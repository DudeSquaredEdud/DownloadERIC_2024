        "description":"Designed to answer basic questions educators have about microcomputer hardware and software and their applications in teaching, this paper describes the revolution in computer technology that has resulted from the development of the microchip processor and provides information on the major computer components; i.e.; input, central processing unit, memory, auxiliary storage, and output. The cost and timesaving advantages of a microcomputer purchase are discussed, as well as the instructional advantages, and the various types of teaching strategies used with a computer are explained. The paper also includes a discussion of hardware selection criteria, software selection sources, and organizations which can provide the novice computer user with helpful information. (LLS)",

Joint Hearings before the Subcommittee on Science, Research and Technology of the Committee on Science and Technology and the Subcommittee on Select Education of the Committee on Education and Labor, House of Representatives, Ninety-Sixth Congress, Second Session.",
        "description":"The joint hearings which are documented in these proceedings were held to enhance the awareness of the Congress, the executive branch, and the private and public sectors of both the potential educational benefits of new information and telecommunications technologies, and the possible social and economic impacts resulting from the widespread use of these technologies in the educational process. A variety of perspectives on these two issues was presented during the two days of sessions. Among the witnesses who appeared before the subcommittees were representatives from the National Institute of Education, the World Institute for Computer Assisted Teaching, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the Warner Cable Corporation, and the  Educational Testing Service. In addition to these presentations, six workshops were held which focused on the implications of instructional technology for elementary secondary education, postsecondary education, public planning, special education, adult education, and information technology development. The recommendations presented to Congress by the workshop participants are included in this document. (LLS)",

        "description":"A field experiment investigated the use of interactive cable television to deliver in-service instruction to elementary school teachers. Fifteen schools in Rockford, Illinois, were designated as controls, 12 were equipped for one-way television, and 14 were set up for two-way communication. A consultative relationship with teachers was established through the Client-Centered Production System (CCPS), which provided for teacher input via interviews, group meetings, and a committee which worked with investigators in the selection of relevant topics and design of the programs to be produced. In interviews conducted after the showing of the eight shows, 35 percent of the teachers in the control schools reported that they had learned new teaching ideas during the year, as compared  with 53 percent in the one-way communication schools and 69 percent of those with two-way communication. On the basis of these findings and cost/benefit analyses, it was concluded that the project delivered a greater variety of teaching innovations than could be presented in an equivalent amount of time by conventional means, and at about the same cost. Limitations of the experimental design are discussed, as well as implications of the findings for policy decisions. Supporting materials appended include synopses of the programs and copies of interview questionnaires. (LLS)",

The survey was conducted in two parts. First, a 34-item questionnaire was mailed to respondents soliciting: (1) demographic information, such as family size, gross income, employment status, educational background, type of transportation used, and shopping patterns; and (2) opinions concerning area health care needs, mass transportation, future industrial development, and the quality of service provided by  GCC. Then, respondents were interviewed at home or by telephone to obtain their answers to 20 open-ended questions about the services GCC should provide, the improvements that should be made in area health care, and the adequacy of local government services. The survey report details methods and procedures, reports response rates for each of the two survey parts, and summarizes findings under six headings: county demographics; transportation; work and shopping patterns; attitudes concerning business, industry, and government; educational needs; and health care needs.

Only 160 of the classes had enrollments of 10 students or less, and the average class size was 24. General education classes experienced higher average enrollments (25 students) than did vocational classes (23 students). Findings directly related to faculty workload reveal that 623.5 full-time equivalent (FTE) instructors taught an average of 13.2 semester hours and that the average  number of student contact hours was 15.9. The average productivity ratio (number of student semester hours divided by FTE faculty) was 306 and the ratio of FTE faculty to FTE students was 1 to 20.

The first analysis described in the report correlates five measures of district wealth with total IUC (i.e., total instructional costs divided by total credit hours produced) and two measures of variable unit costs (i.e., the portion of the IUC that fluctuates with enrollment). The five measures of district wealth included in the analysis are: property wealth per capita; property wealth and tax rate per capita; property wealth per full-time equivalent (FTE) enrollment; property wealth and tax rate per FTE enrollment; and per capita income. The second analysis examines the  correlation of total and variable unit costs with 15 non-wealth factors, including: tuition and fees, faculty load, full-/part-time faculty ratio, and college program mix (i.e., the percentage of instructional effort devoted to each of seven curricular areas). The report then describes the application of two stepwise regression analysis procedures to determine the relation between the combined impact of 3 wealth and 15 non-wealth factors and IUC. The final analysis examines the correlation between measures of wealth and IUC adjusted to exclude equalization funding and tuition and fees. The report concludes with a discussion of the implications of the study for state funding. (JP)",

The second survey was designed to prioritize the issues identified most often by the first survey's 78 respondents. Second-survey questionnaires were sent to 300 presidents, students, faculty, trustees, SACVE members, and ICCB members and staff  asking them to rate 35 financial, student, faculty and staff, program, energy, and public relations issues as &quot;urgent,&quot;&quot;essential,&quot; or &quot;desirable,&quot; and to indicate which agency should have primary responsibility for addressing the issue. Part II of the report reviews the literature related to community college planning, focusing on the declining number of traditional college-age students, stabilizing or declining financial resources, the changing community college mission, the need for planning, and the planning process.

For day classes only, information is presented concerning weekly student contact hours (WSCH), number of full-time equivalent (FTE) faculty, and resultant faculty workload (WSCH divided by FTE faculty). The first three tables delineate, on a year-to-year basis, the WSCH, number of FTE faculty, and faculty load for each of 32 departments. Three additional tables are then presented which provide the same information in an indexed format, using 1973 (or the first year for which information was available) as the base year. Linear graphs illustrating trends for the departments over the eight-year period are then presented. The final table  summarizes annual WSCH, number of FTE faculty, and and faculty load for individual subject areas within the departments. The report concludes with three general observations on the data: (1) overall WSCH increased 20% from 1973 to 1975, but since 1975 has been below the 1973 level; (2) similarly faculty FTE rose from 1973 to 1975, and has decreased steadily since; and (3) faculty load rose 10% from 1973 to 1974, stayed even in 1975, dropped 15% in 1976, and has varied less than 5% since 1976.

        "description":"A study was conducted by Catonsville Community College (Maryland) to identify those factors that foster successful linkages between Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) sponsors and community colleges. The study involved: (1) identifying exemplary CETA/college linkages through consultation with experts in academe and government; (2) interviewing CETA and college personnel involved in these identified linkages to disqualify those that were, in fact, marked by conflict; and (3) administering a questionnaire to the remaining CETA and college personnel to determine the perceived strengths of the linkages and to identify those linkages that could serve as model CETA/college relationships. Major findings, based on responses from 33 CETA sponsors and 40 colleges, reveal six  characteristics of successful linkages: communications and trust are maintained; top college administrators are committed to the program; CETA training benefits general education; the benefits of the CETA linkage are promoted at the college; a liaison person and office are established; and open entry/exit, short-term, performance-based occupational training programs are provided. The study report examines three major barriers to successful cooperation (i.e., conflict associated with educational philosophy and mission; problems of mistrust and negative perceptions; and problems of contrasting operating styles), describes four model CETA/college linkages, and outlines summary recommendations.

        "description":"This literature review examines financial, administrative, and attitudinal problems that impede the expansion of sex equity opportunities in post-secondary vocational programs. After discussing the decreased willingness of the government to fund sex equity programs, the paper notes the forces that have increased the participation of women in post-secondary education and the workforce and argues that women's vocational education programs merit continued funding as significant generators of campus revenue. Institutional barriers to sex equity are then discussed, including: the difficulties women experience in obtaining financial aid; sexist verbiage in college publications; proportionately small numbers of women on advisory committees; admissions requirements that are difficult for  adults to fulfill; the inadequacy of testing instruments to assess the academic ability of adults; and the lack of counseling and support services to meet the special needs of re-entry women. The characteristics of women students as well as their special needs are identified. Next, the paper looks at important concerns for counselors and areas contributing to sex discrimination in career counseling. Several factors that prevent women from training in non-traditional fields are identified, including sexual harrassment, family conflicts, job competition, and parental attitudes. The paper concludes with ten suggestions for an institutional program to deal with barriers to sex equity and a 161-item bibliography. (JP)",

After examining the need for basic skills programs in an era of declining test scores and open admissions policies, the report describes the Special Studies Program's placement procedures, which require students with standardized test scores below a specified level to take basic skills courses and to meet established exit criteria before undertaking regular courses in areas for which remediation is needed. Brief profiles are then presented of three types of remedial students that were identified in a student survey at Augusta College: adults returning to school after many years; recent high school  graduates with a long history of failure in mathematics; and senior citizens returning to school for enjoyment. Finally, the report presents selected findings of a survey of remedial mathematics faculty in the university system, identifying instructional methods used, course content, problems encountered in using individualized self-paced instruction, and perceived obstacles to learning mathematics. The survey questionnaires are appended. The 30-item student questionnaire focuses on personal and academic characteristics, educational goals, and satisfaction with the program. The 70-item faculty questionnaire asks about current and ideal conditions with respect to numerous aspects of special studies programs. (JP)",

        "author":["Wolff, George"],
        "description":"Based upon a theory of intelligence proposed by Alfred Binet, this paper describes a cognitive process approach to poetry instruction. After discussing the suitability of the study of poetry as a means of enhancing students' reading comprehension, the paper summarizes Binet's theory, which distinguishes four successive intellectual operations: (1) &quot;comprehension,&quot; i.e., the identification and comprehension of individual facets of that which is being observed; (2) &quot;invention,&quot; i.e., the synthesis of the individual components; (3) &quot;direction,&quot; i.e., the perception of the main theme or intellectual direction of that which is being observed; and (4) &quot;censorship,&quot; i.e., the ability to concentrate on the intellectual direction at hand and to discern changes in direction. The paper then  describes how these four operations can provide definitions of the cognitive skills needed to understand poetry. First, students must be able to identify and understand words within a poem that have an abstract or unconventional meaning. Then, they must be able to discern parallels between words used within the poem in order to begin the process of synthesis. Finally, they must be able to recognize the themes and intellectual directions of a poem, and recognize &quot;structural joints&quot; within the poem that signify changes in that theme or direction. Throughout the paper, illustrative passages from poems are provided. (JP)",

During the survey, a randomly selected sample of the 1,706 continuing education students who had been enrolled during Fall 1978 but who did not reenroll in Spring 1979 were asked to check off their principal reason for withdrawal from among eight possible categories listed on a postcard questionnaire. Findings, based on 294 responses, indicated that 33% of the students had completed their program of study; 7% withdrew because of an inconvenient schedule; 6% were unable to finance further education; 1% felt that the instruction was inadequate; 1% found the work more difficult than anticipated; 1% were disappointed in  the program of study; and none of the respondents indicated that their main reason for withdrawal was a lack of student support services. Half of the respondents checked off the \"other\" category, specifying reasons centered around job or family responsibilities; 34 of these respondents indicated that they intended to return to college. The study report reviews the literature dealing with attrition among continuing education students and compares survey findings with reasons for student withdrawal cited in the literature.

The report first details total payments, which amounted to $103,252,400 for credit hour grants, $17,200,000 for equalization grants, and $4,700,000 for disadvantaged student grants. None of these funds were lapsed. The number of full-time equivalent (FTE) students served under each of the three categories is then detailed, as are the grant payments made to each of the state's 38 community college districts. An analysis is then presented of the credit hour and FTE student counts upon which state credit hour grants were  determined. This analysis includes: (1) a list of rates per credit hour utilized for payment of grants; (2) a delineation of credit hours generated in five instructional areas at each of the college districts; (3) an assessment of the average grant per credit hour at each district; and (4) a breakdown of credit hours and grants paid at each district during each of the four academic terms. The report concludes with a summary of the equalization grants paid to 17 of the districts and a delineation of the FY 1980 disadvantaged student grant payments per district, which were based on the number of remedial credit hours generated during FY 1979.",

This examination of Phase I details: the planning activities of the committee charged with workshop development; criteria for participant selection; the topics covered and the materials used during the workshops; and a revised workshop agenda developed by an evaluative task  force. The report then summarizes topics covered at three additional workshops conducted during Phase II, which were modified on the basis of experiences gained during Phase I. This is followed by an outline of the topics and learning objectives of a prototype five-day installation workshop, based on the recommendations of a final task force review.

After introductory material noting that the study was initiated in anticipation of enrollment declines and fiscal hardships, the report outlines six conditions and planning assumptions established by the study: the missions of the two systems overlap; many communities are served by both a community college and a V-TEC institute; declining enrollments will increase competition for students and resources; resources from both systems should be combined where necessary; maintaining small institutions will become financially difficult; and the separate systems governing the  community colleges and the V-TEC institutions will become increasingly inappropriate. Three alternatives for combatting anticipated problems are then discussed: providing all institutions with sufficient appropriations to retain a minimal core of services, regardless of enrollment; closing low-enrollment institutions; or restructuring the state's postsecondary educational system. Final recommendations are then presented, calling for: the creation of a combined governing board for both systems; the establishment of regional administrative units; the preservation of the mission of General College; and the structuring of the vocational education role of the state's university system.

After a brief historical preface that points out deficits and needed improvements in public school and infant programs, the discussion focuses on several aspects of established programs for 3- to 5-year-old children. In particular, research findings indicate that preschool intervention is both cost efficient and beneficial to the child and its family. Evidence shows that family care is in no way inferior to center care. Yet, despite many practical disadvantages of center care (i.e., building and administrative costs, distance from children's homes), it receives 80% of Federal day care support. A system that combines advantages of both kinds of care could be developed by linking  day care centers serving as training and resource facilities to a large number of day care homes. Such a system could be started in any community with existing facilities, and would be a cost-effective way to expand services. Precisely how many children need day care is not known, but the figure may be close to 20 million. An estimated $3,500 per child per year would cover program costs and increase caregivers' salaries to a level sufficient to reduce staff turnover. Increased expenditure for day care is also required to provide a base from which operators of facilities can begin to meet, not ignore, state and federal standards. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"Eighty subjects, at each of four age levels (kindergarten, grade 2, grade 4, and university) were questioned concerning their ideas about the structure of the family. Information was gathered on which persons the subjects considered to be members of their own families, how subjects conceptualized a typical family and what criteria they used in judging whether a grouping of people represents a family. In children's consideration of their own families and construction of typical families, no age differences were found. A nuclear family grouping was most salient in both cases, and all respondents constructed similar typical families, consisting of two parents and their children. Major age-related differences were apparent in the criteria adopted for classifying groupings as  instances of a family. Common residence, contact between members, the presence of children, single parenthood, blood or legal relationship and same-sex versus cross-sex partners were variables that were manipulated and found to be of differing importance as criteria for the respondents in the four age groups. Basically, the youngest subjects relied upon common residence and contact between members as the criteria for evaluating families, whereas, with increasing age, increasing emphasis was placed upon blood or legal relationship. No obvious relation could be found between the members of the children's nuclear or extended families, the amount of time spent with, or frequency of contact with, the children and the responses to any of the three parts of this study.

Subjects were 235 children who made up the first cohort to attend kindergarten in the public schools of North Carolina. Data were collected at four points: at the beginning and end of kindergarten, and at the beginning and end of grade one. Subjects' behavior factors of extraversion, social behavior, and task orientation were measured at the four points by the Schaefer-Aaronson Classroom Behavior Inventory. Their achievement performance at the end of grade one was measured on five subtests of the Stanford Achievement Test (word reading, paragraph meaning, vocabulary, word study skills, and arithmetic).  Among the results, Pearson product moment correlations and multiple regression analysis revealed that of the three independent variables, task orientation had the strongest and the most consistent relationship to achievement. The relationship of extraversion to achievement, while strong at the beginning of the first grade, decreased by the end of the year. Discussion of these findings centered on the assertion that children low on reading achievement at the end of first grade are at risk at this time of being less extraverted, more hostile in their social behavior and less task oriented than when they began kindergarten.

A total of 132 boys and girls (age range 8 to 18 years) with behavior problems serious enough to require institutional care participated in the study. The average IQ (WISC) was approximately 88. In the course of a year each of four treatments was administered on three facility wards. Administration consisted of one week of baseline assessment, two weeks of treatment, and one week of follow-up assessment. Each treatment condition included either a prosocial or control TV diet and either the presence or absence of a post-viewing discussion session. The prosocial films were selected for high prosocial and low aggressive content. The control TV diet was based on the youngsters' typical  viewing habits. The TV diets were composed of 10 half-hour programs. Among the results, youngsters exposed to prosocial TV programs exhibited more altruistic behavior, less verbal aggression, and less destructive behavior in comparison to youngsters exposed to violence-laden programs. Children who were initially more aggressive benefited most from exposure to the prosocial programs; that is, the frequency of their altruistic behaviors increased more than did those of the less aggressive youngsters. While the discussion in the prosocial diet condition, which highlighted moralistic motivations, appeared to undermine positive program effects, adult-led discussion apparently can minimize the impact of violent programming.

Section I, the Introduction, addresses five major concerns related to health care that were identified by the panel. These concerns were (1) that programs to prevent disease and promote health are neither available nor adequately used even when available; (2) that sharp disparities persist in both health status and use of health services according to family income, ethnic background, parental education, and geographic location; (3) that the current health care system insufficiently recognizes or supports the role of the family as the primary source of health care for children; (4) that the  organizational, administrative, financial, and professional training aspects of today's health care system have not been adapted to cope with current family health problems; and (5) that public health programs are not working effectively in relation to one another. Sections II through V discuss in detail these concerns and focus in particular on how they can most effectively be dealt with in the 1980s and beyond. (Author/RH)",

Five federal programs, identified by the panel as having a particular positive impact on maternal and child health, are reported. These programs are Title V of the Social Security Act; Medicaid and EPSDT (Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment); WIC (Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children); Public Law 94-142 (Education for all Handicapped Children Act); and Community Mental Health Centers and Service Systems. The analysis of each program includes a  summary of major recommendations, a brief description of the program (including an evaluation of its strengths and weaknesses), and a plan which includes specific recommendations for program improvements. The histories, purposes and accomplishments of 10 additional programs which play an important role in the delivery of health and health-related services are also briefly described. A full list of federal programs directly or indirectly related to maternal and child health is listed in Appendix A. (Author/MP)",

The volume is divided into two sections. Section I consists of six chapters of text and Section II consists of 120 tables. The text is designed to facilitate interpretation of the tables, to highlight the data, and to provide references to recent analytic studies and major sources of data. Section I discusses the following topics: the changes which have occurred in children's living conditions; the conditions influencing and surrounding the beginning of life, including fertility, family planning, parental and hospital care, and the health status of the newborn; the environmental  and social facts influencing family health; the health status and needs of children and youth; the resources available for health care of children; and the use of health services. Selection of the tabular data presented in Section II is based on five criteria: population coverage (national or large subgroups of the U.S. population), statistical reliability and validity, timeliness, importance to public health or social medicine, and relevance to social policy. An index of tables relevant to each chapter in Section I is provided in order to facilitate use of the tables. (Author/MP)",

The caregiver should also be able to employ developmental theory as a way toward providing appropriate stimuli and responses to infants at various stages of development. Developmental theory is especially relevant to the caregiver's handling of infant misbehaviors, responding to the moods of babies, and providing appropriate learning experiences. Caregivers have to become creative arrangers of learning experiences with people and objects. Toys and interactions should give feedback to the baby. By improving their noticing skills, providers can encourage infants' attempts at problem solving and can  forestall discouragement, boredom or frustration. In addition to knowledge of developmental level, caregivers should have knowledge of infants' individual strengths. Fewer emotional upsets will result when providers set goals and tasks that each baby can succeed at with a bit of trying. (At the conclusion of this presentation, six guidelines for day care providers are offered.) (Author/RH)",

Using English and/or Spanish, program staff test and measure the referred child's educational and language functioning, as well as social, emotional, behavioral, medical, and intelligence factors. Evaluators employ many tests including the Alpern-Boll Developmental Scale, the Leiter International Performance Scale, and the Del Rio Language Screening Test, an instrument which uses five subtests to screen language skills of English and Spanish speaking children aged 3 to 6.11. Children accepted into the program  are assigned to one of four program components in which they: (1) spend full time with the Assisting Individual Development (AID) program; (2) divide their time between AID and a regular program; (3) use AID as a resource to supplement a regular program; or (4) receive AID-directed home training. Test results form the basis for individualized curriculum plans centering around self-help, socialization, motor skills, academic skills, and communication. Language development is heavily stressed. Parental involvement is important to all program aspects. Staff job descriptions, sample forms, and appraisal instructions are included. (SB)",

Segregation trends for Hispanics are discussed in terms of the relationship between segregation and school practices, bilingual education and desegregation, language instruction, special education, discipline, grade retention, staffing, and a comparison of Hispanic and Black segregation trends. The findings of two ethnographic studies are: school desegregation plans should distinguish the needs of Blacks and other minorities from those of Hispanics; desegregation plans should adhere  to existing guidelines for bilingual education; desegregation requires a larger Hispanic staff; different socio-economic sectors of the Hispanic community respond in varying ways to desegregation; and many urban Hispanics perceive that desegregation may be detrimental to bilingual education. General conclusions are that Hispanic isolation from Blacks and Whites will probably increase; Hispanics will become the most segregated racial group in the 1980's; Hispanic segregation from Whites and Blacks is increasing in unpredictable patterns in many tri-ethnic communities; and the either/or option of bilingual education vs. school desegregation need not occur.

Such a strategy should include gathering information about anticipated changes in the size and composition of the school population in order to plan for adequate staff and facilities. Planning for growth should also involve the consideration of service arrangements which best serve the community's needs, especially as community members begin to respond to four major growth-related changes: superinflation, service demands in excess of service capabilities, change in socio-cultural structure, and increased people problems, such as oldtimer-newcomer conflicts. Schools can be a logical catalyst for initiating important service  arrangements such as consultation with mental health and social service agencies. Schools can also help foster the formation of formal interagency networks which in turn support community development as a whole. As rapid growth occurs in the rural community, schools can provide leadership and decision making simulations to improve the community's ability to respond to growth-related change. Rural schools can build around the unique educational needs of different age groups, including adults and the elderly, to address the educational needs of the entire community. (SB)",

The first presentation described a study by Hawkes which showed positive changes in the attitudes and behavior of teachers who had had an Outward Bound experience and a study by Smathers which reported on the potential of Outward Bound type experiences in the training of student teachers.  The second presentation described the State University of New York's &quot;Wilderness Workshop,&quot; a 3 hour credit course in American literature open to undergraduate and graduate students and other interested adults. The third presentation described Appalachian State University's use of wilderness experiences to teach anthropology in three ways: as a means of building individual initiative, group communication, and esprit d'corps in classes with no specific environmental theme, as a major project in the &quot;Man and His Environment&quot; course, and as an experience in primitive living in an anthropology class on North American Indians.

Variables recorded on the form included language spoken, group size, activity, adult instructional involvement, instructional responsibility, adult contact, and curriculum used. Design of the form provided for day-long, minute-by-minute observations of randomly selected students on randomly selected observation days by two trained observers. The form was judged useful in examining a variety of curriculum approaches, assessing the extent to which a curriculum has been implemented, relating classroom practices to achievement gains, and/or  contrasting curriculums. Findings from a total of 100 day-long observations were that Title I students received 22 minutes more instruction in a day which averaged 19 minutes longer, took more naptime (36% compared with 27%), spoke and heard less Spanish (1% compared with 11%), were part of larger groups (averaging 10 members, compared with 8), and received less instruction from teacher aides and more from teachers than Title I migrant students. Also included are background material on the form's development, directions and procedures for observers, statistical results, the Early Childhood Observation Form, a card file layout for computer analysis, and the computer program.

        "description":"Eight on-site visits (focusing on school districts which did not use federal Vocational Education Act funds) were made with state vocational education administrators and rural school superintendents in two states to identify factors related to providing vocational education to rural secondary students, to ascertain why some rural districts did not apply for federal and/or state vocational education funds, and to establish what vocational education services students in those districts received. Local superintendents were most concerned about finding and keeping certified vocational teachers. The small amount of money and the volume of paperwork entailed discouraged some from applying for federal funds. Reasons for not wanting to join or contract with area vocational schools  included cost, travel, distance, and political considerations. A number felt that their own industrial arts programs were best suited to their students and community. Some superintendents were not sure whether the requirements which concerned them were federal or state. State level vocational administrators were also concerned about the proper role and funding for industrial arts and career education programs. Both states were in the process of developing multi-occupational cooperative programs. State officials had more direct problems with and suggestions for changing federal law than local officials had. Data indicated that cooperative efforts of federal, state, and local educators were needed to resolve the issues of rural vocational programs. (CM)",

        "description":"Recent changes in patterns of population location, industrial employment, and technology in the north central United States have produced implications for vocational education in rural areas. Missouri has greater social, cultural, demographic, and economic diversity than other states in the region, but is representative of the area for purposes of developing implications for rural vocational education. Area vocational schools are the primary means through which Missouri's rural students gain vocational training opportunities. About 70% of those who graduate from secondary and postsecondary programs are employed as trained. However, a demand for some services in rural areas is not being met; no vocational training programs exist for many of the more interesting and remunerative  careers in rural communities because there is no mass market for the skill. To correct this, Missouri has experimented with a contract vocational education program of apprenticeship training. Trainers are community residents and employers who have skills for which there is a demand and no existing training program. In addition, a four-year secondary vocational agriculture program emphasizes general knowledge and entrepreneurship. Areas of projected rural employment growth include health care, accounting, computer technology, repair services, law enforcement, child care, transportation, retailing, and energy related careers. Statistical trends in population, income, economic base and education are detailed for the north central states. (CM)",

        "description":"Vermont, the most rural state in the northeastern United States, can represent that area for consideration of the problems of rural vocational education. Nearly 21% of Vermont's work-aged population has vocational training. More than half of all high school juniors and seniors now enroll in vocational education programs, and new adult education programs appear regularly. Manpower training, designed to strengthen state and local economies, has been a prerogative of the state government. However, the Federal Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) now contributes to several important programs in labor force development and training, and provides employment opportunities for the unemployed. Presently, vocational education completions in agriculture and office occupations  outnumber openings in the state labor market; however, programs are not meeting labor force demands in forestry, machinery manufacturing, recreation, personal services, and health, education, and professional services. Because the Northeast has more high quality industries in non-metropolitan areas than do other areas of the United States, vocational education efforts must be linked to both job quality and economic development objectives. Difficulties in transportation and accessibility, inequitable financial allocations, program arrangements designed for urban rather than rural areas, and excessive Federal regulations and paperwork create administrative problems in Vermont's rural vocational education and training programs, although some benefits have resulted from Federal involvement.

Mothers exert the strongest influence on their daughters' career decisions. Although federal educational policies and programs can offer opportunities for rural women to gain employment in traditionally male-dominated occupations, real change must come from rural women and others who help determine vocational choices and opportunities. A growing number of women are joining together and seeking assistance in entering non-traditional vocations, many  for economic motives. Community-based organizations are expanding opportunities for women. Provision of information about economic opportunities in non-traditional vocations is one means of overcoming traditional obstacles. Information programs should: (1) include wage and salary information; (2) furnish education and career information for mothers; (3) encourage a non-sexist approach to vocational education in public school systems; (4) prepare information for potential employers and co-workers; (5) provide counseling for female vocational education students; (6) sponsor demonstration programs in the community; (7) utilize women's networks and groups; and (8) encourage rural organizations to disseminate information and foster change.

The impact on small towns and rural areas included ecological damage and fewer permanent jobs than had been anticipated available to local persons. In spite of area growth, most rural youth (predominantly white, with significant Hispanic and American Indian segments) continue to migrate to larger population centers to get good jobs or training for future careers in their home community. Many small rural high schools cannot offer vocational education options other than agriculture and homemaking because of insufficient students to qualify for teachers and equipment, problems with state funding mechanisms, and  excessive time and paperwork required to obtain small amounts of federal funds. American Indian and Hispanic youth have special problems (language and cultural differences, lack of role models, high family poverty rates) which affect work patterns. Challenges for rural vocational education are to reconcile alternative cultural patterns with regular working patterns, and to equip individuals with broad-based skills so they can remain and contribute to their community's economic development; a possible solution is the community development corporation concept, using the rural school as its center.

        "description":"Tailored-for-industry programs like South Carolina's Special Schools and Minnesota's New Jobs raise questions concerning the effectiveness of such programs in creating jobs and their influence on future local and national education policy. Almost every state has a subsidized for-industry program which trains workers for new or expanding industries at little or no cost to the industries; some benefit industry primarily by screening potential employees for labor union background, behavioral and other characteristics. The content and direction of the programs reflect the specific needs of the industry rather than those of the students. Through the programs, states may use funds from federal agencies and programs to compete against one another for industrial development and jobs,  often resulting in job shifting rather than job creation. In many cases, industry's use of subsidized training appears to be related more to receiving subsidies than to training workers. No significant evidence demonstrates that the subsidized aspect of these programs plays a critical role in expanding or maintaining jobs in a state. The fact that education departments provide programs in which industry determines the content, location, and criteria for choosing trainees has definite implications for the future of state-supported education. If such programs become a model for future vocational education policy, the content and availability of vocational education could become seriously limited. (CM)",

Many students from poor families take vocational education as their sole means for gaining economic security. Vocational education is at the bottom of the educational system in the class origins of its students and in their job prospects; it &quot;has become a means to prepare rural Southern youngsters for entry-level openings in any low-skilled, low-wage industry which happens to need job fodder.&quot; The curriculum also perpetuates stereotyped roles for blacks and women, and  often fosters emotional and academic dependency and unquestioning acceptance of authority. About half of the currently-offered vocational courses are in home economics or agriculture. Little is done for the emotionally and physically handicapped. Students graduate with little or no training in specific technical skills; the skill training they receive is usually for jobs found only in more metropolitan centers. After graduation, students can: (1) accept a low-paying job in any manufacturing plant that will hire them; (2) attend a technical institute or community college to acquire needed skills, if they can afford it; (3) enlist in the military for its vocational training.

Persons who had escaped poverty had lived in the community for a longer period of time, were in middle and maturing age brackets, and were significantly better educated than families with similar histories who remained in poverty.  Other significant factors were perceived control over events in their lives, as measured by feelings of powerlessness and alienation, and the social-structural factors of race and education. Also, economic factors alone clearly did not account for one's ability to escape poverty. Thus, programs designed to eliminate the consequences of long-term impoverishment should not only provide economic assistance but also focus attention on elimination of psychological and structural restrictors to achievement and upward mobility.

Open only to students of Indian ancestry, NITEP began in 1974. Although standards and most courses are similar, NITEP differs from the regular teacher education program in that student teaching in Indian communities (after basic education practice courses) precedes theoretical coursework, two Indian Studies courses are included in the curriculum, and students attend one of six off-campus centres for their first two years in the program. Off-campus instruction is provided by visiting  teachers from the main campus and in some cases by local instructors. NITEP students transfer to the main campus for the third year, a minimum requirement for teacher certification, and the fourth year, leading to a bachelor's degree as well as certification. Support services (counseling, financial support, and advice) are important to the program. The &quot;Indianness&quot; of NITEP has been furthered by its Indian-related content and by influence from points of Indian power (Advisory Committee, supervisor, staff, students, communities with off-campus centres) within NITEP.

        "description":"Social isolation, extreme weather conditions, inadequate housing, and low salaries often characterizing rural areas cause problems in recruiting and retaining special education personnel. Successful interviewers for rural districts must include four components in their recruitment strategies: the use of intrinsic rather than extrinsic motivators, the consideration of local cultural norms in personnel choice, the use of the interviewee's needs and motivations, and the creative selling of the school district. The most effective recruiting occurs when all the rural area's resources are fully exploited, negative characteristics are presented positively, and unchangeable limitations are met honestly. Retaining personnel requires a similar strategy. Because personnel who remain in an  area usually share that area's goals and expectations, a district should make every effort to help new staff members acclimate, teaching them about the local power structure and communication system and structuring their initial experiences for success. The district must have long-term strategies to address the unchangeable aspects of employment and to enhance staff development possibilities. Rural districts need a formal interagency recruitment system that includes forecasting, communication, and matching of needs and resources. The National Personnel Needs Data Bank maintains an informal exchange for districts in search of qualified special education personnel. (SB)",

Although 25% of the total United States labor force is comprised of youth aged 16-24, youth account for 50% of the total number of persons unemployed. Unemployment rates for metro and nonmetro youth are equal; however, a lower proportion of nonmetro youth are in the labor force, so a lower proportion of nonmetro youth are employed. Students experience significantly higher unemployment than metro and nonmetro non-students (22% and 17% respectively in 1976). Metro and nonmetro minority students experience exceptionally low rates of labor force participation (less than 20% in 1976) and extremely high unemployment rates (34% in nonmetro areas and 43%  in metro areas). Youth employment is concentrated in clerical and service occupations. Nonmetro female youth are less likely to be employed as clerical workers than are metro females. However, a higher portion of nonmetro females are classified as operative workers. Statistics for 1976 indicate employment of more than 80% of nonmetro students and more than 86% of metro students in the wholesale and retail trade and the service industries. (Author/CM)",

Questionnaires were developed to solicit information from three sources - institutional data (supplied by college officials), data from a sample of faculty, and data from a sample of students.  This information is presented in three separate chapters, and a final chapter summarized major findings and recommendations. Results of the study revealed that faculty members generally were satisfied with their environment despite heavy teaching loads. Students generally were satisfied with their courses, but often lacked adequate language, study, and math skills. There was evidence of a need for improvement in most fields, particularly a need for better equipment, facilities, and faculty development. (Author)",

The data base for the study came from the National Longitudinal Study, a study of over 20,000 high school seniors of the Class of 1972. Three follow-up surveys of the class were conducted in order to analyze the educational and vocational background of these graduates. The survey involved a sample of 1,200 schools with 18 seniors per school. Data collecting instruments included a test battery, a student record information form, and a student questionnaire. The primary tool used for analysis of the data was multiple regression analysis in a path analysis framework. Analysis of the data indicated that sex differences were more important than differences between blacks and  whites in the probability of selecting a major in science. Black males were less likely to select a science major or to obtain a degree in science than were white males. When results were adjusted for difference between males and females in interviewing variables, blacks had a higher probability of selecting a science major than whites. Females showed negative impacts on the selection of a college science major. (Author/DS)",

A study of enrollment changes indicates a drop in enrollment in two courses, little change in one course, and an increase in a fourth course. A questionnaire/survey was developed to assess expectations of students enrolled in the four courses and actual experiences at the completion of the courses. Counselors were asked to complete a questionnaire rating students' reasons for selecting a particular course. Results of the survey indicate the following: (1) students often enroll in the course perceived to be the easiest option for satisfying their lab science  requirement; (2) students find the laboratories impractical and not closely related to course content; (3) classroom experience is viewed by students in terms of learning facts rather than the processes of science; and (4) the science attitude of students does not change significantly during the course. The major product of the research is the development of survey instruments which can be used to improve courses and make them compatible with student needs. (Author)",

The IPSP was created to develop, evaluate, and disseminate materials to improve problem-solving abilities in grades five through eight. The four main assumptions are: (1) pupils need to learn to solve many nontrivial problems of interest to them; (2) specific strategies for solving these problems should  be taught; (3) a general framework is useful in teaching problem solving that can be used to organize thinking; and (4) it is possible and pedagogically useful to test problem-solving abilities within the steps of the framework. The material incorporates hand-held calculators. Results of evaluation reported by this document attest to the effectiveness of the IPSP approach, as measured by posttesting and attitude changes of students and teachers. (MP)",

Data utilized in the field test were provided by four instruments: (1) the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery, (2) the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test (comprehension), (3) the Test of Adult Basic Education (mathematics), and (4) the Navy Numerical Skills Test. The first three tests are standardized instruments, while the last was developed specifically for the workbook. The results of the study indicate  that the workbook can be used beneficially with Navy enlisted personnel who need to improve their basic numerical skills. It is suggested that students with relatively low academic skills can improve their performance by using this tool. The strategy and format used in preparing the workbook is seen as potentially useful in developing learning aids for technical training that requires more advanced quantitative skills. (MP)",

Protocols were obtained from six individuals working on nine different problems in which constructions were used. Nineteen protocols are presented with annotation and discussion, and other protocols are summarized. The primary purpose of the report is to provide documentary evidence relevant to a model of planning knowledge that provides an explanation of constructions. The protocols are consistent with the general features of the model, but also show ways in which human problem solving involves processes more complex than those in the model. Illustrations of interaction between formal and informal reasoning processes are also noted. (Author)",

Perdix, a simulation of problem solving in geometry with schematic planning knowledge, is described. Perdix' planning knowledge enables it to augment the problem space it is given by constructing auxiliary lines. The planning system also provides a mechanism that can result in problem-solving set. Results of three experiments involving a set and constructions seem consistent with the kinds of knowledge structures hypothesized in the model. Protocols given during solution of 11 geometry problems showed general agreement with the explanation of constructions and set based on planning knowledge, but also indicated processes of human problem solving not represented in the  model. Finally, the explanation of constructions is discussed in relation to the general question of ill-structured problems and creativity, and the explanation of set is discussed in relation to other phenomena in the problem-solving literature, including functional fixedness.

        "description":"Cognitive development during each of the major stages identified by Piaget is characterized by abilities to solve progressively more complex tasks (e.g., changes in the object concept during the sensori-motor stage, and in conservation of amount, weight, and volume during the concrete operational stage). Several theorists have suggested that these changes could be explained by increases in working memory or information processing capacity. Case (1978) suggests that development within each of the major Piagetian stages reflects the growth of working memory for the class of cognitive operations which become available to the child in the stage. The hypothesis that working memory for &quot;formal&quot; cognitive operations increases from one at ages 10 to 12 to four at ages 17 or 18 is  examined. Evidence from prior studies of formal operational thought is reviewed. Developmental data using several measures of formal operational memory including tasks involving anticipation of elements in a classification matrix, solution of algebraic problems, and ratio relationships is presented. In general, results are consistent with the hypothesis that there is development of a formal operational working memory. Implications for instruction and other aspects of adolescent development are discussed. (Author)",

        "description":"This document views mathematics instruction as an area that was developed to deal with experiences of the real world, and that needs to change in response to the realities of today's world. To insure the continued teaching of significant ideas and skills, certain traditional topics must be deleted from the curriculum and new ones added. Teaching mathematics must catch up with the technological advances available today, such as the microcomputer and calculators. Teachers are viewed as having the responsibility for teaching the processes of real-world problem solving and motivating pupils to both enjoy mathematics and develop skills. Research to determine the topics and appropriate instructional processes are seen as necessary in order to obtain both the goals of general education  and the aims of occupational necessity. Most available textbooks and curricula are viewed as stumbling blocks. It is suggested that teachers will have to work a great deal on their own, with the teacher-training program of vital importance for the success of mathematics education in the 1980's. (MP)",

Ninth-grade earth science students (N=90) were given the Dubbins Earth Science Test (DEST) and a Science Background Experience Inventory (SBEI) developed by the author. They were then placed into high, medium, and low experience groups, each group subdivided into a treatment (receiving an advance organizer on the rock cycle) and a control (receiving a placebo on the rock cycle) group. A DEST posttest was given after two weeks; in addition, data on sex, Differential Aptitude Test (DAT) scores, socioeconomic status, and grade point average were collected. It was concluded that: (1) neither the advance organizer nor the background experience of the  student made a significant difference in achievement; (2) there was no significant interaction between method and background experience of the student; (3) there was a strong covariance relationship between the DAT section on Abstract Reasoning and achievement on the DEST. Interpretations include, among others, the possibility that the unit of study may not have been broad enough to allow for a maximum advance organizer effect and that the sample did not include the full spectrum of student abilities.

Objectives are to help students become aware of global interdependence, identify roles of various nations in causing and solving problems related to food and population, and develop skills in gathering and analyzing data regarding world problems. The document is presented in seven sections. Chapter I suggests activities which introduce students to global interdependence and to differences in life styles between developed and developing nations. Students are involved in a variety of activities including determining items essential to a 'good life', working  with maps and globes, creating bulletin boards and collages, answering questions on worksheets, and discussing global issues in small groups and in class. Chapters II through IV present activities which focus specifically on population, food, or energy. Activities involve case studies, data sheets, time lines, simple computation problems, and map and globe work. Chapters V and VI offer culmination activities and supplemental projects. Students are directed to pull together background information and skills gained through participation in earlier course activities. Specific activities and projects in which they are involved include producing a filmstrip, making posters and bulletin boards, creating energy tools out of 'classroom junk', discussing food and energy sources, and diagramming  energy issues. For all activities suggested in the document, information is presented on title, background, objectives, time and materials required, skills, focus, and procedures. (DB)",

        "description":"This paper investigated whether male and female college teachers exhibit differences in the way in which they manage authority in the classroom. The hypothesis was that sex differences in classroom authority management were likely to exist for two reasons. First, female professors would have to adopt masculine sex-typed styles of interaction in order to be viewed as legitimate holders of authority in spite of their lesser female status. Second, male professors, although they hold a position which is consistent with their status as males, would experience a conflict between male authoritarian behavior and the cultural norms of a teaching culture in which accessibility to students and an interactive classroom atmosphere are expected. Data consisted of a sample of 15 female and 15  male professors at a large state university. Participants were matched with regard to academic rank, disciplinary orientation, and sex-ratio of department. The method involved interviewing participants about perceptions of their own authority, and about four common classroom management problems--inattentiveness, overt disruption, challenging competency, and lack of student participation. Findings from an analysis of questionnaire responses indicated that rank and sex were related to responses regarding management problems. At the assistant and associate levels, women used strategies that reduced their appearance of authority as they attempted to legitimate it; men, on the other hand, employed a more direct and authoritarian style in dealing with management problems. Few differences were  found between men and women at the level of full professor since both used techniques that reflected their senior status. (DB)",

The purpose of the Program during 1979-80 was to provide grants to public and nonpublic school staff to encourage and assist them in planning and conducting creative learning experiences in which the arts play a key role. Each summary provides information regarding the participants involved, project site and dates, project objectives and activities, project evaluation as perceived by the project chairman, documentation of the project, and the amount of the grant award. Twenty-six of the 33 grant proposals were funded. Some of the projects were units of study for social studies,  science, or language arts courses. Others were units for art, music, dance, creative writing, movement, photography, and carpentry courses. A few examples of the projects follow. The \"Follow the Yellow Brick Road\" project developed an \"Historic Walking Tour of Lock Haven\" packet which includes a slide presentation, a cassette guide for the walking tour, and suggested preparatory and follow up activities for teachers. In another project, \"Appreciation of Rustic Log Cabin Architecture,\" students actually built a log cabin. In the project \"ALOHA: Appreciating Local History Through Art,\" children wrote their own stories using Indian symbols, created finger puppet plays, made patchwork pictures, and created a life-size Indian village. The \"Musical Production Expands Arts Curriculum\" project  involved students in producing three musicals--Jungle Book, A Western Road Show, and Tom Sawyer. Other projects included \"Museum as a Motivator,\"\"Japanese Arts,\"\"Arts in the U.S.S.R.,\"\"Developing Self Awareness Through Mime,\"\"Visiting Folk Artists,\"\"Woodworking,\" and \"Pennsylvania History.\" (Author/RM)",

        "author":["Parker, Franklin"],
        "description":"This paper traces objectives and implications of philosophies which have shaped American education from colonial days to the 1980s. Two recurring themes are stressed--educational opportunity and quality. From the perspective of 200 years of educational experience, it can be seen that schooling has been available to the vast majority of American youth. Exceptions (i.e., southern blacks before the Civil War and children who labored in the factories of the industrializing north during the 19th century) can be more properly considered as a result of historical developments than as intended victims of educational deprivation per se. Efforts to increase the availability of public schooling have been widespread and frequent--much more widespread than efforts to improve educational  quality. For example, in the 17th century, two school laws were passed in colonial Massachusetts to expand public schooling, in the 19th century, the land grant college movement extended higher education for the first time beyond New England; in the 1930s, major efforts were undertaken despite post-depression financial difficulties to implement experimental progressive education; and, during the 1960's, movements for social equality encouraged numerous educational innovations, such as Head Start and bilingual programs. Efforts to improve educational quality, on the other hand, have been fewer and more sporadic. Even the most notable recent attempt to bolster educational quality (the period of massive federal financing of educational improvements in response to the launching of Sputnik by  the Russians), was overshadowed by the more egalitarian focuses on President Johnson's Great Society programs. The conclusion is that American education has been quite successful in meeting its objective of educating the masses and somewhat less successful in meeting the objective of providing education of a consistently high quality.

The Tillman seminars are presented throughout the United States for the purpose of calling to the attention of participants that white racism is endemic in American culture and that it must be combatted, especially at the institutional level. Specific objectives of this study were to illustrate the nature and variety of seminar effects on participants and on social institutions in communities to which participants returned after attending the seminar. The method was to survey participants regarding their impressions of the seminar and their perceptions of changes in their behavior and/or attitudes as a result of seminar participation.  Interview questions were open-ended. Findings indicated that, for all respondents, the seminar was a memorable experience and an introduction to the radical thesis of institutionalized racism in the United States. Most respondents reported that they felt more comfortable around minorities and felt that their commitment to equality became more energized as a result of seminar participation. Further, findings indicated that institutions including schools, churches, and social service organizations were altered by activities of seminar participants in various ways, including that there were noted increases in minority vendor purchases and in the number of white and minority studies programs in schools. The conclusion is that the Tillman seminar accomplished its major purposes.  (DB)",

        "description":"An Art Involvement Program is described which helped students in middle schools, junior high and high schools develop their sense of aesthetic appreciation through visits to an art gallery. Publicized through press releases, the program involved various schools in New Jersey that decided to participate. Students from a wide variety of backgrounds came to Rutgers University Art Gallery for one hour and thirty minutes instruction per week for five consecutive weeks. Topics covered in the sessions included color lithography 1890-1900, contemporary art, bookmaking, printmaking techniques, art collecting, photography, American Indian art, Japanese painting and calligraphy, aquatint etching, the appreciation of prints, American sculpture 1913-1939, posters by Paul Colin, art deco, 18th  century French drawing, the prints of William Hogarth, portraiture in painting, and Dadaism. Students were involved in many different kinds of activities. They listened as local artists discussed their works. Hands on activities included creating coil built clay pots, utilizing Pueblo Indian designs, experimenting with ink and Japanese brush, making paper, utilizing conte-crayon to sketch likenesses of 18th century French master drawings, producing photograms, and doing basic printmaking. Filmstrips, 16mm films, and slides were utilized throughout the course. One of the activities which was quite successful was breaking students into groups of three or four and giving them a mystery object from the collection to identify and research. Students were also encouraged to read art periodicals.  Following the museum visits, students were required to participate in school classroom activities. For example, one student gave a presentation in the classroom about Japanese art. Others were asked to compose essays describing their reaction to art they had seen at the gallery. Evaluation of the project yielded positive results. The report concludes with a discussion of funding for the program. (Author/RM)",

        "author":["Dynneson, Thomas L."],
        "description":"Pre-collegiate anthropology is traced from the 1940's, when it was nothing more than an incidental footnote in most social studies textbooks, to 1978, when, according to a survey of state social studies specialists, it was part of the social studies curriculum in most states. Reasons for the development of pre-collegiate anthropology during the time period in question are (1) more teachers received training in anthropology as universities added or expanded anthropology departments, (2) more instructional materials were developed (although there is still a serious dearth of pre-collegiate anthropology materials), (3) professional anthropology associations became more supportive of pre-collegiate educational efforts, (4) the American public became increasingly interested in the  work of prominent anthropologists as a result of mass media coverage, and (5) increased federal and private financial support became available for developing new curricula. The conclusion is that pre-collegiate anthropology was being taught in some form and at some grade level in about half the states by 1978. Implications for the future of pre-collegiate anthropology are, however unclear. For example, if one of the most serious problems--the lack of instructional materials--is not solved, pre-collegiate anthropology may revert to its former status as an unrecognized or hidden component of the social studies curriculum.

        "author":["Marker, Gerald W."],
        "description":"A social studies educator examines energy education and its place in the curriculum, discussing what should be taught, where, and by whom. Six recommendations are made. First, students must be made aware that sometime between now and the year 2000, world demand for oil and natural gas will actually exceed world supply. Life in the 21st Century will run on something other than oil. Preparations must begin now to make the shift in an orderly manner. Second, we must help students understand that we are dealing with a global problem of massive proportions. A part of the global nature of the present energy situation has to do with the distribution of production and consumption patterns. The United States is the world's leading oil consumer, the Soviet Union is the largest producer,  and the Middle East is the holder of the largest reserves. The developed nations of the world literally run on oil, the majority of which they import from less developed nations. Such global imbalance in production and consumption patterns result in a webb of interdependencies never before experienced by the planet's inhabitants. Third, energy education should focus upon the broader aspects of our energy situation as well as upon what individuals can do. The fourth recommendation is that energy education should give systematic attention to fundamental choices which confront us. Fifth, energy education should occur throughout the curriculum, but the focus should vary with the grade level. Science educators should concentrate upon the scientific aspects of energy education and social  studies teachers should focus upon the social implications of the present situation. In grades 1-6, energy education should be structured around three themes: the nature of energy and its role in our daily lives; lifestyle implications of the new energy ethic; and how conservation does not necessarily mean doing with less, just doing differently. The sixth and final recommendation is that whenever possible, school systems should locate and adapt existing energy education materials rather than invent their own. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"This book addresses the law-related concerns of school teachers. Much of the data on which the book is based was collected during a four year study, conducted by the American Bar Association with the support of the Ford Foundation. Court cases are cited. Chapter one examines &quot;Tenure.&quot; Since tenure gives teachers the right to their jobs, tenured teachers cannot be dismissed without due process of law or without cause. They are entitled to notice of charges and a fair hearing, with the opportunity to present a defense. The burden is on school authorities to show that there are good and lawful reasons for dismissal. &quot;Reduction In Force (RIF)&quot; is the topic of chapter two. Many school districts are facing declining enrollments and rising costs for diminished services. RIF begins with  a decision that a school district has too many teachers. Laws vary from state to state. Discussed are: What requirements must be met for RIF to be declared? Who can be RIFed?; What procedures must be followed? Do RIFed personnel have reinstatement rights? Chapter three deals with &quot;Negligence.&quot; Negligence is the failure to anticipate unreasonable risk and guard against the consequences. In general, teachers are unlikely to be held responsible for students' injuries. Normal considerations of negligence and liability protect the responsible teacher. Chapters four through eight treat the topics of &quot;Malpractice and Defamation,&quot;&quot;Discipline,&quot;&quot;Academic Freedom,&quot;&quot;Freedom of Speech and Association,&quot; and &quot;Life-Style Choices.&quot; Two areas not examined are unionization and some of the emerging issues  in the legislative arena such as teacher accountability and teacher competency.

        "description":"Separate sections of this document deal with refugee concerns in terms of a global approach, definitions of a refugee, alternatives for refugees, the international response, and long-term prospects. The booklet states that the present number of 16 million refugees is bound to increase given increasing rivalry over land and resources. The global community must improve its ability to anticipate conflicts that have a high potential for generating refugees. In the international community, however, the definition of the term refugee is constantly evolving. It now extends beyond the persecuted individual to whole groups of people fleeing from dangerous circumstances. According to the United Nations High Commissioner, the task of the international community is to see that those who  become refugees cease to be refugees within a reasonable amount of time. The three routes to this end are voluntary repatriation, settlement in the country of first asylum, or resettlement in a third country. International support takes the form of United Nations support, bilateral aid, and private, voluntary organizations. In the long term, a new consensus among nations must be made explicitly: that a government has an obligation to protect the interests of all its citizens. If not, it sacrifices its claim to sovereignty over them. Legally establishing a fundamental right of asylum and ensuring that neutral relief operations have guaranteed access to refugees are high priorities for the United Nations. (Author/KC)",

The focus is on policy formation in terms of the family's and state's role in providing for dependent children, the view that family and state should work together to assist dependents, and the needs of persons at each end of the life cycle. The book is presented in six chapters. Chapter I discusses research on the relationship between family and state in the provision of social care to dependent members. Chapter II covers approaches to defining families and the changing nature of the family over time. Chapter III describes needs and characteristics of two at-risk groups: the elderly and the  severely retarded. Chapter IV discusses issues of social welfare such as financing and problems in organizing and delivering supportive systems. Chapter V deals with the professional response to families. The final chapter notes implications for policy and research in terms of arguments for and against intervention, the need for professional reorientation, and the resource requirements of supportive systems.

        "description":"Four papers discuss research exchanges between the United States and the USSR and East Europe. The first paper considers the evolution of perceptions of social scientists in these countries during the Cold War and Detente. The dominant view of American researchers during the Cold War was that the United States, as the most modern society, was the yardstick for measuring other societies. The United States experienced rapid growth of training and research related to the Soviet orbit. However, Soviet scholars were constrained by Marxist-Leninist doctrine and by educational and research policies. In the 1960s, American social scientists gained a greater appreciation for the complexities of modern societies and East European social scientists began innovative studies. The second paper  discusses evaluations of research exchanges between the United States and the Soviet Union. The conclusion is that these exchanges are scientifically valuable to both countries. The most serious problem is Soviet political repression of its scientific community. The third paper discusses problems and accomplishments of East European studies in the United States. Although progress seems to be steady, American social scientists have come to pursue topics that are politically safe, and thus often of secondary importance. The final paper suggests that in exchanges between the Soviet Union and the United States, both academic and government communities profit. The point that Soviet exchanges are generally in sciences and engineering and American exchanges are in history and literature  illustrates that each side sends whom it wishes. Thus, the author concludes that this type of exchange is neither unbalanced nor unfair. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"The paper discusses major lines of research of American economists on the economies of the USSR and Eastern Europe. A specific concern is that the United States faces a complex set of issues resulting from the expanding role of these countries in the world economy. At the same time, the United States is experiencing a declining base of specialists in Soviet and East European economics. Presently, much of the work on the Soviet economy concerns three themes: how the system is organized and how it operates; efficiency evaluation in terms of goals or of hypothetical performance; and how the system performs relative to other Eastern and Western countries. One of the most successful projects is SOVMOD, a computer-based series of models of the Soviet economy. Academic exchanges,  however, have played a relatively minor role in research development. The benefits of travel for the American economist are small. Documents are generally classified and Soviet economists are not encouraged to work with their American counterparts. Thus, the predominant form of exchange may become short stays by individuals or delegations and conferences. East European exchanges have been more promising, particularly in Hungary, Poland, and Yugoslavia. East European economists are more informed about Western approaches, and data are better and more plentiful. The document concludes with a brief comment by a conference participant who differs with the author on the benefits of research in the Soviet Union. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"Two papers examine the relationship between ethnicity and nationalism in the Soviet Union and in Yugoslavia. The first paper assesses the ethnicity in Soviet Central Asia. Because in recent years an increasing number of scholars has been placed in Soviet Central Asia, observation is now combined with commonly held hypotheses to determine regional and national dynamics in the USSR. Soviet Central Asia comprises an area one-half the United States. Major ethnic groups include Turkic (60%), Slavic (25%), and Iranian (5%). Relevant ethnic issues include the complexity of collective identity; saturation of opportunities and positions; manpower needs in other parts of the Soviet Union which have led to the proposal for population transfers; unevenness of birthrates for various ethnic  groups; and interethnic relations. The second essay examines the national question in Yugoslavia. Written prior to the death of Tito, it suggests changes likely to occur after his death and considers the role of the United States in the country's affairs. Yugoslavia is characterized by rivalries among the six republics and two autonomous provinces which comprise the federation. The rivalries manifest themselves in economic and political issues. Since 1971 Yugoslav leaders have severely limited all manifestations of nationalism, while permitting the republics and provinces freedom to pursue their economic interests. The federal system grants each unit the right to veto economic and social legislation of which it does not approve. Most likely, the post-Tito period will be marked by greater  assertiveness on the parts of the republics and a higher level of instability. The role of the United States is to develop policies aimed at sustaining a stable Yugoslavia and promoting the economic welfare of the country. (Author/KC)",

Participants included over 300 members of the public affairs community, including government officials, public policy makers, business leaders, journalists, and educators. Both papers deal with the daily life of Eastern European Citizens. In the first paper, &quot;In a Pig's Eye: Daily Life and Political Economy in Southeastern Europe,&quot; by John W. Cole, emphasis is placed on the necessity of viewing Southeastern European culture in terms of its own past experience and in comparison with other agrarian areas rather than in comparison with Western Europe or the United States. Southeastern  Europe is characterized as an agrarian society undergoing industrialization and urbanization. In most cases, the most intensive social and economic ties are between parents and their offspring, although there are also important links among village households. In the second paper, &quot;Studying the Soviet Social System: The 'Soviet Citizen' Revisited,&quot; author Gail Warshofsky Lapidus focuses on the importance of and changes which have occurred since publication of the original &quot;Soviet Citizen&quot; (by Alex Inkeles and Raymond Bauer, Harvard University Press) in 1959. The author concludes that scholars will be able to produce new research as insightful as the &quot;Soviet Citizen&quot; if they are allowed to undertake social science research in outlying regions of the USSR, make an effort to conceptualize  societal differences between the United States and the USSR through some other prism than the 'industrial society' model, and if they disseminate research findings in academic and governmental communities.

The oral history assignment is to interview an older woman about home remedies. The second  unit focuses on the roles of the black slave woman and the Southern plantation woman. Through interviews, students determine expectations and realities of three generations of mothers and daughters to discover how ingrained the concept of ideal woman has become. The third unit depicts American working woman as channeled into the lowest paying, least skilled jobs and actively struggling to improve working conditions for all workers. Students interview a woman who either has emigrated from another country or who has been involved in a labor struggle, or interview a woman about her feelings toward work in her home and at her job.

Each unit incorporates the student manual and includes background information, objectives, teaching procedures, learning activities, and a bibliography. Student assignments focus on oral history. In Unit I, students examine the role of women under feudalism in Western Europe and in China. Based on what they have learned about the rules of living at this time, students construct endings to stories and make cultural comparisons between Western Europe and China. Unit II analyzes the role of women during the industrial revolution. Topics include the creation of the working class woman and of the  middle class ideal woman. The oral history assignment consists of an interview with a working couple with children. Unit III focuses on 20th century women in transition, particularly third world women. A major project is to research lives of outstanding women in various countries. For the oral history project, students look for common conditions between the women they have read about and the women they interview. The unit concludes with students making posters about the international women's movement. (KC)",

        "description":"This paper describes a graduate seminar for educational administrators, using works of ancient Greek and Roman literature as bases for the consideration of organization and leadership problems identified in theoretical literature. The seminar was team taught by professors from the Departments of Educational Administration and Classics at the University of Minnesota. The purposes of the seminar were: (1) to provide historical perspective on the problems of leadership and authority; (2) to provide for analysis and discussion \"case studies\" which could be approached with considerable objectivity by virtue of their distance in time and space; and (3) to introduce humanistic content for its own sake into the training of leaders in a field which is ideally the most humane of  professions, education. The subject matter of the seminar consisted of works of ancient Greek and Roman literature, history, philosophy, and biography selected to illustrate concepts of organization and administration theory considered pertinent to the educational leader. Each seminar began with a lecture establishing the literary, historical, and theoretical contexts for the ancient material assigned for that day. A general discussion followed. In addition, students were required to make seminar presentations and to write papers. Some examples of topics covered in the course are provided in the paper. For example, the interaction of values and legitimation comes into play in the famous speech of Pericles. Plutarch's \"Life of Themistocles\" shows another Athenian statesman sagely  controlling information to effect a successful alteration of policy at a crucial point in the Persian Wars. By managing the interpretation of oracles and therefore giving his proposals the authority of divine support, Themistocles persuaded his countrymen to abandon the city and risk all in a naval engagement--a strategy that proved successful. Evaluations indicate a high level of student satisfaction with the course. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"The monograph presents a set of social and economic indicators developed for each of the 118 counties in Arizona, California, Nevada, and Utah which comprise the joint Far West Lab/SWRL laboratory service regions. The objective of developing and mapping these indicators was to delineate major similarities and differences among these counties in terms of selected social and economic data. Factor analysis was performed on 35 data items selected from the U.S. Census 1967 &quot;County and City Data Book.&quot; Eight categories resulted from this categorization: population size, population growth, population age, affluence, medical service, manufacturing employment, sales employment, and agriculture. Counties were then grouped together on the basis of similarities on these eight factors.  Information is also presented in the form of narrative, statistics, maps, tables, and lists on location of major county groups, differences among major groups in terms of means on a number of social and economic measures, and grouping for the 58 counties in California and for the combined 60 counties in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. Results from this statistical picture of the Far West Lab/SWRL Laboratory service regions can be grouped into three major sets. First, it has indicated how 35 county level social and economic measures are related and has produced eight statistically independent factor scores that can be employed in future studies as potential predictors of county educational and social characteristics. Second, it has demonstrated that there are both similarities and striking  differences among the counties in the four states. Finally, it has provided some understanding of the general demographic and economic characteristics of each type of county on a statistically descriptive level. (DB)",

To provide continuous professional development, these stages should be identified and programs effective for each stage offered. The pre-education student needs introductory and experiential programing. This presents an opportunity for assessing the merits or drawbacks of choosing a career as a teacher. A program for the education student is weighted toward foundations of education, methodology, theory, and clinical experience. The beginning teacher requires an intensive clinical program focusing on acquiring new skills and on filling the gaps that may occur between the theory of the university and the practice of the classroom. Programing for a developing teacher may be related to  upward change in a career, as well as obtaining further credentials and continuing to acquire new skills. Inservice programs for experienced teachers continue the development of teaching skills, may be related to preparation for a new position, are assumed to be internally motivated, and can also be developed for returning teachers. Four issues must be considered when developing these sequential programs: the authority under which the program operates; the credibility of the program for a particular stage of development; the funding of the program; and the governance of the program.

Results indicated that learner cognitive attainment is relatively stable across different student teacher teaching fields.

Several universities place an emphasis on student development through administrative leadership training and participation in the governing process of intramural athletic departments. Student duties may include tournament scheduling, game supervision, equipment management, and record keeping. Student advisory councils are being given real authority for decision making. A second trend in sports is a changing attitude toward competitive sport with more emphasis placed on enjoying the sport as a recreational activity rather than working at it with the singular goal of winning. Although it has been found that unstructured play and organized sport can  enhance or reinforce good qualities in an individual, there is evidence that negative human qualities are more likely to surface in organized sport than in unstructured play.

Findings reveal that: (1) Males advocated the use of corporal punishment much more frequently than did females; (2) Private school teachers are less likely than public school teachers to recommend corporal punishment; (3) High dogmatism scores were significantly related to belief in corporal punishment; (4) Teachers were found to have significantly higher dogmatism scores than principals or  counselors; and (5) An educator's level of dogmatism was found to vary inversely with the level of education attained.

It was developed for a school district with twelve supplementary instruction programs, and has been in use since the 1975-76 school year. The evaluation method was used to fulfill federal reporting requirements and to conduct longitudinal studies in measuring the impact of instructional programs. Programs in which kindergarten through high school students were tracked included: Title I, Title VII, State Bilingual, Migrant, and Experimental Schools. Inservice training was conducted to familiarize teachers and counselors with the materials required in the process. Greater speed in  reporting test results, and increased specificity of scores for each student helped to alleviate teacher resistance to the extra record keeping involved. Appendices include a list of references, examples of scoring sheets, program code numbers, a list of the scoring codes, their corresponding programs, and the matching design. (FG)",

Several conclusions were reached: (1) When pupils succeed in learning, supervising teachers are more likely to give credit to the student teachers than the student teachers give themselves; (2) When pupils fail to learn, supervising teachers are less likely than student teachers to blame the pupils; and (3) The more a supervising teacher feels responsible for pupil success or failure, the less credit is given to the student teacher.

A repeated measures analysis of locus of control composite scores yielded significant results over time, and two of the three analyses of variance revealed significant main effects for sex and college status. The results indicate that both students completing undergraduate training and students dropping out of their programs because more internal over time. While persisters were significantly more internally controlled than dropouts in the early stages of the students' college careers, these differences  became quite small by the senior year. This pattern may indicate that dropouts suffer a feeling of being out of control immediately after their departure from college, but that these feelings dissipate over time. The results further indicate that females were more internally controlled than males regardless of college status. This finding implies that females may feel more responsible for academic success and failure than do males. (SW)",

Faculty at a Ph.D.-granting university and two liberal arts colleges were studied. Pilot interviews were conducted with faculty members to identify specific individuals with which they had a meaningful professional relationship and to indicate the nature and development of each such relationship. Based on the interviews, a questionnaire was developed and pretested. The final questionnaire included 30 items representing research, teaching, professional, institution, and social functions that colleagues perform for each other. The  results of factor analysis indicate nine functional components of colleagueship: general campus and off-campus college stimulation, support, and collaboration; collegial interaction centering around the informant/advisor role; interaction directly related to the teaching role; interaction related to sponsorship for academic positions and nomination for professional association and institutional activities and officers; interaction directly related to the research role; and social/personal friendship. Discriminant analysis indicated that the most powerful discriminator between subgroups was campus colleague stimulation and support. Liberal arts college faculty were significantly higher on general interaction with campus colleagues than were university faculty. Additional findings are  considered.

        "author":["Simonton, Dean Keith"],
        "description":"The relationship between formal education and creativity was investigated in two studies. A reanalysis of Cox's (1926) 301 geniuses indicated that achieved eminence of creators is a curvilinear inverted-U function of formal education. Secondly, a study of 33 American presidents found that dogmatism (i.e., idealistic inflexibility) is a curvilinear U-shaped function of formal education. Since creativity and dogmatism are negatively associated, and may represent opposite points on a single bipolar personality dimension, these findings imply that the optimal amount of formal education for maximal creative potential is a college experience that falls just short of attaining the baccalaureate degree. Up to the junior year formal education has a positive effect, probably through the  acquisition of general knowledge and skills, but thereafter the increased specialization required for graduate and professional training seems to reverse creative growth. It is suggested that this result leads to several questions for further research, including possible implications for the design of postgraduate programs. Other questions for additional research include the following: the magnitude of education's effect upon creative development, whether the curvilinear relationship holds equally well across disciplines, and whether differences in native ability or scholastic performance affect the functional relationship between formal education and creativity.

The nature of student learning, the organization of students' time, and the role of various individuals were investigated across the disciplines, and the relationships among the various types of learning were explored. Emphasis was directed to evaluation techniques for both instruction and for student learning. The first study phase involved the development and validation of instruments for assessing clinical teaching and learning. The second phase examined one clinical program and the effect of instructional variables on clinical competence. A total of 160 senior medical students were randomly assigned to three hospitals over a 12-month period. The learning  environment (time organization, role of instructors, and student and faculty attitudes) and students' clinical competence in the following three domains were evaluated: cognitive (factual knowledge, problem solving), psychomotor (clinical skill, interpersonal skill) and affective (attitude toward health care). In general, it was confirmed that the clinical teaching process is a complex one and that neither clinical teaching nor clinical competence can be studied as units in themselves. The clinical clerkship program in medical education involves study in distinct disciplines and the attainment of types of skills and knowledge that are somewhat independent. It was found that the disciplines in the clerkship program clearly facilitate different types of learning. (SW)",

Additionally, the characteristics of formal consoritum arrangements are examined. The existence of a full-time professional administrator is one clear characteristic of a formal consortium arrangement. One administrative concern of the consortium is that the executive may make policy without the board. Six basic rules for executive officers are offered. The WIP is a special unit in the School of Education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. After 20 years, WIP is a consortium of 18 Wisconsin colleges and universities and the State Department of Public Instruction. The major focus of this consortium has been the  administration of a teacher intern program for the member institutions. The following aspects of WIP are considered: organization, representation of member institutions in the decision making and administration, funding sources, research that has been conducted, and future research needs. The internship program is characterized by a team design. The undergraduate interns are assigned to a team of teachers, and one or more interns work as part of the team under the supervision of a principal and one or more experienced teachers. The design is flexible in organization, task assignment, scheduling, and planning. In conclusion, the need to develop a plan for research, for organizational effectiveness, and to deal with internal and external conflict is stressed. (SW)",

        "description":"The impact of an evaluation design on the effective implementation of a training program for women in higher education leadership and management was assessed. The program was designed by the University of Pennsylvania's Higher Education Resource Services. The training program, entitled &quot;The Next Move,&quot; was introduced at three pilot sites: a large, public urban institution, part of a multi-campus system; a small, private university in a suburban setting; and a senior college of an urban public university system. To increase chances for career mobility for women and to assist in the development of a positive self-image, the program utilized leadership and management training to provide women with an institutional perspective, strengthen and encourage local leadership, and foster  the growth of networks. The program consisted of a one-half day case study workshop, a one-day leadership and management clinic, and brown bag seminars. To insure implementation of the model on a nationwide basis, it was necessary that the evaluative design consider the special problems of a model focusing on institutional change, while carefully appraising the potential adaptability or transportability of the program. The evaluation design selected was illuminative evaluation, which encompassed both process and product components and the collection of quantitative and qualitative data. Because the program was designed in three stages, formative evaluation was easily built into the evaluative model. Quantitative data were obtained through a questionnaire, administered after the case study  workshop and qualitative data were obtained through observations and interviews. Results of the evaluation are considered. (SW)",

        "description":"This supplement to \"Postsecondary Student Terminology,\" a National Center for Education Statistics handbook, examines postsecondary education policy issues relevant to information needs about students, procedures used in identifying information items needed to statistically evaluate the issues, and an illustrative database for postsecondary education institutions. The policy issues, which were identified by a literature review and interviews with professionals, relate to equality of opportunity, trained manpower, and lifelong learning or recurrent education. Relevant variables to equality of opportunity are economics and financial issues, the location of educational programs, the scheduling of classes, the effect of the student's ability, and the available counseling. Two  important concerns in relation to trained manpower are the factors that influence students' choice of career and the relationship between employment success and specific courses of study. Lifelong learning provides the opportunities for reentry into formal postsecondary education. Policy-relevant questions, variables relevant to the questions, and table-shell (report) specifications that show the data needed to describe the current value of subissues are analyzed. For selected topics, the format and data needed in reports are described to illustrate what might be required for an information system. The illustrative database is presented to review the use of student terms in combination with data from other files and to decide how data files will be linked. Appended materials include a  bibliography, a definition of a postsecondary educational institution, and a list of resources for the definition. (SW)",

        "description":"Current proposals to assist middle-income groups with college costs and estimates of the burden to parents in different income groups are considered. Reasons for discontent by middle-income and upper-income groups regarding college costs are considered in relation to the following issues: the demographic squeeze, the temptation to choose high-cost alternatives, other sociological and economic factors, current contribution schedules and inflation, and political reality and government objectives. Estimates are presented of the costs of education, burdens by family income group, and the distribution of aid to students. Additionally, attendance patterns by income group are analyzed. The proposed legislation for the $250 refundable tax credit is evaluated and compared to the Carter  Administration proposal. The estimated costs of both proposals and their benefits by income group are summarized. The Administration proposal consists of three parts: (1) a minimum grant of $250 to be distributed to students in families with adjusted gross incomes below $25,000 a year; (2) a $l65 million increase in the College Work-Study appropriation; and (3) an increase of the eligibility ceiling of the Guaranteed Loan Program to $45 thousand adjusted gross income. It would provide benefits to full-time undergraduates and to some part-time and graduate students. The Administration proposal will cost $1.2 billion, and the $250 refundable tax credit will cost $1.6 billion. The tax credit proposal will distribute 29 percent of the benefits to persons with incomes over $25,000 in 1978. The  Administration proposal limits this share to 11 percent. The Administration proposal is recommended because it keeps the subsidy visible, rather than embedding it into the tax system, and it costs about $400 million less than the tax credit. (SW)",

        "description":"Policy-impact analysis is introduced as a model to aid higher education in dealing with the significant problems in the decade of the 1980s. The model provides a framework within which a variety of futures research techniques are tied to policy development, implementation, and evaluation. The utility of the model is that it structures communication between those developing information about the future and those responsible for policy formulation and decision-making in such a fashion that policy-makers can choose among alternative policies based upon the probable impact of each. There are four stages in the policy impact model: monitoring, forecasting, goal setting, and policy analysis and implementation. Monitoring and forecasting perform the role of organizing, structuring, and  articulating images of the future with respect to a particular set of assumptions and indicators. The next stage of the model, goal setting, revolves around the process of setting realistic goals given the information provided in the first two stages. This stage requires the generation of a desirable future in a procedure much like that of forecasting using the delphi method. The first three stages serve to identify specific trends, the events which may affect those trends, and the goals of the organization. In the final stage, the research staff estimates how a particular policy may affect a given trend through influencing the probability of the occurrence of one or more specified events affecting the trend. When the selected policies are implemented, the process of monitoring begins  anew, thereby enabling the staff to evaluate the effectiveness of the policies by comparing actual impacts with those forecasted.

        "description":"Influences on postsecondary education, the planning function, and the challenge to management systems for postsecondary education for the 1980s are considered. It is suggested that if postsecondary education is to remain viable in the future, it must be knowledgeable of societal forces, trends, and effects as they occur in the college context and service environment. The way in which an institution is responsive to societal needs is largely a function of its sophistication in planning. Among the institutional planning efforts that occurred in the 1970s to deal with declining enrollments are an elaboration of the systematic and informed collegial (Agency for Educational Development) approach and a project that used societal trends and societal values as a way of planning futures  and bringing planning assumptions into focus (American Association of State Colleges and Universities). A list of planning practices and college personnel attitudes about planning is presented, along with a chart illustrating the planning process in higher education. It is suggested that planning processes in postsecondary education are shifting from operations and project planning to strategic, information-based planning models, including an assessment of the external environment. Categories of information used in strategic planning include social expectations, economic trends, demographic trends, governmental planning, technological advances, changes in the workplace, energy requirements, and value shifts. Planning efforts related to health delivery systems are described as  illustration. It is suggested that the impact of social expectations for better and more economic health care, as translated in federal regulation, upon management systems of universities with teaching hospitals has been demonstrated.

The system is different from existing models of similar purpose because it incorporates a capability to analytically derive, as well as aggregate, data required for the estimation of life cycle cost. This feature provides an improved capability to conduct trade-offs among candidate design, manpower, and logistic alternatives early in the systems acquisition process. LCCIM represents a systematic approach to resource requirements  analysis and cost estimation, which functions in terms of the operation and system support processes associated with the system being examined.

        "description":"The current state of the art on the educational use of microcomputers was explored through a review of the literature, observations, and interviews with teachers and practitioners. A working taxonomy to characterize typical computer-augmented learning environments (CALEs) was developed which consisted of environmental elements, activity segments, teacher-learner environment situations, and learner attributes. Results of the interviews with teachers and practitioners showed that in their CALEs, teachers concentrated less on the presentation of curriculum context and more on computer literacy, thinking, and problem skills, and computer applications. Their expressed needs were for more computers, quality software, and computer-related teacher training. Positive and negative factors  affecting CALEs included: (1) the &quot;hardware reliability&quot; problem, (2) the &quot;access&quot; problem, (3) the &quot;friendly environment&quot; problem, (4) the &quot;social pressure&quot; problem, and (5) the &quot;overbearing person&quot; problem. A hierarchy of achievement that most students pass through was specified, which included fear, curiosity, understanding, and tool use. The profile of a successful computer student showed that such learners tended to be bright, often boys, math and science oriented, logical or analytical thinkers, and persevering. Details on the survey itself and on the taxonomy are appended, and extensive references are provided. (Author/BK)",

A postcard questionnaire was sent to all school superintendents in the six states in the region to determine the current status and future plans for computer use in administration and instruction. A more comprehensive study of information and assistance needs was conducted through a survey of teachers who were at least somewhat knowledgeable of or experienced with using computers in instruction. The questionnaire for teachers was composed of six sections: demographic data, computer use, meeting  current information and assistance needs, software sources, information needs, and assistance needs. The results of the two surveys are reported with 17 supporting tables. The conclusions include a discussion of availability of computer terminals, uses of computers, current ways of meeting information and assistance needs, and needs for information and assistance.

Forty-eight randomly selected faculty members from the chemistry and public affairs departments were segmented into three groups and given retrospective searches on the topics of their choice. Thereafter, one group received only computer updates, another tables of contents, and the third a combination of both. Participants then evaluated their service via questionnaires.

This analysis revealed that: (1) the credits earned ratio was 71%; (2) this ratio was higher for vocational courses (74%) than for general education courses (69%); and (3) the ratios ranged from 66% in natural science courses to 81% in technology courses, and from 66% to 73% by campus. Of the grades assigned, 24% were A's, 25% were B's, 8% were W's, and 11% were N's. Only four of the six colleges assigned F grades, with the proportion of F grades assigned ranging from 2% to 16% by campus. The grade point average for the  system as a whole was 2.69, compared to 2.76 in Fall 1979 and 2.84 in Fall 1976. For the second consecutive year, the GPA earned by vocational majors (2.70) was higher than that earned by liberal arts majors (2.66). The GPA for vocational majors ranged from 2.52 in hotel/food service programs to 2.95 in health services programs. Unclassified students continued to earn the highest GPA (2.87), probably due to the lighter credit load carried.

        "description":"This report examines two models used by North Central Technical College (NCTC) in Ohio to respond to technological and social changes affecting the training requirements of its service area. As a means of illustrating a post-factum, rehabilitative response to such change, Part I of the report describes the development and outcomes of NCTC's Project Care, an interagency effort involving area colleges, unions, industry, and state agencies in the retraining of 500 tire builders who were laid off in August 1978 when the Mansfield Tire and Rubber Company closed. To illustrate a preventive intervention model, Part II describes NCTC's comprehensive institutional planning process in which internal and external planning assumptions are defined and strategies to meet the needs of area  residents are developed on the basis of these assumptions. Several examples are provided of NCTC's proactive responses to local industry needs. Part III proposes that colleges and industry work together in an ongoing Trend and Environmental Impact Analysis Program (TEIAP) which would diagnose national, state, and regional socioeconomic trends and specify institutional responses to these trends. This section also examines the currently operating futures studies programs upon which TEIAP is based. In conclusion, the report underscores the importance of a preventative approach to educational planning, and presents periodic systematic retraining of workers as an economic necessity and an educational challenge.

        "description":"In an effort to aid students with math skills deficiencies, while at the same time circumventing faculty and public resistance to the inclusion of remedial courses in four-year college curricula, George Mason University (GMU) entered into an articulation agreement with Northern Virginia Community College (NVCC), whereby NVCC offers sections of its developmental math course on the GMU campus. Planning the agreement involved a coordinated effort among administrators, faculty, and students at both institutions. It was decided that the sections to be offered would utilize, as is, the individualized, programmed methods in use at NVCC. In addition to minimizing curricular revisions, this decision allowed for the continuous registration of university students who initially attempted a  college-level math course and then encountered difficulty. Other planning considerations included: synchronizing NVCC's quarter system with GMU's semester calendar; facilitating in-class registration of students; and achieving agreement as to the interpretation of NVCC's grading system for university prerequisites purposes. NVCC retained complete control of the instructional facets of the course and selected its most experienced faculty to teach the first sections of the course to assure its initial success. Although the agreement has only been in effect since Fall 1980, it has proved a valuable tool for enhancing service to GMU students and is to be expanded with a testing and placement procedure.

        "description":"One pathway through which second order effects proceed is &quot;social referencing,&quot; a process in which the individual utilizes another's interpretation when appraising a situation. This phenomenon is well identified in adults and older children. While it had not been studied in infancy, there are good indications that the necessary cognitive and social skills for social referencing emerge in the second half of the first year. In the present study, 87 ten-month-old boys and girls received nonverbally positive and neutral messages about a stranger from their mothers, either directly when she communicated to the infant or indirectly when the infant observed her speaking to the stranger. Overall, the more positive the mother's message, the more friendly the infant's behavior to the  stranger. This effect was very strong when the message was provided directly to infants of easy temperament. The evidence suggests that infants' evaluations of the stranger, which led to differences in behavior to the stranger, were influenced by the mother's message. (Author/MP)",

In this paper, eight value-laden areas of probable difference between staff members and parents concerning the process of child socialization are identified. These areas are discipline, sex role learning, aggressive behavior, racial tolerance, religion, self-direction versus conformity, academic emphasis, and sex education. Issues involved in these areas are briefly described and relevant research studies are cited when available. Recommendations for parents and day care workers are offered to encourage dialogue in these areas so as to increase the amount of consistency between homes and day care  centers. Recommendations for further research in the area of parent/caregiver relationships are also suggested. (Author/MP)",

An attempt was made to identify those experiential factors associated with changes in intellectual performance over a period of 4 months. All subjects were pretested on a wide range of intellectual measures including the Wechsler Pre-school and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI), the English Picture Vocabulary Test (EPVT), and the Linear and Circular Order, Seriation, and Multiple Classification tests. Using the Child Observation Schedule (COS), observers recorded subjects' activities, interactions, and behaviors for 4  mornings each week over a period of 4 months. The posttests were then administered to all subjects. Results indicated that (1) for all subjects taken as a group, the mean improvements were significant and relatively uniform across all the intelligence measures used; (2) high IQ children spent more time listening to stories, spent more time in verbal interaction with others, and were more receptive to adult-initiated communication; (3) low SES children spent more time alone, more time on social/ personal activity, more passive time with adults and more time in solitary play than children from higher SES; and (4) girls spent less time on physical activities and more time on social activities than boys.

Established in disadvantaged areas by the Chicago public schools, CPCs are designed to break the cycle of poverty through educational intervention with children at ages 3 through 8. An element of evaluation studies that include experimental designs, treatment verification is the rigorous documentation of the degree and/or type of implementation of an intended treatment. In this study, 43 classroom observations were conducted by 22 observers in randomly selected CPC and control classrooms in order to verify that CPC treatment differed significantly from conventional treatment and that CPC treatment was being implemented as intended and to test the  hypothesis that program outcomes resulted from differences in program treatment. To delineate CPC program processes, four scales were composed from the Classroom Observation Rating Scale (CORS). The scales were titled Enriched Environment, Child-centeredness, Parent Involvement and Presence of Evaluation of Student Achievement. In addition, parent involvement was assessed using self-reports from parent interviews. Relationships and variables were examined using analysis of variance, multiple regression, discriminant functions analysis and factor analysis. Among the results, findings indicate that children in CPC classes scored higher on all intended processes, but only the child-centeredness and evaluation scales showed statistically significant differences.

Over a period of 8 months, each classroom was visited weekly for 2 to 3 hours. Detailed notes and videotapes were made of classroom behaviors in instructional, cleanup and free play contexts, and videotapes were used in interviews with teachers and with two child informants from each class. It was found that the separation of children  in Class A into two labeled instructional groups based on academic performance was reproduced in the structure of children's play activities. Children came to know one another as \"smart\" or \"dumb\" and became very competitive. Black children sank low in the class hierarchy. Instructional grouping in Class B was based on three unlabeled degrees of ability to work independently and two degrees of academic ability. Class B children did not classify classmates by ability. In Class B, cooperation in lessons carried over into interaction in play groups and black children enjoyed a high degree of prestige. In general, results indicate that teachers' organization of instruction affected children's peer interaction. (Author/RH)",

During that year and each of the four succeeding years, the students were administered SRA achievement tests in the fall and in the spring. One first-grade teacher (teacher #8) was identified as especially effective because of the superior achievement gains of her students in the spring of the first year. Two analytical procedures were used to examine whether or not a subsample of 14 students of teacher #8 would continue to demonstrate superior achievements in comparison with matched subsamples from the other classes. The results indicate that the students of the effective  first-grade teacher not only failed to continue their superior performance in subsequent elementary grades but performed worse than the students of the other eight first-grade teachers. Several possible explanations for this unexpected result are offered. (Author/JA)",

One hundred and thirty-nine kindergarten children and 79 first graders participated in the study. Approximately half of the kindergarten children (N=69) were enrolled in a half-day traditional program while the others were enrolled in a full-day academic-oriented program. Measures administered at the beginning of the year included a language and mathematics test from the CIRCUS series and the Auditory Test from the Metropolitan Readiness Test. At the end of  the school year, all the subjects were given the Reading, Language and Mathematics Tests from the Metropolitan Achievement Test. Results indicated a small but statistically significant relationship between month of birth and skill level at the beginning of kindergarten. At the end of the year, only the performance on the mathematics test was correlated to age for the kindergarten children and there was no relationship for first graders. Type of program did not alter the pattern of results. (Author/MP)",

Three samples totaling 166 non-repeating kindergarten children (79 male, 87 female) were drawn from eight kindergarten classes distributed among seven schools. All of the children were native English speakers. Each child was asked individually to print from memory immediately after a 2.5-second exposure to each of 41 reversible letters and numbers shown one at a time in random order on either slides or flash cards. Results support previous findings that left-right reversal errors have limited utility for identifying children with potential  learning problems. It is concluded that the largely overlooked category of form error could prove useful as an aid in early screening programs. The possibility that form errors stem from the child's lack of familiarity with letters and numbers and/or a short attention span suggests that programs designed to focus attention on and provide drill with language based materials are appropriate for early interventions.

During each 6-week period subjects were observed 3 days a week. Comparison between the autumn and the spring studies revealed only one significant  change: blocks changed from a sex stereotyped play activity in the autumn to a non-sex stereotyped play activity in the spring. The other seven child-selected play activities were not sex stereotyped at a statistically significant level in either study. Based on these results it was concluded that sex stereotyping of child-selected play activities did not increase with age. (Author/MP)",

Each session was videorecorded. The data consisted of both adult and child talk occurring during the free play session. Each videorecorded session was transcribed until 100 adult utterances were obtained, yielding a  total of 2,800 adult and accompanying child utterances. Both structural complexity and language use aspects of children's and adults' language were analyzed. Findings indicate numerous differences, both quantitative and qualitative, between the language of the two talkative and two reticent children observed. Quantitatively, the talkative children produced more of all the coded pragmatic functions and, in the discourse analysis, more adequate responses to adult- initiated comments. Qualitatively, differences were noted in structural complexity, in pragmatic functions, and in the discourse functions of the children's self-initiated speech. (Author/RH)",

The purposes of the study were: (1) to compare the academic and social behavior of the early admissions (EA) students with that of the regular first graders; (2) to examine the validity of screening measures; and (3) to determine the satisfaction of parents, teachers, and principals with the services offered. It was found that the performance of EA students compared favorably with that of first grade students and that parents, teachers, and principals had a positive attitude towards the program. However, they tended to look on the program as an all day kindergarten rather than a first grade alternative  and few students were promoted or accepted promotion to the second grade. In addition, it was not possible to identify with confidence screening measures predictive of success in the K-1 program. The pilot program is currently in its second year of operation. (Author/MP)",

Five overriding concerns in the areas of health and health care are identified in Chapter One. Chapter Two focuses on the reduction of environmental risks; Chapter Three explores the relationships between health and behavior; and Chapter Four identifies four ways to improve the nutritional status of mothers and children. Chapter Five focuses mainly on prevention services that typically can be delivered through primary care systems. Chapter Six identifies nine organizational attributes that should be incorporated into all provider arrangements and submits proposals for strengthening existing arrangements.  Chapter Seven discusses home visiting, primary mental health care, categorical services, mass screening, hospital care, and regionalization. Chapters Eight and Nine concentrate on organizing services for special populations and financing health services, respectively. Chapter Ten suggests ways to improve program coordination and management. Chapter Eleven discusses federal administration arrangements. The final two chapters suggest new roles for and relationships among health professionals and list domains of special importance on which research is needed. In conclusion, three sets of goals are formulated to clarify relationships among the many recommendations made. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"This study examines the sex differences in preschool children's perception of male and female adults of different ages (young, middle-aged and elderly) and the degree to which physical attractiveness plays a role in children's attributions concerning adults. Forty 3- and 4-year-old children (20 boys, 20 girls) from middle-income families served as subjects. The children individually responded to a modified Children's Attitudes Toward the Elderly Scale (CATE), which required them to order pictures of men and women by age. The addition of an attractiveness question (pretty/handsome vs. ugly) was the primary modification to the CATE. The children correctly ordered younger, middle-aged, and elderly female adults by age, but did not differentiate younger and middle-aged male adults by  age. They always viewed an elderly male adult as oldest. Boys were generally less positive than girls in attitudes toward elderly individuals and boys also tended to view the elderly adults as less physically attractive than younger adults. These results suggest that negative attributions concerning elderly persons are evident as early as the preschool years. (Author/JA)",

        "description":"This paper explores strategies by which adults can intervene in children's play activities. The five intervention strategies discussed focus on (1) time and space, (2) adult guidance, (3) play materials, (4) boundaries, and (5) roles. The first strategy involves providing time and space in daily schedules and environments for children to play. The second strategy requires teachers and parents to sensitively offer oral prompts and direct involvement cues as children play. The third strategy calls for the provision of a variety of play materials. In the fourth strategy parents and teachers use demonstration and practice to show children how to enter and leave play situations. The fifth strategy requires adults to allow children to decide upon their own play themes and define and  assign their own roles; however, it permits adults, at times, to suggest play themes for specific instructional purposes and rotate children in roles to assure that all have the opportunity to participate. It is suggested that the combination of the five intervention strategies with Parten's model of the development of play behavior (from onlooker to solitary, parallel, associative and cooperative stages) provides a complete intervention model for use with young children at play. Examples that illustrate the employment of intervention strategies at each of Parten's stages are provided. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"Musical improvisation behavior of 4-, 6-, and 8-year-old children who played Orff xylophones during ten 15-minute sessions is described in this paper. Each session involved three improvisatory phases. Phase I consisted of free exploration; Phase II consisted of short verbally stimulated musical tasks (two imitation and six improvisational tasks); and Phase III consisted of a folk song played by the investigator followed by improvisations by subjects while the investigator played a 24-measure bordun accompaniment. Each session was recorded, and improvisations from Phase III were isolated for analysis. Children's initial responses, their sequences of behavior, and the musical structure of their improvisations were analyzed. Among the results, it was found that the characteristics  of children's improvisation change in relationship to the child's chronological age. Young children are able to improvise patterns which are related to melodic and rhythmic stimuli. Four- to eight-year-old children are able to form musical images to verbal stimuli. The 4-year-old child improvises complex rhythm patterns. Six-year-old and eight-year-old children maintain their interest in exploring the sound possibilities of a single instrument longer than four-year-old children. Between the ages of 6 and 8 children may improvise large formal structures. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"The purposes of this longitudinal study were: (1) to see whether it was possible to discern direct or indirect effects of mothers' and fathers' functioning on their 2-year-olds' cognitive, social, and psychomotor adaptations, and (2) to examine separately the relationships between parent functioning and the adaptations of first and later born 2-year-olds. Fifty-two mother-father-toddler family units participated in the study. Thirty-one of the toddlers were first or only children and 21 were later born. Data from the families were collected at 6 points in time: early in the pregnancy, late in the pregnancy (32 to 36 weeks), shortly after the birth, at 2 months post partum, and near the child's first and second birthdays. During the 2-year home visit, each parent was individually  interviewed, the child was given the Bayley Mental Development Index (MDI) and Psychomotor Development Index (PDI), and mother, father and child were observed in partially structured play interactions for 45 minutes. At the end of the visit parents were asked to complete and return a Development Inventory (DI) form designed to screen out disturbance in children. Among the results, it was found that mothers who were more anxious and depressed in early pregnancy had children with substantially lower scores on the DI at 2 years, and this relationship was stronger for first born children than for later born children. There is some support that father's involvement was the intervening variable between mother's early postpartum adaptation and the adaptation of the 2-year-old; fathers whose  wives were not doing well with the child in the early neonatal period stepped in to fill the need and continued their greater involvement with the 2-year-old. For first born boys and girls, the more time the fathers were spending with them on weekends, the less good their adaptation. This was also true for later born girls but not for later born boys.

        "description":"Traditionally research is done via the scientific method, which is quantitative; however, qualitative research is seen by some as a better way to study rural education. Advocates of the quantitative viewpoint claim that it is the only way to develop cumulative knowledge. Advocates of the qualitative method reject the &quot;scientific&quot; view as not being enough and as needing subjective understandings. Popp (1975) identifies two types of educational inquiry, epistemic (concerning understanding of phenomena and dealing with questions of what is) and prescriptive (involving questions of action). Epistemic inquiry is rewarded, recognized, and encouraged among the academics, while prescriptive inquiry serves the practitioners. Progress will come when multiple approaches are used. Additional  approaches which hold promise for research on rural education include ethnomethodology, case studies, anthropological field method, and policy research. Of all the methods mentioned above, policy research is the most desirable and could have the most impact, for it chooses from among conflicting means for the public good. Dealing directly with the issues confronting the decision makers and supplying timely, appropriate information, geared to various alternatives, appears to be the best approach for research on rural education.

Telephone interviews covered respondents' family characteristics and attitudes toward their communities and potential new energy developments. Complete, usable interviews were obtained from 129 of the 151 residents contacted (87%). Limitations included the small sample size and the fact that respondents were exposed to much publicity and controversy after interviewing was concluded. Those favoring the energy industries comprised 72%, while 13% opposed and 14% &quot;didn't know.&quot; When  characteristics of those favoring the industries were compared with those opposing such industries, it was found that older respondents, those with less education, larger families, and lower incomes tended to favor the industries, while respondents who were younger, had more education, smaller families, and higher incomes tended to oppose the establishment of the industries. A larger survey has been planned to determine more definitive relationships relative to these preliminary findings and furnish data useful to others in the field of social impact assessment of energy developments.

A method of curriculum integration in the mainstream of graduate education, utilizing non-traditional content and research methodologies relevant to researchers of Indian communities is needed. Implementation of a two-dimensional grid for curriculum integration, using the American Indian family subject area, verifies the  efficacy of regional research centers which house data bases designed by ethnic researchers. The White Cloud Institute data base provides the greatest amount of pertinent information about the subject, followed by ERIC (Educational Resources Information Center). Annotated bibliographies for selected topics can be easily prepared after the material has been systematically categorized. A state-of-the-art assessment can be conducted by evaluating existing research from the standpoint of research methodology, generalizability, and authenticity.

Data gathered from public sources, attendance at faculty, staff and school board meetings, interviews, and faculty questionnaires revealed similar growth and development patterns in the economy and schools of both counties, but historically greater prosperity and population in West County because of better transportation systems. A larger tax base enabled West County to establish and maintain an independent school system in the major town, although outlying county schools were consolidated. East County's schools were completely consolidated; no community schools remain there. Schools in  both counties are governed by boards of education. Differences in school functioning appear to be more a factor of differences in size and facilities than in organization. However, school-community relations in both counties have been affected by organizational differences. West County's independent system maintains excellent relations with its community, but both West's and East's consolidated schools generally lack strong community ties except at the elementary level. Apparently, grade levels are significant in successful consolidation. Also, school organization is connected to economic conditions and school functioning to governmental mandates. (SB)",

Results of a survey of administrative heads of the department/school/college of education of 24 such institutions in 23 states with a substantial rural population indicate that there is little evidence of availability of programs for educating teachers to develop the specific competencies required for teaching in small or rural schools, and that a limited number of institutions address the specific needs of rural educators with in-service and graduate education programs. A summary of responses names resource concerns, political and bureaucratic  constraints, commitment and responsibility concerns, and knowledge/research concerns as barriers to meeting the needs of educational personnel in rural/small schools. To eliminate those barriers, institutions should (1) commit themselves to the development of personnel; (2) assign the overall responsibility for a rural education effort to a person or unit within the institution; (3) internally redirect resources; and (4) foster cooperative relationships and mutual support among colleges of education, state departments of education, teacher and administrator organizations, school boards, and other school/community-based organizations.

        "description":"Recently, Indian people from the United States and Canada recommended coping-skills training for American Indians, to help in handling stress, becoming self-determined, being assertive, problem solving, and redesigning social roles and support systems. Some 30 tribal groups and agencies participated in a cultural adaptation of an assertive coping-skills training intervention program for a year. The general themes of coping, self-determination, and communication were reflected in the ultimate program goal, which was competence in a biculturally appropriate lifestyle. Brainstorming of program goals among community members provided the cultural input necessary for designing instructional methods and for assessing culturally-determined perceptions of the personal growth process.  Formal and informal modeling provided a variety of Indian coping models enacting assertive behavior in several Indian and non-Indian social, family, and business settings. Indian and non-Indian persons rated 24 pre-training and 24 post-training role play scenes by 6 participants to determine whether relevant and noticeable change had taken place. Results indicated that the cultural adaptation of social skills training appeared to be more effective for American Indians than traditional psychological approaches. (CM)",

        "description":"Although many social indicators suggest that problems exist among the American Indian population for which counseling and mental health services should be provided, there are relatively few American Indian counselors in the conventional mental health system or in schools; therefore, the training of non-Indian counselors who work among American Indians must be improved. Current literature suggests that counselors working with Indians should be culturally sensitive, should have an awareness of Indian culture, and should be able to interpret specific behaviors in terms of possible cultural meaningfulness. A major implication of current literature is that there is a lack of communication and mutual understanding between counselors and Indian students. Results of a study comparing  communication styles (Dauphinais, Dauphinais, and Rowe) indicate that the facilitative style, which is most commonly taught in counselor and therapist training, is seen as least effective by Indian students. Preliminary results of another study in which the authors are involved indicate that 15 out of 25 Indian students perceive the cultural-experimental style as being more helpful. Thus, efforts to specify counseling practices which Indian people find helpful should be intensified in training non-Indian counselors. (CM)",

        "description":"Although there are few studies that include empirical information on the subject of counseling American Indians, an informative and provocative literature base exists. The literature deals with appropriateness of techniques, the delivery of mental health services, the operation and programming of Indian service delivery units (including Indian paraprofessionals and traditional healers), program concepts involving collaborative efforts and use of specialized techniques, encapsulation (including a disregard for cultural variations among clients) of counselors of American Indians, and culturally effective counseling. However, despite the fact that journals are published monthly on research into the counseling process, comparison of various techniques available, and counseling  special populations, it is questionable whether the counseling profession can claim a data base firm enough to support any generalized theory. This is due to methodological difficulties and theoretical disagreements in the field. The availability of community-based research paradigms and an illuminative evaluation technique (Dinges, Trimble, Manson, and Pasquale) provide the researcher with adequate directives to avoid methodological pitfalls. The awareness and flexibility demanded of the scientists in conducting ecological research necessitates collaboration with fellow professionals and the community. (CM)",

        "description":"Small rural social systems tend to have great impact on the social behavior and performance of rural youth in higher education. The issue is the degree to which rural youth from a social environment requiring active and continuous social involvement can exist in a larger social system which may require more passive and observational modes of social interaction. Evidence suggests that they can cope successfully. Generally, youth from smaller schools (versus larger schools) tend to think their work is more important, take broader roles, have greater skills in social communication, have a greater sense of group cohesiveness, and find their work more meaningful. However, rural youth have limited occupational role models; consequently, they have limited views of occupational  opportunities and tend to select from familiar areas. The general socio-economic level of a student's family is a minor contributor to his chances of remaining in college. The higher the educational level of his parents, the more likely he is to persist in college. Within a single institution, few (if any) differences exist between students from rural versus metropolitan areas in terms of academic performance or persistence. However, rural youth may enter college slightly less prepared by their high school background. (CM)",

The first component of PRISM was a survey of preferences for alternative content topics, instructional goals, resources, methods, provisions for particular groups of students, and ways of using calculators. Each of these was considered for nine content strands in the precollege curriculum: (1) whole numbers; (2) fractions and decimals; (3) ratio, proportion, and percent; (4) measurement; (5) algebra; (6) geometry; (7) probability and statistics; (8) computer literacy; and (9) problem solving. The second component of PRISM assessed priorities for  curriculum change or for methods of addressing problems in mathematics education. Respondents were asked to judge the relative importance of curriculum alternatives, identifying points in the mathematics curriculum where change seems most needed. Major points from both surveys are discussed in this publication, and PRISM data are related to eight recommendations in NCTM's &quot;An Agenda for Action: Recommendations for School Mathematics of the 1980's.&quot; (Author/MP)",

Mastery learning in this study was modified to limit diagnosis and remediation to two cycles. Three treatment groups were included: (1) contrast (no diagnostic/remediation procedures); (2) student-managed remediation (students selected their own remediation following diagnosis); and (3) teacher-managed remediation (teachers assigned remediation based on diagnostic test results). Results showed that the modified mastery learning strategy influenced on-task behavior and achievement indicating that high school chemistry teachers may successfully employ such a strategy to increase  the on-task behavior and achievement of their students. Lack of significant differences between the two experimental groups suggested that assigned remediation may not be necessary to bring about achievement gains; simply having remediation available for students to use on their own may be sufficient.

        "description":"This paper discusses a study of learning retention among junior high school students involved in a field trip in a geography course. The study was based on a model of memory proposed by Robert Gagne and R.T. White. This model of cognitive processes, postulated on the belief that recall of any element is a function of its degree of interlinking in memory with other elements, implies that fieldwork should improve retention because it encourages students to associate various types of verbal knowledge, intellectual skills, images, and episodes. The study involved comparing learning retention of geographical facts and skills among three groups of students (141 in all) in grades eight and nine in two junior high schools in Melbourne, Australia. One group was treated to an excursion  stressing processing of meaning of phenomena observed and experienced during the field trip; one group participated in a traditional (passive) excursion; and the final group participated in the same basic geography course but had no excursion. It was hypothesized that (1) students who received either form of fieldwork would outperform students with no field trips on a test of geography knowledge, and (2) that students who participated in the field trip stressing knowledge and idea processing would outperform students who participated in the passive field trip. An achievement test was given to all students soon after the completion of the unit and again 12 weeks later to measure retention. Findings from a statistical analysis of test scores supported both hypotheses. The conclusion is that  information and skill links such as those encouraged during the geography field trip discussed in this paper, will aid recall of facts and skills. Tests are included in the appendix. (DB)",

Carried out by the California Coalition for Sex Equity in Education, the study was designed to demonstrate that districts which make an active effort to promote Title IX implementation by involving public administrators, board members, teachers, specialists, students, and community members will achieve high levels of sex equity awareness, skills, and knowledge of programs. A corollary purpose was to identify types of training and technical assistance most useful for achieving sex equity in education. A pre-assessment of the selected schools revealed that some schools achieved less than minimum compliance to Title IX. Trained interviewers then  questioned school district teams on access to courses, nonacademic programs, physical education, athletics, and employment policies and practices. Results indicate that districts who receive federal assistance for achieving compliance are more prepared to deal with Title IX; the level of each district's compliance can be reliably measured; and political, personal, and economic factors can have an effect on a district's effort to achieve compliance. Researchers also reviewed the taped interviews to discover off the record comments and attitudes by team members. These comments indicated the need for technical assistance and training. (KC)",

        "description":"This paper examines concepts of educational quality in various societies at different times throughout history. It also identifies major opposing themes which influence educational objectives, including eloquence versus efficiency, prejudice and discrimination versus social equality and educational opportunity, and conflict versus consensus. The purpose of the paper is to call attention to the philosophical notion of educational excellence at a time when this concept is either under attack or ignored in favor of the numerous mandates for mediocrity so often used to justify social inequities. The hypothesis is that our educational system encourages students to be less creative and scholarly than they might be because educators are influenced by the current social thinking that  rewards efficiency and disdains eloquence. Earlier societies were influenced by very different philosophies and, as a consequence, aimed at very different educational objectives. For example, the first century orator Quintillian provided a base upon which scholars could build an order of reasonableness and academic criticism. Johan Amos Comenius, a 17th century educational reformer in Czechoslovakia, called for imparting knowledge which would begin with the senses, pass into memory through individual imagination and find expression in creativity. (John Dewey contributed the concept of experiential learning.) More recent educators and educational philosophers who have spoken in favor of academic excellence have been hampered by allegations of discrimination, prejudice, elitism, and  contributing to social conflict. The conclusions are that the relationship between education and social goals is more complex than is generally realized and that educators will be doing the greatest service to diverse contemporary society if they move beyond the basics to goals that maximize individual quality.

        "description":"In order for invitational education to realize its potential as a positive, practical, and verifiable self-concept approach, it must be clearly understood by educators and educational researchers. The purpose of this paper is to clarify the general, research, practical, and theoretical concerns of invitational education. Broadly defined, invitational education is a system which intentionally invites students to perceive themselves as valuable, able, and responsible and to behave accordingly. It can be understood as a means of treating students fairly, humanely, and effectively and 'inviting' school success. The document is presented in four sections. Section one defines invitational education and focuses on two conceptual issues: (1) an analysis of invitations from the  perspective of sender, receiver, and observer; and (2) justification for the practical necessity of becoming fluent in sending and receiving invitational messages. Section two offers specific suggestions for additional research on invitational education. Section three views invitational education from the point of view of the practitioner and emphasizes its potential use in solving educational problems. The final section identifies aspects of invitational education which are open to various conflicting interpretations. The concluding comment calls for additional research on the intended focus of invitational education theory in the hope that, once key theoretical issues are resolved, educational researchers can develop more substantive research methods and practical teaching strategies.

Social/political education is interpreted to include that area of pre-university teaching referred to in the United States most often as social studies or social science education; in England as social science or social studies; and in Germany as political education. An overview, intended to give the reader a synoptic view of the volume, preceeds articles which are presented in four major topical categories. The first section is concerned with the content and theories that underlie social/political education. The second section deals with what is known about the psychological and social makeup  of students and with how students learn. The third section describes knowledge and practices related to curriculum development. The final section describes theories of, and knowledge about, how schools are related to society and to social justice. Major themes which run through the chapters are identified in the introductory overview and in the three concluding synthesis chapters. Themes include the extent to which schools are, and should be, institutions for socializing students; the dilemma over whether the major objective of social/political education should be to make students aware of prevailing knowledge, values, and modes of thought in society or to teach students to become responsible adult political activists who work to change and improve society; whether the curriculum should  be discipline/subject-oriented or interdisciplinary/problem-centered; and the difficulties faced by educators as a result of the disappearance of authoritative guides to what knowledge is true and what knowledge is most important.

The project was designed to provide an ongoing assessment of the changing behaviors, plans, and preferences of American youth. The study involved a nationwide survey of each new high school senior class in over 130 secondary schools since 1975. In addition, annual follow-up surveys are mailed to members of each class for a six-year period after graduation to determine changes in attitude regarding personal lifestyles, confidence in social  institutions, intergroup and interpersonal attitudes, concerns about conservation and ecology, behavior and attitudes related to drug use, and other social and ethical issues. The document is presented in four major sections. In section one, the scope and purposes of the project are outlined. In section two, the research design is described. Information is presented on the rationale, base-year data collections, and follow-up data collections. Section three focuses on measures, including monitored and background variables, high school and post-high school experiences, and questionnaire organization and format. Information is also presented on sample representativeness and response validity. The final section examines analysis strategies and stresses the need for multi-cohort longitudinal  data. The document concludes with appendices which offer information on sampling procedures, questionnaire items, measures, study description, instructions to teachers, and a flyer to senior students.

        "description":"This essay presents background information and suggests teaching stragegies to aid community and junior college classroom teachers of history and civilization as they develop and implement educational programs on Latin American music. It is based on the premise that Latin American music can best be understood as a reflection of other historical and cultural themes. Emphasis is placed on the music of Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia. The document is presented in six chapters. Chapter one introduces the document, identifies objectives, and presents information on major influences of Latin America's musical heritage, including indigenous, Iberian, and African. Chapters two, three, and four focus on the music of Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia, respectively. For each country, information is  organized around six themes--(1) ethnic variety and fusion, (2) regionalism, (3) cultural imperialism and imitativeness, (4) nationalism, (5) protest and revolution, and (6) urbanization and cultural standardization. Titles and themes of various types of music are interwoven throughout the narrative. A brief introductory section for each of these three chapters relates the folk, popular, and art music traditions of each country to Latin American music at various times throughout history. Chapter five offers additional suggestions on relating music to nationalistic and social action themes in other Latin American nations. Chapter six suggests teaching methods, including playing musical selections in class, asking students to identify various rhythmic and stylistic differences, and  directing students to identify traditional motifs while listening to nationalistic music. The document concludes with a bibliography and a discography. (DB)",

The goal of the report is to further public discussion of these important issues and to offer ideas to government leaders who will be developing U.S. policy in the years ahead. A summary of recommendations is provided for each of the following areas: population, food and agriculture, renewable energy resources and conservation, tropical forests, biological diversity, coastal and marine resources, water resources, global pollution, sustainable development, and institutional changes. Examples of the recommendations include the following. Regarding population--the United States should formally consult, at both the  policy and technical levels, with other donor countries on contraceptive research needs and with recipient countries on their health and contraceptive needs. Regarding food and agriculture--the State Department should lead an interagency effort to explore the desirability and feasibility of an international agreement on the preservation of agricultural genetic resources. Regarding tropical forests--the World Bank should be encouraged to survey needs and opportunities for replanting in large deforested tropical watersheds, and to recommend a cooperative program to be undertaken by the Bank, other multilateral institutions, and bilateral donors.

SEA is an instructional program designed to teach seventh, eighth, and ninth grade students a strategy/process for acting ethically in their daily lives. The specific purposes of this report were to study and evaluate SEA classroom use in a variety of settings under conditions that were free of direct influence of SEA developers. The evaluation method used placed strong emphasis on recording and describing in detail the implementation of SEA activities and on evaluating teacher and student response to the course. The document is presented  in nine major sections. Section one introduces the study. Section two describes methods of sampling, data collection, and data analysis. Sections three through eight present case studies of SEA use in suburban and urban junior high schools. For each case study, information is presented on background, implementation, acceptability, teacher interviews, effectiveness, student responses to questionnaires, and conclusions. The final section summarizes the report. Findings indicated, as hypothesized, that SEA operated and was received very differently in different classrooms. The conclusion is that SEA should be altered to improve its acceptability and effectiveness for a wider variety of school settings. Questionnaires, tests, and tables are appended. (DB)",

        "description":"This paper examines knowledge of studying--knowing how and when to apply study strategies. Study strategies may be classified into three categories: memory strategies, comprehension strategies, and problem-solving strategies. Memory-study strategies help students remember what they study. Five attributes often characterize memory strategies: meaningfulness, organization, association, visualization, and attention. Some memory strategies include rhymes, patterns, acronyms, acrostics, the link system, the loci system, and the peg system. Comprehension strategies help students understand what they study. Activities in comprehension strategies include identifying important information (e.g., underlining main ideas or taking note of headings); paraphrasing and summarizing important  information; generating examples and questions; outlining; reorganizing notes; and elaborating. One of the most well-known comprehension strategies is Francis Robinson's SQ3R method. Problem-solving study strategies help students solve problems, innovate, and invent. A number of writers have offered techniques for solving problems. However, a sound rationale underlying the processes of problem solving has not yet emerged. Strategies that are especially useful for solving well-defined problems usually focus on two activities: generating plausible alternative solutions and systematically testing these proposed solutions.

        "author":["Bollen, Sharon Kesterson"],
        "description":"This paper introduces an artistic model of planning and problem solving. The model is based on a case study of processes engaged in by a college art student during the course of producing a senior thesis in batik (a wax-resist fabric dyeing process). Based on the premise that knowledge of the creative process is essential to understanding the art-making process, the author offers a step-by-step description of creative activities undertaken during the three-month process of batik creation. Various techniques of naturalistic inquiry (the investigation of phenomena within and in relation to their naturally occurring contexts) were used to gather information, including observing and listening to the artist as she worked on and thought about the batik, interviewing the artist,  analyzing the artist's daily journal, reviewing field notes, and examining photographic documentation of the batik during various stages of production. During the period of data collection, concepts and hypotheses were generated and tested against previous data and ongoing behavior. The end result of this testing and conceptualization was a theoretical model of artistic planning and problem solving in which three stages of artistic activity were identified: problem finding, problem formulation and solution, and solution evaluation. The conclusion is that artists and art researchers will better understand the planning and problem-solving processes involved in the production of art if they use a process model such as the one suggested in this paper to clarify what is going on in the  artist's mind at various stages of the art-production process.

The materials can be used in social studies and literature classes. The developers believe that it is the obligation of educators to make youth aware of the widespread existence of man's inhumanity, and of possible encroachments on individual and group rights, so that the democracy we cherish may be preserved. The first section very briefly presents a number of examples of man's inhumanity to man throughout the ages. The remaining eight sections deal with the Holocaust. Topics treated include Germany after World War I, Adolf Hitler, the Third Reich, the lost culture of the Eastern European Jews who were destroyed, the &quot;Final  Solution,&quot; world reaction, and aftermath. Each section contains a reading selection, questions for discussion, suggestions for learning activities, and a bibliography of student print and nonprint material. A few examples of the learning activities in which students are involved include doing research, writing papers, listening to guest speakers, tracing the history of anti-semitism in Germany, and writing essays.

Four major categories of skills are discussed--locating information, evaluating information, using time and place concepts, and analyzing social problems. Specific project goals were to define essential social studies skills for senior high students, create a test item bank which could be used to create skills tests for diagnosis and post-instructional analysis, and to create skill lesson models which could be used for student remediation and/or enrichment. The document is presented in five major chapters. In chapter one, the project rationale and goals are presented. In chapter two, information is offered on  the essential skills. Chapter three focuses on the essential learner outcomes in social studies process objectives which were developed by the Minnesota Department of Education. Chapter four presents a test item bank which includes test questions relating to each of the essential skill categories. Chapter five, the bulk of the document, presents 125 lessons relating to the skill areas. For each lesson, information is presented on objectives, background information, directions, and special instructions on activities such as using the dictionary, using the telephone book, reading and interpreting charts, and finding percentages. Students are involved in a variety of activities, including determining bias in selections from social studies textbooks, discussing issues in class, using primary  sources, using chronology and time lines, drawing inferences from maps, identifying value statements, and identifying consequences of actions.

The format is a discussion and comparison of major educational themes, with extensive quotes from the articles. Among the challenges cited by the authors are the status of the  curriculum, participation in decision making, special education areas, evaluation and research, and professional involvement. The implications for pedagogical education in the 1980s are brought together and analyzed in the last section. The ERIC Resources in Education (RIE) abstracts of the articles are appended. (FG)",

        "description":"Four classroom-based experiments in which teachers were trained to use a direct instruction model were analyzed to compare the results of intensive and minimal training methods. The direct instruction model involves extensive coverage of content, student time allocated to instructional tasks, and teacher time allocated to the encouragement of students. The observed results of those studies indicated that teachers could receive minimal training in a teaching method and successfully implement it in the classroom with significant improvement in student achievement. A fifth study, designed to test these findings, failed to corroborate the positive results obtained previously. After a year-long study, experimental-group teachers with a minimum of training did not evidence markedly  greater conformity to the training recommendations than the control-group teachers did. The classes of these two groups of teachers were not appreciably different in end-of-year student academic achievement. Training-related behavior among experimental-group teachers was not modified enough to effect appreciable changes in subsequent student achievement. These results, and the results of the previous four studies, are analyzed, and recommendations are made for further research. (JD)",

After extensive interviews with participants, a premise that collaborative planning contributes to the successful implementation of an innovation emerged. This method of planning is characterized by project plans that are made with equal input from the project managers (the Top) and the persons whose behavior is to be changed (the Grassroots). Throughout the egalitarian planning effort, all layers of participants in the change process are jointly involved in decision making, and each enjoys an equal share of planning power. Collaborative planning can appear in yet another form, \"dialectical collaboration\". This is distinguished by an integration of  directives from the Top, Grassroots action, and joint planning. Impetus for change may come from the Top or the Grassroots, and collaborative planning implements the change. The implications of these findings for developing large-scale inservice programs successfully are discussed. (JD)",

During the second and third years of the project, when the aim was to implement the changes planned during the initiation year, many of the strategies used in the initiation phase continued to be used. A description is given of a variety of extrinsic and intrinsic incentives designed to motivate school faculty  to attend inservice activities.

An improvement in teaching skills calls for an interactive or collaborative mode of professional development which is based on classroom interests and the needs of teachers, with provision for expertise from outside. While the prime objective of clinical supervision is the improvement of instruction, its strength lies in the intensive conferencing that occurs between teacher and supervisor which provides nonevaluative feedback to the teacher. An Australian pilot study used principals trained in clinical supervision to introduce research findings into the repertoire of experienced elementary school teachers. Data  were collected over one year of the two-phase operation: (1) familiarization with skills and processes; and (2) implementation using the clinical supervision framework. The research findings were presented as suggestions to the teachers, which appealed to the participants' sense of balance between needed authentication for classroom practices and the practicalities involved in actually implementing changes in the classroom.

Measurements of age, height, weight, skinfold thicknesses, and performance scores on the vertical jump, standing broad jump, modified pull-up, 40-yard dash, and 400-yard run were obtained on 564 elementary school children in grades one through four. Although males scored significantly higher on tests requiring the ability to move body weight around, sex differences in body fatness were insignificant and did little to explain performance differences between boys and girls. The fact that body fatness accounted for such a small proportion of performance  variance from children of this age emphasizes that other underlying biological and cultural factors are more important in explaining performance.

Teaching styles and strategies are discussed, with recommendations for considering how the use of a particular teaching strategy affects time allocation and pacing, grouping, sequence of events, teaching style, and the need for supplementary materials. Teacher roles in the classroom are reviewed along with implications for  effective use of classroom materials.

Two key principles from systems theory support the above: (1) the definition of an organization as an open system, and (2) the self-regulatory or cybernetic nature of systems. Actual experiences are drawn upon to describe that interrupted the evaluation process or changed the nature of the evaluation. The &quot;By the way...&quot; phenomenon referred to is described as an interaction between the organization and the evaluator that results in a modification, revision, deletion or addition to the previously prescribed evaluator role and its attendant activities. The basic premise, that changes themselves are not able to be anticipated, is explored; and it is concluded that the task becomes one  of skill development (Specifically, renegotiation) so that the processes are there to handle the role changes as they occur.

        "description":"The diffusion of three types of innovations in secondary schools in Canada are investigated: (1) program organization (time scheduling); (2) program content (courses for special students); and (3) physical environment (conservation measures). Analysis focused on the rate of innovations as estimated by a mathematical model of the adoption process, the percentage of schools adopting, and explanations for variations in these two statistics. First, the role of regulations and legislation in the diffusion of time schedules appeared substantial. Second, the values of provincial societies seemed to account for the variation in the diffusion patterns of providing for students with special needs. Third, economic factors clearly accounted for regional differences in rates of adoption and  degrees of penetration of energy conservation measures; both were related to the cost effectiveness of a given practice. The economic growth of Western Canadian provinces encouraged liberalization, and wealth existed to fund experimental programs. The economic difficulties of Eastern Canada fostered rapid innovation in conserving energy, but tended to slow innovation in education and reinforce traditional conservatism. (RL)",

        "description":"Five causal models relating several aspects of end-of-term student evaluation of a graduate course in nursing research methods were proposed and tested empirically. The course evaluation form consisted of four Likert-type subscales, on which students rated the following aspects of the course: (1) the extent to which the course met its objectives; (2) the utility of various instructional resources and activities in meeting course objectives (e.g., reading materials, quizzes, examinations); (3) the effectiveness of a number of specific course policies (e.g., open book examinations and quizzes) in promoting learning; and (4) instructor effectiveness. For each model, a prediction was made in terms of vanishing partial or zero-order correlations. The most plausible models suggested  that ratings of the extent to which course objectives were met, and of instructor effectiveness, were both linked with ratings of course policy effectiveness via ratings of the utility of instructional resources in meeting course objectives. Course policies may best be implemented by means of appropriate instructional resources and techniques; students will then rate the instructor as effective and regard course objectives as having been met.

One approach to the study of such sequences is to gather data on several variables, each of which corresponds to a stage, step, or phase in the sequence and to examine the associations between the variables as displayed in a contingency table. If the variables are associated in ways predicted by the hypothesized sequence, then the data lend support to the sequence. Goodman's loglinear model for developmental or learning sequences is presented and illustrated on number concept data gathered by Brainerd and Fraser. Where its strong assumptions are satisfied, the model provides a probabilistic framework within which to: (1) test the plausibility of an hypothesized developmental sequence or learning  hierarchy; (2) compare several hypothesized sequences on the same data; (3) estimate the proportion of subjects who do not conform to the sequence; and (4) estimate the proportion of subjects at each step in the sequence.

The focus of the study was upon correlates of self perceived respondent burden, i.e., factors associated with the presence of negative feelings such as annoyance, frustration or inconvenience which may be experienced by survey participants during face-to-face interviews at their homes. The effect of interview time (25- and 75-minute treatments) and respondent effort upon respondent burden was assessed. Interviews were conducted with 500 consenting persons in households located in a predominately white middle class suburb. Most questions sought factual information, rather than opinion or attitude data. Results indicated: (1) no relationship was found between interview length (IL) and overall item nonresponse; (2) IL was  associated with willingness to be re-interviewed with 14 percent more of the short interview subjects willing to allow the interviewer to return next year; (3) IL affected attitudes towards the interview by eliciting more negative responses to questions which asked specifically about length; and (4) generally, increasing the effort required to complete the respondent's task (retrieval of records) had no effect on behavioral or attitudinal indicators of respondent burden.

The RDR tranformation is a linear scale conversion method but not a linear equating method in the classical sense. The transformation is used with non-parallel tests, tests which may differ in both item format and length. The goal of the transformation is not to &quot;equate&quot; for differences in test difficulty. The purpose of the RDR transformation is to convert the raw score scale from a given test so that the new scale has the same mean chance point and the same range or length as the raw score scale from a second test. The goal is to eliminate differential  guessing chance factors and unequal test lengths as competing explanations for why two test means are different (or the same). A method for transforming one of the raw score scales so that an inferential test of mean differences can be accomplished though the original raw score scales vary in mean chance score and/or length is described.

        "description":"A major deficiency in classical test theory is the reliance on Pearson product-moment (PPM) correlation concepts in the definition of reliability. PPM measures are totally insensitive to first moment differences in tests which leads to the dubious assumption of essential tan-equivalence. Robinson proposed a measure of agreement that is sensitive to different test difficulty and gives a practical statistic to estimate reliability in the presence of known form variation in difficulty. Robinson's measure of agreement appears to be a useful alternative to the generalizability coefficient, as it provides a more conservative estimate of reliability under conditions of parallel form differences in mean. This is likely to be especially useful when examining inter rater reliability when  internal consistency of the raters is poor. Robinson's measure does not seem advantageous for highly reliable parallel tests such as are encountered in standardized testing programs. A simulation study is presented to illustrate the degree of the coefficient's sensitivity to form difficulty variance. Robinson's measure of agreement and the intraclass correlation are computed for each simulation and their values are compared. (author/RL)",

The use of reading comprehension as a covariate resulted in findings substantially different from previous research or from what may be concluded from looking at obtained testwiseness scores as a dependent variable.

The Spanish component served limited English speaking children in grades K-3. The Italian component served 328 Italian dominant children in grades K-9. English dominant students participated as peer models in both components. The bilingual program was evaluated through consultant observations, interviews with program personnel, students and parents, and pupil testing. Findings indicated that both components were well-implemented. Statistical analyses of student achievement data showed that in the majority of cases there were significant positive differences between pretest and posttest scores. Observation checklists and a position paper on the  identification of students with limited proficiency in English are appended. (MK)",

A nationwide sample of nine, thirteen, and seventeen year old students was tested with a series of exercises that were developed to assess science and mathematics performance. The exercises were designed to probe both content and processes across several taxonomic levels. Findings indicated that, compared to the national average, black students as a group experienced problems in mathematics at all age levels, but these were accentuated by age seventeen. In science, a smaller overall gap in performance was found at age nine. This gap narrowed by age thirteen, but widened noticeably at age seventeen. The many tables of data included in this  report indicate particular content areas and specific taxonomic levels at which black students experience difficulty. (MK)",

The observation is presented that it is within the context of daily activities that teachers and students make judgments about themselves and others, interact and form social ties, and experience social sanctions. It is stated that the structure of activities shapes the student's exposure to particular curriculum contents, the distribution and use of resources, the pedagogical decisions that teachers make, and the excercise of teacher authority. These, it is asserted, affect what children learn. The bases for this activity structures model in other work on social organization efforts are identified. Elements of the model are specified for  different levels of schooling and the relationship between the structure of activities and other aspects of the schooling environment is described. Finally, associations are drawn between specific student outcomes and characteristic activity structures. (Author/APM)",

Eight components, all developed by the U.S. Employment Service, comprise the system. These are a guide for occupational exploration, a dictionary of occupational titles, a general aptitude test battery, an interest checklist, an interest inventory, two jobs selection workbooks, and other counselor- and counselee-oriented occupational planning materials currently under development. The system possesses two dimensions--an interest  dimension and an aptitude dimension. Interest factors identified from a factor analysis of interest inventory items were used as the common basis for developing an occupational structure consisting of 12 interest areas. An assessment tool for measuring interest in these areas was devised. Occupational analysts then subdivided occupations allocated into the broad interest groups into work groups, based on the capabilities and adaptabilities required of the worker. This permitted the establishment of occupational aptitude pattern norms to determine a counselee's aptitude for occupations in all but seven areas. (MN)",

Their strategy includes three essential elements: assist LEAs in planning and implementing career education programs, develop materials for LEAs using this experience and develop assistance strategies for ISAs to support career education program planning and implementation in LEAs, and improve ISA capabilities to provide career education technical assistance to LEAs. Six lessons were discovered that suggested a need for revision in the project approach: (1) SEAs have been ready to plan and implement statewide career education programs  only recently, (2) ISAs have not received sufficient encouragement and incentives from the state to support schools in career program development, (3) without encouragement, LEAs will not plan and implement program changes, (4) LEAs lack staff capabilities to plan and implement effective career education programs, (5) SEAs tended to rely on research and development resources developed within the state but now are open to using other resources, and (6) SEAs place high value on support from regional laboratories in planning career education initiatives.

        "description":"Growth of a human resources perspective among work institutions, mirrored by the lifelong learning perspective in educational institutions, has created an opportunity for collaboration among and within education, business, labor, and government. Barriers to such interaction between education and work include different formats for teaching and learning (emphasis on team effort in work settings, but little team teaching or learning in education) and different motivational settings. Four basic functions seem to characterize institutional relationships between education and work institutions. These are (1) learning experiences and services, (2) flow of human resources, (3) new ideas and products, and (4) strategy development. One strategy/mechanism for maintaining leadership  communication across the business-labor-education sectors over an extended period of time is the local collaborative council. Collaborative councils can be distinguished by these criteria: membership is representative of major community sectors with collaborative mechanisms intended to join and serve the interest of more than two sectors, they are self-organized and performance-oriented, they represent shared responsibility, and organizational activity is sustained through formal council organization with assistance from a staff director or coordinator.

This study empirically tested a conceptual framework that emphasizes chains of linked benefits from learning. A diagram of this framework was given to 100 adults in Toronto. They were asked to imagine that their total motivation for one of their learning projects was 10 units, and then to allocate those 10 motivational units to the appropriate locations on the diagram. Pleasing others was not as strong a motivation as enhancing pleasure and self-esteem. Benefits from using the knowledge and skill were more important than direct benefits from the learning activities themselves, or benefits from simply possessing (but not using) the knowledge and skill. Using the conceptual framework as a tool for  collecting data on motivation is suggested for further research. (Author/KC)",

These are fields in which Boston high school students generally, and minority students particularly, have been underrepresented. In this project--Technology and Science Careers for Minorities (TSCM)--the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Work in Technology and Science (MIT/WITS) group served as the catalyst for Boston public schools and local technological companies. Through workshops, site visits, career materials, and classroom programs, Boston educators from 16 schools developed knowledge about careers and their prerequisites. They also  realized that these careers represent excellent possibilities for minorities and that teachers, counselors, and administrators are in critical roles for expanding students' perceptions of career options. The publication summarizes the following aspects of the project: career awareness; educator's questions; establishing linkages; educators' workshops; student field trips; classroom speakers; materials and other services; educators' recommendations; and a summary of participants' reactions. Appendixes contain lists and tables of associates with WITS in the TSCM project; forms and letters; and materials used to link technological organizations to schools. (KC)",

This pilot project conducted at Emporia State University (Kansas) was constructed to develop a comprehensive model to recruit, counsel, and place vocational business occupations teachers, industrial education teachers, home economics teachers and coordinators in the schools of Kansas. In the project, the guidance and career services (of several state agencies) currently being used in public education were to be adapted to the university level. The project designed a model for long-term cooperative arrangement between the information, recruitment, counseling, and placement services in vocational  teacher education. The procedure used was visitations to vocational and teacher education programs at other institutions which had been identified as integrating the guidance services into teacher education activities. Secondarily was the development of the demonstration model for providing an integrated system for teacher career information, recruitment, counseling, and placement services for potential teachers. Plans for installation and initiation of the service system in the university were completed. This involved input from staff, advisory committee, and resource personnel. The system was to be installed at Emporia State University and initiated for a year-long trial period during the 1980-81 school year. (KC)",

        "description":"This study examined positive and normative policy issues in the use of educational benefits as military service enlistment incentives. A test of the attractiveness of enhancements to the Veterans' Educational Assistance Program (VEAP) has been underway since January 1979. The enhancements, called VEAP &quot;kickers,&quot; are limited to high school graduates in mental categories who enlist in the Army's combat arms or in certain of the Navy's sea-going engineering ratings. Examined from the perspective of the services, the VEAP kicker does not appear to be as attractive an enlistment incentive as might be supposed. Cash enlistment bonuses for three-year enlistees should be more cost-effective. Alternatively, eliminating the current mental category restriction of the kicker would raise  costs per recruit but should yield a much greater response of well-motivated recruits. It would also reduce the likelihood of discrimination charges being raised against the VEAP kicker program, which disproportionately disqualifies blacks and other minorities. Four recommendations for research and policy action emerge from the analysis: (1) the VEAP kicker possibly should be eliminated as a selective enlistment incentive in favor of straight enlistment bonuses; (2) if the kicker is retained, it should be offered to all high school graduate combat arms enlistees; (3) the attrition and retention of current kicker participants should be monitored; and (4) to improve the attractiveness of VEAP, interest should be paid on individual and government contributions.

At present, data deficits exist in the areas of allied health occupations labor supply and requirements, future health needs, and educational needs. Current manpower forecasting models, which vary in scope, methodology, and assumptions, tend to concentrate on single occupations, usually ignoring other health professionals who can and may be providing the same services. Deficiencies and shortcomings of allied health manpower information have discouraged any attempt to treat health care delivery as a system. This hampers development of efficient and productive  data collection procedures. Development of guidelines for well-coordinated research and data collection is essential in the areas of supply and requirements, distribution, utilization, and productivity. Enumerative, descriptive, and analytic information is needed in all four needs areas to plan and insure optimal utilization of resources.

        "description":"This study was conducted in an attempt to identify any predictor or combination of predictors of a beginning typewriting student's success. Variables of intelligence, rhythmic ability, musical background, and tapping ability were combined to study their relationship to typewriting speed and accuracy. A sample of 109 high school students was pretested using the Seashore Rhythm Test, Digit Recall Test, and the Tapping Test. The students were then posttested at the end of the first semester of instruction to obtain speed and accuracy scores from an average of three three-minute timed writings. Additionally, the motivation control variables of assignments completed and absences were introduced into the analysis. A least-square stepwise multiple regression analysis was employed to  analyze the data. The stepwise results indicate that the motivation variable, assignments completed, was the most significant factor in predicting typewriting speed. Beyond motivation, the Tapping Test had a significant zero order correlation with speed. No predictor tests used in this study were able to predict typewriting accuracy. Analysis of the data obtained supports the possibility of predicting a student's typewriting speed based on motivation and the Tapping Test, the predictor variable. (Author/KC)",

The report is the result of field work observations in 1980 in the states of Wisconsin, West Virginia, Florida, and Oklahoma and dialogue sessions conducted in these states and in Colorado, Texas, Georgia, and Kansas during the preceding year. The report identifies the legislative and environmental context  under which local vocational education planning takes place and notes context conditions which affect such planning. The context conditions serve as a background for descriptions of the nature of interagency coordinative and collaborative relationships in support of planning, for ways that data and evaluation are used in local planning, for local level planning processes, and for a discussion of selected issues in vocational education planning. Planning tools and techniques, and training materials and activities whose development can potentially improve the technology of local vocational education planning and develop the skills of persons who do this planning, are also described. Finally, procedures are presented that serve as a basis for the findings which are reported. (KC)",

It is an attempt to isolate and analyze the factors that are likely to influence the field in the 1980s and to suggest the kinds of decisions that might bring about desirable future events or conditions. By synthesizing the trends, events, and issues likely to influence vocational education in the 1980s, a standard world scenario for vocational education in 1990 and two alternative scenarios were created, using much of the data from work conducted during the first year of the project. During this second year, two main activities were carried out: a cross-impact study was conducted,  and three scenarios were developed. The cross-impact analysis attempted to estimate the effect of a given event, trend, or federal policy initiative upon federal vocational education policy initiatives. Data generated by the cross-impact study, as well as year-one data, were used to create the standard world scenario and its two variations. In general, the scenarios indicate that vocational education in this decade will probably become a more diverse enterprise with regard to the characteristics of its clients, the kinds of services it delivers, and the methods it employs to deliver its services.

Chapter 3 discusses such issues and problems in assessing employer satisfaction with the training and job performance of former vocational students as funding, variables introduced by subject selection, the self-employed graduate, time lapse between training and employer surveys, training program limitations, cost factors, advisory committees,  differences in emphasis within training institutions, sampling, employer contact, and analyzing and reporting. An overview of the differences and commonalities between employer satisfaction with training and job performance is given in chapter 4. Chapter 5 examines such steps required in designing, planning, and implementing an employer follow-up as developing study objectives, data collection methods, data analysis procedures, and writing and disseminating reports. A glossary, selected bibliography, and annotated bibliography are also provided. (A series of related handbooks on vocational education evaluation are available separately through ERIC--see note.)

It consists of eight chapters. Chapter 1 explains the rationale, development, and organization of the handbook. Chapter 2 is composed of two commissioned concept papers on the state of the art, problems, and issues of measuring training and job satisfaction. Basic evaluation considerations (identifying relevant decision makers and information users, writing study objectives, determining respondents, choosing research designs, and selecting an evaluation instrument) are discussed in chapter 3. Chapters 4-6 explain the following alternative data collection methodologies: mailed  questionnaires, interviews, and qualitative methods. Some descriptive and inferential statistics that are appropriate in analyzing and interpreting data on training and job satisfaction are examined in chapter 7. Chapter 8 explains some strategies for data presentation and utilization. A glossary, an annotated bibliography, and a selected bibliography follows.

Peer interaction is a special type of dissemination in which people with certain roles and responsibilities help others with the same or similar roles and responsibilities. This involves teachers helping teachers, principals helping principals, business representatives helping others in business and so forth. The primary purpose of this guide is to describe a regional career education peer assistance model and to share what was learned in creating the model with others wanting to use such a model. The guide is especially aimed at the following groups: (1) career education coordinators at state, intermediate, and local levels; (2) operators of multistate dissemination services such as regional exchanges  and vocational curriculum management centers; (3) state dissemination specialists, such as state facilitators, capacity-builders, and talent bank directors; and (4) representatives of labor, business, industry, and government. The guide covers the following topics: model overview; selecting the consultants; promoting the service; training the consultants; making the system work; considerations in establishing peer assistance models; and a review of the literature on peer interaction.

This paper describes the activities stimulated by these evaluation requirements and shows how evaluation results are used to revise and improve programs. However, since policy intentions--in this case, program revision and improvement--are not realized instantaneously, the paper examines a number of intervening steps in the implementation process before considering outcomes. Before the outcomes can be realized, for example, the message from Congress must be transmitted and implemented at federal, state, and local levels. Another purpose of this paper is to describe the  way in which this message was transmitted through the Office of Education to the states and finally to the local level. (KC)",

        "description":"This report is one of a series of papers presented to encourage discussion on the evaluation of important development issues. The recent emphasis within the Agency for International Development (AID) on knowing the impacts of development assistance, particularly the benefit incidence of projects and programs, makes it important to look at the impacts of assisted activities on poor women, the subgroup of the poor which has been the agency's most clearly selected target for help. Focusing on what is now known about bettering the effect of all development projects on women, the report is divided into four sections. The first section introduces the problem, explains how the evaluation conducted differs from the original proposed method of the project, and provides background  information about evaluating development projects. Section 2 reviews and analyzes the current evaluations of women in development projects sponsored by AID. It focuses on three dimensions of female participation: their role in project decision making, their direct access to benefits, and the effects of the project on their position in the family and the community. Section 3 provides an analytical framework for assessing the impact of development projects on women. It describes an approach to performing both mid-stream evaluations of the immediate social effects of ongoing projects, and ex-post evaluation of long-term impacts following project termination. Section 4 discusses methodological issues in compiling comparative data on AID projects, suggesting more flexible techniques of rapid  appraisal. A reference section is included in the publication.

Section 2 discusses planning of a public relations program, including administrative involvement, determining program directions, selection of public relations director, staff involvement,  reviewing the past, and evaluating the results. The next three sections focus on the three major target groups the facility will want to reach: (1) handicapped persons and those individuals, groups, or agencies and organizations working with them; (2) business groups (including employers); and (3) community groups. In each section subgroups within the target group are discussed, and then the messages and techniques for developing the messages relevant to the client groups are considered. (YLB)",

Chapter 1 overviews work sharing in the past and work sharing as an alternative to the problem of unemployment in the future. Chapter 2 reviews issues of work sharing. These considerations are consolidated into the categories of impacts on productivity and price stability, job creation and preservation, level of participation and aggregate employment impact, social equity and targetability, flexibility of implementation and termination, administrative costs and regulatory effectiveness, and secondary social concerns. Chapter 3 focuses on seventeen public policies designed to  redistribute existing and prospective employment opportunities through work sharing. They are grouped into four major categories: (1) subsidized worktime reductions (6 policy options), (2) limitation of worktime (5 options), (3) long term time-income trade-offs (4 options), and (4) voluntary time-income trade-off options for individuals (2 options). Chapter 4 compares work sharing options and then compares the most promising with other approaches to combatting unemployment. (YLB)",

These mechanisms are intended to ensure that health services are provided adequately and with at least a minimum degree of competence. This report is intended to enhance and broaden knowledge of health professions credentialing. It is based on information obtained from more than 40 health certifying agencies. The report is divided into six chapters. Chapter 1 introduces the concepts of licensing and certifying and provides general background for the report, while chapter 2 discusses current problems of concern to all regulators, such as personal qualification requirements for would-be practitioners, test construction and  validation techniques, and continuing competency programs. Chapter 3 focuses on current activities of licensing and certifying bodies and their regulatory activities in the various states. Chapter 4 highlights recent federal, state, and private legal challenges to regulatory practices which are alleged to restrict competition unfairly in the health sector and also includes a brief summary of important relevant concepts. Chapter 5 constitutes a minor feasibility study to identify areas of jurisdictional overlap between health occupations and suggests the extent to which scopes of practice could be modified. Finally, chapter 6 points to significant trends and indicates possible areas for further inquiry. (KC)",

Psychological stress research performed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) from 1971 to 1976 is reviewed first, with an emphasis on defining high-risk work groups and isolating specific sources of stress in the work environment which may influence worker health. Other presentations include an examination of the relationships between coronary heart disease and machine-pacing with occupational stress; a discussion of the rise of worker compensation claims based on cumulative injury, which includes stress-related diseases; discussions of issues bearing upon the establishment of  work-based programs to deal more effectively with occupational stress/strain, including the necessary steps to be taken by a consultant in setting up a corporate stress awareness program; and a description of an active, in-house employee assistance program amenable to including stress management. Both a socio-technical approach to dealing with stress in large organizations and a union-management collaborative program on occupational health are described.

        "description":"This monograph is one in a series designed to report, in narrative form, discussions that took place during a series of mini-conferences for local K-12 career education coordinators on the subject of staff development in career education. The monograph covers two broad concerns: the substance of staff development in career education; and how staff development in career education is being carried on in selected K-12 school systems across the United States. The coverage of each of these questions is broken down into five broad topics: the need for and the nature of career education; occupations and society; the process of career development; availability and use of community resources; and infusing career education into the teaching/learning process. The views of the conference  participants on each of these topics are synthesized, followed by a section of examples of programs under the topics which are working in various school systems. A list of conference participants is included in the publication. (KC)",

        "description":"Intended for state prison administrators and their vocational and educational staff, community-based organizations, and women's employment project seeking better programming for female offenders, this publication covers three aspects of the Women Offender Apprenticeship Program. Part 1 discusses development of this program for women in the federal prison system to learn skills in well paid, nontraditional fields. Topics include program design, functioning of the Women Offender Apprenticeship Committee, and site-visits to apprenticeship programs at two co-correctional and two all-female institutions. Part 2 focuses on the Alderson Consultation for State Prison Administrators, selected as the means to acquaint participants with the apprenticeship system and demonstrate how the  program worked and was developed. It describes participants, agenda, and components of a successful program. Part 3 is a step-by-step guide to developing a women offender apprenticeship program. Sections cover (1) preliminary research to determine feasibility, (2) making the decision (benefits and costs), (3) gearing up for action (organizing a Joint Apprenticeship Committee, defining committee responsibilities, developing trade standards, sending standards for review, writing up work processes, promotion), (4) selecting apprentices, (5) program operation, and (6) setting up support systems. Appendixes include Standards of Apprenticeship at Alderson and sources of information and assistance. (YLB)",

Section 1 discusses reasons for concern regarding youth unemployment. In section 2 are related normal as well as harmful experiences due to labor market outcomes. Section 3 discusses the interpretation of existing concepts and measures of youth employment patterns in terms of serious versus minor problems. Causes of youth unemployment are examined in section 4 from several perspectives. Four sections focus on (1) reasons for unemployment rate differences between youth and adults, (2) factors influencing changes over time and differences across geographic areas in youth  employment patterns, (3) the changing patterns of racial differences in employment, and (4) summarizing the explanations of the youth employment problem. Section 5 presents some estimates of the numbers of youth who encounter serious employment problems using four methods. Twenty-one data tables are appended. (YLB)",

The first section reports on the economic roles of women in the U.S. as their participation in the labor force reached historically high levels during the last half of the 1970s. The employment status is detailed for such selected subgroups of the women's labor force as working mothers and wives, women who maintain families, Hispanic women, and Black women. Segregation is also addressed. Section 2 presents an analysis of policy developments and issues relevant to the World Plan of Action. It discusses measures and programs to reduce discrimination in employment as well as policies affecting the opportunities  and economic regards for women who have changing and multiple roles. The final section highlights the initiatives of voluntary, nongovernmental organizations. Examples include training and employment programs to integrate women in the work force, efforts to eliminate obstacles to women's employment, increasing women's participation in trade unions, social secutity and other retirement income, and entrepreneurship.

        "description":"Innovations in training technology must be transferred from the researcher to the user to be effective. This system concept paper presents a framework for the establishment of an Army training technology transfer program, as well as suggestions to improve the acceptance and use of training research products. Training technology transfer is defined as the process by which research results become implements of useful change in operational training. The user can be civilian or military, functionally involved at levels from high-level review to the trainer in the field. The systems model developed here uses a linear approach to describe the four steps of technology transfer in the Army: (1) analysis of requirements; (2) research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) of  solutions; (3) dissemination of findings; and (4) institutionalization. Within these steps, specific issues include assessment of military needs, consideration of the appropriateness of current RDT&amp;E funding, user acceptance of new products, and the transition from innovation to policy; as well as prediction methodology and recommendations for ongoing monitoring, evaluation, and feedback. Recurring throughout the transfer process are issues of sponsorship and the self-renewal capability of the research product. A bibliography on training transfer is organized in terms of specific activities within the model. (Author/KC)",

While both programs attempt to provide a broad overview of the areas commonly covered in family life education courses, the junior high program tends to focus more on the issue of self-esteem, while the senior high programs focuses more on problem solving and decision making. Topics of the junior high program sessions are an introduction to self-esteem, listening and communicating, sex roles, adolescent growth and development, pregnancy and birth, decision making, birth control and parenting, and pregnancy  alternatives and venereal disease. Session topics for the senior high program include reproductive anatomy and physiology, sex roles, decision making within relationships, venereal disease and communication, pregnancy and birth, teen parenting, pregnancy alternatives and birth control.

The review was based on two waves of site visits to a total of 19 prime sponsors, in May-June, 1979, and in November-January, 1979-80. From the data gathered, most of the knowledge development activity was found to be at an early stage of development, or else it was not developed at all. In many cases, the evaluators found that sponsors lacked any clear conception of what knowledge development was supposed to be; activity of one sort or another was aimed at satisfying what seemed to both regional staff and state and local prime sponsors an extremely nebulous goal. Despite  limited progress, however, the average prime sponsor was found to be interested in learning more about its youth programs so that they could be improved, and would welcome advice, examples, and technical assistance in any form in which it might be offered. It was recommended that (1) some firm definition of knowledge development as applicable to youth programs at the state and local level be provided; (2) that prime sponsors be given help in designing evaluation plans that are within the realm of accomplishment and that may reasonably be expected to provide knowledge useful to them; and (3) that technical assistance be provided to the prime sponsors.

Chapter 1 briefly discusses efforts to redefine the mission of the academic professions so they prepare students for non-academic careers and obtain information on education and work. It closes with a plan to create a Confederation of Academic Professions to provide technical assistance. Chapter 2 describes networking by which Ph.D.s in nonacademic employment and employers combine with universities to collaborate in preparation of Ph.D.s for nonacademic employment. Efforts by academic professions and  institutions to locate and place able Ph.D.s are detailed. Chapter 3 addresses developing a career development program for faculty. A pilot effort to offer all faculty career education options is reviewed that includes internships in other university units or in nonacademic employment. Chapter 4 proposes a coalition of employers and universities to recruit talent and to work with students to integrate education and work. The proposal suggests building on the competency-based education movement to encourage students to engage in voluntary assessments preceding graduate education to provide direction for career planning.

The surge in women's employment is linked to more delayed marriage, divorce, separation, women's increased education, lower fertility, rapid growth in clerical and service jobs, inflation, and changed attitudes toward &quot;women's place.&quot; Employment has risen fastest among married women, especially married mothers of children under six. Some 44% of employed women work full-time, year-round, but average $6 for every $10 earned by men working that same amount. This is partly because most women remain segregated in low-paying &quot;women's jobs.&quot; Working wives were spending six times more time on housework than married men in 1975, and working mothers of preschool children are hampered by a lack of day-care  facilities. Equal employment opportunity and affirmative action have improved the climate for working women but not as much as for minorities. Federal income tax and social security systems still discriminate against two-earner families. Women's position in the labor force should improve with the inroads women are making in some male-dominated occupations and gains in job experience and seniority among younger women who now tend to stay in the labor force through the years of childbearing and early child-rearing.

It had three goals: (1) design and develop a comprehensive planning system for states to select strategies for planning the delivery of vocational education services, (2) train state personnel for system implementation, and (3) provide for continued United States Office of Education assistance to state planning efforts. The Vocational Education for Special Populations (E.S.P.) Planning System was designed to parallel the conceptual model of planning described by the Management Evaluation Review for Quality. Development of the system involved special population procedure identification, assessment of state of the art, development of preliminary system  documentation, and field test of the E.S.P. program. The system was disseminated through three regional workshops. Other activities included a follow-up evaluation, preparation of guidelines for technical assistance, and development of final supportive materials. Major products were a two-volume state-of-the-art report, the Vocational E.S.P. Planning System, E.S.P. sound filmstrip, and report containing the guidelines.

The first paper suggests techniques by which school administrators can identify barriers to vocational education programs faced by handicapped persons. Sixteen techniques are described and their strengths and weaknesses discussed. The second paper identifies and describes group techniques for generating strategies to overcome barriers to vocational education for the handicapped. Five techniques are described in detail and their strengths and weaknesses considered. The third paper identifies procedures for use in estimating costs and allocating  resources within the context of the legal and policy directives of the Vocational Education Amendments, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and P. L. 94-142. Primary focus is on costing and resource allocation to remove barriers to program accessibility. The fourth paper identifies and discusses federal guideline documents available to local school administrators in addressing accessibility. (YLB)",

It also describes noteworthy recruitment and selection strategies and techniques suitable for adaptation in local schools. Section 1 is an introduction. In the second section the five phases of the largely theoretical schema are described. These processes are planning, recruitment, selection, instruction, and evaluation (post-school student activities). Section 3 examines recruitment and selection strategies and techniques and extends the discussion of the rationale for these two activities begun in the previous section. Annotations of three handbooks/manuals directly  addressing recruitment of students for vocational education programs are provided, and some documented recruitment strategies and methods are highlighted. Critical issues in the design of a selection strategy are discussed, including roles of vocational appraisal and choosing appropriate selection instruments and method. A listing is appended of test instruments accompanied by author(s) and/or publisher and summary of content/usability. Six categories of instruments are provided: Achievement Batteries, Aptitude Measures, Measures of Career Development/Planning, Interest Inventories, Personality Measures, and Miscellaneous. (YLB)",

The exploratory phase of the study involved an investigation of the definitions and processes of vocational education student recruitment and selection. It included literature reviews, an experience survey of vocational counselors and advisors in Indiana's secondary and postsecondary schools, and a survey and analysis of exemplary state practices. The descriptive phase of the study addressed prevailing practices and opinions concerning vocational education student recruitment and selection in Indiana. A mail survey instrument was administered to all of Indiana's area vocational technical schools  and the thirteen regional campuses of the Indiana Vocational Technical College System. Data from the two phases, combined with information from literature reviews, were incorporated in the design and development of a schema for recruitment and selection of vocational education students.

Summative evaluation addressed  the nature of changes in career education activity brought about by the project. The report is organized into sections as follows: a project summary is provided in the first section; formative evaluation results bearing on consultant training, awareness efforts, assistance efforts, and project management are presented in sections 2 through 5; the sixth section describes summative evaluation findings; and the seventh and final section provides a summary of the conclusions and recommendations.

        "description":"Past research has suggested that reliance upon implicit theories may depend upon the ambiguity or salience of provided cues. Previously unexplored factors were investigated to further an understanding of implicit theories related to group processes, by: (1) utilizing a no feedback control group in addition to high and low feedback groups; (2) measuring actual and questionnaire effects for a second task subsequent to feedback; and (3) utilizing group interaction ratings by both independent observers and subjects. Results from a laboratory experiment involving 143 subjects in 2 tasks, with feedback after the first task, supported the concept of implicit theories of performance and their effect on survey responses; however, the process by which the theories operated appeared to be  much more complex than past research had suggested. Implicit theories of performance seemed to operate only under certain conditions and for limited periods of time, i.e., when performance cues were strong and little additional information was available, their effects on subsequent task behavior and related surveys were minimal. Immediately after feedback, observer ratings of interaction and feedback condition shared the explained variance for subject ratings of interaction. Following another task, observer ratings were better predictors of subject ratings. (Author/NRB)",

The joint effects of teachers' expectations about students and students' expectations about teachers on the performance and attitudes of both participants was examined. Subjects were 120 female undergraduates. Half of the subjects were designated as teachers and were led to expect either a high- or low-ability student. The other half, acting as students, were led to expect a teacher of high or low competence. Teachers and students were randomly paired in an experimental teaching session. Results showed that student performance was a function of the teachers' expectation. Teachers'  attitudes and rated competence were affected by their expectations regarding the student, and students' attitudes were affected by their expectations about the teacher. Results indicated that both teachers and students can concurrently hold expectations about their partner, and that such expectations affect their attitudes about themselves, the partner, and the entire teaching situation.

From an initial sample of 251 women who participated in a reassessment series conducted between 1973 and 1977, 24 women who had chosen to reenter college or initiate careers were selected for follow-up interviews. Women (N=12) who had divorced were matched with 12 women with intact marriages. The sample was further stratified by age cohorts of 30-, 40-, and 50-year olds. In-depth structured interviews and conversational aids were used to explore changes in the subjects' lives, the effects on marital and familial relationships, and the coping strategies which evolved for dealing with relationship stresses. Husbands of the intact marriage group were also interviewed. Variations in  communication, accommodation, support, and acceptance of change were identified as factors important to marriage survival. The survival of the marriage after the wife's college or career reentry, regardless of motivations, appeared primarily dependent on the husband. (Author/NRB)",

Data indicated that life change had occurred for 80% of the participants and that 57% had enrolled in college. The age group most likely to enroll was between ages 30 and 45. The point at which children entered school seemed to be a very crucial time for the participants to make changes. Most subjects felt the series had given them encouragement to enter college and help in goal clarification. Results suggest that individual experiences coupled with participant's  suggestions and feedback can be used to design an ideal reassessment plan. (Author/NRB)",

        "description":"Many middle-aged children care for their aging parents, i.e., they both care for and care about the parent(s). The emotional and cognitive responses of middle-aged children to their aged parents or parents-in-law were examined through interviews with 51 middle-aged adults. Responses were analyzed to determine the level, type and range of concerns respondents had regarding the well-being of their aged parents and the burden of parent-caring. Most respondents displayed a high overall level of concern. Women were more likely than men to display concern at higher levels; respondents sharing a home with a parent were more likely than respondents from different households to display higher levels of concern. Type of concern varied somewhat according to sex of respondent and living  arrangements. Very few respondents indicated any burdens associated with parent-caring. Findings indicated that parent-caring may better prepare a child for his own old age and, consequently, his ability to adapt to aging may be strengthened. Findings also illustrate the need for programs to educate the middle-aged child about the nature of old age, the care required by aged parents, and the appropriate strategy for obtaining assistance.

Consistent and conflicting positions from other authorities are included, and specific recommendations for implementation are offered. The chapter on Prevention Function includes a definition of delinquency prevention and 37 prevention strategies. The Administration Function chapter contains standards on the role of local, state, and federal government levels in the juvenile service system; the Intervention Function  chapter provides criteria and guidelines for intervention by public officials. The Adjudication Function chapter recommends the establishment of a family court; the Supervision Function chapter is directed to agencies supervising juveniles and families subject to the jurisdiction of the family court. The sixth chapter presents a general implementation plan outlining criteria for assessing the various available implementation mechanisms, and two implementation strategies which appear to meet those criteria.

High school students' life plans and the relationship of some antecedent factors to homemaking and career commitment were explored. Subjects (N=854), 9th and 12th grade students, completed questionnaires containing items and factors taken from several longer questionnaires investigating life plans, career motivation, self-concept, and context measures. Data indicated that girls chose as equally high educational goals as boys, and chose higher level realistic goals. A strong relationship was found between being Expressive and career commitment for both sexes, with a weaker, but significant, relationship between being Instrumental and career commitment.  Girls and boys equally endorsed statements which indicated that career planning was a top priority. Boys did not differ from girls in their endorsement of a life plan which indicated equal sharing of the parent role, although the homemaking commitment was significantly higher for girls than boys. Change in social role expectations for boys was reflected in the positive relationships between the homemaking and career scales. (Author/NRB)",

        "description":"As women enter nontraditional occupations and training programs, tokenism may develop and its side-effects of visibility, contrast, and assimilation may appear. Each of these effects was encountered by the first class of women cadets at the United States Military Academy, West Point, in 1976, who received great visibility from the news media. This visibility led to fears and resentment in dominant male cadets and placed performance pressures on the token women. Cadets' concerns about dating best reflected the effects of contrast; the social interaction of men and women created uncertainties for the men and isolation for the women. The stereotype of women's physical subordination encouraged men to simultaneously protect women, yet fear preferential treatment and a lowering of  Academy standards. The protection of female cadets most clearly demonstrated the assimilation of individual cadets into the stereotypical helpless role of women. An investigation of the men and women who entered West Point from 1976 to 1980 showed that increased numbers of women, institutional supports, changes in the dominant group, and cohesivess among tokens reduced the problems initially experienced by the token women.

Increasingly, conflict is viewed as a central characteristic of family life. The social conflict framework can be used to study both social phenomena associated with the family as well as levels of family analysis: intra-individual role conflict, conflicts between family members, different groups within a social stratification, family units and external groups, and the family institution and other segments of society. A single conflict event can be conceptualized in terms of the issue, actors, interaction processes, relational context, cultural context, physical setting, and consequences.  The social conflict approach emphasizes a basic social force heretofore largely neglected in family sociology. (NRB)",

Persons (N=940) 60 years of age and older were interviewed about their socio-environmental setting. From the enumeration of their relatives, respondents identified those with whom they were very close. Asymmetry of gender was prevalent in confidant relationships with children and siblings. Females were more constrained by asymmetry of gender; asymmetry restraints were strongest for the never-married and weakest for widows and widowers. Females were most likely to be confidant relatives in all cases. Although findings revealed greater reliance for confidant relations among the  family of procreation than among the family of orientation, siblings compensated for the absence of children and spouses. Support for the continued strength of relations with siblings during advanced age was also found. Relationships of the young-old with their old-old parents appeared less close than with their children. (Author/NRB)",

In the preparation stage, organizational consultants must deal with resistance by creating conditions for the consideration of the effects of change. Consultants must help organizations to develop structures to facilitate diagnosis and change, and to build an understanding of the change process after initial diagnosis. Occasionally, significant intervention and change are needed prior to diagnosis, including some conditions in which: (1) diagnostic methods are unfamiliar; (2) individuals most affected by change do not normally interact in problem-solving; (3) the  objective of the change process require changes in the organizational structure and process; (4) the organization is \"underbounded\"; and (5) intergroup conflict exists.

Changes in the project class over the past 10 years are reviewed and the current class structure is presented in which students meet in small heterogeneous groups for 2 hours each week over a 10 week period. A laboratory learning environment is detailed in which students learn effective communication skills, assertion, and academic goal classification, and profit  from specific experiences in goal setting, time management, and decision making. Findings from evaluations of the program are reviewed, indicating the students' improved scores on self-concept measures, study habits measures, and grade point averages.

In the doctor- patient model, a consultant diagnoses an implied need and suggests remediation. A third approach, process consultation, recognizes the value of the clients' expertise in consultation. Approaches to consultation intervention employed by a con- sultant are: acceptant, catalytic, confrontive, prescriptive, or theoretical. Consultants must have a specific area of knowledge, certain emotional characteristics, and many skills to be successful. In the Division of Research of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, consultants are utilized as: (1) scientific and technical reviewers of grant proposals and contractual  proposals; (2) participants on the National Advisory Council on Drug Abuse; (3) members of the Contractual Consultant Services; (4) consultants for the Technical Review/Research Analysis and Utilization System; and (5) consultants for the Division of Research Staff. In accordance with current theories, these consultant roles usually follow the purchase model, using prescriptive intervention with consultants possessing knowledge about a specific area. However, these consultants are task-oriented rather than problem-oriented, and their services are often provided indirectly through contractors rather than directly to the agency. (NRB)",

Residents (N=285) and residence life staff (N=18) randomly selected from three residence centers completed interviews or evaluation questionnaires. Results showed that, although study conditions in the halls were reported as satisfactory,  students who earned higher grades studied more and at different locations than their rooms. Many residents were uncertain as to whether residence life staff and programs could or should influence certain dimensions of their learning disposition. Many students did not appear interested in expending the effort to increase their functioning along many of the dimensions although the behaviors were considered important. The majority of residents reported that activities related to the learning disposition dimensions and increased study time were not appropriate foci for residence life staff. (NRB)",

Beyer's \"hamburger writing\" procedure for the development of composition skills formed the basis of a teaching technique that provided students with problem solving tasks, a procedure for writing compositions, and exposure to a classic adolescent novel within a limited time. The technique was used with 22 seventh and eighth grade students enrolled in a summer enrichment program that lasted only four weeks. The technique was used in conjunction with the novel, \"The Day No Pigs Would Die,\" by R. N. Peck. The teacher introduced the novel by reading the title, showing the book cover, and sharing her impressions of the work. She next read the first chapter aloud and  conducted a class discussion about the main idea, setting, supporting details, characters, and conflicts. Eleven chapters were assigned for silent reading by groups composed of two students each, with the teacher reading the next chapter aloud, and all of the students reading the concluding two chapters silently. Next, the groups shared their synopses of each chapter as the class discussed them. The teacher then introduced \"hamburger writing\" (in which paragraph parts are identified with parts of a hamburger) and students wrote two-paragraph compositions using the technique. Both the teacher and the students favorably evaluated the technique. (FL)",

Twenty-four kindergarten children and 24 three-year-old children at a day care center were randomly assigned to three groups. Three times a week for four weeks, each child in each group was read a book in a one-to-one situation. Those children in the first group received the &quot;active&quot; treatment, with the reader pointing to the text and commenting about it. Children in the second group received the &quot;passive&quot; treatment, with the reader indicating the text but making no comments about it. The children in the third group served as a control, with the reader neither pointing to the text nor commenting on it. After the four-week treatment period, all  children were tested for their concepts of reading and print. The results suggested that small amounts of directed attention to print and to the reading act over an extended period of time could help a young child form an accurate concept of reading--one that includes the understanding that people read words.

        "description":"A project was organized to understand and identify basic variations in reading ability by its information processing components. Focusing on three major processing levels in reading--word analysis, discourse analysis, and integration of word/discourse analysis--preliminary research identified perceptual and cognitive skill components of reading and formulated techniques for measuring those skills. Based on data from 48 high school students, the measurements and statistical analyses ultimately focused on eight basic components of reading: letter encoding, multiletter encoding, phonemic translation, lexical access, use of context, predictive extrapolation of a discourse representation, sensitivity to topicality in text, and semantic integration of antecedents within a discourse  representation. Factor analysis evaluating the model established the relationship of the reading components to conventional reading tests and to other cognitive abilities. Research then was directed at developing a causal model for the interactions among the reading components, yielding a number of alternative interactive theories. The proposed independent effect of automaticity at the word analysis level on discourse processing components was interpreted as supporting a resource sharing model for process interaction. (Sections of this report describe the general theoretical framework of the project, the structural models and the analysis of covariance structures, the componential analysis of reading skills, analysis of component interactions, and the examination of the reading ability  construct.)

Nine paragraphs from the discussion sections of articles on hypertension were taken from each of the journals. When these paragraphs were evaluated by nine people who had little or no prior experience in reading medical journals and ten people who had read medical journals frequently, 14 of the 19 readers indicated that the British paragraphs were easier to read. Further analyses of the sentences and paragraphs showed that the British prose tended to have fewer words before the first subject of the first main clause, fewer words before the first full verb in the first main  clause, less use of passives (and fewer &quot;reversible&quot; passives), nominalizations of verbs that were more easily understood and repeated more frequently, and nominalization constructions whose agents were more obvious than those in the American prose. The stylistic difference that was considered most important was the &quot;web of sentence topics&quot; in the paragraphs. Of the 57 topics in British paragraphs, only eight were unrelated to previous topics or information stressed in the immediately preceding sentences. In contrast, the American prose contained 28 unrelated topics within the 64 topics used in the paragraphs. (RL)",

One hundred eight kindergarten children were divided into high, medium, and low I.Q. ranges and each range group was further divided--one group for each of three testing methods at each intelligence level. A list of words including 25 random verbs was presented in three instructional methods. The phonic method consisted of individual letter-sound presentations. In the kinesthetic method, the teacher and child together traced each word using the index finger, with the child saying the word while tracing it. In the meaningful context method, a sentence or phrase containing the word was printed on the back of a card. The word was spoken by the teacher, then the sentence was  read, with particular emphasis on the specific word. Each child was asked to identify the words presented at the end of instruction on the first and second day. On the third day, each child was asked to identify the words for a delayed recall score. The results of the study, unlike earlier studies, indicated that verbs were not more difficult to learn than other words. No one instructional method proved more effective than another in learning, regardless of the intelligence levels of the children. (HTH)",

The subjects were 104 first grade students and 104 fourth, fifth, and sixth grade students. The design consisted of two levels each of age (younger or older), strategy (pictures or no pictures), the contextual relationship of distractor and test question (related or unrelated), and item type (explicit or implicit). Students in the experimental group were shown pictures while hearing tape recorded sentences. The pictures displayed all sentence information except that which would later become a multiple choice  distractor. Students in the control group heard the sentences but did not see pictures. All subjects were given a multiple choice recognition test concerning the content of the sentences. The results indicated that pictures had a strong, positive effect on learning for both younger and older subjects--even when there was potential interference from related materials. The findings support the notion that pictures enhance the distinctiveness of target information rather than increasing the likelihood of confusing the information with distractors.

An unrelated knowledge group heard and mastered a passage unrelated to the target materials on one day and performed the same tasks as the prior knowledge group on the next day.

The results showed that both the accessibility (free recall) and the availability (probe questions) of information by the fourth grade subjects were affected by prior knowledge.

In the first experiment, the effect of differing proportions of rare-word substitutions were examined in 79 sixth grade students. It was found that a high rate of difficult vocabulary (one substance word in three) was required before reliable effects on comprehension were evident. In the second experiment, difficult vocabulary was placed in important text elements in one form of the passages, and in unimportant elements of another form of the passages that 71 sixth grade students read. These two forms were contrasted with easy vocabulary forms in their effects on three comprehension measures (total recall, summarization, and  sentence recognition). Only on the summary measure was there an overall effect for difficult vocabulary in important elements. These experimental results may be explained by the &quot;minimum effort principle&quot; in reading. That is, a reader will avoid deep processing of difficult or unfamiliar words as much as possible, without loss of the main themes of the passage being read. The &quot;minimum effort principle&quot; also would predict that the presence of difficult words in important propositions would result in substantial losses at the point of comprehension. (RL)",

The students were selected from a public school enrichment program and randomly assigned to one of two groups that met for five weekly sessions. The control group was given traditional tasks (observe a picture, hear a passage read, or read a passage, then answer primarily recall-type questions), with the additional task of recording their number of correct answers. The experimental group experienced a combination teaching strategy that included: (1) a personal graph on which students recorded the types of questions they asked or answered; (2) explanations of four question categories--recall, think  critically, think creatively, and evaluate; (3) focused teacher preparation of questions; (4) student initiated questions; (5) plateaus strategy (based on R. T. Hyman's strategic questioning concept); and (6) emphasis on process rather than on number of correct answers. Pretest and posttest scores on the Ross Test of Higher Cognitive Processes demonstrated that the higher cognitive processes used by the experimental students improved in the areas of sequencing and questioning strategies.

The preferred position doctrine provides adequate safeguards for both speech and press guarantees if it is carefully applied by the courts. This is true because the doctrine reflects more than its original emphasis upon elimination of the presumption of constitutionality employed during the 1940s. Not only does the doctrine have strong historical underpinnings, but its premises are applicable, individually or in tandom with other judicial doctrines, in a wide range of contexts. The doctrine also tends to place the courts in a more  active role in protecting freedom of expression. While the preferred position approach may not give the absolute answers sought by the strict constructionists, it does supply standards for judicial judgments that would be more acceptable to first amendment libertarians than the balancing-of-interests approach presently being used by the Supreme Court.

The report builds an argument toward the conclusion that the assembly line model of secondary education is failing many students in basic ways, and that &quot;authenticity&quot;--one of Camus' philosophical watchwords--in the teaching of composition can enable teachers to engage the subjectivity of students who would otherwise become disaffected with learning. Sections of the report discuss a rationale for subjective research by high school teachers,  why high schools are environments conducive to existential questions, the theoretical background of existentialism and its relationship to education, high school existentialists, the existentialist as teacher, the existentialist as student, and existential English lesson plans.

Stockton's basic writing courses are staffed with volunteer faculty members from across the college. These &quot;rotating faculty&quot; go through three stages of training. In the first stage, faculty members are given a set of reading materials that discuss the nature and function of writing and various writing pedagogies. In the second stage, they participate in a one-day workshop in which they complete a  holistic exercise that involves reading papers and ranking them by the overall quality of writing. The holistic scoring used in the workshop session provides the &quot;rotating faculty&quot; with an understanding of the elements of good writing. The third stage of training occurs in another one-day workshop the week before school begins, during which the faculty members must write under the same circumstances that students often must write under. Strategies for grading are also discussed. Support services for the &quot;rotating faculty&quot; include a skills center and designated consultants from the core writing faculty. (HTH)",

Based on the literature review, two conclusions were offered concerning the complexity-quality relationship. First, neither T-unit length nor clause length is a good predictor of writing quality. Second, although sentence-combining studies sometimes  seem to improve writing quality, the improvement is probably due to factors other than increases in T-unit and clause length. (RL)",

Context, or the setting in which writing actually takes place, may be the most enabling circumstance. Many first grade teachers believe their students cannot write or even spell. However, observations of first grade classrooms, as well as those of other grades where students have written considerably, have shown that teachers--by examing their own writing processes, by writing and sharing their writing with their students, by allowing students to generate their own topics based on experience, and by realizing that there is never just one thing that changes or improves a student's writing--can create enabling  circumstances for young writers. Teachers can begin to understand how their own composing process works and become sensitive to what fosters composing and what inhibits it. They can become models who engage in all of the activities in which the class engages. Studying what these teachers do and how they do it poses a challenge to traditional writing research. Collected writing samples and pretests and posttests are not sufficient to understand how writers develop. Researchers need to be more sensitive to learning and writing contexts. (HTH)",

The goal of these writing assignments was to give students who had solved most of their mechanical writing problems a chance to explore their own experiences and achieve an active command in a particular subject area while polishing their writing skills. Each assignment had a cycle of four activities designed to involve students in increasingly complex writing tasks. The four stages of each writing assignment were as follows: (1) a free writing activity in which students would &quot;brainstorm&quot; their subject area; (2) a focused, structured paragraph of 12 to 15 sentences  on the topic, again depending exclusively on personal experience; (3) a structured essay of five to six paragraphs, designed for a general audience, that added support to the personal-experience material with information from the popular media; and (4) a structured report intended for a specialized audience and supported with information from professional books and journals as well as from the popular media and personal experience. The cycle was used in four writing assignments throughout a semester and combined with additional instruction on rhetoric, writing mechanics, and research methodology. (RL)",

Two teachers each taught a control group (traditional instruction) and an experimental group (instruction focusing on 11 cohesive ties). The results of the study were as follows: (1) there was a positive correlation between the number of types of cohesive ties and the holistic quality ratings of the papers; (2) differences in cohesion were not related  to the mode of the assignment; (3) differences between pretest and posttest scores were not large enough to be significant, though differences between pretest and posttest means showed statistical significance when the experimental groups were compared with the control groups; (4) treatment, teacher, and mode made no significant differences alone, although the effect of the teacher neared significance for holistic scores, and (5) teacher-treatment group interactions caused significant differences in both cohesive ties and holistic gains, though they accounted for only a small part of the total difference.

        "description":"Designed initially as a way of understanding the often anomalous rhetoric of movement leaders, the Requirements-Problems-Strategies (RPS) framework for analyzing the rhetoric of social movements has been applied in recent years to analyses of other collective rhetoric and leadership roles in collectivities. RPS has also been used in conjunction with other communication theories (particularly K. Burke's pentad) to identify and account for the patterns of rhetoric unique to particular movements and the events in the life of a movement. Emphasized by the RPS approach are the cross pressures and constraints that inhere in the organizational roles of leaders of collectivities. The studies used to illustrate RPS include the following: (1) E. W. Mechling's study of 1960s free clinics  and the creation of a theory of the rhetoric of counterinstitutional movement organizations (CIMOs), (2) L. M. Griffin's model of the stages of development in a social movement and the history of a movement's rhetoric, (3) G. Shive's study of rhetoric during a transitional period in a movement's history (the Chinese Communists during their United Front period from 1935 to 1942, for example), and (4) K. Reynolds's study of patterns of rhetorical invention, which focused on the ideological rhetoric of ordained Catholic revolutionaries in Latin America. (RL)",

Major findings supported the generalizability of the results revealed in the earlier research. The role of superior/subordinate relations and their impact on employee satisfaction were examined through perceptions of employees with regard to the MCS of upper management and the task behaviors of their immediate superiors. The results supported the MCS conceptualization advanced in the earlier study and indicated that the MCS of immediate superiors and of upper management had their primary impact on different dimensions of employee satisfaction.  Perceptions of superiors' task behaviors were found to have different impact on employee satisfaction for different organizational contexts. The variability in employee satisfaction predictable from individual employee differences and from superior/subordinate interaction was found to have little overlap. (Author/FL)",

        "description":"For praise to have a positive effect on a child's achievement, teachers must be aware of some important research findings. Varying results of early studies on the benefits of praise still indicate one generalization: either praise or criticism is more effective in reinforcing student achievement than is ignoring achievement. Research in the past two decades has indicated more consistently that positive verbal reinforcement leads to improved achievement. Some educators, however, still hold that praise can be a threat for a child rather than a reward. For example, praise that does not fit a child's self-image can trigger a negative goal-setting process. Praise results in improved achievement only when it is congruent with student needs. Researchers are examining the relationship  between praise and behavior, with studies indicating that praise reinforces appropriate classroom behavior and inappropriate behavior can best be controlled by ignoring it rather than punishing it. A study of motivation and praise suggests that students are intrinsically motivated when they engage in behavior because the behavior itself is rewarding. Adding extrinsic reinforcement to an already interesting task does not increase motivation but may instead cause a student to lose interest. However, praise may not be detrimental to intrinsic motivation if it is used to invite a response from the child. (HTH)",

Seventy-two college students participated in the study. Each was administered a measure of communication apprehension and then asked to play the \"prisoner's dilemma game,\" which is designed to measure the degree of a subject's cooperation/competitiveness. The results showed that a higher number of communications between game participants and their partners was related with more cooperative behavior.

The first half of the paper characterizes the objectivist and subjectivist views of how knowledge is acquired and the forms of inquiry to which these views have led. The remainder of the paper demonstrates the role that the \"interesting question\" (one for which the answer promises to have significant impact on understanding how particular sets of phenomena are related) has played in contributing to advances in knowledge. Some cases are examined in which the role of the interesting question has led to important and useful discoveries. The cases examined include (1) John Snow's solution to the cholera problem in nineteenth century England, (2) the discovery of penicillin, (3) the development of  the thoery of atomic structure in chemistry, (4) Claude Bernard's discovery that the body produces its own sugar, and (5) Charles Darwin's work on evolution.

Other than attempting to convince his audience that his policies had been and would be successful and that Reagan's policies would be disastrous, Carter's major persuasive emphasis was to convince his audience that Reagan was impractical and irresponsible. He linked the values of efficiency, practicality, and pragmatism with external conformity, the latter implying that Reagan would upset the tone of American society. Reagan also strongly appealed to the values of efficiency, practicality, pragmatism, achievement, and success, but external conformity was not his  basic strategy. The major premises underlying Reagan's arguments were appeals to material comfort and Puritan and pioneer morality. He also appealed more strongly to Americans' aversion to governmental restraints. According to numerous public opinion polls, Reagan won the debate. It is possible that Reagan aimed his arguments at more salient values than did Carter, particularly material comfort and rejection of government authority. It is possible that Carter did more harm than good by appealing to external conformity before an audience that, while commonly accepting standards, still prizes individualism. (HTH)",

Project MITT looked at school decision issues and their control structures, and at the people making or being governed by those decisions, to test how types of school decisions are related to types of control structures. Data came from two sets of interviews with principals and teachers at 14 experimental and 13 control schools. The paper lists the questions asked about each of 21 decision issues, their associated types of evidence, and the decision-makers and -followers involved. Further, the paper identifies five types of control structures and shows how the schools were scored on control structure for each of the 21  decision issues. Further analysis grouped the 21 issues, through multidimensional scaling and internal analysis, into 13 decision areas clustered into three general task areas. Finally, schools and control structures were scored for these decision areas and task areas. The author concludes with a short discussion of the correlations of these scores with external factors and compares these correlations for the experimental and control schools. (RW)",

Project MITT examined governance and work structures for five time periods from 1974 to 1976 in 29 elementary schools, 16 of which had introduced team-teaching (or unitized) methods in 1974. To analyze longitudinal changes among variables and schools, the project's statistical techniques had to take account of small sample size and multiple time periods; they also had to control for pre-1974 differences among the schools, changes in variables because of unitization, and differences in variable  means and ranges. All of these factors interfered with comparisons of unitized and nonunitized schools and distorted relationships among the variables. Hierarchical multiple linear regression solved these problems by relating variables to one another both over time and in order of explanatory power. Path analysis using lagged multiple linear regression helped to test postulated relationships through time and explore for further relationships. Four appendices discuss ANOVA, difference scores, path analysis, and corrections used for data cyclicity. (Author/RW)",

        "description":"Contracts that base the compensation and job security of teachers on seniority may promote the goals of public education more effectively than performance-based contracts. Public school teaching is a very complex process requiring constant adaptation to changing students, situations, methods, and dynamics. Measurement of teacher performance under such conditions requires either constant, careful, and costly supervision or the use of student performance measures that cannot account for the full range of influences affecting teaching. Teachers are unlikely to be willing to stake their income and employment on proven effectiveness in such unpredictable situations. Adequately applied seniority rules, on the other hand, allow for the continuous development of good teaching practices  over time without discouraging effort. The financial disadvantages and staffing problems accompanying application of seniority rules during recent periods of declining enrollment can be explained as the result of insufficient preparation on the part of both school district officials and teachers' union leaders conducting negotiations under unexpected pressures.

        "description":"Three big-city school systems nearly went bankrupt in the 1970s. New York City, including its schools, ran out of money; Cleveland closed its schools for long periods to conserve funds; and Chicago's schools ran out of credit. This paper narrates these crises, examines the responses of state governments and teacher and custodian unions, and looks for causes and possible solutions. While specific causes varied from city to city, in all three instances the city school boards had great difficulty both in closing underutilized schools and in raising property taxes and all three attempted to cover budget deficits with short-term borrowing. In response, the state in each instance took over major budget, financial, and sometimes labor decisions from the city school board and imposed  large cutbacks that the board, the unions, and local neighborhoods had to accept. City school systems with similar potential problems may avoid such crises through effective and timely retrenchment, in which closed school buildings are used by other agencies and school employees' fears are taken into account, and through increased state funding on an emergency, as-needed basis, a response pioneered in Ohio.

        "description":"Local school districts must strengthen their innovative capacity in order to respond effectively to the problems facing them. Success depends on both an organization's technical capacity to match problems with appropriate solutions and its political capacity to move an innovation through the process from adoption to incorporation. Research shows that the organization's ability to build a winning coalition, providing enough support to sustain the innovation against opposition, is crucial. An examination of several attempts at innovation over more than a decade in the school districts of Syracuse and Rochester in New York tested the nature of the coalitions involved, investigating their formation, operations, and effect on subsequent decision-making. This document summarizes and  analyzes the results of this extensive study, involving a number of separate, but related, case histories. The analysis leads to conclusions concerning the local educational organization as an innovative mechanism, bureaucratic entrepreneurship and coalition-building within education, the applicability of the research team's decision-making model to education, the comparison of educational innovation in Syracuse and Rochester, and the residual effects of innovation and coalition-building.

Innovations in two urban districts were examined. In the Syracuse City School District these innovations involved the following: responses to the need for educating children with handicapping conditions, the availability of computers for both instructional and and administrative purposes, the adoption of a house plan in an urban junior high school, the creation of magnet schools, the use of paraprofessionals, an attempt to create large educational complexes in campus settings at the elementary and secondary levels, and considerations of racial  balance. In the Rochester City School District nine innovative programs were included under the umbrella of Project Unique. Those described in these case studies emphasize the program permitting urban children from Rochester to attend schools in neighboring suburban districts, and vice versa. An examination of the residual effects of Project Unique is also presented.

The emergence of the permissive society in Sweden has brought growing participation in intellectual, physical, vocational, and citizenship activities as well as a rise of negative and destructive phenomena. At the same time, youth unemployment has risen as employment in the manufacturing industries and the private sectors of the economy has declined. Measures instituted to ameliorate the unemployment problem include granting government subsidies to employers who hire and train  young workers, increasing and facilitating access to education, and increasing the capacity of the employment service to handle placement and counseling. Part two of the book comprises a brief discussion of youth unemployment in Denmark, including a profile of the typical unemployed youth, a description of some experimental Danish schools, and suggestions for the future.

        "description":"In order to assess the methodological merit of the published research in educational administration based on surveys, the authors analyzed data from a random sample of 24 survey studies published in the &quot;Education Administration Quarterly&quot; and the &quot;Journal of Educational Administration.&quot; Each article was evaluated according to six criteria governing sampling and instrumentation procedures. Raw scores, descriptive statistics, and graphical analysis were used to judge levels of quality and to test for systematic improvements in the scientific rigor of the published research. The study reveals that both journals suffer general shortcomings across a number of the quality criteria. Often methodology is treated so tersely that readers cannot evaluate the quality of procedures. The  authors conclude that improvements in methodological rigor have been uneven and modest.

        "description":"To assess structural coupling in schools, investigators must first have measures with established reliability and validity levels. Structural coupling refers to the mechanisms and norms in organizations that influence interactions among individuals. For three structural coupling measurement techniques--participant observation, interviews, and surveys--the study estimated content, construct, convergent, and predictive validity levels and test-retest and internal consistency reliability levels. Interview and participant observation data were gathered at a junior high and a high school in one Kansas school district. Survey data came from 145 teachers and administrators in 67 schools in 48 Kansas school districts. The structural coupling measures demonstrated excellent psychometric  characteristics. The correlation coefficients for the construct and convergent validity estimates were high with few exceptions. The predictive validity estimates add further evidence that the measures were efficacious. (Author/RW)",

The literature on the causes and effects of, and possible solutions to, the problem of disruptive behavior in the classroom focuses on the teacher, classroom climate, curriculum, and behavior patterns of children. While teachers may be the key persons in solving disruptive behavior, they must be joined in their efforts by other faculty, family, and community members to form a leadership team. First, the team needs to define the specific problem situation. Next, they should gather and analyze data on type of student behaviors particular to the school. The Disruptive Behavior Inventory can be a useful tool in  this endeavor. In initiating a plan of action, the leadership team should involve all groups in the planning process, which should provide for improvement in teacher, administrative and parent behavior as well. Once an acceptable realm of student behavior has been established, an environment conducive to productive student behavior should be promoted and maintained. Parents, teachers, administrators, community members, and students can all contribute to a positive discipline program. (Author/WD)",

Analysis of contracts showed that salaries were not generally equal in the 1977-78 school year, but that the percentage of contracts with equal salaries was higher than in 1975-76. Teachers polled during the period felt efforts to comply with the provisions of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 were inadequate. The researchers determined that the Equal Pay Act of 1963 is the most appropriate and effective tool to use  in resolving equal pay issues involving sex discrimination. The data available were not sufficient to answer questions concerning equality of pay for extra work by coaches. As a result of the study, the researchers developed several recommendations for actions to be taken by the NEA involving continued monitoring of federal agencies, establishing of a salary schedule data base, analyzing contracts annually, encouraging use of the Equal Pay Act, and supporting enforcement of Title IX provisions.

The first few chapters of the book describe the nature of private secondary schools--their programs, organization, and management--and the sample of private high schools from which the data were drawn. Later chapters explore the attitudes and goals of public and private school principals, the Catholic high school, the external pressures schools  face (particularly in federal- and state-funded programs), the effects of competition and choice in the school marketplace, the private school as a subject for educational research, and public policy and private education. The initial survey on private schools offers a broad baseline of information representative of the variety of high schools throughout the country and will be followed by subsequent research. Survey results, the sampling plan, and responses are appended. (Author/WD)",

This study analyzed questionnaire data on school size, enrollment decline, program changes, effects of government and collective bargaining, and school-community cooperation from a survey of 312 Ontario secondary school principals and from interviews with 30 of these same principals. It also examined Ontario government documents from 1972-80 covering credit, course, curriculum, and textbook requirements and class scheduling; 35 teacher-school board collective bargaining agreements governing  pupil-teacher ratios, instructional load, class size, and &quot;redundancy&quot; (layoff) provisions; solutions to secondary school program problems in eight other Canadian provinces; and a case study of one small northern Ontario school district. Data analysis showed that enrollment decline, bargaining agreements, and societal priorities (as expressed through government requirements) would reduce students' options and the number of teachers and courses and would narrow the range of difficulty levels in schools. Such program constraints may be avoided through new educational technologies; increased cooperation among school boards, municipalities, and provincial officials; and more flexible educational policies.

        "description":"American education is distinctive in the decentralization of its funding and control. Despite recent expansion, the role of the federal government is still restricted to funding and authority in special programs and situations, while both states and localities have authority to define educational purposes, programs, and policies. At all levels of the administrative organization, administrators must consider relationships with groups outside the educational hierarchy, such as parent, community, and legislative bodies. Centralization of authority and funding at the federal level would theoretically reduce the power of these outside groups and increase the importance of relationships within the vertical hierarchy, while simplifying and ritualizing administrative functions. If  funding alone or authority alone were centralized, it would appear that many of the same results would occur. The American case is one of fragmented centralization, featuring unrelated federal funding programs processed through several independent channels. The situation seems to lead to a massive middle-level educational bureaucracy, poorly linked with the classroom world below, little integrated around broad educational policies or purposes, organized for the function of reporting to a wide, fragmented funding and control environment, and less and less able to respond to the legitimate authority of local systems.

Interviews with 104 educators conducted in 1978-79 in the San Jose Unified School District revealed how those at all levels of a local school system felt about the impact on education of these social and economic changes. The results showed considerable concern, highlighted by a sense that the public was altogether unhappy with the performance of local schools. Teachers and administrators reported that they were working harder than ever, under worsening conditions and for fewer rewards. Many teachers indicated plans to leave the profession. Major responsibility for the situation was  attributed to reductions in funding due to passage of Proposition 13, and additionally to poor public attitudes toward education. The findings point to the importance of close monitoring of the perceptions and attitudes of local school staff in California and elsewhere. (Author/PGD)",

The have overestimated the effectiveness of quantitative techniques, underestimated the importance of qualitative, historical, and political factors, and oversimplified the complexity of the relationship between education and social change. As a result, planning has been undertaken from too universal a standpoint and without enough consideration for the specific national or regional context. This context should also determine the proper role of the planner. Participation in the planning process by those most affected can improve the responsiveness of the process to the context if communication among participants is adequate. The information base for planning needs to be extended in most  cases, and the capacity of each educational system to implement the plans must be considered. Economic and political dependency, the funding of planning by extra-national agencies, and the dominance of the international model of educational planning all tend to aggravate these problems in developing nations.

Technical organizations such as factories act to regulate the flow of their processes and products and, thus, to buffer them from external forces. Institutional organizations such as schools or school systems seek to conform to the institutional environment, including the expectations of their constituents and, thus, buffer themselves from their own technical work processes. An institutional theory of educational organization offers explanations of the structural conformity and overall homogeneity of the system, and of its overall focus on organizational responsiveness to internal and external constituents. The absence of clearly  understood and efficacious technical processes for obtaining desired educational outcomes would threaten the legitimacy and resources of the organization if a tightly coupled technical organizational structure were used. The institutional model needs further development, which should include reconceptualization of the distinction between technical and institutional environments, clarification of the kinds of &quot;buffering&quot; practiced, and specification of the nature of organizational success.

In doing so they must be sure to coordinate changes at the organizational level with changes at the individual level. Development of new structures should take into account the purposes of the changes, the work technology, the organization's stage of development, and the surrounding culture. Structural changes at the organizational level, which can improve public schools' performance by applying limited resources where they are most effective, should include greater school decentralization, more subunit integration, and increased flexibility in reward structures, authority roles, and teacher roles. One way to increase  flexibility is through team building. At the individual level, structural change should involve enrichment of teachers' jobs. To motivate teachers toward responsibility and achievement, job enrichment must ensure job variety, teacher autonomy, frequent feedback, and teacher identification with educational tasks. More research is needed to illuminate the effects of public school organizational change on student performance and teacher motivation. Further, in seeking organizational and individual change, school leaders will have to be open-minded and aware of circumstances supporting or retarding change. (RW)",

        "description":"Successful introduction of school computer literacy programs, necessary in today's worldwide computer revolution, must take into account the nature both of this innovation and of school culture. Computer literacy will be a radical rather than ameliorative innovation and will challenge school culture. Hence an innovator must ensure that educators, parents, and community groups understand the program's effects on the three institutional dimensions of school culture--teacher and student work, knowledge distribution, and teacher professionalism and expertise. Social science models of planned educational change have proven inadequate for implementing innovations, but they have identified factors an innovator should consider, such as activity coordination, school social structure, and  users' needs. Innovation implementation must involve actual change, not merely nominal change. Actual school change, however, should be &quot;constructive,&quot; where both new routines and the principles behind them are adopted, rather than &quot;mechanical&quot; or &quot;illusory,&quot; where only labels and routines are incorporated. Based on these concepts, an innovator should (1) use proven methods of introducing new school programs; (2) identify the school cultural traditions challenged by the innovation; and (3) base monitoring techniques on a causal model that specifies what should be observed.

        "description":"Educational indicators are a subset of social indicators. They are consistently measurable, conceptually based, policy relevant, and related to the educational process. They can be used to compare educational units, monitor change, test goals, and predict the effects of policy changes. Use of educational indicators requires identification of the points at which external changes or decisions by policy makers will or can affect the situation under consideration and the degree to which the situation will be affected. Much of the data needed for developing educational indicators already exists, and should be gathered into accessible archives along with new data applicable at state, district, and individual-student levels. Making effective use of the indicators requires cooperation  between educational researchers and policy makers. Several alternatives for structuring this cooperation are available, and should be combined in different ways for different situations. A permanent staff at the archives can assemble the relevant data, cast it into usable form, and disseminate it through the most effective channels. The cost of maintaining archives to serve a region of several states is estimated at $235,000 in 1980 dollars. Appendixes list data sources and include a lengthy annotated bibliography on social indicators, future studies, and policy analysis. (PGD)",

        "description":"Thirty-six tables provide detailed information about educational and socioeconomic characteristics of students nationwide. The data show, among other things, that overall enrollment is down from 1970, especially at the kindergarten and elementary school level. College attendance is up, though, as more women and people over 25 enroll. This is especially true for two-year colleges, where enrollment growth since 1974 has resulted entirely from increased enrollment of women. The probability of college enrollment remains dependent on family income; high school graduates aged 18 to 24 from high-income families are much more likely to attend college than those from low-income families. The socioeconomic characteristics covered include age, sex, race or ethnic group, residence in  metropolitan or nonmetropolitan areas, marital status, family income, and membership in the labor force. The educational characteristics considered comprise enrollment at all educational levels (from preschool through higher education), educational attainment, public or private control of the institution, full- or part-time enrollment, and two-year and four-year college attendance. Appendices extend the data back in time, as far as 1947 for some characteristics, and project college enrollment forward to 1990. (Author/RW)",

Among the witnesses were U.S. Secretary of Education Shirley M. Hufstedler and Assistant Attorney General John M.

The enrollment projections were based on the cohort survival method, which assumes that recent  enrollment history offers sufficient information to predict future enrollment. Enrollments between October 1974 and 1979 served as the data base. The report also evaluates prior projections.

An initial chapter distinguishes between handicaps and disabilities. Chapter 2 gives the major reasons for including handicapism in the social study curriculum: to understand the potential effects of handicapped people on the handicapped themselves and on the nonhandicapped, and to provide a basis for future citizen decision making. The next two chapters reveiw stereotypes and attitudes toward the handicapped and suggest simulation activities to encourage greater understanding of specific handicaps. Fifteen student projects are suggested, including making photo essays on the disabled and writing biographies of disabled  persons in the community. Using community resource people is the subject of Chapter 6, while Chapter 7 focuses on obstacles to independent living in the community. Examples of relevant aspects of study in anthropology, economics, government and civics, psychology, history, and sociology are considered. Social issues regarding employment, education, health, public facilities, family, and housing are noted, as well as an approach for studying such issues. The final chapter presents an approach to evaluating student attitudes and knowledge regarding handicapped persons. (CL)",

        "description":"The direction and scope of deinstitutionalization in 75 public and 161 community residential programs for mentally retarded people in the Unites States were examined by analysis of current levels of expenditures, projected costs, efficacy of existing funding mechanisms, and identification of critical factors affecting cost variation. Results of a three page self report questionnaire completed by financial officers of each facility included the finding that the largest single expense reported by most facilities was personnel related. Estimates of total revenue, expenses, and capital investments are presented separately for public and community facilities as well as separately by census regions and size categories. Results further revealed that public residential facility per diems  were were significantly different when tested for census region differences and varying levels of staff resident ratios. The intensity of staffing and services provided by community residential facilities significantly affected per diems, as did family ownership and the proportion of severely/profoundly mentally retarded residents. Public policy implications are presented in terms of constitutional guarantees and levels of funding; programing requirements and the application of cost functions; and reimbursement patterns, fiscal disincentives, and the future development of community alternatives.

Efforts to design a technology to permit unobtrusive study of hand movements during braille reading and to link observed differences in scanning to reading ability, comprehension, and stimulus properties (including orthography, syntactic, and linguistic features of the text) are described. A study involving microanalysis of 18 braille readers revealed consistency in hand movement patterns, with better readers using two headed styles more often than one handed styles. Results confirmed that hand movements in braille reading can be reduced to a finite number of microcounts, based on direction  and duration of the movement across the braille cell. Larger movement units, such as regressing motions and fixations, appeared to vary with the reader's ability and differences in the stimulus. (CL)",

Three of the questionnaires are analyzed to get an idea of the problems the students had with English and the state of English teaching in Japan. Thirty-one male and female high school students were involved in the study. The first questionnaire, given one month after their arrival in the U.S., dealt with the students' previous experiences in studying English. The second, administered 7 months after their arrival in the U.S., was intended to find aspects of American culture with which the students were not familiar, and the kinds of cultural problems they were encountering. The third one was administered after their return to Japan. The following results are  noted: (1) English education in schools in Japan emphasizes knowledge about English, not performance; (2) there is not sufficient emphasis on practice of listening and speaking skills; (3) instruction is not geared toward communication with English-speaking people; and (4) little about American culture is taught in English classes in Japan, which prevents Japanese from communicating adequately with Americans. Copies of the questionnaires are appended. (AMH)",

The corpus consisted of the one million word Brown University corpus of American English and a matching Lancaster University corpus of British English. The three factors operative in the study were: (1) contextual features, that is, co-occurring syntactic/semantic features of the text; (2) British and American English; and (3) differences of genre or style. A theoretical investigation revealed that an appropriate model would have to synthesize six orientations: mono-semantic, polysemantic, categorical, non-categorical, logical, and pragmatic. In addition, a new definition was given to the epistemic/root distinction. Here, epistemic refers to a speaker's belief regarding the truth  of a proposition; root refers to a phenomenon which is influenced by some other phenomena. In the four pairs of modals discussed here, should/ought, must/have to, shall/will, and can/may, a compensatory relationship between British and American usage was found in each case. In other words, the American use of the first member of each pair was balanced by the British use of tbe second member. It is noted, in conclusion, that this analysis of written texts is to be supplemented by an analysis of spoken material. (AMH)",

Two groups of 17-year-olds--one studying advanced French and the other French as part of a \"core\" program--and 14 adults in a civil service French program were the subjects. All were administered a cloze test, a Danish sentence translation task, and picture reconstruction and description tasks. Based on test results, a typology of oral communication strategies was constructed, to which the distinction between first- and second-language-based strategies was fundamental. Strategies were found to be categorizable according to their  relationship to two factors: attention to the linguistic aspects of the target item, which exists along a continuum of usefulness to learning objectives; and learner characteristics, which help determine predominance of first- or second-language-based strategies. Specifically, it was found that inferencing ability determines strategy selection and use, once proficiency has achieved a sufficient level of expertise. Finally, strategy choice was found to be highly contextual. (JB)",

        "description":"The inferential use of linguistic and extralinguistic information in structuring conversations was studied in 90 three- and five-year-old children. Pictures portraying an actor-action-object relation, e.g., a child picking a flower, were used to guide conversational sequences. Both active pictures (which emphasized an action relating actor and object via postural cues) and static pictures (which did not) were used. Linguistic topics were implied by prefacing each picture with comments topicalizing actor, action, or object. Neutral control groups were run in which no topic was implied and, in an explicit control group, the actor's action on the object was directly topicalized for three-year-olds. Neither actor, action, nor object productions of three-year-olds varied significantly  with topic; explicitly defining a topic increased the incidence of action and object responses and induced pronominalization or ellipsis of actor. Five-year-olds ellipsed or pronominalized actors for implied object and gave fewer action and object productions when actor was implied. Indefinite articles were used more than definite by both groups. Five-year-olds are clearly sensitive to implicit linguistic topics, whereas three-year-olds seem to require explicit topic definition for contingent replies. The increase in object utterances to active pictures is taken to support the notion that extralinguistic information may guide early linguistic productions and conversations. (Author)",

The category called &quot;searching&quot; served as an example. To produce a body of data, the teacher commented on videotapes of ordinary events in her classroom. However, perceptual cues which inspired her to say that a child was &quot;searching&quot; could not always be found within the videotaped incidents. The model of an informant who matches cues from the environment to a cognitive map did not work. Instead, the teacher's comments about the tapes had to be understood as speech acts in which she was accounting for previously stated theories about students. (Author)",

The two main sources of data were the federal Department of Employment and Immigration, and the Education, Science and Culture Division of Statistics Canada, which collects data from individual institutions. Discrepancies were found in the data from the two sources. The student statistical report includes sections on the collection and improvement of student data; characteristics of students with unknown residence status; enrollment patterns of Canadians and non-Canadians; major field of  study for both categories; sex, age, and length of time in Canada; and country of origin of non-Canadians. The faculty report includes sections on the collection and improvement of faculty data; characteristics of faculty with unknown residence status; origins and distribution of non-Canadian faculty; citizenship and immigration status by subject taught; degrees earned by Canadian and foreign faculty; faculty rank; previous employment of university teachers; and age and year of first appointment. Substantial data tables are included. It is concluded that: student and faculty data reporting has improved in recent years; although the proportion of non-Canadian students has not changed greatly, that of landed immigrants versus visa-holders has been affected by immigration regulation changes;  and the heaviest influx of foreign faculty has been from more established graduate schools in the United States and Europe.

The computer college has several off-campus locations, including one 60 miles away, and it serves a population that tends to have low educational attainment levels. One environmental factor that influences student attitudes is the classroom site, which in the rural setting may be located in a poorly maintained public building or store. Organizational factors, such as size of the off-campus center, student services, and course offerings, also influence student perceptions and self-images. Student characteristics need to be assessed in understanding student perceptions. In the Bluefield State service area, off-campus students show a high degree of  economic need and American College Test scores significantly below the state average, which is in turn lower than the national norm. It is suggested that in addition to needing access to counselors, students must have adequate opportunities to provide feedback to administrators. Steps taken at McDowell County to improve the off-campus situation are noted, including establishing a permanent secretarial position, using a newly established full-time faculty position in a liaison capacity, and implementing an individualized instructional center.

In &quot;Parental Loans--An Option Paper,&quot; Joseph Froomkin considers the rationale for and against public initiatives for parental loan plans, rationales for institutional parental loans, the demand for loans and probable cost to the government, and options/terms for loans. The distribution of benefits and the possibility of leveraging student loans and the federal role in encouraging institutional parental loan plans are addressed. In &quot;Options in the Reauthorization of the Higher Education Act,&quot; Froomkin considers options for the major reconstruction, consolidation, and reduction of student aid programs, along with options for institutional aid programs. The possibility of consolidating student aid programs is suggested if the  Basic Educational Opportunity Grant programs are transferred to the states. In &quot;Statistical Needs to Estimate Demand and Supply of Graduate and Professional Minority Enrollment in Higher Education,&quot; Froomkin considers databases that address the supply of minorities with graduate education, the flow of minorities to graduate schools, and the demand for minorities in graduate programs. It is concluded that there is very little existing statistical information that clarifies the occupational distribution of minorities that also considers the discipline of their graduate degrees. There is some information by discipline about the numbers of persons with minority backgrounds with graduate degrees. In &quot;Fine-Tuning the Level of Campus-Based Aid,&quot; Froomkin and Richard Andrews consider the  following issues: whether aid should be adjusted by the cost of living, whether new statistics should be collected, the need for new data and a better definition of need, and the need for fine-tuning the allocation of aid.

Problems in society that have a moral impact include the high rate of crime and an ineffective rehabilitation system for convicted criminals, illicit drug traffic, and the strength of special interest groups through campaign financing at all levels of government. The moral issue of educational quality has been addressed at all educational levels in Florida. Special remedial help for students in K-3 programs and more difficult standards for future teachers are among the state's efforts to improve the quality of education. Florida has funded the community college system to improve quality and has reestablished a state  community college coordinating board to promote systemwide coordination, prevent duplication, and monitor the quality of programs at the 20 community colleges. The state legislature authorized the issuance of state vouchers of $750 per year for Florida resident students for tuition costs in state private colleges. Objections to this action and problem areas, including an inefficient cabinet state board of education, are considered. (SW)",

Among the lessons are the ideas that one needs to consider a specific quality rather than a broad use of the term, and that quality or excellence is not necessarily linked to originality, hard labor, size, common opinion, or expert opinion. It is suggested that in a free society there exists the freedom to be excellent or less than excellent, and that in a community, the mark of excellence is the mutual commitment to individual excellence in its members. However, the ultimate accountability is to oneself. What otherwise passes for excellence is most often an imposed and proximate excellence defined by others. It is questionable that a society can be excellent if it prizes efficiency more highly than it does  excellence, and social orderliness more highly than individual development. Layers of routines and rules smother the individual excellences of those expected to produce the society's excellence. A free society needs to seek ways to encourage its individuals to define and desire their own excellences. (SW)",

It is suggested that during the last two decades relationships between government and voluntary accrediting agencies have become alienated. Regulatory and coordinating functions have increased greatly as states have assumed coordinating, planning, accrediting, certifying, and licensing roles. The federal government also established accrediting agencies to determine institutional eligibility for federal funds. Voluntary accrediting agencies tried to coordinate efforts, both regional and professional, through a loose federation of the regional accrediting agencies. A major question is whether  states should go beyond state licensure roles in seeking to improve the standing and quality of an institution or whether this function should be left to regional voluntary accrediting agencies. The need and the demand of society for consumer protection and accountability in higher education are considered. Among the abuses that need to be addressed are the following: questionable admissions and grading policies, failure to provide promised services or to offer courses listed, and questionable refund policies. Among the strengths of voluntary agencies are the following: they emphasize self-study, they help protect institutions against political encroachments by outside organizations, and they assist in promoting the diversity and pluralism of higher education. Among the criticisms of  voluntary agencies are the following: standards for institutional accreditation appear to have dropped; regional agencies do not make their reports public; and they have not done much about off-campus extension centers, programs abroad, branches of parent schools, and education at military bases.

It is proposed that quality standards be established for community colleges to reflect their unique mission and goals. The most distinctive characteristic of the community college movement has been the absence of admission standards. It is suggested that this policy has provided access to higher education for all Americans, and has been the primary contributing factor to charges of low quality at community colleges. Research has indicated that selectivity in admissions is highly correlated with reputation for quality in higher education. It is noted that lack of admissions  standards does not indicate a lack of concern about exit standards. The community college's comprehensiveness in academic offerings and the student-centered focus on teaching have also been criticized. Views that quality is linked to either specialization, an emphasis on research, prestige, or physical facilities are questioned, and it is proposed that there is a need to recognize that quality is rather a continuing process of critical self-examination that focuses on the institution's contribution to the student's intellectual and personal development. Student-centeredness, a focus on teaching, and responsiveness to change are characteristic of the community college and are part of the new view of quality for higher education. It is emphasized that the students and missions of community  colleges are different than those of upper level colleges and that quality standards need to be somewhat different as well. (SW)",

Differences between the roles of the accrediting commissions and the state agencies are examined, and ways to develop more cooperative relationships are suggested. The primary means by which the accrediting commission determines institutional effectiveness and provides this public assurance is through the accreditation process, a program of periodic evaluation. Among the developments that have occurred in the regional accrediting commissions to be responsive to changing conditions are the following: examination and revision of the commissions' processes for institutional evaluation, with more specific criteria  for accreditation and clearer information; serious consideration of the due process components of the review process; sharpening of annual reports required of institutions so that changes of a limited nature can be discovered and monitored; and development of sequential evaluation processes for cooperative efforts across regional boundaries. Areas of continuing concern include: the evaluation of off-campus programs in another region, the evaluation of institutions with external graduate degrees, the specificity of standards or criteria, and the evaluation of institutions perceived as nontraditional. Among the differences between regional accrediting commissions and state agencies are the following: the focus of the regional accrediting commission is on the institution, while the focus of  the state agency is the wise expenditure of state resources; the regionals treat public and private institutions alike; and accrediting commissions are private nongovernmental associations of institutions. Five ways to develop cooperative relationships between state and accrediting agencies are suggested. (SW)",

It is suggested that money is a critical issue, that good management is needed to assure the best and wisest use of fiscal resources, and that the fiscal outlook for the future indicates that higher education planners must examine nonproductive or low payoff programs. The money that will be available for new programs in the future will be available through the recycling of existing dollars that are being spent in nonproductive areas. In recent years, state higher education coordinating agencies have played a major staff role in recommending major policy changes. Examples of critical issues in which these agencies have been involved include the approval of new institutions,  new programs in existing institutions, and the coordination of an overall, statewide master plan for higher education. It is suggested that tuition charges and other curriculum charges for in-state and out-of-state students and the relationship of these charges to the dollars state and local governments appropriate for higher education must be thoroughly examined. It is projected that private higher educational institutions will demand and receive more state funds. Additionally, innovations in higher education in the late 1970s are viewed as necessary. For instance, higher education may need to utilize vacant dormitories rather than building additional dormitories at another nearby institution. The Maryland Department of Budget and Fiscal Planning relies heavily on the use of the Chase  econometric model in projecting the state economy and its revenues. The need is noted, in any state, for higher education officials and budget officers to communicate fully early in the year in the preparation of the budget. (SW)",

The University of Wisconsin system is described as an example of emerging budgetary practice in higher education, and it is claimed that imperative planning is succeeding in higher education while PPBS remains dormant in state government. The following major components of an operating, traditional PPBS process are defined: budget format, goals and objectives, cost-benefit analyses, multiyear projections, long-range planning, program procedures, budgetary procedures, and information procedures. Traditional PPBS was intended to guide and  integrate all governmental activity. Imperative planning can be more easily implemented in higher education and PPBS in state government because of organizational similarity and a history of real or attempted program coordination. The origin of traditional PPBS is varied and often involves outside experts, while imperative planning not only originates with the executive heads of state systems, multicampus systems, and campuses, but has their ongoing support. Traditional PPBS was introduced into the states when resources were relatively plentiful, while imperative planning is higher education's response to resource scarcity. Proponents of imperative planning have less faith in quantitative analysis than seems to be required in traditional PPBS. Traditional PPBS was seen to promise the  opportunity for governors and legislators to achieve specific objectives by reallocation of funds in the state budget. Few higher education administrators deal with dollars as an abstraction, and there are few illusions about the practical limits to shifting dollars to achieve program objectives. A bibliography is included. (SW)",

Areas in which improved communication can make a big difference include the avoidance of duplicate management information systems, and avoidance of dual or triple budget formats and submissions. The need for determining priorities and for internal budgetary reallocations in higher education was addressed at the conference. It is suggested that one of the reasons why educational policy decisions are often made by coordinating agencies and budget agencies is because of the reluctance of administrators and faculty to make  these decisions. There have been cases of administrators forwarding new program proposals to the state for rejection because they did not want to say no to internal constituencies. It is suggested that institutions should show that service to people has been the major consideration in programmatic decisions. The need for each state to reexamine budgeting in the light of the incentives and disincentives that are built into the budget process was addressed at the conference. It is suggested that it is the responsibility of state higher education agencies to identify which policies are in the public interest when educational and fiscal considerations are the primary criteria.

The agency and the board then must play the role of interpreting these to members of the general assembly and to the governor. The following principles are suggested when a state creates a coordinating agency in order to allow this agency to perform its functions adequately: (1) the staff of the coordinating agency should have a  general background in higher education and should be capable of making objective decisions; (2) the staff of the agency as well as the supervisory board should have the ability to communicate educational needs and information to the governor and general assembly in terms that they can understand, and they should be able to assist in translating these needs in terms of the various other state agencies; (3) the coordinating agency should be free to look at the needs of the state without political interference from any of the various agencies of the state; (4) the budgets of higher education should be expressed in a manner that is acceptable to the governor and general assembly; (5) the budgeting process for institutions of higher education should be somewhat consistent with the budgeting  for other agencies of the state government but should allow for unique differences; and (6) when budgeting for higher education is considered, competition with a particular region of the country should be avoided and allocating a continuing percentage of general revenues for education is not adivsable.

The following three types of legislative staffs that impinge directly on budget decisions are described: joint legislative budget staffs, budget committee staffs of the separate houses, and program or performance audit staffs. Great variety characterizes the quantity and quality of interrelationships of the legislative staffs, ranging from close supervision and coordination of all staff work by a single director, to the active antagonism of separately controlled committee staffs. In all but three states the governor has a professional  staff devoted to budget development. In state higher education agencies, members of the technical budget staff are likely to be college graduates with previous budgeting experience. Interagency relationships among state staffs are considered in terms of the level of professionalism, openness in communication and information bases, role competition and confusion, and redundancy. Checks and balances and professional staffings in the executive and legislative branches and in coordinating agencies are discussed. The following functions of coordinating agencies are considered: planning and policy studies, information and management systems, program initiatives and control, and budget review of programs and services in relation to long-range plans and policy analyses. Additionally, the  following duties of the executive budget office are addressed: determining the share of state revenue to be recommended to the legislature for higher education, making the technical and mathematical review of the budget, allocating funds, and conducting special financial policy studies.

Studies have indicated that higher education has reached a new low in terms of priority among state services and that little long-range comprehensive planning is taking place at the state level. With some exceptions among the states, planners are not engaged in conceiving new initiatives in programming, in setting system goals, in reviewing or redefining institutional missions, or in establishing other parameters for the development of individual campuses within a system of public and private institutions. Legislators and governors have been found to be much concerned over the lack of  direction or focus in higher education. Results of a 1975 survey of 2,500 college and university presidents on how institutions were responding and planning to respond to leveling enrollments and funding patterns are presented and analyzed. The administrators were sufficiently satisfied with their recent tactics and strategies for recruiting new clientele, adopting new programs, and meeting staffing needs, to report no major changes in activities beyond those already underway in 1974. It is suggested that governors and legislators want the state-level agencies and the institutions to take a more studied and aggressive stand on how and in what dimensions each campus will fit into the new spectrum of agencies and modes of education. State pressures for better and more comprehensive  long-range planning are undoubtedly going to come from the politicians and will be directed at the state coordinating and planning boards. It is suggested that an aggressive, realistic planning mode is the best defense against imposition from without of roles and programs for an individual institution. (SW)",

        "author":["Huff, Robert A."],
        "description":"A differential funding method for statewide higher education planning is examined, and a case study is presented. There are three basic dimensions or parameters by which higher education funding formulas may be differentiated: course level, discipline cluster, and institutional type. It is suggested that the only effective way to logically address the needs of instructional activities is to consider all three dimensions simultaneously. It is proposed that an acceptable statewide higher education financial planning tool must satisfy three important criteria: simplicity, compatibility with current funding approaches as well as with future trends, and limitations on institutional data contributions. The kind of software system that may prove helpful is comprised of three programs or  modules. The preparation module accepts all inputs including both institutional descriptors and planning policy parameters. The calculation module employs the submitted differential funding policies or formulas in conjunction with the credit hour demands produced in the preparation module to compute resource requirements. In addition, with the report module, the outputs of the calculation module are aggregated, sorted, and arrayed in preparation of a series of reports. The use of a prototype statewide planning and budgeting system at Mansfield State College and Shippensburg State College in Pennsylvania is described. It is claimed that computers provide the only means of accurately repeating thousands of calculations necessary for the development of alternative sets of institutional  budgets within a short period of time.

        "description":"The nature and extent of restraing imposed by state and federal funding formulas, guidelines, and regulations on emerging, innovative, nontraditional postsecondary educational programs was assessed. Interviews were conducted with administrators of several innovative programs. In addition, a questionnaire was mailed to over 300 nontraditional programs which were free of traditional time or place limitation. Of the 134 responses, 48 indicated some serious problem with state or federal funding formulas, and 86 institutions reported no particular problems. Of those reporting great difficulty with state or federal funding agencies, 70 percent were public and 30 percent were private. Public colleges and university programs operating within larger traditional schools seemed to have the  greatest difficulty with funding guidelines. The formulas from which many of the problems arise are reviewed, and examples of restrictive policies faced by nontraditional programs are described. Among the possible solutions are the following: pass the costs on to students; use soft money for start-up costs; exert political pressure on state and federal legislators; do away with the formulas and guidelines entirely; arbitrarily assign credit hours to everything done in time-free and place-free programs; develop a new formula based on a concept entirely different from credit hours; and use program budgeting as a way out of the formula dilemma. Program approval, another area of concern to nontraditional programs, is briefly considered. (SW)",

        "description":"Causes contributing to academic program audit and review becoming a means of resource reallocation in higher education are considered, along with principles relevant to its management, and major issues surrounding its development and implementation. The current interest in the audit and review of established academic programs is linked to declining enrollments and budgets. The university is forced to identify and abandon or alter programs or activities that are less essential so that the vitality of that which remains is protected. Organizing principles used in program audit and review in the University of Wisconsin System are addressed. A starting principle was that the audit and review was a responsibility and activity to be conducted by the faculty, or shared governance  agencies, of each institution. A second principle pointed to the need to distinguish between program audit as a process of identifying programs that should be given intensive review, and program review as the comprehensive and intensive examination of a particular program. The review, rather than the audit, would lead to recommendation that a program be phased out or changed. A third major principle developed in Wisconsin policies and procedures is that the institutional processes of audit and review should be perceived as an integral part of institutional planning, rather than a crisis reaction to fiscal stringency. Among the issues surrounding development and implementation of program audit and review are the following: whether the excision of academic programs saves money, whether  external evaluations could provide more acceptable decisions than faculty members assessing the programs of colleagues, and whether audit and review would generate efficiencies in the use of resources sufficient to repay the direct costs of conducting the review.

        "author":["Bender, Louis W."],
        "description":"Factors at the national, state, and institutional level that damage constructive relationships from the two-year college perspective are considered. Two-year institutions have felt that they have not received their proportionate share of attention or funds from the federal level, and that federal vocational education legislation has not protected them from arbitrary and capricious decisions by state directors of vocational education in funding priorities. Other issues at the federal level relate to staffing with the U.S. Office of Education (USOE) of a two-year college advocate and fair representation on various panels organized by the USOE. Additionally, two-year colleges have been concerned about the taxonomies for information reports that did not accommodate the comprehensive  programs of community colleges, particularly in the occupational areas at the certificate or nondegree level. At the state level, two-year colleges are concerned about the hierarchical attitude that exists toward the various segments of higher education with the universities at the top of the pyramid and the two-year colleges at the base. Additionally, the relatively minor attention given to the two-year colleges in state master plans for postsecondary education is a cause of concern, as is the channeling of vocational/technical funds toward secondary programs. Issues at the institutional level that represent forces damaging to constructive relationships include articulation whereby two-year graduates are not given appropriate recognition or credit upon transfer. Additionally, the  strategies used by four-year state colleges to increase enrollments through community service and continuing education programs and through occupational programs are pertinent issues. The institutional level concerns may be resolved if coordinating and governing boards provide leadership. (SW)",

It is suggested that through their open door philosophy, community colleges respond to the public demand for access to postsecondary education and accommodate the lifelong learning needs of a pluralistic society. Three community college prototypes are described: the traditional campus-oriented institution, the without walls community college, and the most recent contract community college. The contract community college delivers its services through contracting with existent postsecondary institutions or organizations that either accommodate the students of the community college by having them occupy empty spaces in  regular classes or design special courses of study and programs to serve the educational goals and needs of the community college student. Four contract community colleges are briefly described: the Union County Coordinating Agency in New Jersey is nonaccredited and nondegree-granting, while the Hudson Community College Commission in the same state is accredited and degree-granting. The Hudson group contracts with three senior institutions and a vocational/technical school and also employs part-time faculty to teach in its evening credit and noncredit programs. The John Wood Community College in Illinois operates on a common market approach very much like the Hudson model, and the Watsco Area Educational District in Oregon also provides services by contracting with community colleges.  Advantages of the contract college for students served, for the local sponsor, and for the existent postsecondary education institutions are examined, along with concerns pertaining to authorization, accreditation, and the contract.

        "description":"The idea of regionalism and its implementation are considered, along with the institutional, state, and federal governmental interests to which regionalism appears to be related. A study of regionalism found it was seen as an interinstitutional, cooperative arrangement officially recognized by an authoritative agency in the state and thus distinguishable from consortia arrangements. It was found that 60 percent of the states are actively engaged in regionalism as an aspect of planning and coordinating postsecondary educational resources. A primary factor that seems to encourage regionalism is the leadership posture assumed by state-level boards or commissions. Most plans were characterized by the following patterns: seeking to meet broad postsecondary educational needs within  each of several geographic regions established throughout the state; seeking to meet the postsecondary educational needs of a special, particular geographical subsection of a state; dealing with a single academic program or a single subsection of postsecondary education; and involving either the entire state or a subsection of the state with either the entire state or subsections of other states. Most states reported that a better utilization of resources was the objective pursued. Regionalism is implemented predominantly by three types of authority: administrative authority possessed by the executive branch or an agency of state government, legislative authority expressed in statutes, and authority held by established postsecondary educational institutions. In organizational terms, the  regionalization approaches appeared to have weak structures for governance and administration. It was found that state and institutional funds were most heavily utilized. (SW)",

Developments that have resulted in commitment to lifelong learning by the federal government, state governments, and institutions are noted, including declining enrollments. Lifelong learning has been regarded as many things: off-campus instruction, service to part-time students, and nontraditional learning. It can be credit or noncredit, examination for credit, or credit for life experiences. Lifelong learning is often classified on the basis of the delivery system and in terms of target audiences. The California master plan, the community college five-year plan, and other plans within the state are briefly described in terms of their consideration of adult students. Some  persepctives on planning are offered, including the following: there is a need for diversity in institutions, instructional methods, and subject matter; planning should be evaluated and coordinated; the planning function should be shared by participants at all levels; and there will never be a perfectly meshed plan, given the federal, state, and local levels of bureaucracy and other differences. Suggested questions that state planners need to consider include: how to weigh individual educational needs; the extent to which duplication will be permitted; whether planning will be conducted only for areas requiring tax dollars; how to guarantee quality; how detailed a plan should be; whether the planning will promote diversity of learning; whether plans should include the estabishment of new  institutions or agenices to reach the new adult audiences; and the extent to which institutions should seek out new audiences.

The students vary widely in age, educational background, occupation, and goals. For some the consortium provides an opportunity for continuing education in their profession, and others participate for advanced degrees and better jobs, or for reentry into the work force. The program was established because historically the educational needs of the area's population have been underserved, especially  at the upper division and graduate levels. The events that led to the establishment of the regional center are traced. An advisory task force, comprised of lay citizens and postsecondary institution members, serves as a forum to discuss community needs, potential problems, and concerns of programs and students. The consortium does not grant degrees, does not offer credit for classes, or employ instructors. Each of the individual institutions perform these functions according to their usual operating procedures. The consortium was designed to utilize existing resources, eliminate unnecessary duplication in the region, promote regional planning and coordination, and explore means for increasing interinstitutional cooperation in meeting articulated local and regional needs.

The history of the community college movement in Illinois is traced, and the nature of state governance is examined. The Illinois Community College Board (ICCB) is the body charged with the overall regulation, supervision, and planning for the community college system. Both the ICCB and the Illinois Board of Higher Education have encouraged the sharing of resources to avoid duplication of efforts and have endorsed the common market concept of delivering educational services through contractual arrangements with other agencies. John Wood Community College serves five counties using existing college and proprietary schools in Illinois, Missouri, and Iowa to provide instructional and support services for  its students. Counselors of the community college maintain contact with students throughout their educational programs, and the full range of student services are provided, including counseling, financial aid, student government, student activities, and placement. Funding support for John Wood comes from four sources: tuition and fees, state aid, local tax levy, and federal monies. Not every course is offered through the common market system. John Wood has its own open learning center, a nontraditional delivery system allowing students to take developmental studies and college-level courses on a self-paced mastery basis. An outreach project also provides courses whenever and wherever they are needed within the district. Among the advantages of the common market approach are that it  maximizes the utilization of facilities and discourages tax-supported building projects, and it enhances program flexibility for students. Challenges or possible problem areas are also identified. (SW)",

CCF is a community-based, competency-based college without a campus directed primarily to adults who previously have found access to postsecondary education to be difficult. Classes are offered in various types of locations in the community, and instructors are paid on a per-course basis and usually hold full-time jobs in the community, practicing the skills they teach. The CCV staff operates from one central administrative office and nine field offices located throughout the state. Counselors and coordinators of instruction also provide essential services. CCV students receive neither grades nor credits; the associate degree is awarded on the basis of demonstrated skills and the acquisition of  competencies defined in advance through a contract. Assessment is accomplished through student self-evaluation, evaluation by instructors, consultation with counselors, and periodic meetings with a review committee composed of a student, CCV staff member, community instructor, and community member chosen by the student. Three programs lead to an associate degree: administrative services, human services, and general studies. CCV provides different types of students with a variety of instructional settings: classes, experiential learning, independent study, and on-the-job training. A fifth instructional model is the cluster, a support group of students who meet together regularly to discuss personal concerns. CCV became accredited in 1975 and since its inception the college has needed to  deal with four general issues: institutional legitimacy, financing, duplication of effort, and program quality. In addition to considering these concerns, a case study of a student is presented. (SW)",

Three broad organizational types that had licensing/approval authority for degree-granting and nondegree-granting private institutions were identified: the state board (or department) of education type, the state board (or department) of higher education type, and the separate state agency type. Four states had vested no authority to any state agency for licensing or approving private or proprietary degree-granting and nondegree-granting institutions as of January 1976. Thirty-three states vested licensing or approving authority with the state board of education for nondegree-granting proprietary institutions. Eleven of these states also placed licensing or approving authority  for degree-granting private and proprietary institutions in the department of education. Nineteen states placed the licensing of or approving authority for private degree-granting institutions with the department of higher education. Five of these states also empowered the same departments with approval of nondegree-granting institutions. Ten states placed authority for licensing or approval with entirely separate state agencies. For each state all of this information is provided in tabular form. Trends indicated by the overall investigation include the following: historically authority to approve nondegree-granting institutions resided primarily with the state board of education, which tended to be designated as the state board for vocational education; and during the 1950s and early  1960s there was a trend toward renaming state boards and departments of public instruction to encompass both public and private education.

        "description":"Factors that have intensified concern with state licensing and oversight of postsecondary education, the current state of licensing and oversight, and areas that need to be addressed are considered. Conditions that have led to concern with state licensing and oversight include an enlarged number of institutions, the increase in federal and state student aid programs, the consumer concern for fair practices in postsecondary education, and the impending decline in the traditional student age group. Increased incentives to adjust educational realities in order to increase enrollment could make state oversight of traditional colleges and universities an important concern. Forty-eight states are exercising some sort of licensing authority over private nondegree-granting institutions,  and 43 states have licensing authority for private degree-granting institutions. Additionally consumer protection laws have been enacted in states to prevent unfair or deceptive practices. Model legislation for state laws to improve licensing and oversight is outlined that was designed by a task force of the Education Commission of the States. A problem area is the many new degree-granting institutions that operate across state lines and offer a range of nontraditional programs. It is not evident who should accredit these educational offerings. Another problem is the exemption of certain kinds of institutions from regulation. There is also a need for state licensing agencies to coordinate their efforts with other state agencies, including the attorney general's office and state consumer  protection agencies. Steps that can be taken to improve state laws include raising the consciousness of governors and legislators regarding the need for oversight of postsecondary education. (SW)",

The analysis was based on usable returns from 53 individuals representing 38 states. The most frequently mentioned agency handling any postsecondary educational grievance was the Veterans Approval Agency, with the Attorney General's Office also frequently mentioned. Several states had agencies that handle grievances that did not seem to fit in any of the given categories and were consequently counted as &quot;other.&quot; There was evidence that many agencies handle grievances without having authority for complete followthrough by initiating redress procedures. The majority mentioned. of complaints  received by 40 reporting agencies came from students or parents: 27 agencies received complaints from this source regularly or frequently and 14 agencies occasionally or rarely. The majority of complaints had to do with refund policies. Complaints dealing with instructional programs or recruitment and admissions practices were also common. For 1,788 grievances reported by 39 agencies, 68 percent were resolved out of court in favor of the consumer. The problem mentioned most frequently by agencies was inadequate laws, policies, or staff for implementation of the redress process. Forty-four percent of respondents indicated that they had no problems. Perceived needs for information on grievance procedures from other states as well as information that might be shared with other states were  also surveyed.

Thirty-two states were examined, including officials who were involved in a licensing/approval of degree-granting and proprietary schools and veterans programs. Twenty-five of the states had statutory authority in regard to consumer protection, and two had legislative bills proposed for such statutory authority. Twenty-eight states indicated criteria for licensing or approval that address consumer issues, and 30 indicated action that could be taken if licensed or approved institutions violated the standards. Thirty states cooperate with other consumer agencies, and  only two agencies had written procedures for servicing requests for information regarding matters of nonpublic colleges and universities. Thirty states provide information to out-of-state institutions, and 31 of the state agencies, boards, or councils hold meetings that are open to the public and their minutes of meetings are open to public inspection. Among the issues raised by the survey are the following: the question of whether institutions should be required by states to disclose certain basic information to prospective students prior to the collection of any fees and whether administrators of proprietary institutions should be required to meet certain state licensing requirements to conduct an operation within the state. A classification of the surveyed states according to whether  the representatives dealt with degree-granting, proprietary, and veterans approval programs is included. (SW)",

        "description":"Reactions to the American Institutes for Research (AIR) study of state legal chartering and approval procedures are presented. In presenting a federal perspective, Alfred Moye notes that the AIR study both assessed the degree to which postsecondary state licensing and approval agencies provide student consumer protection and suggested strategies that might help state agencies acquire stronger laws and enforcement mechanisms. It was found that 48 states and the District of Columbia exercise some sort of licensing authority over private nondegree-granting institutions, and that 38 states exercise specific licensing authority over traditional private nondegree-granting institutions. In presenting a state perspective, T. Edward Hollander suggests that a more generous federal  recognition of the state role in higher education is needed, that state oversight for degree-granting institutions should be in authority of a state agency that is reasonably separated from the everyday political decision-making, and that the state's role with the degree-granting sector may be most effective if its efforts are limited to defining standards and encouraging the establishement of self-policing arrangements within the higher education community. While voluntary accreditation has specific problems, it is argued that state agencies should rely heavily upon voluntary accreditation. Some concerns about potential and actual abuses by state licensing agencies are raised. In presenting a national/federal perspective, John D. Phillips provides information on specific events that  preceded the AIR report and suggests that a massive readjustment in the balance of power between government and other institutions is at issue. It is argued that the possibilities for voluntary self-regulation, preferably through expansion of accreditation processes, need to be explored. (SW)",

The historical antecedents of the AIR study are reviewed. Several policy discussions at the federal level revealed the lack of knowledge about the effectiveness of state licensing in providing consumer protection. The study was based on a detailed analysis of about 95 percent of the total number of state laws and regulations passed before January 1, 1977,  that dealt with institutional licensing and approval. Detailed tables were developed that indicate the consumer protection provisions of state laws and regulations in 14 categories. Additionally, state comparisons were included on such topics as: location of licensing function with the state bureaucracy, authorized enforcement strategies, and treatment of out-of-state institutions. It was found that only 38 states have legal provisions for authorization and oversight of private degree-granting institutions, and, of these, three-quarters contain provisions that make most established institutions exempt from the consumer protection standards of the laws and regulations. Suggested roles for the government and licensing agencies are described. Recommendations by the General Accounting Office  and the federal responses pertain to: the respective roles of the federal and state governments and accrediting associations; dissemination of revised criteria for eligibility; evaluation processes; actions against schools that are guilty of educational malpractice; and guidelines for establishing minimum standards for such matters as advertising, refund policies, and information disclosure.

The complexity of state oversight and the following contributing factors are considered: the widely different administrative organizations for oversight in the different states, the heterogeneity of postsecondary institutions, and the differing philosophical views of the conferees. Other themes include (1) the dedication to equality of  treatment, while recognizing essential differences between institutions, and (2) the idea that oversight and improvement of postsecondary education involves the federal government, state government, and the institutions as represented by their nongovernmental voluntary accrediting organizations. The fundamental nature of state authorization and the state's responsibility to have appropriate statutes and regulations and appropriate administrative strength for enforcement, and ways for each of the three postsecondary education groups to have credibility and improve intercommunication are also addressed. Among the recommendations of the AIR report are the following: USOE should formulate a policy statement to encourage all states to enforce state authorizing and oversight standards that meet  or exceed minimum consumer protection standards; and USOE should ask Congress to provide funds for states that have enacted standards more extensive than those in the ECS model legislation.

In addition to the basic fact that states are the origin of chartering, licensing, and authorization of educational institutions, states have needed to develop more effective laws and agencies and to take more seriously their authorization and regulatory functions. This is in part because of the number of awards of federal funds to institutions, including funds under the G.I. Bill. The growth of postsecondary and higher education during the 1960s and first half of the 1970s and the growing public concern for consumer protection are among the other issues prompting state oversight  and authorization efforts. One forum for state authorizing agencies of proprietary and nondegree programs has been the National Association of State Approval Agencies. The Education Commission of the States (ECS) developed model legislation to assess not only state legislation but also regulations, and to some extent operations. Both the ECS and the Federal Interagency Committee on Education have urged further strengthening of state laws, adoption of ECS model legislation, and development of a clearinghouse for information among states on authorization and on consumer protection. The establishment of the Council of Postsecondary Accreditation and a seminar in 1976 (Keystone) specifically designed for state approval agencies are also noted. Studies that have an impact are also briefly  described. Objectives of the present seminar at Colorado Springs are to review the American Institutes for Research federally funded report, &quot;Study of State Oversight in Postsecondary Education,&quot; problems faced by authorizing agencies, the adequacy of present laws and regulations, and the relations of state oversight operations to accreditation and to the federal government.

Cooperation between the public and private sectors in California exists in many forms, including the support or opposition of legislation. For instance, private university presidents have publicly criticized as inadequate budget recommendations for state universities made by California's two most recent governors, and a public university president has opposed any legislation that threatened to control the educational operations of private colleges. Steps that might promote harmony between the independent and state-supported sectors in Florida include: less talk about segmental interests and more talk about student interests; not talking about saving the private sector but adopting a policy  that allows good colleges to succeed and poor ones to fail; correcting the myth that any funds going to students in private institutions come out of the funds of state-supported universities; dispelling the idea that a college must have a low tuition charge in order to provide access; reexamining the goals of higher education in Florida in light of new conditions and circumstances; and allowing the private sector to participate in statewide decision-making. Recommendations based on a study of private colleges and universities by the California Postsecondary Commission include (1) continuance of existing state policy to assist students with financial need who desire to attend a private institution, and (2) coordination of state policy with changes in federal student assistance programs. It  is also suggested that a healthy private sector is necessary for the achievement of important California goals, which are listed. (SW)",

In response to public criticism that the legislature is too responsive to pressure groups, does not do its business in public, and does not oversee public agencies adequately, legislatures enacted Sunshine laws, requiring a large part of public business to be conducted in public, and Sunset laws, providing for periodic review (and possible elimination) of public agencies. Management and performance oversight of state agencies has also been expanded, and a variety of new budget systems that are designed to provide more information about, and  evaluation of, efficiency of operations have been adopted. Another change in the legislative role that will have implications for higher education is the addition of more legislative staff for policy-making. Traditional expectations of the legislature about higher education and the relation it should have to the legislature include the following: the relationship between the two groups was a personal one, control of higher education was vested in a lay board and was insulated from direct political control, and higher education would prepare people for useful jobs. New expectations or developments include the following: the legislature should exercise oversight over higher education; coordination, regulation, policy-making, and some control of education is necessary at the state level; a  coordinated and centralized communication between higher education and the legislature has evolved; and private institutions have become organized in most states. It is suggested that there will be future emphasis on planning policy analysis, evaluation, performance audit, and other formal analytic methods of assisting decision-making. (SW)",

        "description":"The recent dramatic growth of postsecondary education is reviewed, and the context in which the state legislature and the higher education community will probably interact in the future is described. The era of rapid economic growth following World War II was accompanied by even more rapid increases in demand for college educated workers. Financial aid programs eased the financial burden of attending college. During the 1970's enrollment growth has been slowing down, and the labor market is no longer absorbing the supply of new college graduates. It is suggested that state governments and, in particular, state legislatures are becoming the new power centers for higher education decision-making, which was formerly conducted by educational institutions themselves. This development  is linked to an effort to seek the best organizational responses to reduced growth. Among the concerns for the future is the way and extent that the state will support private higher education, which is being seriously threatened by declining enrollments and increasing costs. The continued ability of the academic sector to provide society with creative and innovative solutions to its problems has been questioned in light of the difficult times. It is suggested that policymakers could foster opportunities for new developments through provision of funds to support innovations. A parochial approach to education seems to have emerged as competition has intensified for students and funds. A survey of 35 governors has revealed the general gubernatorial belief that public higher education is  already adequately funded, and most of them seem more interested in emphasizing greater governmental accountability, increased efficiency, and tighter budgetary controls. It is suggested that with limited resources and increasing demands, legislative funding decisions will become increasingly politicized. (SW)",

        "description":"Perspectives on state oversight in postsecondary education are considered. It is suggested that sufficient disclosures have been made to indicate that at least in recent years with the increased funding provided at the postsecondary level by government there has been enough fraudulence to warrant concern. The problem is to develop adequate oversight to keep fraudulence at a minimum without creating an undue burden on colleges and universities and without establishing a cumbersome bureaucratic structure for either public or private sectors of the economy. There has been difficulty in obtaining sufficient consensus among federal and state governments, educational institutions, and accrediting agencies to enact appropriate legislation and provide funds to deal with the problem of  fraudulence. It is proposed that any expansion of external oversight of postsecondary education should not be limited to any one type of institution, and that strategies should involve both broad discretion and more specific standards. Although much attention has been directed to triad or tripartite relationships in accreditation among federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernmental organizations, there is also a balance of powers between the private and public sectors. Based on the assumption that government will better represent the interests of all people than will the private sector, there has been a trend toward greater strength for the public sector. (SW)",

        "description":"An institutional review of Evergreen State College that was undertaken by the Washington Council for Postsecondary Education is described. A review of a higher education institution by a state agency was unusual but was a compromise action by the 1977 state legislature, which also considered closing the college, whose institutional cost level was high and its enrollment lower than projected. The Council determined that there was potential for enrollment growth, but that it would represent an increase of approximately 90 percent. An examination of Evergreen's accreditation reports revealed that the review committees had consistently given the college high marks. The effectiveness of Evergreen's nontraditional curriculum was assessed through interviewing of current and past  students, employers providing internship or cooperative education experiences for Evergreen students, and high school staff and students. Additionally, the college's placement records were compared with those of other institutions in the state. It was found that the college's academic standards were high, students who attended it were tremendously supportive of the institution, employers were quite satisfied with the quality of graduates they had hired, and the placement level of the college was high, but high school students possessed a negative image of the institution, and Evergreen was not doing very much to counteract these impressions. It was concluded that the college had an effective educational program, but that some changes to meet extant student needs were necessary and that  marketing strategies had to improve. The 20 recommendations of the Council's report, which included enrollment goals, were positively received by the school, and the Legislature rendered the recommendations into statute law. Improvements have resulted at the college. (SW)",

Another paper that considers the role state higher education agencies and government can play in difficult financial times is &quot;Trying To Do Better With Less&quot; by Joseph C. Burke. Suggestions regarding institutional planning are that colleges and  universities should: redefine their mission to be more consistent with strengths of the faculty, available resources, and student needs; reorganize their administrative structure to readjust from the 1960s and 1970s; plan for realistic enrollment expectations and quality of students; reallocate personnel; and streamline the governance process. In turn, the state should encourage institutions in these efforts, stimulate campus leadership in planning, and encourage faculty development programs. (SW)",

It is suggested that boards of education and college trustees have had little basis for a working relationship, and that colleges have felt suspicion or invasion of turf in respect to statewide boards. One hindrance is that college trustees have been entrusted with responsibilities for higher education but most of them are laypersons who have not been professionally prepared and carefully selected for their tasks. In addition, college presidents, who are the principal resource for college trustees, are not trained to prepare them. It is further suggested that college presidents are not motivated to train trustees, and that when it comes to being made aware of the real issues in higher  education, the college trustee is usually the last to know. One of the things that trustees and statewide boards have in common is that both groups are almost universally disliked. Statewide boards may take positive steps by informing trustees of the board's goals. Trustees can help the situation in higher education by taking an active role in influencing colleges and universities toward programs of interinstitutional cooperation, through the statewide boards.

The major period of acceleration in the development of state higher education agencies and boards occurred during 1960 to 1975, the most rapid period of expansion in higher education. While all types of institutions increased in size, by far the major growth was in state institutions. Planning, program review or approval, and budget development are three major areas in which most boards have some responsibility. However, boards vary from state to state both in their powers for carrying out these functions and in the scope of their applicability. Factors contributing to the  formation of the coordinating or governing boards include: increased expenditures, providing budgetary equity among institutions, assuring diversity among state institutions, and avoiding unnecessary duplication. Additional concerns include projected enrollments concerning traditional and nontraditional college students; funding difficulties in higher education; the increased demand for accountability; growing concern for private, proprietary, and vocational institutions; the impact of collective bargaining; and the impact of federal legislation and regulation.

It is proposed that the state's investment in training an associate-level computer programmer should not be the same cost as that for a molecular physicist or lawyer. In addition, it is claimed that there is a need for using the results of educational research when making educational policy decisions. For example, in spite of evidence  indicating the value of smaller and more intimate learning settings, decision-makers have chosen larger and larger campus instructional units. A minimal government role, a conscious effort to deal with educational substance, and questioning about qualitative issues concerning human accomplishment are suggested as guidelines. It is proposed that there is nothing immoral about identifying and rewarding exceptional talent, and the public belief that quality is achieved by dividing educational resources equally among all is questioned.

However, institutions have retained the power to make decisions on the allocation of their revenues, to set academic standards on admission and graduation, and to develop new undergraduate programs.

An important determinant of the future of independent higher education will be public policy. Three major considerations include: private colleges and universities are public resources and serve a predominantly public function; to the extent that private institutions educate citizens of the state, they save the taxpayers money; and it is questionable public policy to expand state-supported institutions while private college facilities lie underutilized. Of primary concern to elected and appointed state officials is the impact of the rapid shift of in-state resident enrollment since the mid-1960s. Data on enrollment trends in North Carolina are  presented as illustration of the decline in the percentage of undergraduates attending private colleges and universities. This change in student choice has resulted in the need for additional facilities and increased operating costs for the state. According to studies, a primary reason students choose public over private colleges is the tuition differential. However, it is suggested that the increased tuition differential between the two sectors has not been as great as has been the increased subsidy to students attending the public sector. It is proposed that a comprehensive scholarship program based on student need be combined with a tuition offset program (addressed to the differential between the two sectors). This proposal is designed to allow students greater choice in selecting a  college. (SW)",

The following higher education components are examined: the institution and its board of trustees, faculty bodies and student bodies, statewide coordinating boards, various state agencies, legislative committees, and federal agencies and courts. Issues facing higher education include declining enrollments, equal opportunity and access to education, educational finance, the missions of institutions or systems, educational quality, institutional autonomy, and long-range planning responsibilities. It is suggested that state government must make its responsibility clear to all  concerned for overall assignment of mission, level of funding, and state policy of access and equality of opportunity. The state must also clarify that statewide planning is within its authority. Within a framework of government policy, institutions should be free to develop their own answers to their needs, and faculty should be free to develop academic programs and student services. It is further suggested that both colleges and state government should keep a check on the federal government's influence in higher education. (SW)",

        "description":"Perspectives on issues in postsecondary education are presented with some reference to Oklahoma. Enrollment trends and the push toward cost effective educational programs are considered, and it is suggested that the important issue is often overlooked: the need to clarify the role of higher education institutions, or what society demands from the educational sector. A collapse of the spirit of community in American society and the growth of groups of people with special interests are seen as overall influential factors. Within the educational sector, there is a temptation to react more to the economic pressures, to react only to the needs of specialization as the top priority. It is proposed that higher education should produce graduates with perspective and not with tunnel  vision, or the point of view of narrow specialization. Additionally, the preservation of the private sector is extremely important for the total system. Among the necessary responses are to avoid duplication of graduate programs. In Oklahoma planning for higher educational programs is a coordinated effort with the public and private sectors participating. It is suggested that it is possible to build areas of excellence in graduate programs, plan together to avoid duplication in the public and private sectors, and enter into some contractual relationships for shared services and resources. There is a need for higher education institutions to relate to the needs of society, and not overproduce teachers, for example. Additional concerns include whether new program development is feasible,  whether new buildings are needed, and how to prepare for change and new roles when old programs are eliminated. (SW)",

Among the planning concerns are the following: to what extent should the nonpublic sector be involved in the statewide review of new and existing programs; how can resources be shared among public and independent sectors; how will the independent sector be involved in policies relating to the provision of learning opportunities for adults; and how and to what extent should the state provide financial support for the nonpublic sector. There is extensive support for need-based student aid as the primary vehicle for state support of independent higher education. Relevant questions pertain to the maximum award level, how  need should be determined, and whether non-need based student aid (tuition offsets) should be available to private colleges. It is suggested that to provide relief to middle income students, it would be necessary to adjust need analysis schedules to require smaller family contributions in the middle and upper middle income ranges. It is suggested that the importance of the private sector is demonstrated by state direct, general purpose support to independent institutions, contracts for general support or for support related to enrollment of low income students, and categorical institutional grants. It is recommended that the composition of an aid program be based on a clear understanding of state goals with respect to postsecondary education, and the role nonpublic institutions play in  achieving them. Other policy questions include who will monitor the accountability of private colleges and what it will involve. (SW)",

Among the areas of concern is the tendency to assess the value of a college education in terms of the individual's earning power in the marketplace, rather than in terms of serving individual identity. It is suggested that independent colleges are among the best places to learn our basic moral and educational heritage as a nation. It is further suggested that increased federal regulation threatens the fundamental ideal of self-government in the states and in higher education institutions. One danger is that as state governments attend to higher education and to the public and private sectors, they will also exert too much governmental control. A positive step was taken with  the reorientation of the federal role in higher education toward primary reliance upon student aid programs and support for middle income students. It is proposed that the federal legislation should be matched by efforts to expand state programs. Another major policy is the gradual replacement of restricted categorical programs with capitation grants to colleges based on general service standards. Regardless of the type of aid, it is proposed that policy should be: service to students with funding based on enrollment in a free-choice educational marketplace; intervention in the marketplace to prevent unfair competition, program duplication, and coordination to meet program needs; and containment of governmental overkill.

Illinois tries to respond to the separate priorities of guaranteeing both access and reasonable choice. Over 60 percent of students at public four-year colleges, and about 18 percent of students attending community colleges receive need-based aid. The need-based student aid program is available to full-time and half-time students and to all students regardless of their academic standing. The need to coordinate with federal financial aid programs is emphasized. Additionally, some kind of formula based on the accessibility of loans is recommended. Illinois' maximum award has grown over time from about $600 in the beginning, to a current $1,650. Illinois has also stabilized the enrollments between the  public and private schools in the state so that institutions equally share the situations of enrollment growth or enrollment decline. It is projected that half-time students will increasingly seek to participate in postsecondary education and jobs, or other pursuits. The importance of scheduling financial aid decisions to provide students with flexibility in their enrollment decisions is noted. Concerns related to accountability include the institutions' determination of eligibility of funds. Some audits may determine whether the packaging of aid is within the guidelines established by the state. Institutions also need to have clear refund policies that are implemented by state authorities and that protect students. (SW)",

The philosophy in Pennsylvania regarding the survival of private institutions is to provide money to the students, the consumers, and let them decide which institutions fit their basic needs and goals. Pennsylvania has established the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Corporation, which puts $72 to $75 million a year into the student market as direct grants. About $68 million comes from the State Treasury, and the rest is made up of federal dollars and earnings. In addition, Pennsylvania has developed an Institutional Assistance Grant program. Pennsylvania takes the money made available by the legislature and divides it by the number of students who have received grants from  private institutions. They then divide out the available money, up to $400 per student. Pennsylvania has also started to move back into direct aid to private institutions. Pennsylvania's system involves: a state-owned system that receives from the treasury virtually all of its money (14 colleges), state-related institutions that receive most of their funds from the state (three institutions), the community college system that receives one-third from tuition and one-third from a local sponsor, and private institutions that receive several million dollars from the state (13 institutions). A brief comparison to the situation in Massachusetts is made. Massachusetts provides need-based aid to students, and the law says that 75 percent of the state aid must go to students who attend private  institutions. Massachusetts also allows students to take their money and go to a college in another state. (SW)",

        "description":"To highlight forces that impede constructive relationships between legislators and agency representatives, advice is offered on presenting testimony in legislative sessions or providing information to a legislator, based on the viewpoint of a state legislator. It is advisable to avoid approaching legislators with the attitude that they are the uninformed and are unable to deal with the complexities of the witnesses' specialized field. Since the legislator will make the decisions, the witness should not present statistical data without interpreting it so that the legislator can understand it. Witnesses should avoid a very lengthy presentation and overused generalizations that proposed legislation is not needed because the function is already being done or because it will be very  costly to implement. Presenting information that is false or inaccurate is probably the most destructive form of testimony. A direct and organized approach is essential. Guidelines include the following: know the issue being addressed and the facts that support the position presented; be clear and brief; have all relevant cost figures; offer to answer questions or to send answers to questions that cannot be immediately answered; present any relevant past experience; do not be evasive or antagonistic; use demonstration materials such as charts, graphs, or pictures; do not assume legislators have read material sent to them; and respect time allotments for presentations. In addition to testifying or directly contacting legislators, agency personnel may want to support their cause with a  long-range educational campaign to win interest and sympathy for programs. It must be remembered that the legislator has to consider many factors, including the taxpayer who pays the bill. (SW)",

In &quot;Life in the Centrifuge--Panel Remarks,&quot; Howard R. Boozer suggests that higher education as part of a political arena has to compete for resources. Governors and legislatures have created planning, coordinating, and governing boards to assist them in allocating available resources. The boards must interact with institutions, state government, local and regional interests, and federal interests. In &quot;College: The Center of the Universe,&quot; G. Theodore Mitau describes the atmosphere of higher education before and after World War II with  reference to academic requirements, the mission of state teachers colleges, land-grant universities, liberal arts colleges, faculty recruitment, broadened access with the G. I. Bill of Rights, the importance of a college education for personal success, and the continuing growth in enrollments in the 1960s. Additionally, a summary of remarks of Luis Nogales concerning the Bakke decision is presented. Among the points are the following: the use of race as an admission parameter has been affirmed; there is a need to redress the underrepresentation of educationally disadvantaged ethnic groups in graduate and professional programs; the same minority groups who are underrepresented in advanced educational programs are the most underserved in critical human service areas, such as health care and  legal assistance.

It is also rising to higher levels of government, including the federal government. This is correlated with relatively new sources of financial support and with accountability requirements. The traditional concept of institutional governance is endangered. The single most important factor accelerating this trend is the rapid rise of educational costs and the need for higher outlays of public funds. State budget and planning officers are beginning to play the critical role played by the Office of Management and Budget and the General Accounting Office at the national level. Legislators are also better  educated than in the past. Combined with a profound mistrust of established authority, the scene is set for administrators and coordinating boards involving an ambience of hostility, distrust, ambiguity, discontent, and criticism. The decade ahead will require strong leadership in five functions: planning, evaluation, accountability, certification, and licensing; informed state and regional advisory councils; and the self-initiated correction of institutional weaknesses. In the absence of the latter and strong coordinating board leadership, authority will either flow into the hands of agencies with conflicting goals or centralized in the state budget director. A clear distinction is to be made between institutional governance and statewide coordination, which serve very different  functions in higher education. (MSE)",

The coordinating board may help the situation by making funding recommendations that require assigning priorities to specific programs in the overall long-range plan.

In addition, it is necessary to move from using only quantitative measures for deciding what programs to continue to refund, and it is obviously inadvisable to produce two or three times as many teachers as can be absorbed into the system. It is suggested that faculty members of the colleges of education be utilized for inservice training in the elementary and  other education systems.

Virginia's legislature operates on a 60-day calendar basis, has an executive budget, and the governor has item veto power. The budget process requires that constituencies needing appropriations provide their requests well in advance, perhaps six or seven months before the legislative session. It is suggested that in spite of declining enrollments in other parts of the country, the South is experiencing an increase in higher education enrollments, and the state-supported institutions cannot take all of the applicants. Virginian politics has followed the belief that educational officials should be nonpartisan, and  Virginia and Massachusetts have the largest number of citizens on policy boards in universities. The large number of citizens on public college and university boards is a reason that a strong centralized governing body would be impossible. It is proposed that diversity within the types of colleges and universities is preferable to the creation of one big state university. The importance of educational officials being informed about bills that affect higher education and being available to provide information during the legislative session is emphasized.

Specific interactions with respect to authorization or appropriations bills under consideration are described to provide some insight on the legislative process. The following  predictions are offered: total dollar support will keep up with inflation at best; few new programs will be enacted and the emphasis will be on student assistance; and there will be continued demands on institutions through exercise of regulatory powers. It is also suggested that there will be an increasing state role in postsecondary education, and that most states should increase support to the private sector. Specific suggestions for state agency strategy include the following: become bipartisan and influence through informal networks; emphasize leadership development for both full-time personnel and nonagency key persons; identify and involve laypersons; and designate one staff person to be accountable for monitoring federal policy process.

It is suggested that one of the dangers in data collection operations is collecting data without knowing why. It is argued that unless one knows in advance what is being measured and the purposes of measurement, data should not be collected. Principles that are followed in New York include the following: before data are collected, an attempt is made to determine whether or not that data are going to help make a decision or influence a decision; an attempt is made to feed back information on how the data were used to the institutions that furnish the data; and data collection costs to the institution are estimated. Data are collected in New York in relationship to four  different kinds of activities: measuring progress toward goals, for purposes of accountability, for decision-making, and for planning. Much of the state's data collection activities are designed to measure, by institution and by sector, progress toward four goals for postsecondary education: open access, maintenance of a comprehensive system including all types of institutions to match all types of student needs; provision of special educational opportunities for persons from groups excluded previously from higher education; and commitment to excellence and quality. Specific ways in which data collection supports these goals are discussed. New York's long-range goal is to implement the National Center for Higher Education Management System (NCHEMS) planning model online, which involves  getting most of the institutions into the NCHEMS format and minimizing data requirements to the kinds of questions that will likely be needed on a regular basis.

It is suggested that scholars fear a future in which educational decisions may be made according to numbers or by state agency staff who may lack expertise about the issues in higher education. Part of the relationship between state agencies and colleges is influenced by the analysis of data and subsequent conclusions. It is a political tactic to display only those pieces of information that are supportive of a preconceived position, and data elements can be aggregated using decision rules that maximize some comparative figures and minimize  others. Data can be manipulated in many ways so as to mislead decision-makers, and decision-makers can choose to base judgments on only scraps of evidence. Faculty suspect that state agency staff and the general public neither understand nor appreciate their unique working style or professional role, and institutional administrators fear loss of autonomy to manage their own campuses. It is proposed that all parties may feel more comfortable if there are clear policy statements guaranteeing certain decisions and responsibilities to each group. One necessary step is to develop a Bill of Rights at the state level so that all participants will have a clear understanding of how the state higher education system is to operate. Additionally, a clear statement defining the sequence of events  within the planning and budgeting processes and specifications for a statewide data base and management information system could be developed. Emphasis could be placed on collecting only those data elements that are essential for the prescribed planning and budgeting process. (SW)",

        "description":"Factors contributing to the struggle for survival faced by postsecondary institutions and ways to deal with dwindling resources, in particular by regionalism and regionalization, are considered. Among the contributing factors are the leveling off of the college-age population (18-21-year-olds), the declining status of advanced learning in American society, and the possibly continuing decline in financial support. One possible response is for colleges and universities to make the human and material resources they already have stretch further. Five dilemmas that confront resource use coordinators are as follows: how to maintain institutional autonomy; whether decisions should be made by consensus, majority vote, or edict; how to implement decisions in light of expanding collective  bargaining; and how to obtain staffing and other resources to do the work of resource allocators. It is suggested that regionalism in higher education is emerging as a middle-ground position in state-level coordination and planning for higher education and may avoid both monolithic, centralized statewide control and a bad market model. Based on preliminary findings of a national study, it is suggested that regional cooperation between institutions be officially recognized by by an authoritative agency in the state. Official recognition can separate the concept of regionalism as an aspect of statewide planning and coordination of postsecondary education from the more general phenomenon of voluntary consortium arrangements among institutions. Thirty-one states have engaged in study of  regionalizing postsecondary education, and 47 patterns of regionalization have been identified. Seven states have moved into regionalization by virtue of an enabling statutory action. (SW)",

Although historically state-supported universities were autonomous, the decade following World War II brought greater state involvement. Increasingly, political rather than educational considerations governed decisions regarding the division of monies among the universities and colleges. Most states have established a single agency to coordinate and plan postsecondary education. Boards were given authority to recommend the establishment of new institutions, the expansion of existing ones, and other functions. The fiscal situation is a major concern for the future. The impact of inflation and a stable income or a decreased rate of increase of that income has  had quality and programmatic effects, and has affected the expectations and morale of citizens. Declining enrollment trends will mean extreme competition for traditional students and expanded educational offerings to other age groups: adults, inmates, shut-ins, and others. It is advocated that caution be exercised to avoid further deterioration of academic standards. It is projected that because of educational, economic, and political necessities central coordinating boards may appear ineffective advocates from the universities' standpoint, and as ineffective managers from the legislative standpoint. It is suggested that it is important to the welfare of higher education that governing boards survive. (SW)",

The board is characterized by its limited powers, its nonpolitical base, and its restricted clientele. In dealing with the executive agency, it is important to make the governor aware that the coordinating or governing board represents an important resource in terms of politics. It is important to anticipate the information the governor will want sometime in the future and to be prepared. It is also important to stay out of the governor's way politically, because coordinating/governing boards do not do very well against governors. In dealing with the legislative branch, it is generally true  that the legislature as a whole has a consciousness approximately at the level of the general public, while the various committees related to education tend to have a high level of sophistication. Committees expect coordinating/governing board representatives to be available, have answers, and do work that their staffs generally handle. Dealing with committees concerned with finance is also addressed. Another important interrelationship is with the judicial branch. The courts' interpretations will affect fiscal freedom and institutional autonomy. The attorney general's opinions and the court's opinions probably will make the difference in whether or not higher education is cut severely through attacks on tenure, on faculty status, and on the rights to offer programs. In addition, there is  a whole set of other interagency relationships with budget agencies. licensing agencies, and other essential groups. It is necessary to have open relationships at the top and some kind of regular communication. Lower-level staff should also develop working relationships with staff of other agencies. (SW)",

It is suggested that faculty and college administrators can be either an internal or external group in relationship to the planning process. The federal government, or the state government, passes legislation that may have both indirect and unintended impacts on postsecondary education and state planning for education. The Vocational Education Act, the Buckley Amendment, and the Erwin Act are cited as examples. When federal funds became available to students or to institutions, the federal government used the accreditation process as a criteria for establishing eligibility for receipt of federal funds. The opening of federal programs to proprietary institutions and  their students not only tremendously increased the numbers of institutions but also the possibilities for below standard and fraudulent operations. Around 1970, there were a number of states that did not have legislation or regulations that applied to degree-granting, nonprofit institutions or to proprietary institutions. The Education Commission of the States developed model state legislation for authorization of institutions to operate and grant degrees. The default rate for the guaranteed loan programs, the growth of the consumer movement, and the issue of educational malpractice are other areas of concern. It is suggested that major concerns are the states' role in licensing, chartering, and regulating, and the need for private accrediting groups and state agencies to work together.  (SW)",

The difficulty of providing postsecondary education in view of reduced funds is noted. It is suggested that the expectation that adult students will help solve the problem of fewer traditional aged college students should be questioned. There may be a gap between the potential adult education population and the actual population willing to participate in formal classes. Additionally, it takes four or five part-time students to generate one full-time equivalent, and colleges and universities will be competing with industry, the military, and even high schools for the adult education market. It is suggested that if the public is less willing to pay  more taxes, it will be necessary to develop a flexible, efficient, low-cost, and accountable system of postsecondary education. The Pennsylvania Senate Bill 551 calls for a citizens commission to study the governance, structure, and financing of postsecondary education. The commission would be composed of legislators and private citizens and would address such fundamental questions as the following: whether the four-year approach to undergraduate education is pricing itself out of existence; whether Pennsylvania can tolerate its patchwork and chaotic classification of postsecondary educational institutions; whether the state should emphasize direct student aid or institutional subsidy; additional approaches, if any, the state adopts to encourage noninstitutional postsecondary education  and learning; and whether the state should define with greater precision the purposes, policies, and programs it supports in the private sector.

It is proposed that federal total dollar support will keep up with inflation at best, but few new programs will ensue, and there will be strong emphasis on student financial assistance.

Both institutions and boards have legitimate claims on many of the same or similar postsecondary powers. It is suggested that if both sides would recognize the other's legal authority, both parties might develop a more conciliatory attitude toward the other. Because all decisions regarding state-institutional relations are value laden, there is a  need to seek a balance between the differences between the two groups. Values basic to state agencies are the efficient use of resources and the promotion of institutional responsiveness. Institutions insist that they must be left alone if they are to satisfy such purposes as the critical evaluation of society and the transmission and advancement of learning and wisdom. Institutions want both academic freedom and institutional autonomy. A typical accountability question being asked by state boards is the cost to produce one baccalaureate degree. Holding organizations and their actors accountable for performance is one of the prime purposes of managerial control or accountability.

The first and basic principle is the need for a clear and categorical mandate for state planning. A second principle is to develop full knowledge of the authority and responsibilities for postsecondary education of the several segments of state government. The primary postsecondary planning body and its staff should seek effective means to keep both the executive and legislative branches fully informed of the priority needs, problems, strengths, and future plans for postsecondary education. Close communication must be maintained with other state and regional agencies. A third principle is that the current and projected status of all  existing units in the postsecondary education enterprise be fully understood. The planning agency should give study to the goals and conditions in the public, private, and proprietary postsecondary institutions. Fourthly, it is essential that proper differentiation and attention be directed within the on-going planning process to the components of total planning: strategic planning and tactical planning. Strategic planning establishes the broad frame of reference, the fundamental premises and the philosophies and purposes to be observed in tactical planning, which focuses on a limited set of issues that have high priority. Additionally, sufficient current, relevant, and reliable data must be developed and maintained, and timely and continuous dissemination of information must be insured.  There must exist both the capacity and willingness to make and implement decisions, and both the planning process and plans should be given periodic review and evaluation. It is also important to recognize that different participants in the planning process can have an impact on planning. (SW)",

In &quot;Educational Program Budgeting in Oklahoma,&quot; Edwaro J. Coyle and Dan S. Hobbs outline the principles, procedures, and processes utilized by the state in the development of institutional needs for educational and general funds. The new budgeting by educational program system in Oklahoma is concerned with instruction, research, and extension. It is suggested that state-level budgeting by educational program is superior to the old system of budgeting by educational function in that it is more responsive to changing conditions; it ties program approval directly to the budget-development process; and  it is more readily communicated to the legislature and the public than the previous system. The second conference paper by Robert Berdahl discusses accountability in public higher education. It is suggested that a Legislative Program Evaluation movement and sunset legislation (to evaluate and either terminate or continue state agencies) appear to indicate that the state governments may want to evaluate how good a job educational institutions are doing (output evaluation). The third conference by Thurston E. Manning considers program evaluation. Evaluations involve judgments about the effectiveness and efficiencies of institutions or programs, and about the improvement of institutional or program effectiveness or efficiency. It is suggested that there is a need for states to develop  clearer statements of purpose for institutions, especially the public institutions and to have a broad base for making judgments about educational quality.

        "description":"The crucial role of the states in postsecondary education and the changing conditions in higher education are addressed. It is noted that the states constitute the largest single source of funding for higher education and have the largest investment in it, and historically and constitutionally are primarily responsible for education. Important trends are declining college enrollments and the need to develop new student clienteles, including older citizens, who may require major changes in curriculum, services, and modes of instruction. There is also public concern with what appears to be overproduction of highly educated manpower (undergraduate and graduate levels). Inflation and decreased funding for education are major concerns, along with the demand for greater accountability  by the general public and state government. A more recent development of significance has been the creation of independent legislative or executive auditing agencies concerned with both fiscal audit and performance audit (linking expenditures to outcome or results). Another factor has been the tendency on the state level toward increased centralization not only in planning and coordination but in governance and structure of public higher education. Concern is expressed that the states are spending considerable amounts on postsecondary vocational education, sometimes in direct duplication of occupational programs in community colleges and even regional colleges. It is suggested that there is need for directness in communication between higher education and state government, including  legislators, the chief executive, and their staff, along with a need for effective statewide and institutional planning and attention to outcomes.

Additional issues include the following: the need for information concerning labor market requirements for graduate-level educated persons; mechanisms for allocating resources in line with shifting requirements; the need for accountability for funds, programs, and fair practices; the need to recognize adult learning needs; and the need for communication and interaction among postsecondary and state leaders. Three pressing problem areas are educational  finance, relationships with private institutions, and education for productive living. It is suggested that there is a need to examine the procedures used for determining the size and distribution of state funds, and that funding formulas may not be appropriate in a stable system. Other concerns that should be examined are the balance between aid to students and aid to institutions, the relationship between tuition and state support, and the relationship between job markets and education and the balance between education for vocational skill development and education for a productive and satisfying life.

        "description":"Problems confronting higher education are considered from the perspective of state coordinating agencies. Ten obvious problems are as follows: adjusting to new enrollment patterns; attempting to close the cost-income gap; expenditures increasing more rapidly than income; supporting the capacity for research and advanced study; meeting new educational needs of the population; working for more effective use of resources in institutions; encouraging diversity and helping colleges and universities to retain vitality and flexibility; continuing the progress toward social justice both in enrollment and employment; creating conditions that foster self-help and local initiative in institutions; and maintaining the proper balance between the inner direction of institutions and external  influences upon them. It is suggested that, except in functions such as resource allocation or setting procedures, the state tends not to be a very good substantive planner. Furthermore, the state is not very good at being an entrepreneur/manager, nor a means for reconciling diverse interests. It is claimed that in the present times of declining enrollment growth and declining growth of finances, the state is being called on to do the things that it does not do very well. Some possible solutions, things that can be done at the state level and that do speak to the obvious problems, are suggested. It is recommended that coordinating agencies can develop a better understanding of the cost pressures in labor/intensive activities, and that they can elicit expertise to assess and act on the  impact of inflation. Additionally, there is a need to review state goals in the new context of higher education and to measure state effort in moving toward those goals, to develop new procedural relationships for required planning, and to determine strategies for influencing federal policy.

In the introduction to the 1978 conference on statewide coordination and governance in the 1980s, Jerome M. Pollack suggests that emerging statewide boards for coordination and/or governance have become the major agency affecting higher education and that higher education policies must also address what is occurring in other elements of society. In another paper James Rosser considers how collective bargaining has changed the nature of the collegial governance  system. There also has emerged public employee relations types of commissions that have affected the internal management and administration of higher education institutions, and there have been changes in the nature of grievance procedures, new interpretations of due process, academic freedom, students' role in faculty appointments and tenure decisions, and reduction-in-force clauses in contracts. Perspectives on the legislative role are offered in a paper by H. A. Goltz. It is suggested that legislative staffs are becoming a force of their own, and sometimes it is difficult to make a distinction between a staff responsibility and a staff's becoming a policy-maker in its own right. The state legislature is also listening to what the public thinks higher education should be doing. Excerpts  from the 1977 conference by Burton R. Clark include five lessons from abroad, including the notions that central bureaucracy cannot effectively coordinate higher education and that institutional differentiation is needed. (SW)",

After briefly noting historical trends in Montana and the United States regarding education, concerns and trends in higher education are noted as follows: accountability to the public for how tax dollars are spent; evidence that there will be decreased demand for traditional higher education on the part of high school graduates; nontraditional students, including adults and women, pursuing schooling at all levels of higher education; the possibility of excess capacity in physical facilities at all educational levels; financial difficulties as educational costs continue to rise while enrollments decrease; and problems in the ability of institutions to be innovative in responding to needs and  demands for new programs. It is suggested that only with precise enrollment projections, perhaps to 1990, can decisions concerning university planning occur. There is a need for continual review of objectives and programs of higher education units and for collaboration and innovation among university system units. Examples of the types of efforts required for improved management of educational resources in Montana include: a long-range plan for a coordinated system of higher education, including public and private institutions; the development of a coordinated system to provide appropriate opportunities for vocational, technical, and general continuing education and training; the development of new ways to provide heat, light, and power; the development of a plan to encourage maximum use  of underutilized school facilities for nonschool purposes; and an effort to solve the reading difficulties among children and adults in Montana.

The following responsibilities for statewide coordination and governance are suggested: planning for steady or decreasing enrollments (retrenchment); taking into account in the planning process the total postsecondary educational resources (public, private, and proprietary); relating expenditures to outcomes, to performance audit; reviewing the budgeting process and formulas in terms of their adequacy to deal with problems of contraction; taking in consideration other state priorities; statewide, interstate and regional planning for adult and continuing education and lifelong learning; understanding the issues in collective bargaining and the impact of bargaining on statewide planning, program review, and financing; and understanding state implications of federal programs.

It is suggested that the trustee should be concerned about what is best for postsecondary education in the state generally as well as for the specific institution. The future trends indicate declining college enrollments, which require planning strategies by governing boards. If trustees do not face the fact of a declining demand for their services, state government may step in to make such decisions. Actions to increase enrollments that could have adverse consequences include: offering scholarships based on some criteria other than financial need, creating new programs or offering old programs at new locations (regardless of demonstrated need), lowering tuitions (or not raising them  when indicated), or lowering admissions or graduation standards. It is claimed that these actions will cast doubt on the reputation of public postsecondary education among state policy-makers, and they might hasten the transfer of the locus of power from the campus to the capitol. The net effect of most of the actions would be to increase the price for those already enrolled or likely to be enrolled, and the price will be paid chiefly by the taxpayers of the state. Possible strategies that trustees should consider include the following: undertaking contingency plans, one dealing with a projected decline in enrollments of 5 percent over the next ten years and another based on a decline of 15 percent; promoting cooperative degree programs; increasing part-time adult enrollments; providing  adult education by television through cooperation with other colleges; and establishing recruitment centers throughout the state in cooperation with other institutions. It is emphasized that trustees should view themselves as trustees of the public interest and not just of a particular institution. (SW)",

It is suggested that educational targeting be undertaken: a coalition of planners, financers, and deliverers of postsecondary education should establish goals to meet perceived societal needs. Out of these goal statements, priorities for state funding could be established and incentives offered to those institutions willing to accept the challenge. Colleges and universities must help the legislature by establishing benchmarks for measuring the effectiveness of the program. Each new educational target would contain information about starting dates, ending dates, and magnitude of expected impact. Difficulties nontraditional programs encounter in relation to state funding policies are considered, along with ways that  colleges can provided needed information to help legislators evaluate programs for which funds are requested. Among the problems associated with evaluating nontraditional programs are the following: use of the credit hour as a measure of productivity poses difficulties for many nontraditional curricula; many new programs are aimed at finding more efficient ways of educating through the use of paraprofessionals, and some funding formulas do not allow faculty salary money to be transferred to other line items. Legislators have indicated a need for instructions on measuring impact, when an educational impact statement is provided. Legislators also want information on the outcomes of education. A model for assessing the value of educational programs is briefly described in terms of measuring  the attainment of its content objective, actual student dollars spent for education, foregone earnings due to job dislocation for study, and psychological costs or benefits.

Among the new developments and practices that illustrate the use of quantitative approaches to management are the following: basic structures for categorizing programs and activities for reporting and analysis; procedures for determing unit costs; financial reporting and audit guidelines; and use of measures of outcomes of higher education. Major categories of legislative concern are that: higher education institutions be run efficiently; higher education institutions have effective and relevant programs; institutions and programs needing funding be identified; and the degree of state support for postsecondary education be determined relative to other  state priorities. It is noted that efficiency does not indicate program effectiveness, and that quantitative approaches may indicate the efficiency of an institution, but not how to make an institution more efficient. It is suggested that quantitative approaches to assessing opinions about value, success, and satisfaction with programs may help decision-makers in judging program effectiveness. It is claimed that quantitative approaches have helped very little, except in improving basic data, in determining what should be funded and to what extent. The future possibility of having an access to a higher education rate, a scholastic achievement rate, a cost of education rate, and other types of indicators is noted to stimulate thinking about additional options.

Among the significant issues facing legislators and educators is the demand for comparable data, which can be useful for decision-making or can be misused to fit the views or objectives of a particular group. Issues about which there are many questions needing resolution are the following: state support of private higher education, providing access to education to adult learners, the effort toward centralization of educational activities through the formation of coordinating boards, and the move to regionalism. It is suggested that as costs go up, enrollments are leveling off, and money is scarce, institutional and legislative leaders are looking to regional planning, as opposed to  statewide planning or absolute institutional autonomy as a better use of limited funds. It is proposed that regional approach within a state is as important as the regional approach at the interstate level. Coordination can help colleges to avoid wasteful duplication and harmful competition. The issue of regionalism is closely related to the role of the statewide coordinating group, which has to relate to both the governor and legislature on the one hand and to the educational establishment on the other. It is suggested that politics inevitably play a significant role in the decision-making arena of higher education. It is suggested that the increasing legislative demand for accountability is not interference by the government, nor is responsible budget cutting. It is proposed that  interference occurs when the legislature impinges on the academic integrity of the institutions by attempting to make decisions about governance, institutional management, academic policy, and other institutional functions.

Among the causes of problems facing private higher education are rising cost per student, especially in graduate education; the market limit on tuition rises; and growing competition with public institutions for program offerings and facilities. Reasons for the state to support private institutions include: private institutions are a basic part of the American tradition, they perform a public mission, and they offer education and cultural options. The following concerns are addressed: the need for a state policy regarding the private colleges, the need for program monitoring, including consideration of the independent sector in statewide planning, the essentials of institutional  autonomy and independence, and the extent of state control of private institutions. Among the need-based aid alternatives are the following: direct institutional grants to institutions, tuition equalization grants, contracts, and cost of education grants to institutions. One-half of the states have need-based aid, which limits payments to tuition and required fees. One-third of the states have tuition equalization aid, and three states have direct grants to institutions. Some of the approaches of specific states are noted. (SW)",

        "description":"Concerns relating to the economics of higher education, including inflation, are considered. It is suggested that future sources of rising costs are energy, equipment, books, and federal requirements, and that another major economic concern involves trends in enrollments and in tuition revenues. Projections of declining enrollments should be subjected to further analysis, since college enrollments depend on economics and politics as well as demographics. Population trends in the different states vary markedly above and below the national average, and only 25 to 50 percent of the college-aged population are actually enrolled in college. It is noted that while college and universities are seeking to attract adult students to compensate for the decline in 18- to 24-year-old cohorts,  those institutions facing the sharpest enrollment declines are not necessarily those best located to attract larger numbers of adults. The federal government attempt to redefine equality of access in narrow economic terms, using a concept of net price, is criticized, along with proposals for tuition tax credits. Other economic factors include the future decline in veterans' benefits, which indirectly provide financial support to higher education, and a relative shift of federal revenue sources from income taxes to employment taxes, which erodes the benefits of the tax-exempt status of higher education institutions. Additionally, the burden of federal program requirements, the need for new budgeting formulas, meeting capital requirements, the need for better analysis of college financial  conditions, state and federal roles, legislative cycles, and research funding are addressed.

        "description":"The feasibility and potential relevance of comprehensive planning models for postsecondary education are examined, focusing on the two most widely discussed models of this type: (1) the Postsecondary Education Financing Model (PEFM) of the National Commission on the Financing of Postsecondary Education, and (2) the Federal Planning Model (FPM) of the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems, Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education. The broader context within which such analyses are pursued are considered, identifying the important dimensions of the postsecondary education sector that must be captured by any prototype model. An attempt is made to provide an alternative strategy for enhancing understanding of the postsecondary education sector and the  functional effectiveness of both public and private policies. Areas in which potential students and institutions directly interact include the following: admission policies, standards of academic performance, responsiveness of academic programs to labor market conditions, and pricing and financial aid policies. Important aspects of internal organization include faculty composition and the general mix of activities undertaken by faculty. The FPM includes a student demand model, which is short-run, comparatively static, and positive, and an institutional model that has both long-run and short-run and both static and dynamic components. FPM is essentially a model of a single institution. The PEFM predicts changes in the future configuration of the postsecondary system from National Center  for Education Statistics benchmarks induced by specific policy actions. It is concluded that each model has major weaknesses at both a conceptual level and at the level of empirical implementation. (SW)",

        "description":"The planning relationship between the federal government and the states, and between each state and its higher education institutions are considered. The federal government's role in higher education has had three major components: regulation, support of research in universities, and support of student aid programs. Federal regulation has particularly addressed equity issues, including participation of women and minorities, and has been justified because some of the states had failed to exercise an adequate role in this area. There has not been significant state involvement in federal support for research. Federal aid to students has been designed to provide increased access for the economically disadvantaged, middle income students, and other special populations, and has been  developed without much involvement of either the states or institutions. It is suggested that it is important to the states to have a relationship with the federal government in formulating and implementing policy in regard to federal support to students, research, and health manpower and education. Planning linkages between the state agency and public and private institutions are addressed. It is suggested that most colleges are not managed internally in accordance with a plan and that planning needs to be addressed to issues in addition to planning for retrenchment. Other possible directions are to increase legislative and executive branch involvement in planning in the future, provide the necessary mix of quality improvement goals and resource reallocation and efficiency goals in the  plan, and use statements of goals and objectives in state plans as a basis for evaluation.

Illinois is currently engaged in the conceptual design of a computerized management information system that will contain as a subset the State Level Information Base (SLIB) being developed under the auspices of the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems. A review of the planning agency's statutory responsibilities is the first step in the design of an information system. The statute will specify the areas of involvement for a planning agency, such as program review and approval, which prescribes the types of information that must be available in the information and indicates  what issues the agency is likely to confront. Before designing the information system, it is necessary to attempt to determine what directions higher education will be taking. A 10-year master plan by the Illinois Board of Education concerns enrollment planning; student access; faculty and staff resources; program planning, review, and evaluation; operational funding; and facilities, space, and capital planning. An information system must also address routine needs--such as budget preparation, program approval, and institutional reports--and the data must be collected according to agreed upon definitions and procedures so that adversaries cannot argue that the data are bad, and that an effective spokesperson can interpret the results in terms that the policy maker can understand.

The role of leadership, various styles of leadership, and strategies for implementing the development of leadership are discussed. Leadership qualities demanded by regionalism that are different from leadership qualities needed in other areas of higher education and in other fields are also considered. In the report &quot;Regionalism in American Postsecondary Education: Concepts and Practices,&quot; S. V. Martorana and Lawrence A. Nespoli suggest three strategies for organizations: the authoritative/coercive tactic, the incentive funding tactic, and the programmatic/opportunistic tactic (a combination of the first two). In the third model where decisive authority is used in  circumstances meriting action and incentives are used when less aggression is required, flexibility and good judgment are required of the leader. Harry Levinson's &quot;The Exceptional Executive&quot; identifies the specific types of leaders: shaman, who uses personal powers; priest, who claims power through the office; elected leader, who goes through some time of preparation to achieve the position; missionary, whose mission involves a utopian view of the future and a program to achieve reforms; and mystic healer, an altruist and creator who seeks to find causes. Three areas of knowledge that are needed to accomplish the important mission of achieving regionalism are as follows: knowledge of higher education, knowledge of government, and knowledge of human relations. Other qualities that are  necessary are flexibility of character, facility for negotiation, and the ability to look to the future. Strategies for developing leadership include special institute programs run by universities or agencies. (SW)",

It is suggested that the decision was like a remand to the nation and especially to the universities to try to devise and work toward affirmative action programs within certain parameters. Justice Powell gives the schools a great degree of latitude but does give guidance for the necessary self-analysis that now must occur. First, all two-track systems and all overt and covert quotas must be eliminated, except where imposed by court order to correct past discrimination. Second, pre-Bakke race-conscious programs, especially nondiversity predicated programs (e.g., those which directly sought to counter the effects of societal discrimination) must be evaluated. It is suggested that the kinds of diversity beyond  race and ethnicity that are legitimate for a medical or law school are open for discussion. Justice Powell's opinion in regard to citing the fundamental 14th Amendment conflict and First Amendment concepts of academic freedom raises some conceptual questions. However, he does not require universities to seek diversity, but approves of the goal under the rubric of academic freedom. Now work must be done to make legitimate affirmative action efforts with individualized determinations and without divisive quotas and two-track systems. At the same time affirmative action has been endorsed. Within these parameters, those on both sides of the Bakke case now have guidelines within which to work constructively together. (SW)",

        "author":["Fincher, Cameron"],
        "description":"The uses and applications of testing in education and the implications of the Bakke decision are considered. Pluralism and diversity in education have convinced many observers that a different philosophy or theory of testing is needed. Alternative uses are sought in ways that would shift the aptitudes and general intelligence to skills and competencies. The changing emphasis from measurement to assessment reflects the educational need to appraise those changes in behavior and performance that presumably are the result of learning and development. Differences of ranking are not needed as much as an acceptable way to determine if learners have mastered some standard of performance. Testing concepts and methods are needed to help appraise instructional methods and materials, program  structure and content, and overall program effectiveness in bringing about desired outcomes and results. The intent of educational testing needs to concentrate on accomplishments rather than potential. It is suggested that positive uses of tests can result from a shift from selection per se to placement, advisement, counseling, and program assessment. Specific uses served by testing include instructional improvement and learning facilitation and assessment of: basic skills, academic competencies in general education, college academic programs, learning difficulties, and learning outcomes. The Bakke decision indicated that if achievement of diversity for educational purposes is to be an admissions function, colleges must prepare to deal with human qualities that are complementary to those  that can be handled within traditional testing contexts. It is suggested that the Supreme Court case provides an important context in which public policy concerning the uses of standardized tests must be debated. (SW)",

Although the Court said that race may be a factor in the admissions process, many people, with the effect of headlines of &quot;Bakke Wins,&quot; think otherwise. A concern is whether corporate and educational officials will use the ambiguities of the Bakke decision to weaken or even abandon their affirmative action commitments. It is suggested that affirmative action programs have come about only because of insistent pressures of black people and their allies, and only because sufficient pressure was brought to enact laws and compliance mechanisms mandating black participation in American  institutional life. It is proposed that the merit system was invoked to keep blacks out, on the basis of test scores and grade averages, but that the system could find room for C students who play football or are born into the family of a wealthy alumnus. It is further proposed that even a merit system based solely on test scores is inadequate as a selection mechanism, because tests have not been devised that can accurately predict future success. The challenge for individuals and institutions to overcome the pervasive discrimination of the past, and to ensure black educational opportunity and the moral integrity of higher education institutions is noted.

It is suggested that the predictions based on tests and grades are not biased against minority groups and that the real barriers to affirmative action are not tests but complacency and lack of courage of many leaders in education. It is further suggested that it is critically important to  strengthen the nonquantitative admissions data, and to move to a broadened view of talent, and more defensible procedures in selecting students who have the personal qualities and characteristics that fit the educational objectives and responsibilities of higher education institutions. It is proposed that efforts to achieve diversity in the student body might provide a wide diversity within different environments for learning and might nurture a broad range of personal and societal objectives.

Bakke alleged violation of equal protection provisions, since he was denied admission to the University of California (Davis) medical school, although his test scores and grade point average were higher than most or all the 16 minority applicants who were accepted under a Task Force Program. After a trial court and California Supreme Court issued opinions, the U.S. Supreme Court heard the case. The prevailing view on principal issues was that race and ethnic background may be considered along with other factors in higher education admissions decisions, and that Bakke must be admitted to the medical school  at Davis because the procedures pursuant to which he was denied admission were invalid. It is suggested that the central message of the decision is an approval of affirmative action, and that the Davis program was rejected, not because race and ethnicity were taken into account in making admissions decisions, but because of the two-track character of the program. The six opinions of the Supreme Court Justices are outlined. It is suggested that the most important proposition of the decision is that the Court has now resolved the doubts that have revolved around all race-conscious admissions programs. Every college and university, after determining that its admissions program complies with the Court's guidelines, will now be able openly to state what it intends. The Court also left leeway  to medical schools and higher education in prescribing admission standards. Unresolved issues include: the extent to which numbers of minority students should be considered in the admissions program, permissible admissions criteria, and the impact of the Bakke decision on financial aid and other programs intended to aid minority students.

Supreme Court in the Bakke case, the principal arguments addressed to the Court, possible dispositions of the case, and implications for the educational community are addressed. Bakke's claim is that he had been denied the equal protection of the laws in that applicants of lesser obective qualifications had been admitted in the University of California (Davis) Medical School because of their race. The decision of the California Supreme Court and the admissions process at Davis are outlined. Among the points significant to the future of minority participation in higher education on which there is substantial agreement are the following: it is justifiable to take special steps in an effort to enlarge the proportion of minority  students attending medical schools and other segments of higher education; the medical school at Davis has never practiced discrimination; in the absence of special admissions programs, the number and proportion of minority students in higher education would decline sharply; tests and grades do not predict success or failure but only probabilities; and applicants need not be taken in rank order of performance in terms of grades and test scores. The basic questions in the case is whether race can be taken into consideration in admissions decisions at a public institution, when done for valid social purposes. Bakke and his supporters insist that the Davis medical school has a quota system for admissions. The University's position is that there is no quota system, and that the medical school  does not admit unqualified applicants in order to insure that each entering class contains a particular number of minorities. The positions of several professional associations and the U. S. government regarding special admissions programs to professional schools are outlined. (SW)",

While the Supreme Court rejected the doctrine of complete racial neutrality in admissions decisions, there is ambiguity in the decision that could be used to rationalize complacency and justification of the status quo, doing away with quotas and two-tracks and submitting nothing in their place, or weakening programs designed to support minority students with potential for professional and graduate work. Advantages of the decision include directing attention to the issue of underrepresentation of minorities in higher education and in responsible positions in American society. It is suggested that state boards, commissions, or departments of higher education have  played or have the capacity for playing significant roles in expansion of access, including providing guidance in areas related to access such as admissions standards and student aid. An agenda for state higher or postsecondary education should include the following: disseminate accurate information about the Bakke decision to policy-makers, identify and disseminate admissions models designed to increase enrollment of underrepresented minorities at graduate and professional levels within the Bakke guidelines; encourage institutions to develop their own plans for overcoming underrepresentation; and conduct human resources studies that identify specific community as well as aggregate state needs in critical human service areas. An agenda for the legislative and executive branches of state  government could include: issuing a formal resolution and/or executive order reaffirming the state's commitment to affirmative action and to overcoming underrepresentation both in educational opportunity and in providing human services.

        "description":"The impact of college admissions policies designed to expand educational opportunity for minority groups is considered. It is suggested that since the Supreme Court decision in the Bakke Case permitted race as a criteria for admission, institutions must articulate their goals in terms of the degree and nature of diversity they hope to achieve. Admissions policies at the undergraduate level are set by the mission of the college, with an interest in the survival of the institution, and by the educational impact brought about by a given admissions policy. With the exception of racial barriers, the courts have backed the right of institutions to make value judgments of the sort that permit continued diversity in admission standards as these standards correspond to diversity of  educational mission. A sensitive issue linked to institutional survival is maintaining alumnae loyalty by admitting alumnae children. Some research evidence has suggested that the characteristics of the student body are critical in the learning process that takes place in an institution. It is claimed that it is not possible to train the leaders needed for the future or grope toward answers to racial communications in all white educational communities. There is a need for educational communities to provide an arena for the understanding of different cultures and values and help eliminate stereotypes. In regard to graduate programs, it is suggested that medicine, social work, public health, and education, the people-caring, culturally-sensitive professions, must be particularly sensitive  to the mix of their student bodies. Such professionals must be able to listen and hear the person needing assistance, and have respect, knowledge of life styles, and the ability to see each person as an individual. It is proposed that affirmative action principles are essential to the education process itself. (SW)",

        "description":"Factors contributing to the underrepresentation of minority groups in higher education and professional schools are discussed, along with suggestions for state postsecondary education agencies and for state legislative and executive branches in light of the Bakke decision. A 1977 Educational Testing Service study concluded that if admissions committees were forced to disregard racial factors, the numbers of minorities in law schools would be greatly reduced and that most of them would attend the least effective institutions. It is noted that underrepresentation of minorities in graduate and professional schools is linked not only to early educational experiences, but also such influences in student background as health, nutrition, family influences, and general living  conditiions. Suggestions to state higher education agencies include the following; disseminate accurate information about the Bakke decision to policy-makers, identify and disseminate admissions models that may help increase enrollment of underrepresented minorities at graduate and professional levels; encourage or require schools to develop their own plans to overcome underrepresentation; conduct human resources studies to identify specific community as well as aggregate state needs in critical human service areas; evaluate programs designed to increase minority participation at the undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs; and provide fiscal incentives for special programs to reach elementary/secondary schools to address early basic skills, science, and math needs. Suggestions  for legislative and executive branches of state government include issuing a formal resolution or executive order reaffirming the state's commitment to affirmative action and overcoming minority underrepresentation both in educational opportunity and in providing general state services.

It is suggested that before the Bakke case public support for affirmative action admissions programs was diminishing; and that if affirmative action had continued as it was being operated, its negative effects may have been its downfall. The U.S. Supreme Court neither declared the concept of affirmative action discriminatory nor found the special admissions program at the University of California (Davis) constitutional. Some foresee the Bakke decision as bringing about an era of even greater affirmative action/equal opportunity growth for all segments of society, not just racial minorities. The role of the school admissions officers and administrators in  determining the impact of the Bakke decision will be crucial. It is important to develop a design through which the affirmative action commitment can be fulfilled without violating the court's guidelines so that further federal intervention can be avoided.

        "description":"The question of how graduate schools can include race as an admission criteria and give equitable treatment in admissions decisions is addressed by considering some aspects of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores and the use and misuse of test scores in admissions procedures. The GRE is used in admissions procedures to prove an across-the-board measure of academic potential among all the applicants. If the GRE score plays a significant role in the admissions decision, equitable treatment requires that all applicants with equal academic potential have equal chances to be admitted. Although the Graduate Record Examination Board has cautioned against the use of any set score as a cut-off for a favorable admissions decision, some graduate schools and some departments use a  cut-off number. Since performance on the GRE varies widely with the field of study, it is suggested that a field-conscious aspect to admissions decisions might be desirable. It is noted that GRE scores For graduate students at Louisiana State University also vary with race. It is suggested that in order to have applicants fall within the same range of predicted academic potential, different scores would have to be used for different races, just as it would be necessary to use different scores for different fields. It is suggested that admissions procedures need to be reevaluated to determine whether equal treatment (uniformity in application of standards) has actually led to equitable treatment of applicants.

        "description":"Issues pertaining to the Bakke case and to college admissions in general are considered. Three major viewpoints concerning admissions are as follows: whether reserving a fixed number of seats in the entering class for designated minority candidates to programs that are federally supported violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; whether the use of race and ethnicity as nondecisive factors to be considered in a flexible admissions program, which also takes many other circumstances into account, is valid as a means for producing diversity among the students in an educational program that is federally supported; and whether race and ethnicity may be used as decisive factors in the admissions process, without violation of the Equal Protection Clause, if responsible  legislative, administrative, or judicial bodies have determined that this approach is necessary to remedy specific prior discriminatory practices of the institution. Some relevant legal and constitutional issues that need to be addressed include the following: whether the Bakke decision applies to educational programs that receive no direct federal support, merely because other programs within the same institution do receive such support, or federal financial aid is available to students in attendance there; and whether the Bakke case suggests a judicial tolerance for more discretion and less rigidity in the admissions process, thus paving the way for imaginative and more flexible approaches short of strict racial quotas. It is concluded that (1) if an institution wishes to adopt a  racially sensitive admissions program, it must be prepared to articulate the precise manner in which the structure and criteria used serve the stated objectives of the program; and (2) the Bakke case appears to suggest that the greatest opportunity for vigorous affirmative action program lies in legislative hands.

        "description":"The uses and limitations of tests and college admissions policies and procedures are considered, and some testing/admissions guidelines for selective graduate and professional schools in the post-Bakke era are suggested. Among the uses of tests are the following: diagnosing academic deficiencies and weaknesses; determining the level of mastery; identifying the very able and the very weak students who apply to selective institutions; and predicting how individuals will perform in the future with respect to relevant criteria. Four things that tests cannot do are: measure innate ability, measure without substantial error, measure drive or persistence, and predict with any substantial accuracy who will or will not succeed in a given profession. The purpose or role of public policy  where admission to professional schools is concerned is to serve the public interest. The purpose or role of academic policy is to insure the educational integrity of the educational programs and the institutions involved for the larger good. It is suggested that effective affirmative action admissions programs include: programs with a common set of admissions criteria and a single admissions procedure that takes into consideration race or ethnic designation, disadvantage, geographical location, or other relevant factors that serve the public or academic interests of the schools involved; programs with admissions criteria that are matched with human service needs; programs that carefully assess socioeconomic disadvantage; and programs that do not heavily emphasize test scores. The Harvard  admissions program utilizes race as one criterion for selection, sets no specific quotas in an effort to achieve diversity, and recruits widely and vigorously to increase the diversity and size of the eligible pool of students.

Perspectives on the role of the state agency and its interface between the statewide education system and the governmental and external bodies that influence it are considered. It is suggested that the many problems confronting the state agency appear to cluster in three ways: (1) concerns over the actual survival of the higher education system as it has been; (2) the acknowledgement that the system no longer solves internal problems primarily generated internally, since problems appear from external groups (e.g., governments and unions); and (3) the realization that the state agency must deal with its own agency behavior. Agency  response to these clusters of problems may be viewed as clusters of actions, or strategies, techniques, and tools. Two worksheets are presented, one for problems and the other for actions. Observations made by participants are organized along several dimensions. For the problem worksheet, problems of state-level leadership and state-level issues and challenges are indicated for each of the three problem areas (survival, external initiatives, and agency behavior). Additionally, examples based on participants' observations are displayed for each problem area.

        "description":"Major assumptions and goals on which professional school admission decisions are based, the use of the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) as an admission criteria, and approaches to admission used by the Temple University Law School are examined. One consideration in making admissions policies is group needs, or whether there is a need for more black and other racial minority professionals in law, medicine, and other professions. The groups needs goal refers not only to blacks, Hispanics, Native American, and Asian Americans, but to ethnic minorities. It is suggested that regular admissions policy must be fair to all groups. A second societal goal is the individual's needs: that access to the professions should be within the reach of every American determined by that person's own  individual merit. Individual merit means that the total relevant record of the applicant be examined, and that attention be directed to the record of the individual rather than the group to which the applicant belongs. It is suggested that the LSAT does not measure, and was not designed to measure, a person's capacity for being a good lawyer or community leader, but rather to predict performance in the first year examinations of law school. The LSAT does not measure common sense, self-discipline, motivation, judgment, character, leadership, and many other qualities. The individual circumstances, such as holding a full-time job during college, may be important considerations in addition to LSAT scores. One issue is that some colleges with a large proportion of ethnic minorities (e.g.,  Slavic and Polish-American) have been found to have lower median LSAT scores than predominantly white colleges: it is not just predominantly black colleges that may tend to score lower on the screening test. The Temple Law School uses both nondiscretionary and discretionary approaches to admission. (SW)",

Lyman A. Glenny described his study of response to fiscal stress by 10 California institutions. He  documented uneven enrollment trends and suggested that public institutions that are expanding are not having their growth adequately funded. Richard Ingram addressed the role of trustees and regents in the institutional response to stress and described a five-year planning document at Plattsburg State University of New York. Robert Lewis considered the relationship between trustees and college executives, and Robert Berdahl argued that &quot;deparochialization&quot; of academic disciplines must be one key goal for any statewide board.

These  trends include declining college enrollments and efforts to develop new student clienteles, the oversupply of college graduates, financial problems, the demand for accountability by the public and state government, the creation or independent fiscal and performance auditing agencies, and a trend to move higher education decision-making directly into the executive and/or legislative branches of state government. In &quot;Educational Program Budgeting in Oklahoma&quot; Edward J. Coyle and Dan S.

        "description":"A 1978 conference report on major issues of the 1980s in statewide coordination and governance in postsecondary education is presented as part of an inservice education program. The introduction to the report contains the conference summary by Jerome M. Pollack. The keynote address by Richard Millard is presented in three separate sections, organized under the conference sessions' headings: Where Have We Been?, What Are the New Conditions? and What Do We Do in the Future? Other papers are as follows: &quot;College: The Center of the Universe,&quot; by G. Theodore Mitau; &quot;Economic Realities,&quot; by Carol Van Alstyne; &quot;Accountability,&quot; by Robert Berdahl; &quot;Legislative Role,&quot; by H. A. Goltz; &quot;Collective Bargaining,&quot; by James Rosser; &quot;Program Evaluation,&quot; by Thurston E. Manning; and &quot;Some  Highlights from Recent Studies on Statewide Coordination and Governance,&quot; by Janet R. Clarke. Excerpts from discussions are also included. Among the specific topics addressed are the following: the growth of coordinating boards, the planning, program review or approval, and budget development functions of coordinating boards, trends in postsecondary education, including declining college enrollments and the search for new student clienteles, fiscal problems, accountability concerns, issues pertaining to private, proprietary, and vocational institutions; collective bargaining; the impact of federal legislation and regulations; and changing legislative and executive expectations; attempts to redefine equality of access in narrow economic terms, using a concept of net price; tuition tax  credits; and program evaluation to insure quality.

        "description":"State-level concerns for postsecondary education are discussed as part of an inservice education conference. Attention is directed to the purposes of a performance approach, distinctions between performance measures and other kinds of measures used for assessment in higher education, concerns about reaching consensus on performance criteria within a state versus the capacity for greater control being exercised, establishing the capacity to measure performance outcomes, the use of performance criterion in an evaluation process, and relating the performance measures to the budgeting function. There appears to be no strong agreement among conference participants on why performance measures are necessary or desirable and no clear evidence as to their consequences. There seems to be a  consensus that questions of effectiveness and performance would inevitably have to be faced regardless of their intended purpose. In establishing the capacity to measure performance outcomes, a number of issues are highlighted: the content of each particular performance criterion needs to be carefully delineated; an issue of debate is whether performance measures should be specified for programs or for institutions; and a major difficulty in using performance indicators is the evaluation of other changes occurring in higher education that could affect the outcome indicators.

        "description":"A case study illustrating the political influences on higher education in a hypothetical state is presented. Higher education became a target for reform by the state's governor, who expressed interest in the sharing of resources between institutions in close geographic proximity; supported the more extensive use of management tools as a means of improving institutional management; recommended the deferred completion of certain capital construction projects begun, but not yet completed; suggested the possibility of tuition hikes accompanied by increased aid to students with demonstrated needs, or state aid to private higher education; and called for legislation expanding the Commission's authority to review existing as well as new academic programs. Ten months after identification  of the governor's higher education issues, little had come of his recommendations. State revenue continued to decline at the same time that enrollment unexpectedly increased. While capital construction was halted and tuition increased, the longer-range recommendations for improving system efficiency had gotten nowhere. The governor was distressed to hear of a move underway in the legislature to revolutionize budgetary decision-making for education using performance measures in the budgeting process. The governor decided that if reviews of program effectiveness were to be conducted, he and his administration, not the legislature, would have the responsibility. The legislature, rather than lose oversight powers to the governor, publicly adopted a stance of agreeing with the governor but  insisting upon vesting review powers in a legislative committee. Support for the legislative review committee was obtained, and a strategy was adopted to identify ineffective performance within the higher education sector, partially for political reasons. (SW)",

Among the findings are the following: in 1979, women accounted for 48.3 percent of the bachelor's degrees, 49.1 percent of the master's degrees, 13.8 percent of the doctoral degrees, and 23.6 percent of the first-professional degrees; education continued to be the most popular degree field for women at the bachelor's, master's, and  doctoral degree levels; for men, business and management was the most popular at the bachelor's and master's degree levels, while education was the most popular at the doctoral level. In addition, women continued to increase their representation in all eight of the first-professional fields, such as medicine and law, in which trends could be measured, but they are still a definite minority in all of these fields.

        "description":"Federal policies toward higher education and their interaction (or lack of interaction) with state policies are described. Characterized are the differing historical roles played by the state and federal governments in shaping American higher education. Administrative arrangements, types, and dimensions of federal funding for students and institutions are outlined, along with the trends and prospects for such support during the 1980s. The discussion on state and federal roles examines federal programs in terms of bypassing the states, the types and dimensions of federal support, federal regulation, and some assumptions about the 1980s. The section on student aid focuses on: the dilemmas caused by the expansion of federal programs, state responses, expansion of state aid, the  creation of no-need awards, the shift in focus to the private sector, cutbacks, changing features of the federal/state partnership, enrollment shifts, and the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. Federal funds and state prerogatives are discussed with focus on the federal budgetary outlook, fiscal control and the issue of reappropriation, and the status of education in the federal establishment. Among the conclusions are: the principal object of federal funding will remain the individual student; federal dollars for the most part will not wind their way through the states; and key decisions affecting colleges and universities will be made by or at least within the states, not by the federal government.

        "description":"The role of advanced programs in urban universities and the relationship between large public urban universities and comprehensive state universities in less-populated areas are addressed. An overview of the issues, case studies in three states, a study comparing students in two doctoral programs, and information on the characteristics of large urban universities in the South are considered. Among the issues are the following: pressures exerted on states to make graduate and professional programs available in cities are linked to the concentration of part-time students on urban campuses who desire these programs; urban universities are seeking funds for expansion, while other institutions that are facing declining enrollments are seeking additional funds primarily on the grounds  of quality improvement; urban schools emphasize serving urban populations and solving urban problems, while they generally also seek to expand their advanced offering in traditional arts and sciences; and state higher education agencies are faced with the problem of accommodating urban demands for educational programs that would duplicate ones already in existence in their states. The universities profiled in the case reports include an older, established institution and two of the newer state universities in the nation: the University of Louisville, the University of South Florida, and George Mason University.

        "description":"Suggestions for faculty who are attempting to improve their advising skills without the benefit of a formal program are offered. Good advisement is always a process composed of timely responses in areas relevant to student education. The scope of advising may encompass the following: describe the intent of the general or liberal arts part of the undergraduate curriculum for the advisee; communicate the rationale for institutional and/or departmental requirements, policies, and procedures encountered in the advising process (i.e., grading policies, endorsement of schedules); analyze the student's study skills/habits, especially when difficulties with a course are indicated; question the course selections and other choices of students (e.g., determine the reasons why certain  courses are chosen); determine the involvement of advisees in other campus activities; explore the advisee's career choice and suggest alternative careers if appropriate; explore graduate school expectations and choices with the student; and assist students with course selection. Strategies that advisors can use to allow sufficient coverage of all areas of advising are as follows: develop a checklist, calendar, or syllabus for advising; use contracts with advisees (i.e., a student outlines a degree plan); use groups when appropriate to economize advising time; use other students as advisor helpers; encourage student self-advisement; and share information, skills, and techniques with other advisors. There are also a multitude of techniques that may help an advisor work more effectively  with advisees. These are grouped under three skill headings: informing, communicating, and helping. Among the suggestions are to insure having accurate information about academic programs, listen carefully and use open-ended questions, and respect the advisee. (SW)",

University students completed an aptitude test that provided contingent or noncontingent feedback and varied in length (short, medium, or long). All subjects, including a control group who did not complete the aptitude test, then viewed a videotaped lecture in a simulated classroom. Following the lecture, students completed a teacher evaluation, an achievement test, and an attribution questionnaire. The results reveal that contingent students scored higher than noncontingent students on the achievement test, and that students viewing the high expressive lecture performed significantly  better than students in the low expressive condition. A priori comparisions of the contingency by expressiveness interaction indicated that the high expressive instructor attenuated the negative effects oF noncontingency. After viewing the low expressive lecture, noncontingent subjects had lower performance scores than contingent subjects, but there were no achievement differences between the three contingency conditions (control, contingent, noncontingent) when subjects viewed the high expressive lecture. Instructor expressiveness had the largest impact on the post-lecture measures. It accounted for the greatest amount of the achievement variance, and was the only variable to influence student ratings and attributions. It is concluded that exposure to contingent outcomes had a negative  effect on achievement; however, instructor expressiveness had a larger overall effect on student performance. It is suggested that teacher behaviors such as expressiveness may attenuate the effects of exposure to noncontingency. A bibliography is included. (Author/SW)",

        "description":"Analysis of recent developments in the supply of college graduates, non-completers in postsecondary education, demographic and educational developments in the 1960's, and projections for employment in 1985 suggest that an increasing proportion of younger, well-educated workers will be filling jobs where their postsecondary education will be of limited relevance. Many of these jobs will be in industry and in profit-oriented services. It is argued that the recent emphasis on training students for openings in the public sector no longer needs support. An important consequence seen in the presence of a large number of underused educated workers is that they will block merit promotion routes for persons with less impressive educational credentials, or that entry-level jobs for the  better-educated will deteriorate. An examination of earning trends is suggested to determine whether additional education is contributing to productivity or just being used as a screening device. It is concluded that by 1985 roughly a third of college graduates will be in positions previously held by persons with less education, and two-thirds of persons with some postsecondary education will hold jobs previously filled by persons with only a high school degree. Appended are extensive tables and summaries of estimates of demand and supply for labor by level of education (population of working age, labor force participation rates) and of the demand for educated manpower (the Gross National Product and industry employment, labor force projections by occupation, and employment by educational  level).

        "description":"The personal, professional, and postgraduate educational development of graduates of six Michigan postsecondary institutions with programs that allow credit for experiential learning was examined. The two- and four-year programs also included a liberal-studies type curriculum, and experiential learning options included portfolio assessment, testing assessment, and cooperative/internship opportunities. Other study objectives included assessment of the relationship between experiential learning credit awards and academic performance and development of a model to identify characteristics of programs and individuals that contribute to postgraduate success. Telephone interviews and several small group interviews were conducted with 195 graduates of the Michigan programs. It was found  that the younger, inexperienced group of students (or the reentry adult) was being served by the cooperative/internship programs, while the portfolio and testing programs were serving those individuals who believed they have acquired college-level learning and wished to have this learning recognized in an academic environment. Regardless of the type of personal development that graduates pursued, nearly all pointed to their program or classes as awakening an interest or increasing their awareness of the new activity. Overall, the internship/cooperative group was lower in the number of their goals realized by the program. This finding may be related to the fact that younger people, as in the internship and cooperative group, do not often enter their college programs with realistic and  attainable career goals. No relationship was found between the number of experiential credits received by graduates and their grade point averages. A bibliography, sample telephone questionnaire, and institutional profiles for the six schools are appended. (SW)",

The Public Cryptography Study Group, with one dissenting opinion, recommends that a voluntary system of prior review of cryptology manuscripts be instituted on an experimental basis. Cryptography is the body of knowledge that deals with methods of information protection. NSA is concerned that research and dissemination in this field could lead to the publication of cryptographic principles or applications similar to those used by the United States Government. NSA claims that this work may enable foreign powers to engage more successfully in cryptanalytic  attacks upon the secure telecommunications of our government and that papers dealing with weaknesses in cryptosystems may be used by other governments and prompt them to adopt more sophisticated and less vulnerable systems. Although the study group views any system of prior review involving governmental agencies as a possible disincentive to academics and others to undertake research, guidelines are suggested for a proposed voluntary system. The dissenting study group opinion to the voluntary system is also presented. In \"The Case Against Restraints on Non-Governmental Research in Cryptography,\" George I. Davida argues that the national security interests of the country are broader than the narrow mission of the NSA, which is data-gathering; that restraints would adversely affect that  quality and direction of basic research in computer science, engineering, and mathematics; that restraints would be unconstitutional and would lead to legal entanglements and international complications, and that restraints would be ineffective in achieving the NSA's objectives.

The basis of the complaint was that the university received federal funds and therefore was legally liable for refusal to comply with the federal legislation. Finding a possibility that Camenisch would be irreparably harmed in the absence of an injunction, and finding a substantial likelihood that Camenisch would prevail on the merits, the District Court granted a preliminary injunction requiring that the University pay for Camenisch's interpreter, but Camenisch had to post a security bond pending the  outcome of the litigation. The Supreme Court held that the question of whether a preliminary injunction should have been issued is moot because the terms of the injunction have been fully and irrevocably carried out, but as the Court of Appeals indicated, the question of whether the University must pay for the interpreter remains for trial on the merits. A syllabus of the case and the concurring opinion of Chief Justice Burger are included. (SW)",

        "description":"A causal model to explain student attrition was tested at a major midwestern land-grant university with a sample of 1,513 full-time, unmarried freshmen who were 21 years old or younger. The causal model was reduced from 23 to 10 variables: an intent variable, three attitudinal variables, and two each of organizational, personal, and environmental variables. Background variables were excluded. The sample was divided into four groups based on the student's sex and level of self-confidence, and multiple regression and path analysis were used to analyze the data. Overall ranking of the independent variables in explaining dropouts, based on effects coefficients, in descending order of importance, was as follows: intent to leave, grades, opportunity to transfer, practical value,  certainty of choice, loyalty, family approval, courses, student goals, and major and job certainty. The correlation coefficients ranged from .42 to .50. For each of the four path analyses (high/low confidence women and high/low confidence men), intent to leave had the largest direct influence on dropping out. Also, for each group, the three attitudinal variables (loyalty, certainty, and practical value) had significant negative relationships with intent (with the exception of loyalty for low confidence men). However, the attitudinal variables were not well explained themselves due to relatively high intercorrelations. Recommendations based on the findings are as follows: develop the motivation and learning skills of students so that their grades can rise; demonstrate to students how any  major they choose can be of practical value (important for future employment); create a desirable image of the school and identify reasons to be loyal to it; offer courses the students think that they want to take; and develop the student's educational goals.

        "description":"A model of student attrition was synthesized from psychological, sociological, and educational sources, and contains six sets of variables: background, organizational, personal, environmental, attitudinal, and intent to leave. The model was tested with 1,909 full-time and unmarried university freshmen at a major midwestern university. The sample was divided into four groups based on the student's sex and level of self-confidence, and multiple regression and path analyses were used to analyze the data from the study instrument. Background variables included father's education, mother's education, performance in high school, high school and home town size, and distance to home. Organizational variables included university grades, informal contact with faculty, centralization,  memberships in campus organizations, finding the academic program competitive, courses, and absenteeism. Personal variables were goal commitment, major and occupational certainty, and confidence. Environmental variables included opportunity to transfer, likelihood of marrying, ease of financing one's education, and family approval of the institution. Attitudinal variables were loyalty, certainty of choice, satisfaction, and practical value. It was found that intent to leave and university grades were the best predictors of attrition; high confidence compensates for absenteeism and low grades in reducing dropping out. The correlation coefficients ranged from .43 to .53. For each of the four path analyses (high/low confidence women and high/low confidence men), intent to leave showed a  consistently high positive relationship with dropping out, while university grades were negatively related to dropping out. Recommendations are presented, and the way that this model differs from those of Spady (1970) and Tinto (1975) is considered. (SW)",

The models of Tinto, Spady, and Rootman in the area of student attrition, and models of student participation (Boshier), status attainment (Sewell and Hauser), turnover in work organizations (Price), suicide (Durkheim), and the relation between intentions and behavior (Fishbein and Ajzen) are addressed. Bean's industrial model of student attrition and Pascarella's model concerning student/faculty informal contacts are also included. The synthetic model identifies four classes of variables: background variables, organizational  variables, environmental variables, and attitudinal and outcome variables, all of which have direct or indirect effects on intent to leave, which is the immediate precursor of dropping out. Variables can be added to or deleted from the model to match the particular needs of an institution. Twenty-three variables that may be important predictors of dropping out are identified. The relative causal importance of these variables to dropping out can be assessed using stepwise multiple regression analysis in a path analytic framework. In addition, effects coefficients can indicate the total contributions of one variable on dropping out in terms of both indirect and direct effects.

For the master's and doctoral levels, data are provided on the total number and percent change by field of study for 1975 to 1979. The total number of master's awards increased slightly from 1976 to 1977 but fell by 5 percent in 1979. For all master's recipients increases of 17 to 25 percent occurred in the fields of agriculture, business and management, computer science, health professions, and public affairs. For blacks, the increases in agriculture and computer science were much smaller, 2.6 and 8.3 percent, respectively, but those in business and management, health professions, and public affairs were higher. For academic year 1978-79, historically black colleges (HBCs) accounted for  almost 20 percent of all black master's recipients, despite the fact that HBCs made up only 30 of the approximately 1,000 master's-granting institutions. In contrast to master's degrees, there appeared to be slight progress for blacks and strong headway for all minorities in the number of doctorates awarded in 1979. Nationally, there was a drop of 3.3 percent between 1976 and 1979, black Ph.D.'s increased by 4.5 percent, and other minorities increased by 26.3 percent. There was a substantial upswing in the total numbers of Ph.D's awarded in architecture, fine arts, health professions, public affairs, theology, and interdisciplinary studies. There were serious losses in computer science, engineering, mathematics, and physical sciences doctorates. The total number of first-professional  degrees increased both from 1976 to 1977 and from 1977 to 1979, a total rise of 10.4 percent. The number awarded to blacks dropped by 5.8 percent from 1976 to 1977 and then climbed by 11.8 percent in 1979, or half the national figure. HBC's accounted for 21.2 percent of all black first-professional degrees. (SW)",

        "description":"The innovative actions that faculty, and institutions on behalf of faculty, have taken to adjust to retrenchment and the changing academic profession are considered. It is suggested that faculty have three kinds of employment options to present conditions such as the scarcity of tenure-track positions and the failure of salaries to keep pace with rising prices. The options are remaining on campus, engaging in supplemental work on and off the campus, or leaving academe. Programs to retrain faculty in low and declining enrollment areas to teach in related disciplines or subdisciplines with growing or high enrollment are increasingly common. Some faculty are shifting to college administration, research, or support services. Overload teaching and consultation are sources of faculty  supplemental income and may result in retraining and additional job contacts. Sabbatical leaves may be another option for faculty that permits employment for professional development or retraining or simply allows the individual time for career reassessment. One institutional response is a program at Hagerstown Junior College that enables faculty in occupational programs to take leaves to work in industry. Faculty who feel that leaving the academic community is their best option have several choices, including retiring early, changing careers without retraining, and retraining with campus support. Some institutions now offer campus counseling or career exploration specifically to aid faculty who are changing careers. The University City Science Center in Philadelphia is an example of  support to academicians who wish to start businesses. Low-cost administrative support is provided for a variety of industries that are housed at the center. A resource (within the American Association for Higher Education) for additional information on programs to individual faculty and institutions is described and a bibliography is included. (SW)",

At the same time, maintenance of low tuitions through public subsidies has provided reasonable assurance of accessibility and equality of public education, institutional autonomy, and support for institutional programs. The effectiveness and equity of socially subsidized low tuitions have been challenged by economists in recent decades. Among arguments: since students benefit directly from education, they should be required to pay a larger portion of the costs, despite foregone earnings and existing expenses, and further, tax laws cause the poor to subsidize the rich. More recently  these arguments have been challenged on both economic and philosophical grounds; recent evidence suggests low tuition supplemented by student aid serves accessibility and maintains academic quality better than high tuition and large amounts of student aid. The challenges have not justified or resulted in great modifications to the public low-tuition system, but the basic funding pattern adopted by the federal government will be critical to societal quality and essentially irreversible. Three questions stand out for further study: (1) How effective is need-based student aid in increasing participation of low-income students? (2) How can student aid programs be refined so need analysis and aid distribution can be simplified and student, institutional, and government accountability be  clarified? and(3) Is it feasible to maintain high access levels with low tuition and stable or declining student aid?

Although the basic concerns of higher education (teaching, research, and service) have remained unchanged, the reality of expanded numbers and increased responsibility in a number of areas has placed immense pressure on universities. Seven goals essential to higher educatoin reform issues are new university structures, interdisciplinarity, accountability, administrative efficiency, relevance, democratization and participation, and increased responsiveness to society. Post-war reform forces: the demands of government for a new academic program or pressure by the public for increased access to higher education. In many cases they involve spending outside funds. Internally, the faculty is  crucial to any reform's success. Tradition impinges on the reform process, oftern inhibiting rapid change. Students can also stimulate change, and even help develop and implement reform proposals. Examples in a variety of countries and systems (Sweden, West Germany, France, Japan, India, Great Britain) illustrate the complexity of the reform process. The German and British models hold some useful lessons for achieving controlled expansion in the United States. Reform often has unanticipated results or can engender serious opposition, and illustrate how not to achieve true reform. (MSE)",

The purpose of this study was to explore possible future modes of growth of the personal computer and related industries, to assess the impacts and consequences of that growth, and to present some of the policy issues and options which may arise as a consequence of the development of personal computer technology. However, due to limitations of time, funds, and personpower, detailed analyses were restricted to three main issue areas: (1) the growth of personal computer technology, (2) the expected impacts of the technology, and (3) the public policy implications in areas of education, employment, and international trade. Much of the information generated in this report was based upon the  results of Delphi surveys. Tables of data are included. (Author/LLS)",

First, technological developments that will influence the rate of diffusion of personal computer technology among the general populace are examined. Then the probable market for personal computers is estimated and analyzed on a functional basis, segregating it into four submarkets: the home, education, small business, and large organizations. Next, some possible evolutionary forms of the personal computer are briefly described along with an alternative mode of development of personal computing. In conducting this phase of the assessment, the researchers utilized a survey of existing personal computer users and market growth models for large ticket consumer durable goods to predict the  probable growth and maturation patterns of the personal computer market.

Returned questionnaires provided a 62.3 percent response rate, and were balanced both geographically and by urban/rural distribution. Analyses indicated that 90 percent of the districts were currently using the computer, with projections to 94 percent by 1985. Instructional usage was reported by 74 percent, with projections to 87 percent by 1985. A total of 54 percent of the districts reported use of the computer for computer assisted learning, with projections to 74 percent by 1985. Major usage is in secondary schools for drill and practice in mathematics, natural  sciences, business, and language arts. Projections for 1980-85, however, indicate greater usage in the social sciences at the secondary levels, as well as growth at the elementary school levels in all subject areas, and shifts to tutorials and simulations with microcomputers as the delivery systems. Major impediments to usage were identified as financial, lack of knowledge about computer assisted learning and computers in general, faculty attitudes, and the need for more and better computer assisted learning modules.

Group A took module tests in the standard CR format with answer cues and then converted their answers to MC answer sheets for CMI scoring. Group B took CR tests with answer cues, but the research staff converted the answers. Group C took CR tests but without answer cues, and the staff converted the answers, while Group D took tests in the MC format. Before and after the tests, skills and knowledge were measured to compare factors such as learning, retention, time  to complete the course, and attitudes. There were no differences in learning among the groups, but Group C, with the CR questions without cues, had the best retention, but took longer to complete the course and rated their tests as being more difficult than did students in the other groups. The attitude questionnaire and the results of ANOVAs comparing the groups on measures of learning are appended, and five references are provided. (Author/BK)",

Fifty-five percent of the transactions at reference service points are directional, while the remainder are reference transactions; university libraries report significantly higher numbers of transactions than either 4-year or 2-year colleges; and publicly controlled colleges report greater numbers than private institutions. Similarly, reference and directional transactions vary with total operating budget, collection and staff size, and enrollment. The picture is complicated, however, by intervariable relationships; e.g.,  university libraries tend to have larger operating budgets, staff, and collections. Under these conditions, regression analysis is a better procedure to predict the number of reference and directional transactions. (Author/RAA)",

        "description":"Designed as informational aids for community college practitioners, these two booklets examine the counseling and job placement needs of older adult students. The first booklet addresses itself to community college counselors. After profiling the composition of the older adult population in terms of \"young-old\" persons (those of 55 to 75 years old) and \"old-old\" persons (those 75 years or older), this booklet examines 14 false stereotypes concerning the intelligence, educational interests, personal goals, and physiology of older adults. The remainder of the booklet discusses the role of the counselor in providing academic and personal counseling to older adults; planning teaching and testing methods appropriate to their needs; managing group counseling sessions; and increasing  general awareness of the educational and training needs of today's older adult. The second booklet, which is addressed to college placement officers, first notes the stereotypes that have kept older adults from successfully competing in the job market and then examines: (1) benefits to employers of hiring older workers; (2) the social and financial benefits derived by older adults from employment; (3) the unique ability of the community college to meet the training needs of older adults; (4) ways in which a college employment center can serve older adults; (5) volunteer work options for older adults; and (6) other employment resources.

        "description":"After providing evidence of the decline of student academic ability and identifying some of the factors influencing this decline, this paper examines the role of community colleges in providing compensatory education for the growing population of students who are underprepared for college-level work. This examination begins by tracing the development of the community college and discussing the growth and magnitude of its involvement in remedial education. The next sections of the paper cite research studies and describe programs that provide answers to questions related to the integration of remedial programs into the college curriculum, particularly into transfer programs; the relationship between compensatory education and retention and articulation; and the role of counselors  and guidance personnel in efforts to combat illiteracy and attrition. After discussing the effects of increased involvement in compensatory education on the faculty, academic standards, and integrity of an institution, the paper considers charges that segregated remedial programs are racist and class-biased and questions the public's willingness to pay the high costs of remedial programs. Finally, the paper makes several suggestions regarding the community college's course in providing developmental education, including a recommendation that remedial courses be integrated into the regular curriculum.

Chapters I and II delineate the objectives of the study and outline nine proposed goals for postsecondary education in Minnesota. Chapter III then summarizes planning assumptions concerning anticipated trends in demography, educational demand, funding availability, and interinstitutional competition. Next, Chapter IV profiles the AVTI's in terms of enrollment trends and projections, mission within the state's system of higher education, curricular emphases, governance structure, service population, and state funding structures. Chapter IV also examines planning implications, stressing the need to stabilize  enrollment and fiscal bases, eliminate the dual accountability of the AVTI's to both local school boards and the State Board of Education, and increase statewide coordination. Chapter V outlines alternatives for the future governance and role of the AVTI's and classifies these alternatives according to their anticipated contribution to the overall goals outlined in Chapter II. Finally, Chapter VI discusses the characteristics and probable positive and negative outcomes of two of the eleven alternatives; i.e., the creation of a separate governing board for the AVTI's and the merger of the AVTI's with other postsecondary institutions under a single board.

        "description":"The dilemma of maintaining academic standards as well as open access policies is discussed in this paper with respect to the causes of and possible solutions to the problem. Trends leading to the standards/open access dilemma are first considered, including the dominant belief in the 1950's that education served to select and groom the most academically talented students; the efforts undertaken in the 1960's and 1970's to change this elitism by stressing open access to education; and the concurrent deterioration of academic standards. The paper then looks at current disillusionment with open access policies and examines the failure of colleges to change common educational practices that cannot adequately deal with the wide variety of skill levels possessed by today's student  body. As an example, the paper details the inability of fixed semester and letter grading systems to accommodate the varying learning rates of students and to motivate them toward success. The remainder of the paper discusses the efforts of Miami-Dade Community College to provide an instructional program incorporating both standards and open access policies. These efforts include the placement of students at a level that offers them realistic chances for success; the use of computers to monitor student progress and to provide feedback; the enforcement of academic warnings and suspensions; and the development of a state funding formula based on clock rather than credit hours.

After introductory material discussing the need to determine the impact of postsecondary education on the well-being of society as a whole, the report outlines the three steps in the planning phase of the PME system: (1) determining planning assumptions concerning the probable future characteristics of the community, the student body, and the institution; (2) determining institutional and departmental goals, i.e., desired results over three to ten years; and (3) defining measurable outcomes of short-term (one-year) efforts. This section of the report identifies the  various categories of assumptions, goals, and objectives and discusses their interrelationship. Next, the report examines the three-year PME cycle, which calls for initial planning during the first year, implementation of the plan during the second year, and evaluation during the third year to determine the extent to which objectives have been met. The report concludes with a discussion of contemporary demands for accountability, which require that the impact of higher education on the society, as well as the individual, be measured.

Concerted efforts are first made during the admissions process when handicapped students are identified and students are provided with the assistance they need to take required placement tests (e.g., oral interpreters are provided for the deaf). Then at registration, special academic counseling services are provided which circumvent the need for handicapped students to wait in long lines or go to areas of the college that are difficult to reach. As required by law, handicapped students are mainstreamed into all regular remedial and college-level programs. While remedial English programming was once conducted  separately for deaf students, these students are now integrated into the English as a Second Language Program. Throughout the semester, CCP's Programs for Handicapped Persons Division provides several support services: (1) arranging for the provision of special materials or personnel (e.g., talking books or volunteer notetakers); (2) answering the questions of faculty and lab personnel; (3) providing comprehensive counseling services; (4) serving as a liaison with various agencies and community groups; and (5) securing funds to purchase special equipment or run special programs.

In addition, open-ended comments about the police were solicited.  Selected findings reveal that 49% of the interviewees had interacted at least once with an officer and that more than half of these respondents rated the officers as efficient (73.9%), courteous (65.2%), and fair (77%). Responses concerning personal attitudes toward the police and the Department's general campus image revealed a wide range of attitudes on a scale of 1 (good) to 5 (poor). While older students tended to have more positive attitudes toward the police than younger students, no attitudinal differences were discerned between ethnic groups, day and evening students, and students and staff.

The review first defines and looks at the purposes of community needs assessments, noting that while such studies are purported to facilitate the planning and evaluation of credit and non-credit programs, few studies have led to substantial program changes. After discussing the importance of identifying the needs of subgroups within a community in remaining responsive to all area citizens, the review cites studies which examined the needs of special constituencies, such as women, minorities, and the business community. The application of needs assessment findings to college marketing programs designed to recruit and retain students  is considered prior to a review of selected works revealing the limited use made of needs assessment data at community colleges and the importance of incorporating such data in the institutional planning process. Next, the review summarizes prevalent problems in current needs assessment practices, including the lack of clear definitions for \"need\" and \"community,\" poor data collection and interpretation techniques, and reliance upon data gathering systems that are designed to meet legislatively mandated reporting requirements rather than institutional needs.

        "description":"The relationship between egocentrism and five components of social competence (decentering ability, social participation, helping behavior, conflict resolution, and egocentric speech) in young children was examined in this study. Measures of egocentrism, intelligence and social competence were obtained for each of 100 three-year-old children paired in 50 dyads. Egocentrism was assessed by seven frequently used tests of egocentrism and intelligence was assessed using McCarthy Scales of Children's Ability. Social competence was assessed by observing each child playing with a friend (generally of the same sex) for 30 minutes in a room that was furnished as a miniature nursery school. Each child's play behaviors were videotaped from behind a one-way mirror and then were categorized  by both time unit and discrete social acts. Among the results it was found that in comparison to less egocentric subjects egocentric children were no less social in their play and no less able to integrate their own play ideas with those of their peers. Although level of egocentrism showed a greater relationship to social competence than did level of intelligence, the only significant relationship was with helping behaviors; less egocentric children helped each other more, gave each other more things, and tended to use less egocentric speech. Girl dyads who did better on the egocentrism tests tended to use less egocentric speech and to have fewer conflicts than boys. It was concluded that the results raise questions about the construct validity of egocentrism. (Author/MP)",

Participants were 788 seventh-, ninth-, and eleventh-graders in three school districts differing in location, socioeconomic composition, and course offerings. Formal thought was measured with tasks involving proportional reasoning and predicting displaced volume. The ability to predict displaced volume was measured by an eight item paper-and-pencil test called the Water Glass Puzzle. Subjects' responses were categorized according to four strategies of response derived from protocols for a similar task. To measure proportional reasoning, the Balance Puzzle was used to present 13 problems. Response choices reflected one of four inaccurate strategies or the  correct strategy for solving the puzzle. Experience with math and science was assessed in two ways: (1) students indicated how many years of math and science courses they had taken, and (2) the socioeconomic composition of the school (which was related to math and science offerings) was established from principals' reports. Vocabulary, Letter Series, Find a Shape Puzzle, Paper Folding and Water Level tests were used to assess aptitudes. Anticipated male-female differences in formal thought emerged in the data. It is concluded that aptitude measures are not sufficient to explain why males choose accurate strategies more frequently than females do. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"This paper describes a series of studies investigating the effects of memory reactivation in early infancy. Twelve-week-old infants were taught a footkick response by having one leg tied to an overhead crib mobile so that each footkick produced movement of the mobile (reinforcer). Retention of the footkick response was assessed after 6, 8, and 14 days and rates of forgetting were determined. The effects of memory reactivation in counteracting the forgetting were then examined. Reactivation consisted of placing the infants under the mobile without attaching the ribbon to their leg, so that they could be exposed for 3 minutes to the reinforcer (movement of the mobile) independent of their response (footkick). Results showed that this reactivation was sufficient to bring the level  of footkicks back to its level on the original retention test immediately following initial training. Further results showed that the effects of reactivation were greatest at 24 hours after reactivation. Thereafter, forgetting was shown to occur at about the same rate as the forgetting of the initial learning. Further investigation showing that reactivation was facilitated by periods of sleep was interpreted as suggesting that infant memory is more accessible for reminiscence during periods of minimal interference.

Time use studies investigate how individuals allocate time among various activities. Such studies have revealed sex and age differences in time spent at work among adults and children of various societies, thus providing a view of the extent of women's and children's work and a perspective on the choices women make about their children when time is scarce. However, in order to meet quality standards in the quantitative social sciences, more stringent efforts must be made to improve the quality of time use data being collected. As a step toward this end, ten time use studies from developing countries using three kinds of methodology  (observation, sequential recall and activities recall methods) are examined and ranked in terms of 12 methodological issues. Issues raised include problems of reliability, validity, coding, justifications for age classifications of children, sample coverage and quality of time use. Methodological improvements for time use studies are suggested. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"The extent to which individual differences in pictograph recall performance are related to reading readiness and other aspects of language and cognitive development is examined in this paper. In each of three studies kindergarten children were taught names and toy enactions for approximately 30 pictographs. The kindergarteners were then administered the Pictograph Sentence Memory Task, which required reading a series of 6- to 8-item pictograph sentences and recalling each sentence after a short (10- or 15-second) delay period. Performance measures for these tasks included the number and order of pictographs recalled, the number of articles (&quot;the&quot;) and verb inflections (/s/) included in the recall attempts, the number of decoding errors (corrected by the experimenter) made in  reading the pictograph sentences, and the use of separate and integrated toy enactions. Moreover, the number of errors made in initially learning the individual pictograph names and enactions was recorded. Additional measures such as word recognition, oral word blending, metareading, nonverbal reasoning, metamemory, and auditory rehearsal, were performed in each of the three studies. Results indicate that learning the names and enactions corresponding to a rather large set of vocabulary items and recalling the meanings of pictograph sentences are both related to traditional measures of readiness and linguistic/cognitive development.

        "description":"This study of handicapped and non-handicapped preschool and early elementary school children and their older normal siblings was designed to determine (1) the intercorrelation of parent and teacher ratings of the child's academic competence and social adjustment, and (2) the correlations of mother, father and teacher ratings with the child's diagnosis of handicapped or normal. Two samples of families were studied. Sample A consisted of 36 two-parent families with a child aged 3 to 6 and at least one older child. In half the families the preschool child was identified as having a mild to severe handicap. Sample B consisted of 52 families with a child aqed 3 to 8 and both parents in the home. Thirty-five of the families had an older sibling and in 39 cases the target child was  referred as handicapped by a preschool, public school or special school. Teachers rated each child's behavior in the classroom using the Classroom Behavior Inventory (CBI), Bipolar Trait Ratings (BTR), the Social Assets Inventory (SAI), and a Teacher Report of Child Behavior Toward the Teacher Inventory. Mothers and fathers also completed the BTR, the SAI, and a Parent Report of Child Behavior Toward the Parent Inventory. In general, correlations between parent ratings and teacher ratings were substantial on the dimension of academic competence and were lower and marginally significant on the dimension of socialization and temperament. Results suggest that parents as well as teachers might contribute significantly to developmental screening. (The short form of the Social Assets Inventory  and the traits rating scale, accompanied by scoring forms, are included. (Author/MP)",

        "description":"Teacher Corps experience in meeting Corps objectives in rural sites provides a rich source of information about rural education. Collaboration exists between university faculty and rural school staff despite distances involved and sharp increases in transportation costs, but development of on-site facilitators is critical to making collaboration work. College scholarships and low-interest loans offered to young local people who agree to return as teachers in local schools can alleviate the problem of attracting and keeping quality staff. Weekly conference call sessions and use of videotape are possible solutions to problems which distance creates for the delivery of supportive inservice training. Utilization of on-site facilitators, combined with an orientation toward more  individualized and staff-based inservice, can greatly improve a small district's staff development efforts. A consistent finding, relevant to the improved school climate objective, is that morale of staff, students, and community residents is generally high in rural areas. Progress has been mixed with regard to Teacher Corps objectives focusing on multicultural education and needs of exceptional students. Establishment of an office or center for rural education seems essential to meeting objectives of institutionalization, demonstration, and dissemination. A land grant university would be an ideal location for this. (CM)",

        "description":"Traditional methods of ethnographic data collection and analysis can be adapted to conducting summative evaluations of educational programs, particularly those for American Indians. Such evaluations can be approached from a micro-ethnographic standpoint (in which the school alone is studied as a subculture) or a macro-ethnographic standpoint (in which the school is studied as part of the culture as a whole). While each approach has advantages, the macro-ethnographic approach is better suited to non-Western cultures and American Indian cultures in particular, because it can be used to discover discrepancies between the educational goals of the community and the actualities of the schools. Ethnographic evaluation methods are essentially the same for each approach. In an iterative  rather than sequential process, data are collected via interviews (using descriptive, structural, and contrastive questions) and participant observation (to determine the places, actors, and activities of the program), and analyzed to determine its domains and taxonomy. Ethnographic summative evaluation is advantageous because it eliminates the evaluator's cultural values; it needs no control group or culturally biased achievement testing; it needs no statistical analysis; its reports are more useful; and it facilitates the study of the cultural appropriateness of the program.

The study involved use of the Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM), designed to conceptualize and facilitate educational change, and had a  primary goal of determining the potential applicability of CBAM to bilingual education programs, to develop a process that school districts could utilize to improve the effectiveness and productivity of their bilingual programs. Results indicated that with some modifications the CBAM system of instruments and procedures could provide schools or districts with diagnostic information to build prescriptive intervention strategies which can aid in adoption and implementation of bilingual education programs.

Highlights of the fiscal 1980 BIA/tribal partnership included the joint review of overall Office operations and management; the creation of the Hoquiam, Washington, BIA agency; and increased tribal participation in budgetary matters. In fiscal 1980, 275 programs worth $21 million (38% of the Office's program funds) were contracted under the Self Determination Act. Also, the 3600 acre reservation of the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians was restored. The BIA provided technical assistance in the areas of forestry and agriculture (the two major resources  of tribal revenue), mineral resources, ranching, fishing, and business enterprises including retail outlets, fish processing, furniture manufacturing, and tourist facilities. Direct tribal participation in water resource planning in the area remained an unrealized goal. The tribes were increasingly active in the area of education. Nearly 900 students attended 7 tribally operated schools and 1 boarding school. Nearly 11,000 Indian students were eligible for supplementary educational services. Continued improvements in BIA/tribal management and service delivery were recommended. (SB)",

In sum, the report shows apparent deconcentration at several territorial-based levels (as witnessed by population decline in the nation's largest cities), a continuing pattern of metropolitan suburbanization, more rapid growth of smaller than larger Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSA), population redistribution away from the densely-settled industrial Northeast, a reversal in growth patterns between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas, and deconcentration down the urban  hierarchy within nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas of the United States. The report concludes that each of these changes represents an important component of current redistribution trends in the United States. (Author)",

The effectiveness of four instructional strategies for teaching problem solving to students of various proportional reasoning ability, verbal and visual preference, and mathematics anxiety were compared in this aptitude by treatment interaction study. Strategies used were: (1) the factor-label method; (2) the use of analogies; (3) the use of diagrams; and (4) proportionality. Problem solving ability of high school students (N=609) in nine schools in Indiana was measured by a series of immediate post-tests given after each lesson of an instructional unit, delayed post-tests given within two  weeks of each unit, and the ACS-NSTA Examination in High School Chemistry administered at the end of the year. Findings indicate: (1) that mathematics anxiety is negatively correlated with science achievement; (2) that problem solving ability in chemistry is dependent on students' proportional reasoning ability; and (3) that students with visual preference performed better on an immediate post-test dealing with the topic of molarity.

The studies that are examined employ a wide range of research techniques, are based often on quite different perspectives, and span over half a century. It is striking, however, that there has been so much attention paid to algebra in general and equation solving in particular since 1970. The resulting recent accumulation of bits and pieces of information may leave the impression that what is known about equation solving has not been clearly synthesized. Such an impression is probably correct. The results that have been reported tend to be based on limited data and are  not consistent enough to outline clearly the structure of the processes of equation solving. (Author)",

Objectives of this study were to: (1) examine the levels and direction of attitudes toward the sciences as a function of grade level; (2) probe into possible causal determinants of these attitudes; and (3) examine correlates of attitudes toward the sciences as a function of grade level and specific subject matter. Subjects (N=5,804) in 277 classrooms in grades 4, 7, and 9 were administered the Inventory for Affective Aspects of Schooling (IAAS). First, product-moment correlations were computed, then ordinary least-squares regression analyses were done to determine the relative contributions of teams of variables for explaining criterion  variance. Results are reported by grade level, by subject matter, and by the regression analyses. Conclusions are drawn concerning the role of the teacher in shaping attitude at the class level; and generalizations are made concerning a classroom in which there are positive collective attitudes about mathematics, science, or social studies.

The four common syndromes identified with pupils who were experiencing a lack of success in mathematics were: (1) a lack of an adequate college or high school background in mathematics; (2) the tendency to feel that because they completed homework problems they really \"knew their mathematics,\"; (3) the inability to apply appropriate reading-learning strategies to their mathematics studies; and (4) a feeling of hostility over mathematics classes and anxiety over tests. These students are referred to as \"underdeveloped learners,\" who did not know how to study and learn mathematics. Twelve learning strategies that students should learn to apply are listed and  described. A remediation strategy for these pupils that combines an understanding of problem solving strategies and problem solving is suggested. A self-instructional packet titled \"Problem Solving in Mathematics\" that is designed to help students develop a mind set that will enable them to have some degree of success in required math courses is described. This teacher-developed packet is based on the problem solving approach used by Whimby and Lockhead in their text \"Problem Solving and Comprehension.\" (MP)",

First graders clearly relied on a counting process for their performance, as advanced by the Groen and Parkman &quot;min&quot; (for minimum addend) model. Third grade appears to be a transitional age with respect to addition processing; from fourth grade on, however, performance in both tasks yields evidence of a memory retrieval process as the major vehicle of mental addition. The results are discussed in terms of the Ashcraft and Battaglia (1978) &quot;network-retrieval&quot; model, a model which asserts that simple arithmetic facts are stored in a network representation, and are accessed in a spreading activation-like fashion.

The project aims to develop a psychological &quot;map&quot; focusing on several aspects of the learning process.  The project is concerned not only with what children can do naturally, but also with what they can do accompanied by minimal guidance or following theory based instruction.

        "description":"The two main objectives of the present study were to get a better understanding of sixth-graders' solution processes with respect to arithmetic word problems and to investigate the possibility of improving children's problem-solving ability through instruction. As background for the study, a hypothetical model of the problem-solving process was developed based on previous research. In the first part of the investigation, quantitative and qualitative data on the forms of problem-solving behavior were collected in two classes. In this ascertaining study, important shortcomings in children's solution strategies were discovered, and it was hypothesized that these shortcomings could be overcome by instruction. Therefore a teaching experiment was undertaken during a two-week period  involving teaching the experimental class a solution-strategy for word problems in which estimating the outcome of a problem was a central concern. Estimating a problem's outcome systematically before working out the solution was expected to be an effective heuristic strategy that induces pupils to analyze the problem on the one hand and to anticipate the solution on the other. At the end of the teaching program, a posttest was administered to the experimental and the control groups. The results of this experiment are discussed. (Author/MP)",

Findings from these 30 research studies reveal a wealth of information including: (1) conflicting results when similar treatments are used by different investigators; (2) varied values of the reliability of the SAI, some of which are ignored; (3) reporting of non-significant effects when they are not expected and vice versa; and (4) finding that some correlational studies provide discrepant information about the validity of the SAI. Although some of these results can be explained in terms of the conceptual validity of the SAI, it is concluded that there is some uncertainty of what is being measured by the SAI and that it needs  reworking before it can be used with confidence. The paper concludes with some general concerns about attitude measurement and its place in science education research. (Author/JN)",

Effects on aspects of cognitive structure and performance were investigated. Propositions elicited by a modified word-association technique were used to assess linking in cognitive structure between dynamics and existing knowledge. Performance differences were found between instructional groups for problems requiring the application of material learned to new situations. Path analyses indicated that this effect of instruction on performance was substantially mediated by the extent to which cognitive structure was linked to existing cognitive structure. (Author/JN)",

The quality of life in small cities is difficult to measure because information is scattered, in contrast to the considerable body of centralized information available on large urban centers. To remedy this situation, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development contracted with the Rand Foundation to locate and catalog sources of data on small cities. The cities include all municipalities having at least 2500 residents. Only nonmetropolitan cities--those that lie outside Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSAs)--are included. Another criterion required that the data source be geographically comprehensive in its coverage of cities. A data source that  excluded New England cities, for example, would be unacceptable. The varied kinds of information about small cities provided by this data source include population services offered; financial and government data; location and physical attributes; population and economy; commercial and financial services; cultural, intellectual, educational, and recreational services; health services; protective services; housing; transportation; communications; and environment and climate. For each data source the following information is provided: a brief description of content; geographic coverage; frequency of collection; years covered by the data; availability of the data in hardcopy or as a machine readable data file, and an agency contact point where the user can obtain more information.

        "description":"This publication examines the changes in the roles of women and men and what these changes mean for the future of schools--for educational quality and opportunity and for educational decision making. Women comprise more than 44% of the paid work force. It is estimated that by the year 2000, if not before, work force participation rates of women and men will be equal. Despite women's increasing participation in the work force, the incomes of employed women remain lower than those of employed men. Women are increasingly heading families. The &quot;typical&quot; American family--father employed outside the home and mother working inside the home caring for two children--now constitutes only seven percent of all families in the nation. Eighty-seven percent of all single parent families are  headed by women. Families headed by women are more likely than others to live in poverty. Despite tremendous increases in women's participation in the paid work force, the majority of Americans still work in sex-segregated worlds. The publication then goes on to discuss the role that education plays in maintaining or eliminating these patterns of sex discrimination. For some ethnic groups, females are less likely than males to complete secondary school. Sex-stereotyped roles for females and males are reinforced in elementary and secondary schools by textbooks, by teacher-student interaction, by counseling and counseling materials, and by role models presented to students. There is also discrimination at the postsecondary level. If equity for females and males is to be achieved, there must  be a consensus among educators and community members as to its importance. Goals for achieving sex equity must be articulated and models for program implementation must be developed. Financial and human resources for sex equity must be allocated. Educational personnel must be trained. Monitoring and reinforcement systems should be developed and maintained. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"This monograph contends that the same ethnic preoccupation that is pervading politics in the United States today is also dangerously affecting our educational system. Specifically, pluralistic demands placed on American schools are moving them away from the historical objectives of unifying, providing a common experience for a diverse population, establishing democratic ideals and devotion to civic duty, and providing basic vocational preparation. Examples of 'pluralism gone mad' (defined as any attempt to introduce, on the basis of social equity, programs that divert the educational process from the democratic goals and principles to which it is historically committed) include separation of curriculum, activities, or services on the basis of race, ethnic background, or sex;  bilingual education aimed at supporting a jobs program rather than valid educational purposes; accommodation of the idiosyncratic values and personal behavior of every individual; educational reform based on evangelism or spiritualism; attempts to make all learning activities relevant and immediately gratifying; and attempts to meet the curriculum desires of every special interest group and every political persuasion. Several recommendations are offered to guide reform of the educational system, including establishing parent governance committees at each school, strengthening the quality of teacher preparation, supporting affirmative action programs that lead to the employment of the best qualified persons regardless of race or sex, and improving student achievement. The conclusion is  that the agenda of American schools should be to concentrate on quality rather than pluralism. (DB)",

        "description":"This booklet deals with moral education examining major issues of theory and public policy and suggesting how educators might approach their roles as moral educators in the real world of schools. Written in a question/answer format, the booklet is organized into four major sections. In the first section, the author defines moral education to mean what the school does, directly and indirectly, to affect both the student's ethical behavior and his capacity to think about issues of right and wrong. The second section examines the pros and cons of moral education. Cons include: there is too much diversity in our society to have a program of moral education in our schools, moral education is difficult to teach without indoctrinating, and morals and values are very complex. The pros  include: teachers and parents recognize the need for moral education and that moral education is inevitable. Approaches to moral education are presented in the third section of the booklet. Values education, Kohlberg's cognitive moral development approach, moral reasoning, and an approach which sets out to teach a particular set of values are discussed. In the concluding chapter, the author points out that each approach has certain strengths and should be used to gain certain ends. The author suggests that we draw on all of these alternatives and use a synthesis approach. Four steps for a program of moral education are suggested: consciousness raising and information sharing with teachers and parents, a study program leading to a general plan, the development of a curriculum and  implementation plan with a strong experiential dimension for students, and a system of evaluation.

        "description":"This booklet describes Alvin Toffler's future society and culture and examines its potential impact on education. In his book, \"The Third Wave,\" Toffler describes our civilization's progress through two major phases (waves). The First Wave began some 8,000 years ago when man became agricultural. The Industrial Revolution began the Second Wave. The Third Wave is just now starting. The values upon which the Third Wave society is based are: personal fulfillment, feelings of self-worth, and time for leisure; meaningful and stimulating work; individuals who are self-reliant and autonomous; and a reasonable degree of security. Because of education's lack of success in innovation and change, many doubt our educational system can respond, much less lead us into the Third Wave. If  education is to be valued by a Third Wave population, education will have to be different. It will have to be less formal, expensive, and wasteful, and more individualized, realistic, humane, fun, and lifelong. The curriculum of the future will (1) focus on preventive mental and physical health; (2) create a responsive environment for learners; (3) be more integrated and will be organized around major topics; (4) emphasize acquisition of critical thinking and problem-solving skills; (5) stress the ability to locate and use resources; and (6) encourage building human relationships. More use will be made of interdisciplinary instructional teams often composed of specialized personnel from business, industry, and the professions. Also, there will be new organizational structures for schools.  (Author/RM)",

The three major objectives of human rights education and teaching are: (1) to foster the attitudes of tolerance, respect, and solidarity inherent in human rights; (2) to provide knowledge about human rights, in both their national and international dimensions, and the institutions established for their implementation; and (3) to develop the student's awareness of the ways and means by which human rights can be translated into social and political reality at both the national and the international levels. Because research has indicated the importance of the years before adolescence in human rights education, activities have been included for this age group as well as  for advanced students. The majority of activities are more suitable for classrooms where teachers are used to engaging in open discussions with their students. However, many of the activities can also be adapted by resourceful teachers for use in more structured situations. The activities are grouped under three areas: basic human rights concepts; organizations and procedures which protect human rights; and specific situations and ways in which human rights are violated. The many and varied activities include the following: students are asked to study The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UNESCO, 1948); identify human needs and human rights themes in short stories and novels; and identify themes concerning human rights and oppressions in historical periods.

Written in Standard Fortran IV, the model currently runs on mainframe or mini computers, but has not been adapted for micros. It has been successfully installed on Harris, Burroughs, Telefunken, CDC, Univac, IBM, and Prime machines. It requires about 54K core. The global model of IFs represents the world in ten nations or regional groupings: The United States, Western Europe, the rest of the Western Developed World, Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, Latin America (except OPEC), Africa (except South Africa and OPEC) plus the Non-OPEC Middle East, OPEC, South and Southeast Asia, and China. The issues of IFs are the rapid acceleration of global population growth, the  uncertainty of food sufficiency, the degradation of environmental quality, the shortages or crises of resource (especially energy) availability, and the persistent gap between the global rich and poor. The base year of IFs is 1975. It is normally used through 2000 or 2025, although it can theoretically run indefinitely. The model, which has over 2,000 variables, has four major submodels: population, economics, agriculture, and energy. Each submodel separately represents each region. Interested readers are invited to request user manuals or equation descriptions from the author. (Author/RM)",

Responses indicated that as far as child-bearing practice, value of homelife, the amount of time spent at home, and sex and marriage are concerned, the students of  1967 conceived them as more important and valuable to their personal life than students in 1980, regardless of their sex. At the same time, the results showed increasingly conservative views on birth control, care of the aged at home, and modern influences on Norway from the outside. This movement within a thirteen-year-period indicates that the personal views of many prospective teachers run counter to the values explicitly upheld and promulgated in Norwegian schools. The values foundation on which the Norwegian society and school rest appears to be less solid and cohesive today than 13 years ago, presenting a clear challenge to educators on all levels in that country.

Patricia Bidol, in \"A Preservice Model for Multicultural Education\" and \"Preservice Student Teaching Model for Multicultural Education,\" describes six phases for developing and testing a preservice model for multicultural education. Eugene F. Provenzo, Jr., lists brief statements and suggested lecture topics in educational equity for introductory education courses in his  article, \"Educational Equity and the Social Foundations of Education.\"\"Cultural Diversity, Psychology, and Learning,\" by Roger L. Collins, acquaints the reader with some of the concepts of educational equity that relate to the study of educational psychology. Consuelo Nieto's article, \"Multiculturalism and the Methodology of Teaching,\" outlines the general processes and content that can be adapted to any teacher preparation program that is incorporating multicultural and equity concepts into its curriculum.

        "description":"This study was designed to identify teaching-learning process behaviors that affect pupil achievement on a psychomotor task. Forty preservice physical education teachers each taught a twenty-minute cartwheel lesson to three elementary school pupils. Students' cartwheels were filmed before and after the instructional sessions, and analyzed for body control. The videotaped instructional sessions were analyzed using a teacher behavior observation system. Factor analysis of the raw data led to the formation of four teacher behavior factors. Group instruction of specific information and feedback to a single student on the entire motion were positively related to pupil achievement, while simultaneous practice with the teacher talking and detailed verbal feedback were negatively related  to pupil achievement. Eighty percent of variation was explained by learners' readiness for instruction. It was concluded that the appropriateness of teacher behaviors depended not only on the expected learning outcomes, but also on the readiness of the learners to benefit from specific teacher-learner interactions.

The participants for the first year (1979) were 21 elementary and secondary school teachers with a median of 8.6 years of teaching experience. The second year (1980) participants numbered 49, consisting of elementary, secondary, and special education teachers. Summer School in Action met for five weeks, for five days a week. The dual format program provided teachers with opportunities for self help through individual contracts and, at the same time, gave additional learning experience to school age children, many with learning problems. The teacher training was divided into six components: large group activities, home  group activities, round table discussions, workshops, independent study, and classroom observation and practice. Through questionnaires, the program was found to be effective in improving content knowledge in 1979, and in increasing instructional skills in 1980, reflecting a shift in needs by the participants. The long-term attitudes of participants were determined to be favorable because of the use of skills or materials acquired in the program ten months later. (FG)",

The sense of the original game is usually not altered significantly because the number of rule changes is kept to a minimum. Changes in rules may be made for administrative or financial reasons, or to adjust to the participants or to the quality or quantity of participation. Suggestions for modifying team sports are presented. Some rule modifications for soccer involve the adjusting to the height and number of team members, number of allowable hits, officiating, and allocating time. In football, there are rule modifications to prevent injuries and unnecessary collisions, alter the size and design of playing area, determine the time  length for the game, and to break ties in the scoring. Two modifications for standard slow- and fast-pitch softball games deal with the length of the game and the amount of game action in the time period. Many skills used in playing ice hockey can be learned by replacing the ice rink with the gymnasium floor. There are many alternative rules that could be used in basketball to eliminate the stopping of the time clock and to keep the game moving. (CJ)",

Previous studies have indicated that most Teacher Corps projects will need specialized technical assistance and external support if they are to carry out even minimally effective outreach programs. It is pointed out that, while most members of the Corps regard themselves as educators and not &quot;disseminators&quot;, it is critically important that school improvement programs be extended beyond local project activities. It is suggested that the Teacher Corps employ direct measures to reward dissemination activity and that  the Corps provide training and technical assistance to projects to build their capabilities for outreach. Seven specific recommendations are made for improving the information dissemination processes, and the means of implementing and funding them are discussed.

The composition of the two systems is explored pragmatically, with an overall objective of assisting teachers in their endeavors to make teaching and learning more efficient, effective, and rewarding. The differences between the two philosophies are apparent: humanism assigns the responsibility for learning to the student, while behaviorism assigns the responsibility for learning to the teacher. Humanism is concerned with self-directed activity such as creativity and self-discovery. Applying humanism to a physical education course entails creating an environment of psychological, intellectual, and physical (movement) freedom. The  behaviorist model of teaching represents a branch of psychology which relies on a stimulus-response view of education. The central idea of behaviorism is that behavior is affected by its consequences, and the future occurrence of behaviors is influenced by the way in which the environment (usually people) responds to those behaviors. An effective combination of both systems, which at first glance seems antithetical, would use the following steps: (1) identify specific target behaviors; (2) select the educational experiences; (3) organize the educational experiences; and (4) evaluate the effect.

The main concepts are: (1) know your media contacts, and let them know that you are available for questioning; (2) know the kinds of information they want; (3) be aware of and observe deadlines; (4) show that you are a valuable news source by recognizing the types of news items that are interesting and timely; and (5) be accurate, consistent, and persistent. Pursuing media contacts may mean initiating the relationship with news personnel, including the sports editor. Ideas for increasing media interest include giving sports luncheons, open houses, and media passes to publicize sports events. Some ways to think of news items are in terms  of unusual angles, accomplishments, seasonal timeliness, and visual presentation for television. A list of do's and don'ts advises promptness, care in off-the-record remarks, and points of etiquette in dealing with editors of news stories. (FG)",

Because the field of women's sports has not had the amount of media exposure compared to that of professional sports, collegiate men's revenue sports, and high school sports, the women's sports publicist must rely on the usual and the unusual methods of advancing and reporting women's sports events. The news release containing \"hard\" news items (as opposed to feature articles) is the main communicative tool for the publicist. However, the feature story with an interesting angle is the best assurance of highlighted program coverage. Coaches and athletes can support the women's sports program by participating in radio discussions, writing columns  for local papers, and by being accessible to the media at sports events. Although many women's sports programs lack the funds for advertising, increased spectator interest can create greater sports coverage, making public service announcements, radio giveaways, community calendars, and other low-cost publicity efforts necessary.

        "description":"An information-processing view of perceptual motor performance holds that the processes involved in perception are organizational and depend on past experiences. In motor tasks which require anticipation, an individual uses past experience to predict what may happen. Yet bias effects in perceptual judgments, including bias caused by contextual stimuli, may explain the significant differences in coincidence-anticipation performance due to stimulus speed so often found in previous research. This study observed the relationship between stimulus context and performance on an anticipatory motor skill after extended practice by skilled subjects. Two groups of 20 female college athletes each were tested for their reaction to coincidence-anticipation tasks. Following four days of  practice, one group was transferred to the same stimulus speeds given to the other group. Results showed that each group improved during the training, although the pattern of improvement was not identical. Both groups demonstrated a significant tendency to respond late as well as less accurately and more variably to the slowest speed. The groups performed similarly except that the transferred group was significantly later in responding to the slowest speed. A significant speed factor for constant error and individual trial means indicated subjects were influenced by contextual stimuli. Bias effects therefore seem to persist, even after extended practice. (Author/CJ)",

The exemplary interscholastics program planned for the 1980s is based on recommendations solicited from coaches, athletic directors, principals, parents, and students. Recommendations include: (1) Efforts should be made to explore and implement sports that are indigenous to Hawaii, allowing equal access for girls and the  physically handicapped; (2) The policy-making structure governing the program should continue with some changes; (3) The state should provide full funding for transportation and compensation for athletic staff salaries; (4) All schools should have certified athletic directors selected by the principlas; and (5) Every high school should have minimum athletic facilities, including: fields for football/soccer, baseball and track; tennis courts; swimming pool; gymnasium; and weight training and wrestling facilities.

There is a positive correlation of .5 to .7 between the department mean sender and mean matriculant scores; however, about an equal number of departments in both fields were found to enroll students with average test scores that were relatively lower as well as relatively higher than their average sender scores. Results were similar for departments with high, moderate, and low reputational ratings. Although the self-selection of  applicants appears to account for a large part of departmental &quot;selectivity&quot; as this is represented by average GRE Aptitude Test scores, the study concludes that average sender scores should not be used to describe the admissions selectivity of individual graduate departments in these two fields.

In 1976, statutes were enacted in  category five in Minnesota (the Planning, Evaluating and Reporting--PER--Legislation). This paper provides a description of this legislation, the results of the first two years' experience with its implementation, and a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses as opposed to minimum competency testing. Data from 1978-79 and 1979-80 reports to the Department of Education and from a 1980 survey of administrators, Board members, and citizens describe the kinds of planning, evaluating, and reporting taking place, and judgments of professionals and laymen about the process. Results show that PER has served Minnesota schools well, and provided a vechicle for constructive community participation in goal-setting and prioritizing. (Author/GK)",

It is important to recognize that a curriculum program and its evaluation are highly interactive throughout the curriculum development process. It is critical in deciding upon a definition to guide evaluation efforts that due importance is given to the pervasiveness of the evaluative dimension of all human activity, and to the fact that it is present in a range of individual and public judgment processes which exist whether or not  an evaluation is formally commissioned or expected of project and program participants.

A longitudinal study of five schools working with two development efforts illustrates the complexity of this process. Each development effort sought to create an &quot;approach&quot; that external linking agents could use to help schools modify their programs in specific areas. Data come from two years of participant observation and numerous interviews with teachers and administrators in the schools as well as linking agents from the development efforts. The study suggests that: (1) the knowledge transfer process consisted of four analytically distinct stages that overlapped in time; (2) developers rely on practical knowledge in different ways; and (3) teachers' practical  knowledge is grounded in a pragmatic, concrete occupational culture. The knowledge transfer process is characterized by tension between research and practical knowledge which is worked out in different ways at each stage. (Author/GK)",

One concern for the future of SNA stems from the elevation of distrust among participants in a turbulent environment such as Pontiac's. As a result, the kinds of reflective questions that are posed by network researchers are often greeted with suspicion and apathy making data difficult to verify. Another concern is that the attention focused on structure may obscure the interest in process. A third concern is for the explanatory usefulness of SNA. From an ecological perspective, education should be  incorporated at the local level within a more general social service rubric that includes youth groups, churches, recreational agencies, child health agencies, and family organizations. The major tasks confronting network researchers are: (1) developing more adequate data collection techniques that can be validated; (2) incorporating more dynamic analyses of network processes; and (3) linking network research studies to theoretical development in many disciplines.

This paper is organized into six major sections. The first section outlines the general instructional conditions and procedures described in books and articles dealing with mastery learning. The second section discusses two aspects of the initial group-based instruction: teaching to objectives and the use of appropriate teaching methods or presentations. The third section focuses on the importance of porper sequencing of instructional activities and units. The fourth section presents information  concerning corrective instruction. The fifth section briefly details the types of enrichment activities used in existing mastery learning programs. Finally, the sixth section presents ideas concerning the role of classroom management in complementing a mastery learning instructional program.

Some of the more prominent elements in the evaluation process that constrain or encourage evaluation utilization were analyzed. A &quot;constraint&quot; to evaluation utilization was defined as something that a typical administrator would find limits his/her choices or understanding. An &quot;encourager&quot; to evaluation utilization was something that increases an administrator's understanding. Three of the general features that emerged from the data--proximity, competing demands on time, and psychosocial variables--were discussed and their actions as constraints and  encouragers to evaluation utilization were analyzed. Sharers, i.e., cooperative decision makers, made the greatest use of evaluation information that arose at the local level and had more direct personal contact. Confronters, i.e., decision makers who were more directive about change, appreciated the clout that came from evaluations generated by higher authority at other levels of the organization. A number of suggestions were made to increase evaluation utilization at the site level. (Author/RL)",

The materials for this analysis comprise separate teacher evaluation documents, all originating since 1974, from 12 large school districts across the nation. From the 50 documents a general picture of teacher evaluation procedures emerges which has the following features: (1) an effort to consult with the teacher and keep the teacher informed  concerning the process and its results; (2) classroom observation is a ubiquitous feature; (3) diagnosis, counseling, and the offering of assistance take place; (4) a final judgment is reached based upon the relevant data; and (5) alongside the formal evaluation process, there is provision for an informal evaluation process which can give a large measure of discretionary power. Document features reflecting system needs are outlined, along with the most urgent teacher evaluation needs for research. (RL)",

By confirmatory factor analysis with boys and girls independently, the separation of worry and emotionality as test anxiety components proved successful. The Test Anxiety Inventory (TAI), a self-report scale designed to measure individual differences in test anxiety as a situation-specific trait, was used in the study.

Third grade teachers in the experimental schools were provided with in-service training in the Magic Circle primary prevention strategy. Process evaluation data included: (1) documentation of in-service training by outside observers; (2) teacher feedback on individual training sessions; (3) questionnaire surveys of teachers at the end of training and the school year; (4) interviews with a sample of teachers and principals; (5) observations of classroom implementation, and (6) weekly reports by  teachers about classroom implementation. Process evaluation showed that the teachers mastered most of the skills taught, and they found most of them to be useful in the classroom. Student- and class-level analyses of variance/covariance on outcome data showed that boys in the experimental group had significantly higher social self-esteem at the end of the school year. No effects of Magic Circle were obtained for girls, and the level of exposure to Magic Circle was not related to experimental students' post-test outcomes. (Author/GK)",

The program was designed to offer bilingual instruction and supportive services to the school's Haitian population, with the aim of preparing these students to participate in mainstream social, economic, and political life. This report contains: (1) a description of program objectives; (2) an outline of the instructional component, including descriptions of funding sources and discussions of the English instructional program, the French/Creole instructional program, and mainstream courses; and (3) a review of the program's noninstructional component, including curriculum development, supportive  services, staff development, parental/community involvement, extracurricular activities, and student response to the program. Also presented are a description of assessment instruments and procedures and the results of student achievement tests. Program strengths are concluded to have been staff dedication and the development of French curriculum materials. Weaknesses are described as conflict over the amount of English instruction, lack of parent participation, lack of Creole language materials, lack of a bilingual counselor, and poor articulation between the bilingual program and other school departments. Appended to the report are copies of curricular and other materials produced by the program. (GC)",

The paper begins with a speculative consideration of the ways in which work experience might affect later employability. Three types of research literature are then reviewed: (1) economic studies of the relation between youth work and subsequent employment and earnings; (2) research on the effects of work experience on adolescent development; and (3) evaluation studies of employment and training programs. The next section presents a radical critique of current educational programs. It is suggested that the most effective means of enhancing youth employability would be to make more equally available attractive and rewarding employment opportunites and to increase the number of such jobs by  improving the quality of work life. An ecological perspective which serves as framework for recommendations on research and programs is then proposed, and ten recommendations on programs and five on research are formulated.

To these ends, a study was conducted to assess staff development programs, inservice education programs, and other strategies for improving education in desegregated schools. Programs were analyzed in terms of planning, preparation, implementation, application, and evaluation. Officials from the school districts' central offices, school principals, teachers, students, and parents and community members were interviewed. This report summarizes the literature review, interview findings, survey results, and  methodological discussion contained in the original study. Based on survey and interview data, the report concludes that desegregation problems can be dealt with through more effective staff development efforts. (APM)",

Part II examines the nature and effects of the change strategy with specific reference to: (1) the learning communities which formed the new instructional environment; (2) staff development; (3) decision making within the school community; and (4) community and parental involvement and satisfaction. A general discussion of such issues as test scores, the transference program, and funding concludes this section. Part III presents insights from practitioner experience and reflections from an external perspective on  educational innovation and innovators.

Various theories regarding these relations, including a definition of ethnic groups, are reviewed and a synthesis is advanced. This theory is based on a conflict model of society and considers the roles of coercion, differentiation, conflict, cultural patterns, and social structures in the adaptive processes of ethnic groups. The problem of overlapping or intersecting economic, political and cultural contradictions is analyzed. It is hypothesized that these contradictions will force certain changes in the way a majority treats minority groups, that these changes are connected with changes in the economic and  political status of an ethnic group, and that the improvement of a minority group's situation will enlarge its common ground with the dominant group.

Additional program components included staff development and parent and community participation. The program was evaluated through the analysis of student achievement data, evaluator observation, and rating scales and questionnaires completed by program staff. Standardized test scores indicated that pupils in grades one through four, six, and seven made significant gains in reading.  No additional achievement data were available. Staff evaluations were generally positive. Activities planned to involve parents were successful and staff training workshops were satisfactory. Rating scales, questionnaires, and tables of data are included. (MK)",

        "description":"Despite the currency of &quot;equity&quot; as a general objective among technical assistance personnel and feminist groups, little serious attention has been given to developing consensus on definition, rationale, and methodology. Rather, attention has been on the promotion of full compliance with Title IX, in itself a major thrust toward equity. School district compliance efforts are strengthened, however, if the goal becomes educational equity instead of the retention of Federal money. This paper attempts to define educational sex equity and to provide a rationale for full equity in terms of outcomes for students and benefits for school districts. It seeks to clarify the relationship of compliance to equity, and to provide a method of analyzing the short and long term costs and benefits  for students and schools of both minimal and maximal equity responses. In addition, it presents some implications for action based on the goals of full equity. It is argued that failure to establish full equity as a goal is in the long run severely dysfunctional for students and schools, is costly in both financial and human terms, and creates disjuncture between the schools and society. It is thus held that while maximal equity responses to Title IX may appear radical now, they are essentially practical and cost effective when viewed from a long range perspective. (Author/GC)",

        "description":"Existing models for explaining individual educational attainment have not been particularly useful for explanations of the high dropout rate for black youths. This study employes a status attainment approach in analyzing the school dropout problem, using data from disadvantaged black youth who were enrolled in 1979 in a targeted job placement program funded by The Comprehensive Employment Training Act. The analysis shows that the school dropout rate among black youth in the program is related to family residential instability. In addition, it shows that dropouts tend to come from larger families than do high school graduates. Only weak relationships of parents education and youth aspirations with dropout rates are evidenced. (Author/APM)",

This situation has the potential to lead to an incorrect estimation of the treatment effect when assignment to treatment and control groups is not random. This paper adopts techniques that were recently developed in the econometric analysis of labor and markets and applies these techniques in order to resolve the bias problem of conventional evaluation models. The selection bias problem is placed in a broader context by considering references to the institutional setting of evaluation research and to its application in labor economies. The paper concludes with several caveats  about the proposed technique. (Author/MK)",

(Experience-based career education is a type of program in which high school students spend a major portion of their time on learning projects in the community. Activities in EBCE are tailored to individual needs, abilities, learning styles, and goals, and students are guided in their learning through on-going relationships with a variety of working adults in the community.) The sample projects presented in this packet illustrate the wide range of approaches teachers can use when writing individualized learning projects for students using nonclassroom resources. The samples are real. They represent hundreds of student projects that were written and carried out in six  EBCE programs, and, as such, reveal the workability of the project approach to learning. In this packet, sample projects are given for each of the EBCE curriculum's five Life Skills categories: critical thinking, personal/social development, science, functional citizenship, and creative development. Each section of the packet contains the following material: learning objectives, a sample predesigned project as a &quot;starter,&quot; and several sample individually negotiated projects. In addition, three appendixes are provided at the end of the packet to illustrate how the same interest area, topic, or theme can be interpreted in substantially different ways for students with different basic skills needs, and how the learning needs and interests identified in a student's profile can lead to several  different, individually negotiated projects.

Topics covered in level 1 include the scope and role of distributive education, career development, and fundamentals of selling and sales communication; written and oral  communications and mathematics in marketing and distribution; personal development, human relations, and ethics; and American business and the free enterprise system. Level 2 covers such additional areas as marketing strategy and promotional mix, product and service technology, stock control and facility safety, and sales promotion. Marketing management competency development in such areas as human relations, communications, mathematics, sales promotion, merchandising, operations, and administration and supervision are outlined in level 3.

        "description":"This monograph by educator-philosopher Eli Ginzberg, commisioned by the Phi Delta Kappa Educational Foundation, examines the transition from school to work, exploring why the transition is so hard for some groups of young people, relatively easy for others. The point of the book is not to add one more research report to the literature dealing with detailed aspects of the educational system or of the labor market for youth. Rather, the monograph strives to set out the critical interfacing between these two large systems--the school and the world of work--with regard for the way in which each is affected in turn by the family and the larger society. The book's seven chapters explore the following concepts: the background of the concern for youth unemployment and the origins of  youth employment programs; theories about youth unemployment; statistics on employment and unemployment for affluent and poor, white and black youth; the role of the family in the preparation of youth, environmental differences between white and minority youth, the problems of inner city schools, and the differing conditions of earlier immigrant groups and today's ghetto residents; the role of the military as a shaping experience for youth; school as the opportunity matrix, and how different population groups relate to school; programs in both school and the labor market aimed at improving the employability of youth; and recommendations for improving the transition from school to work. A list of suggested readings is included. (KC)",

        "description":"The action principles and concepts developed in the field of adult education may be generalized to include the practice of continuing medical education. A review of learning theory and research reveals that adult learning varies along four dimensions: (1) ability to accept new information and adopt new practices; (2) approach to learning; (3) ways of processing information; and (4) way of thinking. In all these dimensions adult learning is characterized by a dynamic tension between stability and change in physical condition role requirements, personality, and social context of the adult. Learning is viewed as the primary means by which the tension and anxiety characteristic of adult development is resolved. Consequently, the action principles and concepts proposed in adult  education literature focus on the role of the adult and continuing medical educator in facilitating the reduction of this tension in adults through provision of systematic learning activities. Continuing medical educators may adopt these principles of adult education to the specific developmental needs of physicians and must replicate them only when they clearly do not apply to the practice of continuing medical education or when no action principle for a continuing medical education problem exists.

This report examines a selected group of six of these studies and attempts to extract from them the information items which best represent the ideas, the conclusions, and the recommendations they contain. The report is a synthesis of the selected studies, designed to provide CETA and vocational education policymakers and practitioners with information on the development of successful CETA/vocational education coordination. The  report is organized in four chapters. Chapter 1 describes the objectives and approach of the study, names and describes the six studies selected for review, provides general observations on linking CETA and vocational education, and examines the overall conclusions of the selected studies. Chapter 2 of the report contains an analysis of state and local coordination of CETA and vocational education based on four of the selected studies. In Chapter 3, selected studies are reviewed in terms of the information they contain on successful CETA/vocational education planning and successful service delivery. Chapter 4 is addressed to those interested in the study approaches taken by the researchers; it summarizes the goal, methodology, and report contents for each selected study. Information on  how to obtain each of the selected studies is included. (KC)",

Project activities included identification and direct referral by counselors, a home-school coordinator, other school district alternative programs, and outside agencies; meetings with counselors and principals at the secondary school to discuss the ABE program; involving secondary personnel in the advisory board; providing opportunities for  secondary personnel to visit ABE sites; development of an ongoing system of feedback to secondary school personnel; and frequent communication. In the first year, 75 per cent of the 316 referrals enrolled in ABE clases. Data concerning area dropouts and program participants were collected and studied, and a follow-up study was also conducted.

An attempt was made to be as comprehensive as was considered practical. Documents dated prior to 1960 and the preponderance of research on small group behavior within a social-psychological context were limited to a few representative review articles. Hundreds of source documents were investigated to obtain just over 100 relevant reports that focus on definitional issues; individual,  task, and team characteristics of team training; the role of feedback; performance objectives; measurement and evaluation; and the potential of instructional system development for effective team training. Findings are briefly discussed for each of these areas. The appendix contains an annotated bibliography.

Program success was determined by the following data: post-release employment of at least 60 percent; recidivism rates of less than 30 percent for all program participants; and a rate of 70 percent or better for in-program success of participants. Information was studied on a qualitative basis, using information collected through a case study approach of successful programs in 10 institutions. Successful programs were found to be characterized by 10 critical components/variables that  functioned to overcome problems encountered in many vocational programs in corrections: administration, coordination and cooperation, curriculum and instruction, facilities/equipment, funding, placement and followup, planning, policy, staffing, and support services. Four ideas were offered for consideration as elements for a federal policy on correctional education: (1) specification of communication and development of inter-agency agreements between correctional vocational programs and other agencies; (2) funding provisions to provide seed and initial monies to initiate innovative vocational education programs in corrections; (3) encouragement of development of comprehensive educational programs providing an entire range of necessary services; and (4) provisions for a research component.

The center was constructed as the hub of a network of existing services. Included in the network of over 300 agencies linked by the Oakland CCERC are the Oakland Public Schools, the Employment Development Department, the National Alliance of Business, the Oakland Youth Employment Service, the Community Careers Council, Oakland Adult School, and Peralta Colleges. Center services included simulation, counseling, occupational information, placement, teacher training, and providing experiences in the world of work. Examination of the development and operation of the Oakland CCERC combined  with a national survey conducted by the project made possible the identification of some central principles concerning the formation of a CCERC. The Oakland CCERC expanded the career education audience and filled service gaps in the area of linking components, thus enabling existing agencies to function cooperatively and better serve and refer their clients.

A revised inventory was developed and administered to 194 students in eight selected programs at Toledo vocational high schools (data processing, food service, retailing, animal care, horticulture, stenography, auto mechanics, and machinists). In addition, students' instructors provided evaluative data about each student. Student scores on the revised instrument were compared to teacher evaluations. Next, students were provided with feedback in the form of computer printouts on the levels of affective characteristics that both they and successful workers possessed.  Finally, an evaluation instrument was administered to respondents to obtain information on the perceived usefulness and effectiveness of the instrument and feedback system. Data analysis revealed significant correlations for eight of the ten affective competency clusters investigated, and students believed that the inventory and feedback provided were helpful and informative. Recommendations called for research on the inventory as a placement tool and development of accompanying instructional materials.

Overall, fewer than half the required audits have been performed, the principal reason being a lack of audit resources. An evaluation of three of ten regional offices responsible for auditing prime sponsors showed significant variance in the extent to which they accomplish required audits. The Department of Labor's difficulty in controlling the audit process stems from a shortage of audit staff. Many of the audits performed did not meet applicable audit standards. Audits accomplished under the CETA program were reviewed to evaluate quality and thoroughness of work performed. Audits were found (1) not always to  be timely, (2) not to cover subsponsor activities, and (3) not to have all the characteristics of an acceptable quality audit.

Some schools have developed alternative courses for students in transition from school to work. Innovative career guidance programs in schools may (1) provide for work experience, (2) specify professional development in career  education for teachers, (3) produce career education resource materials, or (4) involve career teachers in link courses cooperatively developed by secondary and postsecondary agencies.

Although many programs, such as the War on Poverty and the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) had addressed these problems previously, these programs had failed to provide a knowledge base for youth programs for the 1980s. Past knowledge development efforts were not adequately balanced, coordinated, disseminated, or operationalized. The knowledge development required by the 1977 YEDPA is documented in a series of reports, grouped into 12 categories. This document, the first of  the reports, presents a rationale for the knowledge development effort, and an overview of the entire YEDPA program and the reports stemming from it. The three plans contained in this document provide the framework for the following &quot;Youth Knowledge Development Reports.&quot; The three plans build on each other. The first plan emphasizes the coordinated assessment of &quot;first order&quot; issues needed to legislate more effective youth programs. The second plan fine tunes the questions and better structures the activities to address more detailed administrative, service mix, and target group issues, and to test longer duration interventions. The third plan stresses follow-through on previous activities and also emphasizes dissemination and application of the findings. In addition, implications for the  1980s are discussed. (KC)",

The NLS is a continued survey of 12,693 youth age 14-21 as of July 1, 1979. Of these, 1,281 are persons in the military. This preliminary study of the first interview in February-May, 1979, reports the following findings: (1) employment opportunities offered by the Armed Forces are dramatically affected by public policy decisions; (2) the Armed Forces are more egalitarian than the private sector as a labor market,  perhaps too much so in the sense that almost all entrants are paid the same and the wage structure is too compressed to attract or retain enough highly skilled workers; (3) as a result of public policy, the Armed Forces are less egalitarian in hiring women and blacks than the private sector; (4) those who went into the service would be better off there, while those the service wants are less well off in the service than they would be in the private sector; (5) high turnover is the result of these practices, so the armed forces must invest heavily in training; and (6) the evidence is not yet in to determine the impacts of the Armed Forces on individual development.

This report on assessment of the Job Corps presents a large array of studies ranging from rigorous impact and benefit-cost evaluations to survey of nutrition in centers. It is intended to be a compendium of most of what has been learned about the Job Corps in the 1970s, particularly since the youth initiatives were launched in 1977. The key elements in this report are the six-month follow-up study of Job Corps enrollees and a benefit-cost analysis based on these findings. There are several major findings of the study: (1) Job Corps apparently produces benefits to society in terms of  increased earnings of participants, lowered transfer payments, and reduced crime, which exceed its costs; (2) older youth stay longer and tend to make significant employment and earnings gains while younger participants benefit from socialization and gain maturity; (3) the self-paced individualized approach of Job Corps seems to work in education and vocational training; and (4) it may take as long as five years of operation for centers to stabilize and participant benefits to be seen.

Principal findings of the study are the following: (1) the rapid implementation of YEDPA was a major accomplishment; (2) although the YEDPA emphasis on knowledge development resulted in more local evaluation, little productive data have  been generated; (3) work experience should be coupled with teaching basic work habits and their importance; (4) youth advisory councils are not effective in increasing youth participation; (5) sponsors concentrated on the economically disadvantaged; (6) YEDPA resources were substituting in some cases for funds from other youth programs; (7) community-based organizations were &quot;thoroughly involved&quot; in the youth program delivery; (8) links with local education agencies were poor but promising; and (9) the private sector and unions were rarely involved in sponsor initiatives.

The next five chapters (2-6) are devoted to the topics used to structure the review: (1) public sector job creation, (2) access to the private sector, (3) educational strategies and institutions, (4) supportive services, and (5) management and research. These chapters open with a brief discussion of the main goals/purposes of the law with respect to the topic. They then proceed, in  a largely narrative manner, to delineate lessons accumulated through two years of implementing the law. Chapter 7 is a brief concluding note on knowledge development.

The evaluation involved a 1755-student test group and a 1684-student control group from 30 sites funded by six delivery agents (National Urban League, National Council of Negro Women, SER Jobs for Progress, the Recruitment and Training Program, the U.S. Employment Service, and the Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor). Approaches at these sites included activities to eliminate sex stereotyping; helping Hispanic, black, and other minority youth; use of instituional agencies to facilitate the school-to-work transition; and use of community- and neighborhood-based groups to accomplish the same task. Surveys to measure  performance outcomes after a three-month followup period revealed that the school-to-work transition activities produced a statistically significant increase in abilities to find and hold jobs. While postprogram outcomes at the three-month period are modest, significant gains, probably adequate to justify costs, are realized by certain of the delivery agents and certain subgroups of the target population.

Eight VICI programs, each of which enrolled up to 60 unemployed, out-of-school, economically disadvantaged youths between the ages of 16 and 19, were started at the following sites: Broward County, Florida; Chicago, Illinois; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Newark, Jersey; New Haven, Connecticut; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and the South Bronx in New York City. Program participants worked five days a week under supervision of union journeyman drawn from the construction and building trades. Although the work varied among the sites, it was aimed at making tangible community improvements through  such activities as refurbishing public facilities or repairing homes occupied by poor or elderly people from the same neighborhoods as the youths enrolled in the program. The VICI model relied heavily on a set of linkages (including educational institutions, labor unions, and various local agencies) to tie the program to other institutions. Activities at each site were summarized and evaluated, and practical suggestions for prime sponsors seeking to implement VICI-type projects were made.

        "description":"A study compared the effectiveness of public and private sector work experience programs. In five locations equal numbers of jobs were developed in the private and public/nonprofit sectors. To equalize the incentives relative to the public sector, full wage subsidies were provided on an experimental basis in the private sector. Youth were matched in pairs and randomly assigned to one of the two sectors. They were tested at entry and completion using the Standardized Assessment System and supplemental measures. Preliminary results of the study indicated that it is harder to develop jobs and match disadvantaged out-of-school youth to jobs in the private sector, even when full wage costs are covered. Youth are more frequently terminated in the private sector. Finally, the subsequent  placement rate into unsubsidized jobs as a percentage of all participants is higher in the private sector, while the placement rate into subsidized plus unsubsidized jobs is about the same. Thus, the early finding is that the benefits of private sector employment do not significantly outweigh those of public or nonprofit sector employment for dropouts, although differences are in the anticipated directions.

The fundamental elements of this two-year demonstration program include a simplified planning framework to utilize fully the flexibility resulting from consolidation of summer, school-year, and year-round and in- and out-of-school programs; an individualized service delivery approach; reports on participants, services, and expenditures; specification of new individual performance requirements; local establishment of benchmarks of achievement to assess  progress of participants towards basic competencies required for successful employment; emphasis on linkages with education and vocational education; and experimentation with flexibility in allowance payments. The first two quarterly assessments indicate the basic soundness of the notions involved in CYEP, but also the challenges in implementation. Problems and recommendations for solving problems in the areas of program planning, administration, and enrollment were discussed.

The study revealed that the nation's first guarantee job program was implemented on a large scale, quickly, though not without a great deal of stress and strain. There were obvious difficulties in implementation, some caused  by the unique features of YIEPP, others by the difficulties of coordinating so many independent agencies. Yet, the model was generally preserved though the provision of all its services was delayed at many of the sites. While many issues remain to be addressed in the longer term, the preliminary judgment is that entitlement is feasible in reaching and employing large numbers of eligibles.

Overall, findings document improvement of the sites in implementing the YIEPP model. While the demonstration has enrolled impressive numbers of youths, there were  some limitations on the ability and willingness of prime sponsors to establish and enforce school and work attendance and performance standards and to reverify youths. Sponsors were generally able to develop enough jobs and to reduce the time lag between enrollment of youths and their assignment to jobs. Schools have generally shown good cooperation with prime sponsors in recruitment of in-school youths into the program. Also the demonstration has fostered development and expansion of alternative school programs to serve returning dropouts. Program costs were computed and determined feasible.

The first section, which provides a rationale for reading instruction in business education classes, covers the range of student ability, difficulty of texts, the changing student population in business education classes, demands for functional literacy, needs for retraining, and skills developed in business courses. Explained in section 2 are techniques for assessing prerequisite skills, students, textbooks and reading materials, and study habits; techniques include informal assessment, teacher observation, informal exercises,  and teacher-constructed reading texts. The third section describes organizing activities, students, and time in the business education classroom; stranding assignments; and applying various teaching principles to specific business education classes (bookkeeping and accounting, typewriting, shorthand, general nonskill courses, and business law). General guidelines for material selection, readability formulas, and information on developing, funding, and obtaining multi-level materials are presented in the final section.

The four-program series was designed for children aged eight to eleven, although older children have responded favorably. The goals of the series were (1) to improve awareness and attitudes of all viewers toward handicapped persons; (2) to improve the self-esteem of children with disabilities; and (3) to promote career awareness, using adults with various disabilities as role models. Each program features a child with a specific disability who gests involved with a trio of magical characters. Khan Du is an apprentice wizard from a magic cage whose expeditions to the real world turn up some  unusual people and real problems with very unmagical solutions. The program storylines combine actors with nonactors and special education concepts with career awareness. Specific disabilities treated in the program include orthopedic disabilities, learning disabilities, deafness, and visual impairment. Evaluation results from testing more than 1,000 children indicate that the audience that benefits most significantly from KHAN DU! is not the handicapped. Results show that certain indicators of self-esteem among children with disabilities may be higher after viewing but not significantly so. Very measurable and significant improvements in attitude measures toward the handicapped were found among the nonhandicapped, and the overall audience showed much higher opinions of the abilities of  handicapped persons. The series will be broadcast by the Public Broadcasting System. Cassette tapes and a teacher's guide will be available. (Author/KC)",

It begins with a presentation of the basic nature of AJL aimed at providing initial insights into its potential for use as a community partner in career education. A detailed discussion of AJL's Volunteer Career Development Course follows, which includes both adult and youth models. The next section identifies concerns voiced by AJL members at several miniconferences. These include (1) career development as a lifelong process, (2) greater emphasis by career education on voluntarism; (3) more support for and involvement from top corporate executives  regarding career education, (4) need for systematic plan for community linkages by career education, and (5) need for teacher training in career development. Eleven possible contributions of AJL to career education are then outlined. Next, action ideas for Junior League/career education partnerships are presented. The monograph concludes with consensus views of AJL members and K-12 Career Education Coordinators concerning AJL as a partner in delivery of career education. (YLB)",

It consists of five chapters. Chapter 1 reviews literature pertinent to the historical perspective and key elements of economic development, economic development in rural areas, and factors affecting CETA linkage with economic development programs. Next, an interpretive analysis of 20 cases of CETA-linked economic development programs researched during the course of the study is presented in chapter 2; emphasis of the analysis is on social/rural concepts in the community, program characteristics, interagency coordination, program outcomes, and program models. Chapter 3 offers program  development guidelines in the following areas: researching options, formulating strategy, economic development strategy matrices, developing linkages, and funding strategies. Discussed in chapter 4 are a rationale for program evaluation, types of evaluation, and structuring an evaluation methodology. The final chapter discusses the need for more experimentation by CETA program operators. A bibliography and three appendixes containing tables of case study models, economic resources, and the text of CETA follow. (A related report containing the 20 case studies is available separately through ERIC--see note.) (MN)",

        "description":"Studying the employment outcomes expected from educational programs at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID) can aid planners of other occupational programs. The main barriers to planning education for work are the inaccessibility or unavailability of information, the arbitrary nature of occupational classification, and insensitivity to planning problems. To overcome these barriers, NTID specified expected employment outcomes of their programs in terms of the &quot;Dictionary of Occupational Titles&quot; (DOT) occupational names and codes. NTID program managers met to revise these names and codes and to match DOTs to U.S. Census occupational classifications. A total of 211 DOTs were identified for NTID's 14 programs. The list has a number of implications for practice. For  instance, the NTID catalog could be updated without reference to worker age or sex, and the public internal and external to NTID would find it easier to use the catalog. This use of DOT classifications has also facilitated research and development efforts in the areas of data collection, data analysis, and comparative analysis. Although this procedure for specifying employment outcomes could be adopted in planning other occupational programs, caution is suggested due to the vagueness of the occupational classifications system applied.

To determine how to improve economic performance, a careful, rational evaluation must be made of such factors as tax policy, spirit of risk, managerial effectiveness, rates of innovation, research and development, and human resource training and education as they apply to industry. Unlike Japan and countries in Western Europe, the U.S. does not understand the need to invest in major training and education efforts to service the skill needs of private and public sectors. Neither is there evidence of an awareness of the key relationship between the inadequate investment in human resources and problems of inflation and productivity. The Japanese  human resource investment approach--life-long employment with continuous retraining of all employees--has major implications for some U.S. labor force problems. To move toward a really modern labor force, the U.S. should rethink the decision to change the definition of acceptable levels of unemployment and consider the experiences of other major industrial countries. Vocational education researchers should evaluate the human resources-capital investment programs in Japan and West Germany and determine how such approaches can be adapted in U.S. industry. (YLB)",

Listings of competencies were located, identified, and compiled for all 32 program areas of the eight occupational families identified in the State Continuum. Validation involved all interested level competency-based level II programs to insure continuity between  achieved statistically significant validation. The third project objective was to develop an implementation model for competency based level II programs to insure continuity between levels II and III.

Agriculture areas that are especially significant in urban settings include ornamental horticulture, companion animals, food processing, conservation and ecology, agricultural marketing, and gardening. This planning guide has been designed as an aid to teachers and administrators who wish to plan or replan an urban agriculture program at the secondary school level. A suggested procedure and sample forms are included to assist the teacher in developing courses of study using the Illinois Core Curriculum Project materials. The  guide includes an introduction to urban agriculture, which explains the functions of agricultural education in urban areas, federal legislative provisions, and the Illinois Core Curriculum for agricultural education; instructions for planning an urban program, including program objectives; five program models; course planning aids, such as course planning sheets and instructions for their use; and a list of resources for program planning.

Their Worker Function Codes fall at or below the following levels: Data--3, People--6, Things--3. Job titles in caps are Base Titles used in the body of the  DOT. Those in lower case are jobs related to the base title with the same job code. For each title, there is an industrial designation that indicates location of the occupation, types of duties associated with the occupation, products manufactured, processes used, and/or raw materials used.

        "description":"We are witnessing an historic shift in our approach to employment policy that will have profound implications for vocational educators. This shift is most recognizable in the waning influence of demand-side economics and the ascendence of supply-side economics. Recent indications are that public policy is no longer firmly committed to maintaining full employment. The principles of Keynesian or demand-side economics (which assert an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation) no longer seem valid in light of recent economic and political developments. Demand-side policies were built on the idea that the American economy was mature and has used its capacity for growth. In reality, America is on the edge of a technological revolution. Nevertheless, despite an abundance  of work that needs doing, a shortage of jobs exists. Thus the need for entrepreneurship training is greater than ever. Recent studies and interest in small business seminars affirm this need. Studies on entrepreneurship education and its effectiveness are needed. In addition, the terms of employment must be redefined. (A series of questions and answers follows the text.) (MN)",

Data were collected from traditional and nontraditional female students in California secondary and postsecondary vocational training programs by self-administered questionnaires with items reflecting five primary clusters of variables: (1) demographics/family background, (2) support/encouragement from important others to enroll in nontraditional programs, (3) peer experience with nontraditional programs, (4) personality dimensions and sex-role orientations, and (5) perceived barriers to enrolling in a nontraditional program. Nontraditional students were found more often to have working mothers, to have been  employed more hours per week, and to be of a higher social class. They consistently received the most support and encouragement to enter nontraditional fields, most often by parents and already-enrolled female students. Nontraditionals had more female friends and siblings who had experience with nontraditional programs. Significantly more traditionals than nontraditionals believed there were rules or restrictions limiting enrollment to men. Traditionals had a significantly greater fear of success and were more sex-typed. (YLB)",

Also of importance is knowledge of the ways in which schools and society at large are involved with both the creation of and the solution to the problem of student/teacher authority relations. School people are referring primarily to discipline problems when discussing authority. Reasons for their concern include these facts: schools need cooperative students to exist, students' academic knowledge cannot be improved without their support and confidence, and schools are a forum in which social relations are reworked. Authority in the school must be based on trust and accountability and come from persuasion, compromise, and negotiation. The erosion of a teacher's  traditional authority in the school today appears to be due to slipping of the teacher's status. Data suggest that students' willingness to grant teachers personal authority is based on a combination of the teacher's respect, social skills, and technical expertise. Teachers must call on the personal capital they have accumulated to encourage compliance. When that fails, they should negotiate to find a standard with which students will comply. (YLB)",

        "description":"The data and analyses presented in this report are from the first (1980) wave of a longitudinal study of U.S. high school seniors and sophomores. A total of 58,728 students from 1,016 high schools participated in the survey. Special emphasis was placed on Hispanic students, Catholic schools with high proportions of black students, non-Catholic private schools, public alternative schools, and private schools with high-achieving students in order to conduct special studies of those populations. The findings of this baseline data suggest that labor force activity is a widespread phenomenon among teenagers, far exceeding what was commonly believed to be the prevalence of this behavior. While some differences were found among ethnic and gender groups in the propensity to work and the  amount of time spent at work, school grade consistently had the greatest impact on all aspects of work behavior, from hours spent at work and hourly wages to the type of job held and amount of training received on the job. The comparison of sophomores and seniors reveals a distinct trend toward greater likelihood of employment, more time spent at work, higher wages, and holding jobs that are performed in a structured organizational setting and away from the family environment.

The introduction summarizes the activities undertaken by the review. Chapter 2 focuses on staging, which is variously intended to provide country orientation, information about Peace Corps service, selection of individuals for service, some preliminary training, and medical and administrative processing. It describes the three staging processes in use that differ in format, objectives, and cost. It is found that all do not meet their intended purpose, and no formal criteria exist for determining which format volunteers will undergo. Chapter 3 considers the highly decentralized volunteer training system that has evolved.  Findings indicate that (1) in-country staffs are autonomous decision makers on matters concerning form and content of training programs; (2) their ability to design, conduct, and manage this function varies signifantly among countries; (3) volunteers do not receive the type, quality, and degree of cross-cultural, language, and technical training they need to be effective; and (4) a core curriculum is under development. Chapter 4 concerns management of attrition. It is reported that attrition data are regularly collected, but there is no routine analysis or distribution of the data. (YLB)",

A psycho-therapeutic alternative to pharmacotherapy is Life Enhancement Counseling, a counseling approach matching therapeutic techniques to client characteristics and providing an age-appropriate and culturally sensitive treatment model for alleviating depression. Elderly subjects (N=100), mostly Hispanic Americans, completed two sets of measures of functioning pre- and post-therapy. Outcome analysis indicated that significant improvement in functioning occured along all dimensions of psychosocial functioning. Results showed that, among this Cuban-American sample, outcome was inde- pendent of client variables;  two treatment variables, extent of Life Enhancement counseling and medication, were signifi- cantly predictive of treatment outcome. In many cases, the difficulties of the elderly were amenable to psychosocial intervention both with and without pharmacotherapy. These results support the concept that many psychological difficulties of the elderly are potentially reversible rather than inevitable consequences of aging. (Author/NRB)",

The first section is a brief overview of the values and socio-economic characteristics of the rural elderly. In the next section, studies on the leisure interests and the recreation participation patterns of the rural elderly are presented. The third section is a compilation of representative program descriptions obtained through literature review and contacts with agencies on aging. Factors affecting the provision of services to the rural elderly comprise the fourth section and include transportation, attitudes, publicity needs, socioeconomic conditions, cultural diversity, sex differences, and health factors. The fifth section outlines various approaches to meet the recreational  needs of the rural aged. A summary section presents an overview of the state-of-the-art in the provision of recreation services to the rural aged, as well as conclusions and recommendations related to improving the quality of such services. The final section is an annotated bibliography of 83 research studies, reports, and programs related to aspects of recreation and the rural elderly. (Author/NRB)",

Statements by witnesses are recorded to present the results of ongoing longitudinal studies focused on the effects of biological aging and the measurement techniques used to analyze variables associated with learning and working abilities. Techniques of assessment used by the Soviet Union where older workers are a necessary part of the labor force are also reviewed. The report by the Director of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) differentiates chronological age from biological age, psychological age, intellectual age, and social age. The director of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging describes the investigation of individuals across  the entire adult lifespan. Similarities of studies, information sharing between studies, and commonalities of traits associated with long life are presented.

The analysis is based on literature from the last decade supplemented by interviews and statistics from site visits to 14 juvenile court jurisdictions with alternative programs. Chapter One describes the decisions by police and other adults that create a group of youth court referrals. The next chapter analyzes the process of juvenile court through which decisions are made about court and detention intake, with the placement of selected youths in secure detention, alternative programs, or their homes. In Chapter Three, the variations in use of secure detention are described; the psychosocial  consequences for detained juveniles are discussed as well as the consequences after adjudication at the time of court disposition. Chapter Four contains descriptions of the programs used as alternatives to secure detention in 14 jurisdictions. The final chapter presents conclusions of the study and offers recommendations intended for jurisdictions planning alternative programs. (Author/NRB)",

        "description":"Characteristics of the expected 55 million elderly Americans in the year 2050 can be predicted with some accuracy. The proportion of elderly blacks will increase, while the ratio of women to men will remain at three to one, with a higher ratio at the higher age levels. Educational levels will also rise significantly. Current information indicates that between 15-25% of the elderly have significant symptoms of mental illness and need assistance in carrying out their daily living tasks. The elderly also have more health problems and use more health services than the general population. In terms of informal support systems or individuals, approximately 75% of the elderly men and 37% of the elderly women live with a spouse. Nearly 41% of the elderly women live alone. Elderly persons  have many contacts with their children, and support from children is likely to increase over the next 30 years as the childlessness rate declines. Long-term care efforts continue to have difficulty in coordinating programs with a specific focus on the individual. Public policy must determine how to make the delivery of long-term care services more responsive to the needs of those requiring such care. (Author/NRB)",

The two forms of inductive reasoning tests were then administered to an additional 40 older adults who constituted a more representative older population. Results of the comparison of the two older samples showed differential effects for different theoretically ecologically  valid tests, better performance by highly educated older adults, and correlations between performance on cognitive tests and real-world competence.

Social psychology has addressed the variables that affect the individual in relationships with larger groups. Social individualism is a conceptual framework that explores the relationship of the individual and society from the view of the individual's internal needs, desires, and drives to determine the role that society will fill in the interaction. The role of the individual in directing and determining the shape of social relationships is critical. Social individualism has philosophical (existentialism, phenomenology), sociological (symbolic interactionism), and psychological (Neo-Freudian, Gestalt, Humanistic, Assertive, Libertarian) roots. Central concepts  to the theory of social individualism, many of which have been culled from Carl Rogers, include awareness, perception, self, self-directedness, other-directedness, self-actualization, needs, alienation, frustration, congruence, cognitive dissonance, locus of evaluation, unconditional positive regard, inner nature, ideal self, threat, growth, distortion, defense, openness to experience, and perceived locus of control. The formation of a conceptual framework such as social individualism may help existential and humanistic social scientists approach their work from a more conceptually organized perspective. (NRB)",

Older blacks tend to have lower incomes, greater health problems, and higher incidence of widowhood than comparable whites or younger blacks. The median income of older blacks remained at only two-thirds of the income of elderly whites between 1967 and 1977, a disparity reflecting limited employment opportunities, a higher concentration in lower paying jobs during younger working years, and a higher concentration in jobs not covered by Social Security prior to 1950. In 1977, the average life expectancy of blacks and other minorities at birth was estimated to be shorter than for whites. Compared to their white counterparts, older blacks  appear to suffer more from the effects of chronic health conditions and other illnesses and injuries, to be the victims of hyper- tension more frequently, and to have a higher mortality rate. However, for ages 80 and over, the mortality rate of blacks is lower than that of whites. (NBR)",

A community studies approach investigated the effectiveness of service programs available to female misdemeanants both in the jail and in the community. Interviews, observations, discussions, and questionnaires were used to collect information from imprisoned women (N=68), prison staff, and community agencies. Data indicated that in jail women were inactive and &quot;warehoused&quot; at a considerable distance from the community, with little attention to the problems faced upon release. A review of community resources indicated that relatively few served female ex-prisoners.

        "description":"This study was conducted to establish the existence of grade inflation and show that the ability of college students has remained constant. The second purpose was to examine the effect of grade inflation on the validity of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). Two types of analyses were performed to gather data. A longitudinal analysis of selected characterisitcs of SAT scores and grade point average (GPA) over a fifteen year period was conducted. The second analysis focuses on selected schools to evaluate the effect of grade inflation on the validity of the SAT in those colleges. The conclusions reached were increases in GPA were due to grade inflation since there was no concomitant increase in SAT scores. The rate of grade inflation seems to have diminished since 1974 as  indicated by levelling-out of GPA means. If grade inflation is seen as the addition of a constant to grades, it will not affect validity since this would not affect the correlation of GPA and SAT. In the presence of declining validity of High School Record, the SAT has become a more valuable tool for predicting academic success in college. (Author/DWH)",

The groups were men, women, Asians, blacks, Hispanics, and whites. The use of grade point average or individual course grades was avoided because these are subjective, often biased, measures. The EPT-Essay score based on a forty-five minute writing sample was considered a good standard for comparing other basic skills measures available. The measures were evaluated as predictors of essay writing and overall performance. The correlational comparisons showed few differences across groups, except that correlations tended to be lower  for the white sample because of variance restrictions. The regression comparisons agreed with previous studies showing blacks and Hispanics to be generally overpredicted. False negatives, those people who score low on a predictor but who excel on a criterion, occurred least in the black and Hispanic groups. (Author/DWH)",

These included auxiliary services and support staff, teacher values and expectations, adult and continuing educational programs, staff development, personal development of the student, and elementary educational programs. Total priorities were determined on results of a district-wide survey. The cause of an area being considered high priority requires study of respondent group results by questions across a function. Two trends were identifiable. The greatest concern for school administrator respondent groups dealt with improvement of other instructional level  groups. Various administrative groups found little problem with their own instructional level. The second trend was that communications about the schools needed to be improved. This was necessary in view of the district's difficult financial position which required discussion of problems facing the schools.

The similarities for administrator groups included opinions about the effects of absenteeism on achievement, back-to-basics movement, strict discipline, school expenditure reductions, and voluntary integration of schools. The differences were elementary and junior high administrators felt voluntary integration would  improve the quality of education. However, senior high and central office administrators were split on this issue. It may mean integration is seen as a social, rather than academic, goal. School administrators agreed students should be allowed to finish college work in high school, but central office administrators disagreed. The groups differed on the amount of confidence in the school board's ability to deal with school problems.

Items from two conventionally administered mastery tests administered in a military training environment were calibrated using the unidimensional three-parameter logistic ICC model. Using response data from the conventional Administration of the tests, a computerized adaptive mastery testing (AMT) strategy was applied in a real-data simulation. The AMT procedure used ICC theory to transform the traditional arbitrary \"proportion correct\" mastery level to the ICC achievement metric in order to allow  adaptation of the test to each trainee's achievement level estimate, which was calculated after each item response. A mastery decision was made for the trainee after the 95 percent Bayesian confidence interval around his achievement level estimate failed to contain the prespecified mastery level. The AMT procedure reduced the average test length over all circumstances examined, while reaching the same decision as the conventional procedure for 96 percent of the trainees. Advantages and possible applications of AMT procedures in certain classroom situations are noted and discussed. (Author/DWH)",

The verbal score of the CAT showed the highest correlation with the ITBS composite score of the three ability measures. It is a good predictor of school achievement. A significant discrepancy among the three CAT component scores is not of significance in relation to academic performance. High scores in non-verbal and quantitative areas do appear to compensate for low verbal  scores. The separate ability scores on the CAT provide useful information for students who demonstrate low verbal abilities, but much higher quantitative and/or non-verbal abilities. (DWH)",

Applied to curriculum, this theory provides a conceptual framework for expanding the present technical model. The purpose of this study is to provide technical and interpretive data about home and family life which are critically analyzed to provide knowledge useful in the development of home economics curriculum. The development of curriculum research has been hampered by the attempt to apply a reconstructed logic of physical science research. Curriculum problems are practical problems which are moral rather than technical in nature. Curriculum researchers need to acknowledge the legitimacy of the different meanings which people attach to facts and  situations. The predominant model for curriculum in vocational education is occupational analysis. Several states have undertaken an occupational analysis for home economics education. The study was an outgrowth of the researcher's concern for the lack of fit between the philosophy of home economics and the occupational analysis used in vocational education. A task-oriented approach is reductionistic. A paradigm shift is proposed for research and curriculum, from a quantitative empirical perspective to a comprehensive theoretical framework that incorporates the hermeneutic and critical sciences.

A need exists for interpretation of results of school wide testing programs. Students who have gone through this interpretation process emerge with an improved self image. As discrepancies occur between teacher expectations and actual performance, they can be explained. This  benefits both teachers and students.

Several issues in impact evaluation of educational programs in general are outlined, and the special problems associated with evaluation of ECT-I programs as distinct from Title I programs in later grades are addressed. Chapters III-VI describe four different approaches to evaluating short-term program impact, including the three models proposed by the United States Education Department for evaluating Title I  programs in later grades. Chapter VII describes special issues relevant to criterion-referenced assessment of program impact. Chapter VIII discusses the key problems to be faced by anyone wishing to aggregate results of short-term impact evaluations of ECT-I programs across several cases that may or may not use the same approach to assessing impact. Chapter IX provides a summary, conclusions, and guidelines on the appropriateness of different kinds of short-term impact evaluations of early childhood Title I projects under different conditions.

The third program provides a frequency count of the  duration and frequency of all codes. The method for using the Datamyte is explained as are very specific coding directions. The categories included Play With Toy, Books Initiation of Activity, and Modification of Behavior. (Author/DWH)",

The book is designed to help evaluators decide what a particular information system should look like. For longitudinal data to be useful, they must be collected and maintained systematically. That means: (1) data collection is done at regular intervals; (2) the population on whom data are collected remains the same; and (3) the data are filed in such a way that they can be easily obtained when they are needed. This resource book contains four chapters. In the first, two ways in which longitudinal information systems can be used are described  (assessing long-term program impact, and helping with routine operations). The two main types of such systems are discussed in the second chapter, together with their strengths and weaknesses. Chapter 3 describes how to determine information needs, and Chapter 4 discusses different design features of systems that must be anticipated before building them. (Author/GK)",

        "description":"One of the major assumptions of latent trait theory is that the items in a test measure a single dimension. This report describes an investigation of procedures for forming a set of items that meet this assumption. Factor analysis, nonmetric multidimensional scaling, cluster analysis and latent trait analysis were applied to simulated and real test data to determine which technique could best form a unidimensional set of items. Theoretical and empirical evaluations were also made of the effects of guessing on the dimensionality of test data. The results indicated that guessing affected highly discriminating items more so than poorly discriminating items. Of the procedures evaluated for sorting items into unidimensional item sets, principal factor analysis of phi coefficients gave  the best results overall. In summary, guessing does have an effect on test data, but the effect is not very large unless items of extreme difficulty are present in the test. Of the procedures evaluated, traditional factor analytic techniques gave the most useful information for sorting test items into homogeneous sets. (Author/GK)",

Six major areas were studied on the project: (1) techniques for forming unidimensional item sets; (2) techniques for calibrating items; (3) item parameter linking procedures; (4) comparisons of latent trait models; (5) tailored testing procedures; and (6) decision making procedures. Results showed that factor analytic procedures were best at forming unidimensional item pools, the LOGIST calibration program performed slightly better than the ANCILLES program for item calibration, the maximum likelihood procedure using the LOGIST program generally gave the best linking, the three-parameter logistic  model was preferred to the one-parameter model for tailored testing applications, the maximum likelihood based tailored testing procedure was slightly preferred to the Owen's Bayesian based procedure, and the use of the sequential probability ratio test with tailored testing resulted in substantial savings in test length. Overall, tailored testing was shown to be feasible for achievement testing applications. More detailed results are described in the papers and reports listed in this report. (Author/GK)",

        "description":"Accepting that language diversity is functionally related to other variables characterizing human societies, much discussion stems from the advantages or disadvantageous nature of language diversity in terms of national development and national unity. To discover ways of measuring language diversity would help, in part, to solve the language diversity issue; however, the lack of consistency and agreement in the definition of the two viewpoints hampers the language planners. Bearing in mind that any language diversity measure takes into consideration all languages present and considers the numbers of users of the languages, the coupling of these two independent variables renders the elimination of all ambiguity impossible in a diversity measure. For example, a society bearing a  large number of languages with widely differing numbers of users will have the same diversity measurement as one characterized by a smaller number of languages but greater evenness of user distribution. The diversity measurement must be related to both the number of languages and the degree of evenness of user distribution. Using indices and equation models of the research of language planners, this document sets out to define properties which a language diversity index should exhibit, using both sample and census data.

        "description":"The relationship of aptitude, strategy, and cognitive task performance is explored through the use of mathematical models of performance time. Models of strategy and strategy-shifting on a spatial visualization task were tested individually for 30 male high school and college subjects. For each of three successive task steps (encoding, construction, and comparison), different models applied for different subjects suggesting that different subjects used different strategies for solving the same items. Some of the best fitting models specified that subjects frequently and flexibly switched strategies during the task in keeping with variations in item demands. This was considered a form of adaptive, within-task learning. Three alternative cases of aptitude-strategy relationship were  examined. For the encoding and construction steps the most efficient strategy was restricted to subjects with a particular aptitude profile. For the comparison step, strategy selection appeared to be a more casual choice but aptitude differentially mediated performance depending on which strategy had been selected. The importance of strategy-shift models as a means for analyzing more precisely subjects' problem solving processes and for representing the adaptive, flexible quality of intelligent performance is discussed.

Bilingual education programs have the potential to create a scientific revolution in the field of education, have drawn a widespread resistance from existing paradigms, but have failed to instigate any paradigmatic changes in current educational practice. An examination of the various types of bilingual education programs currently functioning in American public schools raises the following questions: (1) Can bilingual education programs be characterized to the extent and level of technical knowledge  that make them operational? (2) What are the effects of technological characteristics on the bilingual classroom structure and its outcomes? (3) Is it possible to structure bilingual education programs into \"ideal type\" models? Bilingual education has failed to arise as a paradigmatic response to a unique set of beliefs and has not developed a model that would generate hypotheses relevant to its survival in a bureaucratic environment. Bilingual education must gain control of itself and direct its own action. (Author/ML)",

Three main questions were probed: (1) What social competencies are needed by multicultural children to maintain effective functioning in three culturally distinct settings--home, school, and among peers? (2) What conflicts are inherent in maintaining multiple adaptation? (3) What are the resultant stresses and their management by children successful in maintaining this multiple adaptation? Chapter one explains the theoretical constructs and methodology of the research. Testing techniques and instruments are discussed in chapter two, and  the association between selected demographic variables and multicultural social competency scores is examined in chapter three. Chapter four includes a series of case study profiles of 24 Hispanic students (ages 6-12), who participated in the after school program. Chapter five is a discussion of the components of social competency development in multicultural children, including the criteria for judging social competency as defined by parents, peers, and teachers, and the instruments for evaluating performance levels of children in home, street, and school environments. The concluding chapter presents hypotheses and theoretical constructs on the development of social competency skills in multicultural elementary-aged children of Hispanic background.

Following the introduction, section two outlines some of the components of court desegregation orders and discusses the ways in which desegregation affects faculty labor relations. Section three includes case studies which examine the relationship between desegregation and faculty labor  relations in the three school systems. Section four evaluates the success of the court's regulatory intervention in the three systems and suggests some of the factors that explain the observed variations of successful intervention.

This final report examines the procedures and methodology used for achieving the objective, the results of data analysis, and conclusions and recommendations for future research and action. The major research questions considered are: (1) What are the existing models for Inservice Education (IE)? (2) Can any of these models be applied to facilitate effective desegregation/integration? and (3) What new models for IE need to be developed? The report discusses several inservice training models that are defined according to governance strategies, such as sources of authority and planning,  views of individual needs, training contexts, and research functions. The final report examines specific guidelines for use in planning and developing IE models designed to deal with problems in conflict management as it relates to desegregated school settings; change teacher perceptions and behavior with respect to Mexican American students; implement guidelines for teachers in regard to bilingual education; and develop desegregation workshops for students, teachers and the community.

        "description":"This paper assesses the effectiveness of readability indices, standard cloze procedure, and the matching cloze procedure as determinants of the readability of supplementary English materials for elementary ESL students in a Pacific Island context. A review of readability indices and the standard cloze procedure indicated that neither procedure is an adequate measure of text readability, according to the study. Readability indices are identified as not adequately considering differences in sentence and paragraph structure, which are considered a major factor in difficulty levels of elementary ESL texts. The paper states that the standard cloze procedure is too difficult for most beginning ESL pupils because of the production skills necessary to complete the task. Matching cloze  procedure, which requires primarily recognition skills, was given to elementary ESL pupils in Saipan to see whether it could be used to evaluate the readability of elementary reading materials. The matching cloze procedure is said to show excellent reliability, and generally correlated more highly with criterion measures for readability. (Author/JCD)",

        "description":"This report examines previous research on school desegregation effects and suggests new research directions to provide information for policy deliberations. The current imbalance in school desegregation research is attributed to unresolved technical disputes in policy debates, the limitation of debate topics relevant for research, and the absence of a strong theory of social mobility, community power, or discrimination to support research studies. A review of the desegregation effects on black students shows a general additive incremental effect on attendance at desegregated colleges from each extra year of earlier experience in desegregated elementary or secondary schools. This evidence indicates that other adult outcomes such as employment or housing attainments may be  significantly influenced by desegregation in elementary and secondary schools. A consideration of the long term outcomes of school desegregation and its implications for policy deliberations suggest the need to identify the processes that exclude qualified minorities from promising opportunities as well as compare both institutional and individual behavior in an effort to explain the problems of minority social mobility and segregation.

The evidence shows that black workers are overrepresented in a restricted range of types of occupations, but attendance in desegregated schools may help produce a wider range of career choices and opportunities. Also, black adults who attended desegregated schools are more likely to function in desegregated environments later in life. The paper further calls for further research to more carefully define and study specific structural barriers to equal opportunities, and to investigate the relationship of  desegregation to these structural factors.

        "description":"What does educational research tell us about the effects of school desegregation? A review of past and present research studies provides no conclusive evidence about the effects of school desegregation, primarily because of the variance in type of methodology, time period of desegregation implementation, and type of desegregation plans evaluated. Major shortcomings of this research include: (1) the absence of a strong theoretical framework that acknowledges cultural differences and conflicts between minority and majority group cultures; (2) inconsistencies among research findings; (3) the lack of communication between researchers and educational practitioners and policy makers; and (4) the limited inclusion of racial minorities other than blacks. Recent studies based on  ethnographic field techniques and secondary longitudinal data improve upon past studies by better specifying the internal characteristics of desegregation, and by examining the relationship between school desegregation and other outcome variables such as student aspirations, self concept, and racial attitudes. The topics which still need to be addressed include: (1) effects of desegregation on whites; (2) effects of enrollment decline and funding policies; (3) the nature of school counseling, tracking practices, and academic success in segregated and desegregated schools; (4) effects of desegregation on minority faculty and staff; and (5) effects of desegregation on traditionally black colleges.

A total of 520 different health care professionals attended the sessions, with multiple registrations bringing the total enrollment in the program to 925. Programs were designed to help the participants acquire updated information on various aspects of nursing and other professional health care, new and improved methods and techniques in the delivery of health care, and enhancement of their competencies. To provide long-term evaluation of the effects of the workshops, a one-page Impact Survey Report Form was adapted from one used with the University of Wisconsin-Extension Programs and sent to the  past participants. Results from the 341 forms returned by 227 participants were very positive. Most participants reported that they had gained insights, contacts, new ideas, answers to questions, useful resource materials, reinforcement, and help in making decisions. A very high percentage of the respondents rated from &quot;moderate&quot; to &quot;high&quot; the amount of information they actually applied and used, and adequacy of skill training; more than 90 percent said &quot;yes, definitely&quot; or &quot;probably, yes&quot; that the program was worth the time and money spent; and most participants also reported ideas gained at the workshops resulted in better service to their patients and personal satisfaction and confidence. An indepth interview with 20 of the participants and their supervisors is yet to be conducted as  part of the evaluation of the workshops. (KC)",

An analysis of the responses of the 119 institutions indicated that there are two types of service providers: full-range programs that could be called displaced homemaker centers and programs; and other service providers, which did not provide total services for displaced homemakers but did  serve them in various ways. The survey also indicated that the need is greater than the services provided, since there are more than 580,000 displaced homemakers to be served by the 119 centers. However, there are several strengths to the structure. First, the centers are found across the state; second, no single institutional type dominates, so individuals can find the institution that meets their needs. There are also weaknesses; namely, not all locations are served, and almost half of the centers and programs rely on Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) funds, which are in jeopardy. It was suggested that it would be beneficial for the centers to concentrate on providing a full range of counseling services, while the other service providers should concentrate on training for  employment. (Services for and numbers of displaced homemakers by county are provided. An information request form and the survey form are appended.) (KC)",

(These women's needs were relevant to the state's plans for vocational education because the Education Amendments of 1976 made it possible to address them.) Information was gathered by literature review, mail questionnaire, and direct communication with displaced homemakers and their service providers. These three information bases showed that displaced homemakers had a large number of needs that could be grouped into five major categories: informational needs about the services available to them; financial needs, both long- and short-term; personal  counseling needs to aid in becoming emotionally stable and self-sufficient; vocational needs--for employment at a level sufficient to support their families; and education and training needs to prepare for a first or a better job. It was also found that displaced homemakers are a product of a society that refuses to recognize work done in the home as &quot;real work,&quot; and it was stated that until societal attitudes change, with changes in Social Security and other financial programs, along with employer attitude changes, displaced homemakers will continue to have many problems in American society.

        "description":"With Social Security and retirement benefits unable to keep up with inflation, and persons living longer than ever in this country, retirement at age 65 or younger may no longer be a desirable choice for millions of older workers. These themes were articulated by government officials and foundation officers at the first session of a U.S. Senate hearing on work after 65, held in Washington, D.C., in April, 1980. In the hearing, witnesses from the Center on Work and Aging, American Institutes for Research; the Gerontology Research Institute, University of Southern California; the Center for Studies in Social Policy, the Work in America Institute; the National Council on Aging; and the President's Commission on Pension Policy, along with Senators Lawton Chiles, Pete Domenici, John  Heinz, and Charles Percy, testified that the demographic picture of the United States will show a much greater number of older persons after the turn of the next century, as compared to today. This population, if early-age retirements continue, will place a great strain on the resources of the country for support. At the same time, witnesses noted, many thousands of older workers are both capable and desirous of continuing on the job, or at least being employed part time. Efforts must be made to change both public policy and public opinion to both permit and encourage older workers to continue to be employed, according to the witnesses, with benefits from such a policy accruing to both the older persons and the economy of the country.

Executives of Xerox, Polaroid, Bankers Life and Casualty, and Atlantic Richfield told the special committee on aging that their companies have a 15-year span--from 55 to 70 and beyond--during which employees can choose to retire. The executives said that in most cases the best, most productive workers were the ones who chose to stay the longest; thus, not having mandatory retirement was helpful for the companies. The company officials also commented that older workers had records of absences that were as good as or better than those  of younger workers, and much better safety records. The hearing record also includes testimony about the needs of older workers and the future needs of the marketplace for older workers by Senators Lawton Chiles, Charles Percy, John Glenn, David Pryor, and John Melcher. In addition, reports of various task forces and surveys relating to older workers and retirement are appended to the document. (KC)",

During the Florida hearing, representatives of various government programs for senior citizens, professors of education and economics and private employers and employment agencies described the services their agencies or offices provided for persons over age 65, and the problems these seniors encounter. Themes running through the testimony were that pensions and Social Security provide inadequate incomes for most retired persons, and, therefore, the people need jobs. However, they often encounter discrimination in finding a job and in being paid a fair wage. However, experience  has shown that older workers are as capable as younger ones if they are allowed to work. The witnesses urged more help for senior citizens in finding employment and in filling out forms required, as well as suggestions for increasing Medicare benefits. Many personal anecdotes of productive senior citizens are included. (KC)",

        "description":"A basic consideration in conducting a career education needs assessment is whether to select published tests or to develop new instruments and evaluation techniques. Advantages of published tests are availability and convenience and ease to use. Advantages in using self-developed measures can be seen by examining a needs assessment study in which both types are used. In a fall 1976 needs assessment for career education in upstate New York, ninth and twelfth graders were administered the attitudes section of the Career Maturity Inventory (CMI), and they and their parents also responded to a project-developed questionnaire. Interpretation of CMI results was that the average student needed supplemental career education and guidance slightly less than the average student in the  nation. The questionnaire asked questions concerning parental influence and school influence on career decisions. Data suggested that parents and children agreed on need for parental influence but disagreed regarding amount, usefulness, and quality of parents' information. The public felt the school was not doing sufficient work in career education, and more effective information dissemination and parental education were needed. A comparison of needs assessment information obtained from the two tests indicates that the self-developed questionnaire provided the most meaningful, useful information. (YLB)",

The two programs were the Cambridge, Massachusetts, Job Factory, which paid youths a stipend for doing the &quot;job&quot; of finding a job, while providing group activities, resume writing, job search skills and placement assistance; and the Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, Workshop, which assigned participants to one of three treatment groups to receive either individual career counseling and job placement services, career counseling, job placement services, and group job search skills workshops, or career counseling and job search skills workshops. No stipend was paid in the Pennsylvania project. In the Cambridge group,  203 youths were enrolled in the Job Factory while 165 served as controls; 396 youths were enrolled in the three treatment groups in Wilkes-Barre. The process evaluation showed that the Job Factory functioned fairly smoothly because it was a modification of an existing program, while the Workshop experienced difficulties in implementation because of its &quot;top-down&quot; model. The impact evaluation found that the Job Factory had a substantial effect in getting youth to work quickly, although these effects may not continue long-term, while in the Workshop, there were no significant differences in the rate of job finding for the three groups. Job Factory participants found moderately better jobs than the controls, while no major differences in the groups were found in the Workshop participants. In  Cambridge, attitudes/knowledge areas did not contribute to job finding, while in Wilkes Barre, job search skills were a significant component of job finding. Overall, it was found that the intensity of the search fostered by the moral support of counselors was the most significant component in the job search assistance programs. (KC)",

        "description":"As a result of a series of miniconferences held throughout the United States on implementing career education in grades K-12, four implementation issues were identified and summarized in this monograph. (Other issues are treated in separate publications.) The issues which the K-12 educators identified as very important were the following: (1) the issue of infusing career education into the regular curriculum versus creating separate courses; (2) whether the term &quot;career education&quot; should be abandoned; (3) the nature of the relationship between vocational education and career education, and (4) the use of career education resource centers in many school districts. For each of these issues, the arguments pro and con as advanced by the miniconference participants are summarized, and  the personal observations of Kenneth B. Hoyt, Director, Office of Career Education, U.S. Department of Education, are included. As a result of the discussion at the conferences, Hoyt concludes that K-12 career education practitioners are fully capable of defining and discussing crucial conceptual issues, and they should be listened to more by those who make career education policy decisions; and that if an issue can be identified, there are already several K-12 career education practitioners in the country who have developed unique approaches to solving the problem.

Testimony from 106 witnesses from 27 states led to the overall conclusion that the current level and quality of correctional vocational education is not adequate to provide, on a regular basis, comprehensive vocational education programs to offenders. Over the course of the four hearings, four major issues were implicated in all the problems, frustrations, and possible solutions discussed by witnesses. These issues are the following: (1) funding is inadequate, and there is lack of funding cooperation between state education and correctional agencies; (2) in the area of administration, recruitment,  training, and retention of qualified vocational instructors is insufficient; facilities and equipment are inadequate; and there is a lack of coordination and integration of vocational programs with prison industries; (3) regarding comprehensive programming, vocational program standards are lacking and programs are not relevant to realistic job opportunities; and (4) concerning federal policy and leadership, overall coordination is absent; and there is a shortage of research, evaluation, data collection, and technical assistance.

Five descriptive concepts/characteristics (intensity, diversity, continuity, proximity, and supportive diversity) were derived to assign students to five types/patterns of participation or profiles: concentrator, limited concentrator, concentrator/explorer, and incidental/personal. Results of the  profile matching showed 22% of secondary graduates with no vocational credits, nearly 50% of those who had exposure to vocational education were in the incidental/personal category, less than 2% were identified as explorers, and the other groups collectively accounted for almost 50%. Cluster analyses indicated verification of the proposed pattern types. Sex, race, and family socioeconomic status had an effect on participation. The classification procedure based on transcript data was found to be a workable way to identify patterns of participation in vocational education. (YLB)",

        "description":"Because of its benefits to classroom teachers, tutors, and tutees, peer tutoring as a strategy for instructing handicapped students in vocational education is gaining in popularity. Several factors are important to the successful implementation of a peer tutoring program, including administrative support, assessment of tutoring needs, and establishment of program goals and objectives. Equally important is the formulation of a tutor role description which provides the tutor and teacher with a clear description of their responsibilities, a criteria for selecting tutors, a supervision or evaluation instrument for measuring the tutor's performance, and guidelines for the appropriate use of tutors in the classroom. In selecting appropriate tutors teachers should consider a variety of  personal characteristics and variables such as age, achievement levels, and racial and socioeconomic backgrounds. While a review of tutor training programs in the literature reveals certain components that are characteristics of successful training programs, the organization of these components into training sessions is determined by individual school training programs. Two suggested training activities found effective in training programs for tutors and paraprofessionals are the Peer Tutor Decision Worksheet and the Tutor Training Triad. Also essential are close supervision and quantitative and qualitative evaluation of peer tutors. (MN)",

        "description":"A prototype for the development of an auto-tutorial course in anatomy and physiology for adult learners in Associate Degree Nursing (ADN) was implemented in the fall semester, 1980, at Waukesha County Technical Institute in Pewaukee, Wisconsin. The format of the two-semester course consists of two hours of scheduled lecture time and three hours of scheduled anatomy-physiology laboratory time each week, plus an independent study session component, the auto-tutorial learning laboratory (ATL). The ATL contains audiovisual materials presenting new content that is to be learned and materials for the reinforcement of content presented in scheduled class sessions. The time devoted to the auto-tutorial learning laboratory varies with each student. Learnings in the courses are scheduled  prior to the need for related content in nursing courses. The audiovisual materials in the ATL contain that part of the course content which could be presented effectively on filmstrips and cassettes and were selected from commercially produced materials rather than instructor-produced. Support materials have been written to guide and assist the student in achieving the course objectives. Instructional objectives are printed and handed to students for each unit. A combination of study guides, review sheets, and self-tests have been prepared for support of student learning in the auto-tutorial laboratory sessions.

(Leisure service professionals were defined as persons employed full-time in administering, directing, leading, organizing, and planning in leisure service organizations.) A questionnaire was mailed to 1,646 Wisconsin professionals regarding their characteristics, continuing education needs and interests, and attitudes toward continuing education, with a 50 percent response rate. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics, analysis of variance, and tests of homogeneity. It was found that male recreation professionals' salaries were an average of almost $6,000 more than those of females. In  general, attitudes toward continuing education were similar in males and females, although women tended to view continuing education in a slightly more positive light. Men had high continuing education needs in public relations, budgeting techniques, program evaluation, supervising staff, and long range planning. Women said they needed information on innovative programming, programming for special groups, activity analysis, current issues, and program evaluation. No significant differences in needs between women and men were found in staff training, time management, public speaking, and interpersonal communications. It was recommended that since no major differences by gender were found, opportunities for continuing education should be made available to all personnel, with particular  emphasis on removing barriers or deterrents to women.

        "description":"A research project examined the relationship between education and work in the professions of social work and engineering. The project encompassed four main studies of professionals at different career stages. There were (1) a questionnaire and interview study of alumni from the Case Western Reserve University Schools of Engineering and Social Work in five graduating years; (2) a corresponding investigation of current students and teaching methods in these two professions; (3) a project studying engineers and their work environments in two engineering firms; and (4) a study of the experiential learning process. Among those areas addressed in the project were the following: development of an applied theory of experiential learning, assessment of adaptive competencies, assessment  of person-environment congruence, the relationship of professional education and career development, and the relationship between careers and adult development. Developed in the study was a system identifying three levels of competence--performance, learning, and developmental competencies. Techniques for assessing each of these levels and for assessing person-environment congruence were developed and tested. Data also indicated that professional education currently prepares professionals better for their core professional role than for lifelong careers and that adult development is marked by a shift from specialization to integration.

Specifically, it is intended to help teachers identify and place correct emphasis upon those areas of business law which will most nearly meet the students' needs when they reach adulthood, to help teachers to inculcate in the students the necessity for acceptable social values when dealing with others, and to help teachers explore alternative teaching strategies useful in the presentation of business law in their classes. The guide is organized in nine chapters, and also contains a bibliography of business law books, periodicals, and sources. Topics covered in the teaching guide include the following: philosophy, goals, and objectives of the high school business law  course; course content for a semester, year, or mini-course; teaching legal vocabulary; teaching legal fundamentals; teaching law as applied to contracts: contracts dealing with property; laws that govern business relations of individuals; and student and teacher evaluation.

Included among the program features common to all five sites were the following: (1) the roles and functions of individuals, organizations, and agencies involved; (2) initiation of effect by the same University of Texas project staff; (3) cost considerations; (4) adult performance level (APL) materials and competency-based high school diploma (CBHSD) program processes; and (5) problem areas (staff cooperation, insufficient workshop training, inadequate APL materials, staff shortages, staff inflexibility). A number of  differences also existed among the various sites with respect to these five areas. Examination of the similarities and differences among the sites resulted in nine recommendations. These included calls to resolve problems resulting from different budget cycles, to delineate responsibility for different elements of the program, to focus on adequate staff training, to develop remedial and supplementary APL materials, and to coordinate tests.

Despite restrictions imposed by the Privacy Act, investigators were able to obtain information concerning 76 program graduates and 26 dropouts.

Over 90 percent of the graduates surveyed were positive about the program's impact.  Follow-up of the 26 dropouts or leavers revealed that those who chose to leave generally did so because their unrealistic expectations led to quick and easy disappointment.

Because of the restraints imposed on employers by the Privacy Act in giving information on hired graduates, follow-up information was available for only 45 percent of the 238 students/clients served by the program, and only 14 students had near-to-complete reports filed on them. What one can glean from the sparse information submitted by employers to CETA is that 37 graduates (roughly one-third of all graduates) secured some kind of employment. One-third of these worked in offices  and less than one-quarter of them entered professional or management slots. In all likelihood, the public sector employers who had provided the bulk of work experience for candidates during the pilot project continued to be the employers for a majority of candidates after they completed components of the CBHSD program.

Data was gathered by mailed questionnaires to 474 prime sponsors (89 percent response rate), site visits to national membership organizations, attendance at conferences sponsored by membership organizations, and telephone interviews with CETA-related membership organizations, and Department of Labor officials. The following conclusions were reached from these data. (1) It was determined that CETA's provisions are sufficiently broad to allow prime sponsors to use CETA funds to enter into membership and to pay expenses for activities related to membership organizations. (2) CETA prime sponsors spent $1.8  million in fiscal year 1979 for activities related to membership organizations. (3) Services provided by membership organizations to prime sponsors include information dissemination, technical assistance, and advocacy. (4) Benefits accruing to CETA prime sponsors from membership organizations include exchange of information, innovative programs, information about budget allocations and regulations, analyses of CETA legislation and policies, provision of a forum for discussion, and staff training. (5) There is no direct evidence that CETA funds were used for lobbying efforts by the membership organizations, although it is possible that they may be indirectly related. Prime sponsors believe expenditures related to membership organizations are justified because the services they provide are  worth the cost and are frequently more useful than those provided by the Department of Labor.

        "description":"This report covers the Council on Adult Education's operation from September 1979 to December 30, 1980. The report outlines the annual activities, describes the Council's program, and gives a status report on the process developed to obtain input on the development of recommendations for the reauthorization of the Adult Education Act, which expires in 1983. During the period of time that this report covers, the Council completed recommendations on the organizational structure of the Office of Assistant Secretary for Vocational and Adult Education in the Department of Education, and published three extensive reports which will serve as basic references as the new Administration and the Congress formulate a federal policy relating to adult learners. A major part of the annual  report is devoted to a preview paper on adult learning programs. In this paper, the Council notes that we know that most adult learning is self-directed and often done independently of structured educational institutions, and that adult education activities and adult earning opportunities are increasing. Under these conditions, the paper suggests ways in which organizational changes might enable the federal government to accomplish more than it now does with existing educational programs. The paper encourages linkages and cooperation that may be facilitated by organization charts and job descriptions, but depends, in the final analysis, upon the leadership at the top and the good will and common sense of the rest of those involved. The annual report also addresses the issue of  administrative costs for adult education and makes recommendations for use of funds. (KC)",

        "description":"A useful, values-oriented human resource development (HRD) program evaluation approach is one that is empirical with its orientation derived from a social/technical perspective. The optimum mix between the technical skills of evaluation and the required social skills of evaluation delivery is crucial for the quality assurance process. The core to this approach is grounded in the interrelationship of three continua: (1) the general context of training, education, and development; (2) time dimensions; and (3) action components such as source, types, and collection methods for data. The most critical dimension of the socio-technical continuum approach is time. A general framework can be provided to indicate the initial considerations and the immediate, intermediate, and long-term  positions. The direction for evaluation design and understanding of evaluation results should be considered under the initial considerations area by means of evaluation issues, participant and management expectations, and the projected results on future decision-making. The day-to-day development and management of quality assurance tasks focus on the levels of information, sources of data, and methods of collecting data. Evaluating the evaluation can be achieved through the following technical and social components: reliability, validity, utility, credibility, and feasibility. This type of analysis links evaluation to planning and thus to recycling and feedback while also blending judgment with objective evidence. (A 16-item reference section is included.) (BPB)",

        "description":"Vocational education in America has attempted to be the bridge between education and work. The Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA), an example of such a bridge, provides for remedial education in basic skills for training disadvantaged youths and young adults who had not been successful in the educational system. The context of skilled workforce preparation is changing. National changes such as the philosophy of the Reagan administration and its goals, the acceleration of technological change and demographic change, will affect the interface between education and work. The developments may affect the interaction of education and work in the following ways: (1) expansion of career development programs; (2) re-emphasis on the study of mathematics and science; (3) more  emphasis on postsecondary technical education with equipment sharing with industry; (4) increased demand for industry training utilizing a teacher-worker exchange; (5) increase in cooperative education; (6) training trust funds negotiated by labor unions; (7) increase of vocational education in rural areas; and (8) expansion of special needs programs. Combined with labor union willingness to build retraining into industry-wide contracts, this represents the opportunity to redefine education and work, or rather to rationalize all of the disconnected pieces into a reasonably smooth continuum.

        "description":"Research indicates substantial evidence that, compared with competition, cooperation increases mutual friendliness and contact between individuals. The effects of cooperative and competitive experiences on the structure of student cliques in the classroom were examined. Seven classrooms of fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-grade students (N=117) were randomly assigned to cooperative group learning, competitive group learning, or control learning treatments for a six-week program. Following the program, student relationships were measured using two sociometric questions. Students also completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children and the Social Behavior Scale. Results showed that cooperative groups decreased the average clique size, while competitive experiences enlarged  pre-existing cliques. Both treatments increased mean student prestige, increased the tendencies of students to occupy broker network roles, and reduced isolate network roles. The results suggest that the increased opportunities for student interaction in the classroom provided by both group treatments increase relationships among individuals, but that cooperative and competitive goal structures have opposite effects on peer clique structures.

        "description":"A household survey of 3,253 rural persons, conducted as part of the 1979 National Survey on Drug Abuse, focused on comparisons between rural and non-rural drug usage patterns. The findings indicated that rates of illicit drug use in rural areas increased through the 1970's and that rural/non-rural differences in illicit drug use declined. Rural and non-rural users of illicit drugs resembled each other demographically; age, education, and gender were associated with illicit drug use in the same ways in both types of areas. Rural and non-rural residents began using illicit drugs at approximately the same age. More than half of the rural young adults (age 18-25) and more than one-fourth of the rural youth (age 12-17) had used marijuana at least once; of the two groups, half were  current users, i.e., they had used marijuana within the month prior to the interview. Rural/non-rural differences were much more noticeable in the South and North Central regions; in contrast, rural and non-rural areas in the West and Northeast showed much smaller differences. The findings suggest that the emergence of drug abuse in rural areas may be related to variations in the rural environment. (Author/NRB)",

Various legal technicalities are noted, including that parents are exempt from criminal prosecution under the federal kidnapping statute, i.e., when a parent kidnaps a child and takes him/her to another state, that state is not bound by the child custody decree issued in the first state. Several Congressional members introduce legislation to combat the problem of child snatching and describe experiences of their constituents who were victimized by child snatching. Testimony is provided by a panel of  witnesses, comprised of members of Children's Rights Inc., a non-profit organization addressing the problems of child snatching as well as parents of kidnapped children. The motives of parental kidnappers are explored, dangers to the children are discussed, FBI involvement in cases is considered, and changes in legislation are suggested.

A sample of 69 married couples with children was used to examine the interrelationships among several measures of family adjustment and to explore the role of the social desirability response set on the self-report of marital and child adjustment. Subjects completed the Spouse Observation Checklist, the Dyadic Adjustment Scale, the Louisville Behavior Checklist, the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory, the Parental Attitude Research Instrument, and the Edwards Social Desirability Scale. Results closely replicated previous findings, suggesting that couples  with well-adjusted marriages were unlikely to have children who evidenced behavior problems. When social desirability was controlled, the relationship between marital and child adjustment was not significant. The results suggest that previously reported correlations between marital and child adjustment may have been inflated by a social desirability response set. The social desirability response set appears to play an important role in the relationship between marital and child adjustment among normal families. (Author/NRB)",

Psychology graduate students (N=19) participated in a semester-long simulation course. Students divided into small groups, and each group submitted a written proposal for evaluating the counseling service of a fictional community agency. Students could question the agency director, role-played by the instructor, to obtain evaluation-relevant information which had been intentionally omitted from descriptive materials about the agency. A second proposal was also written and submitted by each group. The groups then analyzed a fictitious set of pre-and post-measures describing the psychosocial adjustment of three client subgroups and prepared a  comprehensive final evaluation report that included the analysis results. Data relevant to the effectiveness of the simulation was generated from questionnaires completed by participants, questions asked by the groups, the proposals and final report, and the instructor's informal observations. Both the performance of the students during the simulation and their subsequent evaluation of the simulation effectiveness indicated that the simulation was involving and educational. The findings suggest that teaching evaluation research via simulation need not be confined to short-term courses. (Author/NRB)",

Female undergraduates (N=180) listened to taped interactions between a counselor and a female client in which the counselor, described as either a professional or paraprofessional, responded with either low intimacy self-disclosure, high intimacy self-disclosure, or self-involving responses. Subjects responded to the counselor as they believed the client would and rated the counselor as they believed the client  would by completing the Counselor Rating Form. Results indicated that: (1) high self-disclosing and self-involving counselors received more expert and trustworthy ratings than low self-disclosing counselors; (2) paraprofessionals received more attractive and trustworthy ratings than professionals; (3) client responses to high self-disclosing and self-involving counselors contained more client self-referents than responses to low self-disclosing counselors, which contained more counselor-focused statements; and (4) responses to high self-disclosing counselors contained more affective words and fewer counselor references than responses to self-involving or low self-disclosing counselors. The findings suggest that high intimacy self-disclosure is a superior response to low intimacy  self-disclosure and appears to be as effective as self-involving responses. (Author/NRB)",

However, under special circumstances, images of significant others may be shattered as they are seen &quot;for the first time.&quot; A phenomenological analysis of 60 descriptions suggest that this transformation occurs in one of four basic types of contexts. For example, persons may become empathically aware of others when they are seen responding emotionally to an unanticipated occurrence, such as the death of a friend. Fundamentally, the situation in which this new awareness of the other occurs is one in which a person is deeply engaged and which strongly speaks to basic values and concerns. But this new awareness does not  simply happen; it requires an implicit decision to remain open to the implications of the other's behavior and to allow one's preconceptions to be challenged. The characteristics of this decision process are in contrast with decision making as it is typically conceptualized in the psychological literature. (Author/KMF)",

To measure alienation among freshmen sorority members and freshmen independents in a small women's college, 60 women completed the Dean's Alienation Scale. Results showed that the largest percentages of women joined sororities for social activities and to make friends. Independent students said that they were not interested in sororities or preferred to be independent; some cited financial and time considerations as well. Scores on the Alienation Scale showed significant differences between sorority members and independents in terms of social isolation and total  alienation: independents scored higher in both areas. No significant differences occurred for either powerlessness and normlessness. Further research is needed to understand how alienation might be mitigated through various types of group membership.

The intellectual assessments of 153 children were examined during two test periods in the St. Louis Risk Research Project. In 1967-1972, the Wechsler tests of intelligence were administered to offspring in families with one schizophrenic parent, one parent with affective disorder, one parent with schizoaffective disorder, one physically ill parent, or to offspring with two normal parents. In 1975-1978, the intelligence of offspring was tested again at a mean age of 16 years. Differences between children as a function of parental diagnoses were assessed and yielded significant  time effects. Children of schizophrenics and children of parents with affective or physical disorders had greater loss in verbal IQ scores between the first and second testing than did the children of schizoaffectives and children of normal parents. Offspring of psychotic mothers had lower IQ scores than those of psychotic fathers. Children of schizophrenics and children of schizoaffectives had the lowest stability in IQ scores from the first to second testing. The findings suggest a need for further replication research on the effects of ill parents on their children. (Author/JAC)",

Various problems face the university-based academician who consults with agencies and organizations, such as consultant abuse, i.e., when a consultant is hired on the basis of title and academic affiliation rather than for specific research competencies. In addition, most drug education/prevention programs desire reduction of adolescent drug use; however, some data suggest that drug use may increase rather than decrease as a result of education programs. The ethical issues involved in this phenomenon have not been analyzed. Adolescent drug abuse also represents illegal behaviors and has important implications for issues such as  informed consent and protection of data. Finally, implications of therapist-client sexual relationships or harassment upon both the therapeutic relationship and the objective evaluation of therapy outcome must be considered. The psychological research consultant can attempt to improve the methodological quality of substance abuse programs, while simultaneously assuring that ethical standards are maintained.

        "description":"School psychologists who work in rural areas face difficult problems because of the setting in which they practice. Traditional models for delivering psychological services in urban and suburban schools are not typically generalizable to rural service delivery. Rural school districts tend to be closed and rigid, reflecting the nature of the community structure. School management may rely heavily on tradition and attempts to promote innovations are often met with opposition. Monetary constraints are faced by nearly all rural schools. These conditions make the implementation of special education services in rural settings difficult. Rural areas present difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified special education staff, community resistance to change and suspicion of outside  interference, and geographical problems. The practice of rural school psychology faces similar problems. The rural school psychologist must be a program planner and evaluator, taking a multilevel, multidimensional perspective. The rural practitioner must engage in needs assessment, program planning and development, implementation, and outcome evaluations. Despite potential problems and implications for training, rural school psychologists, in order to be effective, must adopt innovative methods of practice. (Author/NRB)",

Test takers of career interest inventories and occupational tests may perceive adult roles differently if they are male or female; thus, these perceptions are critical to any attempt to reduce sex bias in testing. High school students (N=600) rated the importance of several values on their choice of an occupation, the decision to marry, and the decision to become a parent. Both males and females agreed on the importance of high income, job security and leisure opportunities as components of an ideal job. For females, the addition of a prestige value suggested a belief in the prestige of working. For males, prestige was related to leadership and working in a  field of interest. Results showed that high school students perceived the adult world differently. Career choices by women tended to be limited by past experience or expectation; career choices made by men did not consider values related to other adult roles in marriage and parenthood. The findings suggest that these differences may affect the construct validity of tests and therefore should be taken into consideration by counselors. (JAC)",

        "description":"Research into the reading process has shaped an understanding of how readers &quot;make meaning&quot; when they are engaged in a reading activity. This research has highlighted a learning triad--the reader, the text, and the context (or learning environment)--that interactively affects the manner in which the student will comprehend a particular text. Research also permits reading teachers to consider such prereading characteristics as the role of background knowledge, reader/text interaction during reading, and the review, recall, and student response activities that occur after the text has been processed. Similarly, in examining instruction it seems particularly helpful to consider the variety of strategies that readers need to use at each of these three stages in the reading process.  Instructional activities before reading might focus on the vocabulary and conceptual knowledge appropriate for a specific task. They could include prequestions, analogy, and the idiosyncratic associations students tend to make in an attempt to relate what they already know to what will be contained in the text. Activities during reading might focus on helping the reader develop self-questions or respond to inserted questions. Activities following reading might focus on post-questions, student response, and text- and script-based recall. The most important point to remember is that when instruction focuses on strategies--on how a student interpreted a certain idea and arrived at a certain response--then the student will be more likely to learn to cope effectively with a wide variety of  reading tasks as an independent reader.

The second experiment involved five-minute timed typing tests of pairs of paragraphs. Subjects participating in this second experiment were 14 beginning typing students, 18 students with 36 weeks of typing instruction, and 12 secretarial students with 36 weeks of typing instruction. The data from these experiments strongly supported the  hypothesis.

The subjects read passages in one of these new orthographies, timed themselves, completed a comprehension test, and rated the ease of learning to spell and to read the new orthography in relation to traditional orthography. It was found that WES, a phonetic system, impaired the reading rates of adults; but RS, a system uniformly applying the most frequent of existing spelling rules, only impaired reading in the initial stages of the experiment. After reading about 6,000 words of text, the impairment in reading rates in RS had disappeared. By the end of the experiment, spelling in both systems had not been completely mastered by subjects, but this was  probably because the teaching of the spelling of the orthographies was treated as secondary within the experiment.

Based on the literature review, the paper presents six conclusions: (1) learning is a contingent activity; (2) almost anyone can learn if the task is broken down into small enough steps; (3) anxiety can be a debilitating state for an  individual; (4) the control of the environment in the form of contingency management, particularly contracting, can be used to help an individual accomplish his or her learning goals; (5) genuine concern for the individual is necessary if treatment is to be successful; and (6) investigations into the improvement of various forms of learning should be limited, for the moment, to results rather than processes.

In addition to the national results, the report describes the performance of 9-, 13-, and 17-year-old students in various cohorts defined by geographic region, sex, race/ethnicity, parental education, and size and type of community. The primary focus of the report is upon the written responses of students to works of literature when they were asked to analyze them, defend their initial reactions to the works, evaluate works, or simply respond to them in any way they deemed appropriate. In addition, the report provides information about the students' reading habits and attitudes, as well as their knowledge of literary works,  characters, and conventions. The findings presented in the report indicate (1) that most students lacked systematic strategies for examining what they read in order to understand it fully, and (2) that although students could make sound initial responses to works, they did not appear to know how to support or explain their responses in any but the most superficial ways. The report discusses the implications of the findings and suggests that school administrators and teachers take a variety of steps to address the problems raised by them. Primary type of information provided by report: Results (Selective) (Change). (FL)",

        "description":"The schema theory of reading comprehension holds that an active interplay exists between the reader's cognitive structures (schemata) relevant to a text and the text itself. A study examined whether children varying in reading comprehension ability showed differences in the deployment of cognitive structures--specifically, whether good and poor readers showed similar flexibility in shifting between familiar schemata. Twenty good and twenty poor third grade readers listened to two short passages about familiar daily activities. Comprehension of the second passage demanded a shift in schemata, and only half the children were explicitly cued to that shift. Analyses of free recall and interview responses indicated that although good readers recalled more information, there was  similar flexibility of schemata shifting for both good readers and poor readers.

At two-year intervals, all third and sixth grade teachers who taught reading in self-contained classrooms were classified as high, average, or low effective teachers. Effectiveness was determined by comparing students' predicted end of year reading achievement with their actual performance. The 64 teachers in the study also completed questionnaires that elicited information about their instructional practices, including skill sequencing, diagnostic record keeping, group organization and instruction, and materials used. The results showed that effective teachers at both grade levels used fewer  reading groups than did less effective teachers, and the more effective teachers relied upon commercial skill charts connected directly with a basal reader series, while less effective teachers relied more heavily on teacher prepared charts. All teachers in the study kept diagnostic records, but the more effective teachers placed more emphasis on basal reader diagnostic level tests and less effective teachers on teacher made tests. All teachers used flexible grouping procedures; however, effective teachers used progress as the criterion for changing students from one group to another while less effective teachers used lack of progress as the criterion. Effective teachers relied heavily on basal readers, while less effective teachers did not. (FL)",

        "description":"As part of a larger study of the oral reading of elementary school students representing eight linguistic populations in the United States, a study was conducted to discover why readers make the same miscues at the same point in a text and to discover factors in the text that contribute to this phenomenon. Subjects were second, fourth, and sixth grade students who were Navajo, Hawaiian Samoan, Arab, and Texas Spanish second language speakers, as well as downeast Maine, Appalachian white, Mississippi rural black, and Hawaiian-pidgin dialect speakers. They were instructed to read aloud whole stories of considerable length and to recall all they could remember about the stories. Sentences that generated the highest rates of miscues per word per reader were then analyzed for aspects  that contributed to those rates. The analysis confirmed that syntactic complexity was not the only contributor to miscues. Other factors causing miscues were (1) lack of relevant prior knowledge, (2) unfamiliar or unusual use of terminology, (3) weak syntax, (4) unpredictable simple structures, (5) unusual stylized syntax, (6) complex syntax, and (7) combinations of the above. The findings suggest that text difficulty cannot be understood completely without some investigation of the interaction between readers and the text, and that miscue analysis can provide data that reveal such interaction.

One teacher and 26 fourth and fifth grade students were observed daily over a four-month period. The focus of the observations was on the reading group discussion sessions that the teacher conducted with each of nine reading groups in the classroom. Interviews were also conducted with the teacher and with individual students. The results indicated that the teacher had developed a teaching perspective that revolved around the use of discussion of story content to teach the comprehension skills that he deemed  important for lifelong reading. He had organized his social studies instruction around the practice and application of those skills. He used several plans for grouping students for instruction, and had developed his own materials for teaching comprehension. The children's ideas concerning reading and reading instruction included the following: (1) reading is comprehension, (2) reading is reading aloud, (3) workbook exercises do not help in understanding a story or in developing reading skills, (4) children who read aloud with the teacher have difficulty with reading, and (5) reading skills learned in elementary school will help in high school.

The subjects, 27 second grade and 25 fifth grade students, each read six stories that had been developed for the study. The stories were one-episode narratives comprised of six grammatical categories with two propositions per category. The six categories were setting, initiating event, internal response, attempt, consequence, and reaction. Six event sequence orders were used in the stories, five representing either the movement of the internal response or the consequences, and the sixth representing the correct event ordering. After reading a story, each student was asked to answer a series of probe questions about it to discover how readily he  or she had noticed the order violations. After answering the questions, the student was asked to construct a better story using the same sentences. The results indicated that children judged correctly ordered stories to be &quot;well-formed&quot; and &quot;sensible,&quot; but frequently identified disordered stories as being &quot;flawed.&quot; Developmental differences were found in the children's ability to use expectations for the sequence of a story, in determining when the story made sense, and in correctly reordering it.

        "description":"Most popular strategies, including illustrations, for improving prose processing consist of procedures that force attention either to the text's macrostructure or to the organization and interconnections of its propositions. These strategies are assumed to enhance students' comprehension of the text as encoded, as well as to afford students an efficient storage and retrieval scheme for long-term recall of text information. However, with expository or instructional texts containing factual information that is unfamiliar, complex, abstract, or simply difficult to remember, comprehension strategies of the kind just described may not be suitable for enhancing long-term recall. Rather, mnemonic strategies that are designed expressly for storage and retrieval of difficult-to-remember  information would seem to be preferable. This view is supported by several recent experiments showing that prose-learning strategies combining the critical components of comprehension-directed techniques with those of memory-directed techniques will ultimately prove to be the most successful.

In the first study investigating semantic interference, it was found that both elderly subjects and college students took longer to call out the ink color when the printed word was semantically related to designated words held in memory than when it was not related. In the second study, elderly subjects showed at least as much semantic priming as younger subjects, that is, pairs of letter strings were identified as words more rapidly if the  words were semantically related than when they were unrelated. In both studies the stimuli were highly associated with each other, so a third study was conducted, varying the degree of association, to see whether age differences in priming would appear for less highly associated pairs. Participants were asked to state whether pairs of letter strings printed one above the other were words, with the response time recorded. The results showed that the magnitude of the priming effect did not vary with age or with associativity of word pairs, thus indicating that automatic processes do not change during aging. (HTH)",

        "description":"During writing conferences, many teachers impose their own ideas and attitudes on the student's essay, and often are not sure how else to help their students arrive at changes that will improve their writing. Understanding or assessment of a student's prior knowledge about the topic can be very helpful to a teacher in shaping the conference and paper under discussion. Brainstorming is a powerful prewriting activity that helps students draw upon previous experience to discover what might be relevant about their writing topic. Students who know little about a topic need a special kind of conference that focuses directly on building the ideas or concepts being written about and provides suggestions for sources of further information or alternative topics. When students do know  something about a topic but have not thought it through, the first draft often serves as a way to develop ideas. In this case, a productive conference might focus on what the student knows about the topic and how aspects of that knowledge are related to each other. A conference focusing on the linguistic or organizational aspects of a paper can be helpful for students who know a good deal about a topic and have thought it through already. (HTH)",

        "description":"A psychological model can show the technical writer how to present information for effective communication by explaining how readers perceive, understand, learn, and remember. The principles underlying the model are the reader's psychological set, the mind's pattern-forming tendencies, the span of short-term memory, and the mind's need for reinforcement. The psychological set explains the disposition of readers to think or act in a particular way, and interference occurs when a communication does not match the reader's mind set. The main reason people read technical literature is to know how to do something, so technical publications should be task oriented. Gestalt psychology suggests that the mind tends to seek meaningful patterns in perceiving, understanding, learning, and  remembering. Therefore, the technical writer's objective should be to supply cues for forming helpful patterns and to avoid cues that may form misleading patterns. The fact that the capacity of short-term memory is 7 plus or minus 2 items has numerous implications for presenting information: sentence length, number of items to include on a chart, and the number of parts into which to divide a comprehensible whole. Information is simple when the number of items presented does not exceed the span of short-term memory. Reinforcement helps the reader review material, verify interpretation, and see information in alternative ways. Technical writers should organize information so it will be easy for the reader to review. (HOD)",

A study was conducted to test a more developmental perspective on the effects of violent television: that the impact of televised aggression will vary according to the child's cognitive and social developmental level. In an experiment using 119 students from kindergarten, second grade, and fifth grade, the subjects' free playground play was observed during a one-week baseline period, a two-week experimental phase, and a one-week follow-up period. During the experimental phase, subjects were randomly assigned to view for 20 minutes each  day either exclusively aggressive or exclusively nonaggressive programing, after which their playground behavior was observed and rated according to 13 categories ranging from physical threat to passive social interaction. The results showed that the older the subjects, the better their comprehension and recall of the shows. Female aggressive behavior was quite low throughout the experiment, but aggressive behavior in boys decreased after they viewed the aggressive segments. Kindergarten children showed more decrease than did fifth grade students, although the fifth grade students better understood the programs they had viewed. (HTH)",

The three-credit course is offered as an elective to juniors and seniors and is predicated on the belief that lawyers, judges, litigants, and jurors face numerous communication problems on a daily basis. It gives particular attention to the literature related to verbal and nonverbal aspects of communication as they apply to the legal concerns of interviewing, negotiating, and litigating. The course is  organized into five units: (1) introduction to communication theory and the legal process, (2) communication theory and practice in interviewing and counseling, (3) communication theory and practice in negotiating and pretrial strategies, (4) communication theory and practice in the trial process, and (5) special topics in judicial communication.

        "description":"A study tested a method for teaching preservice teachers enrolled in a basic speech course how to lead classroom discussions. In addition, the study examined the effects of communication apprehension and size of audience on students' satisfaction with the assignment. The students were administered a measure of communication apprehension and assigned to one of two groups. Those in the first group led discussions within a small group of five or six students, while those in the second group led discussions before the entire class. Students in both groups were required to adhere to the following format: (1) introduce the discussion topic; (2) ask a preplanned question and wait for an answer; (3) react to the audience's response with a comment, a probe, or a reflective summary; (4)  ask another question and repeat the third step; and (5) summarize and conclude the discussion. Student reaction to the assignment was measured with a questionnaire. The results confirmed that classroom discussion was perceived as an effective teaching method by students. In addition, students who lead small group discussions were less apprehensive than those who lead entire class discussions, and highly apprehensive students rated small group discussion assignments among their preferred assignments more frequently than did low apprehensive students. (The student questionnaire is appended.) (FL)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine whether graduate teaching assistants in speech communication were aware of the affective components of their classroom behavior and of the student responses to them, and whether the instructors' awareness of the affective dimensions of instruction related to the student evaluative responses. Subjects were 640 students enrolled in 30 sections of a basic communication course taught by 18 instructors. During the last week of a semester, the students were administered the Index of Teachers' Affective Communication (ITAC), along with the objective teacher evaluation instrument traditionally used by the university. In separate circumstances, the teaching assistant in each course section was asked to examine the ITAC and predict what the mean student  response would be for each of the items on the measure. The results suggested that the teaching assistants had poor sensitivity as to how they were perceived by their students. While most instructors scored well on the ITAC according to their students, many were unable to predict their scores. The results support the generalized use of the ITAC as an effective evaluation instrument of classroom communication. (FL)",

While the primary tool for delivery of health care services to people is human communication, there is evidence that the communication between the providers and consumers of health care is in need of improvement. Researchers advocate the development of educational programs, such as a health communication course, that will help prepare people for occupations that deal with the problems and concerns of the elderly. Ten primary topics for study in such a course relate to the specific communication needs of the elderly: (1) the relationships between health care and human communication, (2) the  use of language in the delivery of health care, (3) the importance of nonverbal communication in health care, (4) health care interviewing, (5) therapeutic communication in psychological and emotional areas, (6) group communication in health care, (7) the role of conflict in health care delivery, (8) intercultural communication in health care, (9) communication in medical organizations, and (10) communication with the terminally ill. By offering strategies for improving communication in health care, perhaps at least some situations that might be problematic will be handled more sensitively and effectively by communication trained health care professionals.

To better understand the impact of such technology, a study of a recently implemented computer based messaging system (CBMS) was undertaken at a large, private university. Questionnaires were administered to and interviews conducted with 74 high level administrative users of the system and to 67 computer services personnel who were experienced CBMS users. The results showed that, overall, the users were satisfied with the system. Other findings were that the system produced positive, but not extreme, benefits; that usage of it reached early stability and then declined; that the users generally  agreed upon the tasks for which the system was appropriate; and that it brought about an increase in the users' communication networks.

The third section of the report covers the cost, limitations, and appropriateness of each of the possible applications, while the fourth section discusses the general barriers to the use of the systems. The fifth section compares each system to conventional feedback methods and to its competitors, and the sixth section notes the best technologies suited for each application.

The first positive administrative decision made was to involve every full-time person hired in speech and theatre in the activity part of the program. Another positive aspect of the administration is its relatively constant and consistent moral and financial support. On the negative side is (1) the loss of a protected &quot;activity fee&quot; that was identified separately from tuition and allocated through a process which involved students, faculty, and administrators; and (2) the &quot;split&quot; personality that faculty develop as they teach &quot;under&quot; one associate dean and engage in speech and theatre activities &quot;under&quot; another associate dean. Not only  does this mean that there is not one administrator who has responsibility to understand all of the speech program, but it also carries with it the preparation of two separate budgets and the artificial separation into two parts of what ought to be one whole. Suggestions for improving a speech activity program would include making the speech activity program a cocurricular program by involving the whole community and learning how to do more with less by bringing forensic tournaments closer to home. Faculty and administrators must devote the best of their efforts to &quot;save&quot; the community colleges for a complete communication program--both curricular and cocurricular. (HOD)",

To measure the ability of a child to adapt communication to a specific listener, each subject was shown a series of eight drawings illustrating handicapped and nonhandicapped children doing different things and asked what he or she would say to communicate a certain intention to the child in the picture. The subjects' responses were coded for their empathic adaptation to each handicap. The subjects were tested at the end of the  first year of a mainstreaming program and again at the end of the second year of the program. The results indicated that both nonhandicapped and handicapped children had difficulty communicating with their handicapped peers. Being in a mainstreamed class had no impact on the communication skills of the nonhandicapped children, and no differences were found between children studied at the conclusion of the first or second years of the mainstreaming program.

The first part of the program involves completion of stress logs to note all the different kinds and sources of stress as well as to observe the daily patterns and weekly cycles of stress. This is followed by a series of exercises to identify all possible on-the-job stressors, assess the relative impact of each, list the most bothersome ones, and decide the amount of control one has over each. A  stress management program can begin with the self-diagnosis of stressors. The top five stressors are to be listed and categorized into external and internal control factors. For those stressors where internal control is possible and the actual cause of the stress can be attacked, the \"Seven Steps to Managing Stress\" process is recommended. The process is explained and work sheets provided. (MLF)",

Following a brief summary of the historical development of the superintendency in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the author contrasts the opposing viewpoints of Callahan and Tucker and Zeigler regarding the actual balance of power between boards and superintendents. Callahan believes the evolution of superintendencies has provided boards and superintendents with a system of checks and balances while still giving citizens a voice in the schools. Tucker and Zeigler see instead a lack of balance, rising superintendent dominance, and a loss of citizens' power. The paper next examines the status of  superintendents today. It cites Zeigler and Jennings book, \"Governing American Schools,\" which concludes that the superintendent is clearly dominant over the school board, and contrasts this view with the positions of Cuban and Boyd, who assert that a variety of political and social factors influence the relative power of superintendents. The author concludes that the local boards themselves are in the best position to decide what role they want to play. (Author/JEH)",

When planning for a necessary change in staff size, districts must still ensure that equal educational opportunities are available to all students, that equal student activities are offered for males and females, and that affirmative action procedures and state standard requirements remain intact. Additionally, procedural requirements of the  Oregon Fair Dismissal Law and local collective bargaining agreements must be followed. Position descriptions are needed for each type of position to ease reassignments. In writing a plan, districts should establish clear procedures for determining that reduction is needed. Specific programs that can be eliminated should be identified along with alternatives and considerations for retained personnel. Districts must also have policies intact for recalling employees to work. Finally, the board should officially adopt the plan and disseminate it.

The first question is based on the assumption that, in addition to generalized conflict, city managers and superintendents respond to demands from a variety of sources (the elected board or council, other administrators, other governments, or segments of the community).

Similarities between school district and council-manager institutions are discussed. The researchers examine how the respondents both perceive and handle citizen involvement and involvement by other interested parties. In accounting for differences between the two groups, the three dimensions of the nature of conflict (source, substance, and  scope of intensity) are explored. Educational and municipal governments are compared for the levels of conflict arising from various sources: the legislative body, segments of the community, staff members, and other levels of government. The discussion of substance concerns how school districts and municipalities are affected by various types of conflict issues, such as those that evolve from collective bargaining, state or federal regulations, or other kinds of tensions within the community. The discussion of the scope or intensity of conflicts focuses on the number and characteristics of parties involved and the duration of the conflict. (Author/MLF)",

        "description":"In observing 51 decisions made in a school district over the period of a year concerning the placement of elementary students in special education, the author noted that most decisions seemed to be presented and accepted rather than debated. To discover why, he analyzes one meeting and placement decision of the district's eligibility and placement committee. After describing the district's student referral process and the paths followed by special education students, the author lists the four phases of the committee's proceedings, including information presentation, decision-making, parents' rights explanation, and student goal-setting. Analysis of the language used by the meeting's participants in the information-presentation phase shows that the professional participants  presented (without interruption) test-based academic information, using mystifying technical language. However, the nonprofessionals' observational, emotion-based information was elicited by questions, was frequently interrupted, and was communicated in everyday language. Further, the nonprofessionals depicted the student in situational, historical, and biographical contexts while the professionals did not. The author concludes that the roles of professional and layperson are embedded in the language used in the meeting, and that the different authority assigned to these roles explains the acceptance without debate of the professionals' recommendations.

        "description":"To improve parent and citizen involvement in school closing decisions, this guidebook discusses the methods and requirements for effective participation. Chapter one covers the background of school closings and declining enrollment, including national demographic and lifestyle changes and their effects on schools and other institutions. Chapter two lists eight components of successful citizen involvement programs, including appropriate definition of the problem, establishment of priorities, widespread information-sharing and debate, and a cooperative, problem-solving spirit. Different methods of getting involved and various courses of action are described in chapter three, while chapter four notes eight topics, such as enrollment and finances, about which involved citizens will  need credible information. The fifth chapter suggests 13 strategies to consider in handling enrollment decline and school closure. Among the suggestions are boundary shifts, curriculum changes, staff sharing, and school space sharing. Chapter six offers ways to ease the transition after a school closes. The summary chapter emphasizes eight key points, including the need for adequate time to involve the community and for school reuse plans. Two appendices provide questions citizens should ask about school property reuse and a list of national citizen-advocacy organizations in education. (RW)",

        "description":"Drawing on the writings of scholars in the field, this report presents the case for increased parental control over the education of children. It begins by maintaining that the American public school has fallen from favor mainly because of a decline in academic achievement and the replacement of the teaching of basic skills with social engineering. The author sees the humanistic curriculum and subjective values as the roots of the crisis. The author maintains that education is basically religious and neither can, nor should be, the value-free institution that today's educators strive for. Advocating reforms based on more family control and less state control of education, the report attempts to demonstrate that the Constitution and a number of Supreme Court decisions guarantee  the primary rights of parents in the education of their children. Court decisions illustrating the legal tension between family rights and state control are cited. Finally, current proposals for increasing family choice in education are presented and explained, ranging from voucher systems to minimum competency requirements to moral education classes. The paper concludes that in this democratic, pluralistic society, all families should be free to train their children according to the values and beliefs they cherish. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Based on the view that tuition tax credits will benefit all taxpayers, this report examines the history and economics of educational financing to furnish a background for an explanation of current proposals to provide tuition tax credits. The author begins with five theoretical economic models of school finance designed to explain the logic of tuition tax credits. The report then looks at several historical models of school finance including the New York public school system and the economic bases for free and for compulsory schooling. The rationales for current proposals to establish tax credits are then examined and some criticisms of tuition tax credits are refuted. The report then makes a case for a potential gain for taxpayers from education tax credits based on the  contention that they will generate competition throughout the school system and bring down the cost of education. Early origins and recent federal proposals for tax credits are then examined, including Tom Paine's education tax credit system, U.S. federal tax credit and tax deduction schemes until 1977, the Packwood-Moynihan Proposal, and the 1979 tuition tax credit bill. The report concludes with descriptions of education tax credit proposals in California and Washington, D.C., and a comparison of tax credits and vouchers. (Author/JM)",

Chapters focusing on the person who holds the leadership position look at characteristics of today's educational leaders, at what makes an effective leader, at the scarcity of female and black school leaders, and at leadership style. The part of the volume focusing on structure looks at the organizational supports that underlie school leadership. It examines school-based management, management support teams, participative decision-making systems, and determinants of school climate.  Chapters on leadership skills highlight several abilities administrators must master to be effective leaders in education today. This part of the volume looks at such skills as communicating, leading meetings, managing time and stress, managing conflicts, and solving problems. Practical suggestions for using this information in schools are offered throughout. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"A statewide questionnaire survey of 180 Tennessee public school principals examined their perceived degree of participation in decision-making in six policy areas and compared it with their degree of satisfaction with the decisions made in those areas. The principals were selected from three sets of school systems: those which had had formal professional negotiations before the 1978 Tennessee Education Professional Negotiations Act; those which had had negotiations only after the passage of the act; and those which had never had formal negotiations. The six policy areas comprised curriculum and instruction, finance and business management, educational facilities and auxiliary services, school-community relations, pupil personnel, and certified personnel. Using analysis of  variance, the researchers found that there were not significant differences in levels of satisfaction among the three groups of principals in any policy area except certified personnel; in this area, the principals from systems with pre-1978 negotiations were least satisfied and least active in decision-making. The findings also indicated that principals from non-negotiating systems participated least in decision-making in two areas: finance and business management and educational facilities and auxiliary services.

        "description":"In a survey of 96 county commissioners in 20 central Tennessee counties--a state where county commissioners determine the funds available for local public school systems--researchers used a seven-item questionnaire to elicit commissioners' attitudes on issues of public educational finance. The survey asked about local educational expenditures, methods of generating educational revenues, sources of educational income, and the adequacy of available funding for education. Analysis using a chi-square test for statistical significance indicated that the commissioners support additional local funding for educational expenditures pertaining to instruction, discipline, and auxiliary services, but not for sports, extracurricular activities, or teachers' cost-of-living raises. They oppose  giving school boards the power to levy taxes; prefer using state and local sales taxes to raise educational revenues; and believe the primary source of public educational funding should be the state government. A copy of the survey questionnaire is attached to the report. (Author/RW)",

        "description":"The influence of citizens on educational collective bargaining was examined in this study of eight school districts in California and Illinois. Data were collected through interviews with persons active in collective bargaining and observation of bargaining sessions and other meetings. The study revealed that citizens rarely participate directly in collective bargaining but may have strong influence over it through school board recall votes or elections. The authors differentiate between client participation (in which parents act as representatives of their children's rights) and citizen participation (in which parents attempt to alter organizational policy and practice) and discuss causes for movement from the former to the latter. The authors identify three decision-making  arenas: legal/political, professional/bureaucratic, and labor relations. They suggest that the criteria that citizens use in deciding whether to participate in a particular arena are permeability of the arena, efficacy of entering that arena, and efficiency of influencing decisions in that arena. The report concludes that since the criteria used by citizens in deciding how and when to participate leads them away from direct participation in collective bargaining, public policy attention ought to be focused on encouraging citizen influence rather than on furthering direct participation.

        "description":"The notion of intervention strategies is introduced in this paper to explain why and when certain change efforts are successful. It is argued that the choice of control points and the selection of control linkages are determined by characteristics of the task in the implementing agency. Many implementation failures can be attributed to the selection of the wrong control point and the wrong linkage. Linkage refers to the kind of reporting required and the kind of positive or negative inducements used. Control points are selected as the relevant variable, whether implementation controls are mainly exercised on input, output, or process variables. Input controls relate to allocated funds and characteristics of the professionals and are associated with adaptive implementation. Output  controls involve the implementer in saying something about what has been done and can either enlarge or reduce the implementer's discretion depending on the specificity of disclosure. Process controls are directed at internal behavior and are concerned with the way services or products are provided, thus reducing day-to-day discretion. This paper focuses on situations where the task does not always lend itself to routinization and where professional discretion is important. The implementation of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 is selected to illustrate the unforeseen consequences of inappropriate intervention strategies. (Author/MLF)",

The author first explains the analytical concepts of school productivity, input-output analysis, and productivity functions. His review of school productivity research, covering studies of teacher, school, and program effectiveness, notes a number of variables that influence productivity, including teacher experience and verbal ability, teacher-student interaction, use of computers or other advanced technology, school climate, class size, and socioeconomic factors. Administrators wishing to apply the research  findings to their schools, says the author, should also be aware of the opportunity costs--the alternatives lost--when a particular method or reform is adopted. The document also explains how difficulties in choosing among multiple educational goals and in selecting appropriate test instruments can create problems in measuring educational output. The author concludes that administrators can make a difference, however, by finding ways to make schools more productive and effective. (RW)",

        "description":"Policy analysts approach problems of decision-making from two distinct perspectives: rational-comprehensive and incremental. This paper examines the theory behind both perspectives and argues that incrementalism may be a more appropriate strategy for applied decision-making in education. In considering the appropriateness of applying incrementalism to a specific situation, the following environmental characteristics must be assessed: threshold on critical mass effects, structural decomposability, sleeper effects, and the issue attention cycle. In addition, the organizational characteristics of redundancy of resources, distribution of power, and maturity of the organization must be evaluated. Educational organizations are precluded from disruptive shifts in policy and thus are  characterized by an incremental, additive approach to policy. Rationalization of educational policy in the United States is made difficult by the decentralized character of the system, the jealously guarded prerogative of local control, the predominance of short-term issues, and sudden swings in public demands. All of these conditions seem to call for incrementalism. Other characteristics showing a predisposition for incrementalism are abundance of resources (found in the redundancy in organization at the local and state levels), the availability of a bargaining arena, and organizational maturity.

The framework identifies factors from several environments--the home, the community, and the larger sociocultural context--and links them with school policy and operations. Methodological considerations important to further investigation of these environmental links are also discussed. This introductory inquiry into the topic of community influences is intended to set forth a paradigm guiding research at the University of Oregon's Center for Educational Policy and Management. To do so, research linking environmental influences to schooling and student learning is reviewed. The manner in which these influences affect school governance, student learning, and management of human resources at the  school and classroom levels is explored and several theoretical approaches to studying these links are discussed. Finally questions flowing from this inquiry are proposed in the form of a research agenda. (Author/JM)",

Initiated by the National Institute of Education in 1976, the RDx is composed of eight Regional Exchanges and four central support services. In 1979 members of the RDx agreed to collaborate in the development of a resource base on the identification and validation of promising educational programs, practices, and products. This paper provides a brief history and description of the following validation processes: the Joint Dissemination Review Panel (JDRP); Identification, Validation, Dissemination (IVD); Sharing Business Success (SBS); Project Information Packages (PIPs);  and the National Education Practices File. Some of the issues in validation discussed in the paper include replication versus adaptation, the evaluation experience of the project staff, state responsibilities before validation, the degree of rigor applied in validation, and the nature of on-site visits. A bibliography on validation processes and the abbreviated form of original IVD submission requirements are appended. (Author/MLF)",

Approximately two-thirds of the states that have validation programs employ either the Identification, Validation, Dissemination (IVD) procedure or some modification of it. Roughly a third of the states reported that they use their own state-developed validation processes. Forty-three states conduct site visits, following prescreening, to verify projects' status on the state's validation criteria. Significant variation occurs in the length of the site visits, the number of team members, and the composition of the teams. Twenty-seven states reported that they provide support to both the  developer/demonstrators and the adopter/adapters of validated programs. Close to three-fourths of the states reportedly are involved in some form of cooperative activities with other nearby states. However, the cooperative activities center primarily on implementation of the validation procedure. Few if any states cooperate by actually sharing validated programs. A number of recommendations are made in the general areas of coordination and communication, funding, diffusion efforts, and the scope of the Joint Dissemination Review Panel (JDRP) programs.

The controversy over the estimated number of handicapped children given by the Office of Special Education is addressed (6.2 million estimated as opposed to 3.9 million actually identified). Resulting problems in misclassifying children as handicapped to increase state childcount are discussed, and it is recommended that the 12% prevalence estimate be discontinued. Among the eligibility questions cited are  unclear definitions in the law and legislative history and insufficient guidance in program regulations. The lack of compliance with individualized education program (IEP) requirements are documented, including IEP content problems and missed deadlines. Comments from local education agency officials are summarized regarding the increased time, personnel, and funds needed to provide a free appropriate public education to all handicapped children. The report further suggests that state education agencies have been inadequately staffed to carry out P.L. 94-142, and that the initial federal administration of the program was inadequate. Each section concludes with recommendations to the Secretary of Education and responses by the Department of Education. (CL)",

The authors propose a set of questions as guidelines for staff personnel to use in selecting curricula for young handicapped children. Among the questions posed are the following: Is the curriculum based on a theory of early development and learning? Do the goals of the curriculum complement  the existing goals of the program? Are the objectives designed to accomplish the terminal goals of the curriculum? and Are the items developmentaly relevant and logically sequenced?

An introductory section mentions the purpose of five major program components: caregiver interview, identification of child's wants and needs, training the child to request wants and needs, training to initiate interaction and request wants and needs, and environmental manipulations to facilitate spontaneous requests. A section on parent involvement and the initial assessment contains a sample caregiver interview and examples illustrating interpretation of the caregiver interview. Procedures for identifying reinforcers via environmental manipulation are the focus of the section on identification of wants and needs.  Request training is discussed in another section in terms of goal and rationale, three decisions in request training, and request training objectives and procedures. The goals and rationale, description, procedures, criterion, and generalization information are offered for training in requesting more, requesting through choice, training the child to initiate communication, and manipulating the environment to facilitate spontaneous use. Appended materials include a report on facilitator training, a sample caregiver interview and teacher questionnaire, blank data sheets, guidelines for planning and managing a communication board, guidelines for selecting a primary communication mode, and a review of response development and data collection.

The model included a tutorial program for gifted underachievers, a special counseling program for gifted students experiencing disciplinary problems, and specially designed minicourses developed to meet the needs and interests of Middle School gifted students. A program of teacher training in giftedness and education of the gifted was conducted. Avenues of communication were established between gifted program teachers, parents, students, and regular program teachers; and an evaluation was undertaken at two stages of program development. The academic  aspects of the model were implemented in a second district secondary school the following year.

The legal requirements are focused on thorough discussion of litigation and legislation. The second section explores research on the use of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R). Research touches on the many definitions of bias, construct validity/content bias, item bias, atmosphere bias, and bias in test use. The author states that conclusions regarding the validity and bias of the WISC-R with minorities vary depending on the definition of bias. A definition is proposed based on the outcomes of test use for the individual. Prerequisites to nonbiased assessment are identified, including good fundamentals and ethical  practices, clarification of purpose, and multifactored assessment. Research on the System of Multicultural Pluralistic Assessment are reviewed, followed by a discussion of assessment of adaptive behavior with mentally retarded persons. Requirements of P.L. 94-142, (the Education for All Handicapped Children Act) that the child's sociocultural background and primary language be taken into account are considered. The continuing problem over defining mild mental retardation is examined. The author concludes by emphasizing the importance of multifactored assessment and of viewing nonbiased assessment as a process rather than a specific number of instruments. (CL)",

Scores of 100 White and 100 Black third graders on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised, the SOMPA, the ABIC, and the SOMPA Sociocultural Measures (SCM) were analyzed. Among findings were that the mean ability (academic aptitude) level among Iowa school age children is significantly  above the national population average and the ABIC norms are accurate for Iowa children. Policy implications include justification of higher IQ cutoff score in Iowa than suggested by the American Association on Mental Deficiency; recognition of limitations of the ABIC; and the need for further research on SOMPA SCM validity and reliability.

Chapter 2 reviews categories of illness (functional psychoses, neuroses, personality disorders and certain othernonpsychotic mental disorders, psychophysiological disorders, transient situational disturbances, and behavior disorders of childhood and adolescence) and considers the relationship between mental illness and deafness in terms of causes and incidence, difficulties of detection, and occurrence of specific types of illness. A  third chapter defines four types of therapies and describes ways in which the treatments are adapted to deaf patients with particular reference to the Mental Health Program for the Deaf (MHPD) at St. Elizabeth's Hospital (Washington, DC). Theory, purpose, and operating procedures are discussed for psychotherapy (individual, group, and family therapy); behavior therapy/modification; activity therapies (self expressive activity therapies, occupational and/or vocational therapies); and somatic therapies (pharmacological and physical therapies).

Factors affecting students' responses to questions are the strengths and weaknesses of the learner and the type and difficulty of the question asked. A systematic method of providing or following up on students answers, termed Interpretation of Pupil Answers (IPA), is explained. Definitions and examples of five types of interpretation related to IPA are given: (1) a positive evaluation in which the student is provided with information about their work that is favorable; (2) a negative evaluation in which the judgment of the student's work is unfavorable; (3) a prompt in which the teacher provides a hint or clue so that the student can arrive at the desired answer; (4)  an expand in which the student is asked to give a justification, an explanation, or an example; and (5) a refocus in which the student is reminded that he/she has only answered part of the question or has overlooked some component of the instructions. It is suggested that it may be necessary to interpret correct as well as incorrect answers and silence, that more than one interpretation-questioning exchange may be necessary, and that teacher silence may be the best policy on occasion.

Noted are the project background (including sporadic outreach efforts) and conceptual orientation, and an ecological perspective which stresses the role of both the nuclear and extended family. Project goals include development of a demonstration service program, developing a replicable inservice training program for local professionals, and expanding educational services to young retarded children in rural areas. Program implementation has involved providing screening and evaluation services and a weekly 3 hour educational clinic for 21 children (mean age 17 months) and their parents in  three locations. Clinic activities include group parent-child training, individualized parent-child training, home planning, and a parent-family training and discussion group. Additional clinics are offered periodically to involve members of the child's extended family. The inservice training programs for 23 local allied professionals in the three communities involve a 9 month program in 4 week cycles consisting of two half day seminars in the local community, a day of centralized training activities, and a half day practicum locally. The FIT project staff are also using the media to make the public more aware of the needs and resources available for young retarded children and providing technical assistance to local agencies. Continuation of the program through state, local, and private  support is seen as evidence for its effectiveness. (DB)",

In addition, differences among teachers with regard to factors which contribute to stress and factors which help teachers guard against stress were examined. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and the Special Teacher Response to Stressors (STRESS) were used to elicit responses from the teachers by mail. The results indicated: (1) male teachers were more depersonalized by their jobs than female teachers; (2) teachers with 4 to 5  years experience (compared to teachers with less experience) and teachers with only a bachelor's degree (compared to those with master's and specialist's degrees) perceived themselves to care frequently and intensely about the needs of their students; and (3) teachers between 26 and 30 years of age perceived themselves to be more depersonalized by their experiences than older teachers. LD and ED teachers cited legal concerns, lack of administrative and peer support, and lack of support services as extremely stressful. ED teachers in particular were fearful of being attacked verbally and physically, and rated their overall job responsibilities as significantly stressful. LD and ED teachers felt that exercise and outdoor programs and confiding in significant others (i.e., wife or husband)  were helpful in combatting stress. EMR teachers felt peer support was helpful.

Farber's theory of minimal family adaptation is tested to see whether family characteristics (such as demographics and family career); child's characteristics (such as severity of the disability, sex, and age); and the family's involvement in informal and formal social networks affects parents' planning. A literature review applies the concepts of family career and individual life cycles to families with mentaly retarded children as they plan for future services. Forward stepwise regression analyses were performed on data gathered from a mail survey questionnaire of 330 parents of  mentally retarded children from birth to 21 years old. In general, strong support was found for Farber's theory of minimal adaptation. The strongest predictors of parents' planning were family career, child's characteristics, and community support. Family demographics were found to be the least significant predictors. (Author)",

Data were collected using the Pupil Rating Scale (PRS), which measures behavioral characteristics in auditory comprehension, spoken language, orientation, motor coordination, and personal-social behavior; the Clymer-Barrett Prereading Battery (C-B), which assesses visual  discrimination, auditory discrimination, and visual motor skills; and a parent questionnaire. Among findings were that referring kindergarten teachers rated students lower than either of the transition teachers on all three scales, parents' reactions to the program were generally positive, and significant progress was made as indicated by PRS ratings and C-B scores. Four illustrative case studies offer achievement data, teacher ratings and perceptions of the child, and the investigator's observations of classroom behavior. (SB)",

There was broad support for some type of preparatory program which would allow students more time and more data on which to base a career decision; allow for more interaction with students and more thorough assessment of students' abilities by faculty and staff; and allow time for appropriate skill building in the areas of information reception, math, English, and career decisionmaking.

Multivariate analysis of variance showed that repeated review was much more helpful to deaf students than to hearing students on the recall and recognition measures but not on the higher level learning outcomes.

Stepwise multiple regression analyses of the data showed that for females, spatial skills followed by communication skills were signficant predictors of field dependence; for males, spatial skills followed by the extent of hearing loss were significant predictors of field dependence.

In Experiment 1, Ss read incomplete sentences and chose which of two word pictures best completed the sentence. From these responses, 12 sentences were identified (eight sentences in which rhyming test words were predictable from the context and four in which one word from the test word pair was not predictable). In Experiment 2, twenty-one of the same hearing impaired children, who met strict speech discrimination training criteria, heard variations of the 12 sentences over headsets in which the relationship between a context word and one of a rhyming test word pair was  either reasonable, unreasonable, or neutral. After each sentence, the child decided whether he had heard the test word or its alternative which differed in either the initial or final consonant. Significantly more correct identifications were made on the reasonable and neutral sentences than on the unresonable ones. Average means were 81% on the reasonable sentence, 64% on the neutral ones, and 34% on the unreasonable ones. (Author)",

It was found that freeing preschoolers' speech from constraints inherent in talking about the immediate context results in their demonstrating control over a variety of language-related skills that are generally assumed to be beyond their competence. These include: (1) the simple ability to talk about, and thus presumably to represent, events not taking place in the here-and-now; (2) the ability to, and preference for, talking about these in general rather than specific terms; (3) the use of timeless reference; (4) the sensitivity to the temporal structure of activities and the ability to move \"backwards\" within a temporal structure to effect a \"repair\"; and (5) the  appropriate use of a variety of relational terms that are infrequent in context-bound speech and that preschoolers appear not to understand in direct tests of comprehension. Attention is focused on the way in which the use of \"if\" and \"or\" indicated the flexibility and complexity of preschoolers' representations of familiar activities, and on the possibility of interpreting many of their \"if\" statements as timeless hypothetical references. In addition, the evidence that preschoolers' knowledge of familiar activities includes a representation of alternative and conditional pathways suggests that questioning them about such activities might provide a means of assessment of their ability to use the verb forms \"could\" and \"would.\" (SW)",

        "description":"The ways in which preschoolers use the word \"but\" were studied. It was found that the eight preschoolers, who ranged in age from 3;9 to 5;5, were able to use \"but\" to express a number of different types of adversative relationships. \"But\" introduced clauses containing information that: (1) contrasted with shared knowledge about the usual state of affairs, (2) described a condition under which the situation described in the preceding clauses did not hold, (3) denied an inference that might be drawn on the basis of the preceding statement, (4) explicitly contradicted a prior statement, and (5) introduced a temporal repair. The cognitive prerequisites that could be assumed to underlie and motivate each of these types of \"but\" statements also are considered. Statements contained in  categories one and two indicate knowledge of optional pathways in the occurrence of an event, while statements contained in category three indicate at least an emerging ability to recognize the implications of one's own statements, and possibly to take the listener's perspective and make inferences about her inferences. Statements in categories four and five indicate knowledge of and adjustment to discourse conventions. The subjects' productions are divided into categories and discussed on the basis of whether the contrast signaled by \"but\" was directed toward the text of the statement, or toward the discourse process per se. It is suggested that the analyses indicate a somewhat surprising level of sophistication in children's understanding of discourse conventions and their ability to  adjust their speech in accord with such conventions.

        "description":"Causes of language fossilization and ways to overcome it are considered. Fossilization is the relatively permanent incorporation of incorrect linguistic forms into a person's second language competence. The discussion is focused on fossilization of incorrect syntactical rules, based on experiences with learners of English as a second language at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Students who have been in the United States for years often demonstrate fossilization. While they can communicate basic needs and some may communicate at complex levels, the students have developed their own personal, idiosyncratic interlanguages, which are simplified versions of English. The causes are lack of formal instruction and insufficient corrective feedback from native speakers and  classroom teachers. It is suggested that helping students overcome fossilized items requires positive affective feedback but negative cognitive feedback when fossilized structures are used. A problem for educators is to convince the students that they need remedial assistance without intimidating or antagonizing them. Placement essays and grammar tests can be used to determine whether students need a remedial course or can proceed to an English as a second language composition course. In the remedial class, the span in levels of proficiency causes problems. Tutorial help for less proficient students and extra language lab work, as well as individualized instruction, are possible solutions. The remedial class includes formal grammar instruction, oral exercises with corrective feedback,  substitution and sentence manipulation drills, written exercises, short composition assignments, and dictations in class.

        "description":"Forty-three children, 2;11 to 5;6, described six familiar activities: making cookies, going to the grocery, having a birthday party, going to a restaurant, getting dressed, and having a fire drill. They described each event three times. The descriptions were elicited by initially asking \"What happens when...?\" or \"What do you do when...?\" and then providing non-directive probes such as \"Can you tell me more?\" and \"Anything else?\" Reviews of the children's descriptions indicate that the request for description of events divorced from the immediate context elicits a sophistication in temporal structure and relational vocabulary that is often not accessed in either experimental or free-play settings with preschoolers. Performance in such settings can considerably expand what is  known about preschoolers' cognitive and linguistic abilities. The baseline competency demonstrated in these settings can provide the foundation for more controlled research that attempts to establish how experimentally based competency gradually develops into the more abstract, decontextualized knowledge that characterizes adults' understanding of relational terms.

        "author":["Lempert, Henrietta"],
        "description":"Preschoolers' ability to understand grammatical relations in passives and to generalize was studied using animate referents. Three- to five-year-old children were taught to produce passive sentence descriptions of events in which animacy of the actor and acted-on object were varied. After pretesting to determine passive sentence comprehension, the experimenter used toys to enact 32 actor-plus-action-plus-object events, and described 20 events in passive sentence form. Then the child was asked to describe the event without benefit of the experimenter's example. Three types of toys were used to enact the events: (1) animate (e.g., girl, horse); (2) dynamic inanimate (e.g., train, ball); and (3) static inanimate (e.g., house, piano). Training conditions were as follows: animate  actors acted on dynamic inanimate objects; dynamic inanimate actors acted on animate objects; and the acted-on objects were static inanimate things. It was found that when the referents in the event coincided with particular word order propensities, production preceded comprehension. Children who were unaware that the grammatical subject and object in passives correspond to the underlying object and subject still produced sentences which observed these relations. Apparently, a linguistic rule is not always the base for correct word order. It is suggested that the discrimination between animate and inanimate actors that emerged may not involve the entity's capacity for independent action, but may involve the child's naming a referent in preverbal or in postverbal position according to the  referent's relative salience.

Descriptions of eighteen innovative programs confirm that there are highly successful programs of the following types: (1) language immersion (programs in which most of the elementary school classes are taught in the foreign language); (2) partial immersion (programs in which up to 50% of the classes are taught in the foreign language); (3) curriculum integrated foreign language instruction (programs in which the daily language class is conducted in the foreign language and is supplemented  by additional culture and language study in the regular classroom); (4) FLES (programs that have foreign language from one to five days a week and emphasize oral communication); and (5) foreign language experience (FLEX) (programs that aim at exposing children to basic concepts of foreign language). Recommendations for elementary foreign language programs cover the following topics: definition of goals, articulation, language assessment, program administration and cost, parent and administrator support, resource materials, teachers, and supplemental classroom activities. The literature review covers optimal age for learning a foreign language and program design and evaluation. An extensive bibliography including curriculum resource guides completes the volume.

Although data show both strengths and weaknesses, programs share some common positive features: (1) dedication of program staff, (2) use of a wide range of materials and techniques (i.e., eclecticism), and (3) provision of services beyond those stipulated (resulting in orientation as well as education). In many institutions, the programs receive special assistance and consideration. The data strongly suggest that the programs have a positive effect on the students' efforts to learn English and make their way in the American society and economy.

Programs are conceived as falling under foreign language in the elementary school (FLES), middle-school programs (grades 5 to 8), and secondary school programs. These last receive the greatest emphasis. Specific educational strategies focus on skill development, teaching culture, evaluation (testing), and classroom and  curriculum management. A great deal of emphasis is laid on career education. Ample lists of resources are scattered throughout.

Progress in writing skill is enhanced by careful attention to prose style, and students are encouraged to write pastiches. Finally, students are required to keep a journal. Testing and grading are discussed, and situations commonly encountered by teachers are dealt with. Appendices include suggestions for or samples of personal assessment statement, course introduction for a basic French composition  course, grammar mid-term, student evaluation of course, prose style analysis checklist, grammar review sheet, sentence-embedding exercises, and tests.

        "description":"The status of women faculty in colleges and universities is considered. While there has been increased hiring of women on college faculties, women faculty members still lag behind men in rank and salary, even when differences in fields, institutions, and postdoctoral experience are considered. Women presently constitute about 24 percent of the full-time instructional faculty in higher education. Most of the growth in the proportion of women faculty can be attributed to the hiring of individuals under the age of 30 to fill untenured positions. Only 46 percent of women faculty have tenure, compared to 72 percent of men faculty. Women faculty, on the average, receive 17.5 percent less in salary. One of the reasons given for the low percentage of women gaining tenure and the  declining number of women full professors is the relatively low number of women who received doctorates before 1970. Once appointed to tenure-track positions, women faculty climb the academic ladder more slowly than men. Since teaching, research, and institutional service are all important factors in the evaluation of faculty for promotion and salary increases, it is necessary to determine if male and female faculty differ in the amount of time they spend doing those things. There is, for instance, a considerable difference between the teaching loads of full-time male and female faculty: women more often are involved in teaching. The evidence about the publication rates of male versus female faculty seems conflicting; however, even when the publication rates of academic women and men are  identical, men are promoted more rapidly. The individual's professional visibility and service to the institution as factors often considered for advancement also are addressed. (SW)",

        "description":"Egalitarian attitudes and the personality traits of instrumentality (masculinity) and expressiveness (femininity) were examined for 314 male and 71 female dental students and for women in dental auxiliary programs. The objectives were to (1) investigate their possible correlates (e.g., parental occupation, status, age) and to compare the attitudes toward societal roles of women held by professional and paraprofessional groups with the attitudes of the general population and (2) examine dental students' self-reports of masculine/feminine attributes. The Attitude Toward Women Scale (AWS) and the Personal Attributes Questionnaire (PAQ) were administered to three classes of dental students, female dental hygiene students, and women in the dental assisting program at the University of  Minnesota. Among the conclusions are the following: (1) Women who enter dentistry are different from college women in general--stronger on the instrumentality trait and weaker on the expressiveness trait--and also hold more egalitarian attitudes towards women's roles. Except for their attitudes towards women's roles, these women are much more similar to dental men than to other women. (2) Professional men are only slightly different from college men on the masculinity trait, with slightly though significantly higher scores and slightly more egalitarian attitudes toward the roles of women. (3) A comparison between dental students and a group of established professionals seems to suggest that women entering dentistry do so because they are like the men of dentistry. Questions for research  as well as for professional education in U.S. dental schools are posed on desirable gender-associated personality attributes for the dental health practitioner, and the effect of these characteristics on patient treatment styles, public access to dental care, and the individual's oral health condition.

Specific chapter discussions cover the following: postwar trends, federal land grants for higher education, the Morrill Land Grant College Act, the G.I. Bill, federal research grants to universities, equal opportunity policies, the politics of regulation, Title IX, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1964 (the Buckley Amendment), tuition tax credits, the Department of Education, policy analysis, constraints on the federal role, and speculation on the future. The following  appear in tabular form: estimated expenditures of institutions of higher education, by source of funds, alternate years (1960-1976); estimated expenditures of different forms of federal aid by institutions of higher education, alternate years (1960-1970); trends in costs of implementing federally mandated social programs (1965-1975); total outlays for higher education, by source of funds, selected years (1939-1970); federal funds as a percentage of the total current income of universities and colleges, by control of institution (1939-1970); estimated expenditures of institutions of higher education, by source of funds, selected years (1960-1977); and the development of Washington representation in higher education. It is shown that the scope of the federal contribution to higher education  has grown since World War II. In fiscal 1977, the federal budget for higher education was approximately $11.75 billion and growing. Including all major forms of aid, this constitutes about one-fifth of all funds spent by public institutions of higher learning and about one-third of total private school funds. (CC)",

In order for this commitment to be implemented, it will be essential for institutions to define the appropriate administrative  structures and intellectual environments necessary to meet and participate in events that will shape advanced education in the future. Each institutional environment will be called upon to meet unique needs that will serve different kinds of students and programs. It is suggested that the chief graduate school officer be a person who occupies a prominent position in the decision-making processes of the academic institution. Such a person should participate directly in academic and resource allocations and administration of research. In addition, the graduate school officer should be responsibile for the administration of such graduate student affairs as admissions, financial aid, examining committees, degree requirements and, jointly with the graduate council, the review of graduate  programs for their educational quality.

        "description":"The institutional goals of the University of Illinois and the Illinois Board of Higher Education during the 1960s and conflict between the two entities are examined. One goal of the University of Illinois was to develop new general purpose campuses in the urban areas of the state in order to increase its educational services to the state. One goal of the Illinois Board of Higher Education was to provide effective leadership for statewide master plans for public higher education. Attention is directed to the importance of the goals, actions blocking goal attainment, and degree of goal attainment. Differences in organizational circumstances of the two groups are examined to help determine whether the goals are central to institutional self-maintenance. The university's goal of  adding new general purpose campuses was directly frustrated by the board's rejection of the plans of &quot;The University of Illinois and Plans for the Future,&quot; and by denial of governance of the Chicago and Springfield campuses provided for in Master Plan II. The board's goal of providing strong leadership in statewide master planning was partially blocked by the mere existence of University of Illinois statewide planning initiatives. The board was able to protect its goal by denying the fruit of the University's planning initiatives. For the university, the goal of adding new general purpose campuses was important but only one among a broad set of goals typical of the comprehensive university. It is suggested that the goal of providing strong leadership in statewide master planning was  central to the board's self-maintenance. (SW)",

Continuing education may be defined as any systematic effort developed by a clinical laboratory scientist to update and expand knowledge and skills. A pertinent issue is whether mandatory or compulsory continuing education has any demonstrable beneficial effects on the health care of the public and on the provision of timely and effective care. It is suggested that more research is needed to determine how, or if, continuing education affects the competence of the laboratory professional's performance. All continuing education programs sponsored or  approved by ASMT should: identify participant's perceived needs and needs demonstrated by proficiency tests, performance evaluations, or accreditation inspections; specify financial and manpower resources; determine whether behavioral objectives correlate with needs; base course content and instructional strategies on objectives to maximize transfer of knowledge of skills; and evaluate student learning and long-term course outcomes. It is suggested that the upsurge of mandatory continuing education during the 1970s is almost certain to continue, and that licensing or certification is increasingly becoming prevalent. Examples of continued learning experiences under the following categories are identified: formalized and nonformalized learning experiences; self-directed learning,  participation in ASMT at various levels, formalized tours, and program contribution for continuing education.

        "description":"Developments during the 1980-81 academic year concerning mergers/joint planning projects designed to eliminate unnecessary duplication of programs between historically black and white colleges in Nashville, Tennessee; Savannah, Georgia; and Norfolk, Virginia are examined. Site visits were made during the second year of operation of the programs at the merged Tennessee State University and the University of Tennessee, at Old Dominion University and Norfolk State University, which have cooperative programs using both campuses; and at Armstrong State College, which sponsors all Georgia teacher education instruction, and Savannah State College, which sponsors all business administration courses. It was found that in all three locations each campus is still largely racially  identified. In Nashville, the continuing decline of white enrollments since the merger has had an effect upon faculty morale, not for ethnic reasons, but because of apprehension about job security and academic program support. In Norfolk, planning efforts for joint programs of instruction have not abated. Total institutional enrollments have not changed in any negative way, and a visible increase in &quot;other race presence&quot; has been achieved on both campuses. In Savannah, faculty transfers between campuses as a result of the movement of academic programs has gone smoothly. It is suggested that ethnic diversity seems to be achieved more rapidly on campuses serving primarily commuter students than on campuses that are chiefly residential, and it occurs more easily at the post-baccalaureate and  upperclass student levels than at the freshman level, due in part to the maturity of students and clarity of their career goals at these upper levels. Information on enrollment and academic programs is appended. (SW)",

For 1978-79 doctoral degrees awarded, there was a nationwide increase of 1.9 percent and a 4.5 percent increase in the South. There was a decline in the number of master's degrees awarded both nationwide and for the South, and the number of degrees awarded at the baccalaureate level remained stable. The pattern of annual increases in the number of first professional degrees continued nationally and for the South, and the number of associate degrees awarded both national and in the South decreased. Blacks accounted for 6.8 percent of the total associate, bachelor's, master's, first professional, and doctoral degrees awarded in the nation, and for 11.3  percent in the South. Black representation nationally, and in the South, was highest at the associate level and lowest at the doctoral level. The drop in the number of master's degrees awarded to blacks was 4.6 percent nationally and 6.9 percent in the South. The largest increase in the degrees awarded to blacks in the South occurred at the associate level (16.6 percent) followed by first professional and doctoral degrees (approximately 10 percent). The 1978-79 data reveal continued lessening of the role played by historically black institutions. Blacks outpaced whites in the proportion of degrees in teacher education at the master's and doctoral levels. The field of business and management increased in popularity with blacks, and blacks increased their share of graduate degrees in  engineering. (SW)",

The federal government is reducing expenditures in education and seeking to limit the government's involvement in developing education policy. The federal support for higher education has been primarily through assistance to students and not directly to institutions. The decline in the number of 5- to 21-year-olds and the increase in the number of adult students has shifted the focus of the pressure for governmental funding. The community and junior colleges were designed for and grew from community need, the demands of business and industry, and the needs of the nontraditional student, and they currently enroll more  than 35 percent of the total enrollment in postsecondary education. Community and junior colleges receive considerable financial support from state and local governments. Another sector of higher education discussed is the private college, which educates a large percentage of the liberal arts graduates and which faces a struggle for survival in the future. Throughout the United States there is a renewed emphasis on the need for quality in education at all levels. A National Commission on Excellence in Education has been established and, among other things, it will assess what higher education can do to counteract poor preparation of college students in basic and advanced learning skills. Additionally, there is a need to train specialists in such fields as computer science, optics,  engineering, and some physics and chemistry areas. Additional perspectives on financing higher education during the 1980s are considered. (SW)",

Three sources of information were used to obtain predictor variables: American College Testing (ACT) program test scores, the ACT Student Profile, and high school transcript information from the registrar. Study objectives were to reduce the large number of pre-enrollment variables to a small number of useful preduction variables and to use linear and nonlinear classification techniques to exhaust the predictive power of the predictive pwoer of the predictor variables. Of the 2,850 entering freshmen in the fall 1978 cohort, there was enough information to allow factor scoring for 1,711 of  the students. It was found that the difference between using 43 factors and 23 factors was negligible. There were no indications from this study or previous studies that a larger number of hte pre-enrollment variables could account for more the variance of persistence; however, the 23 factors did not predict retention any better than an earlier study that used only three variables. It is concluded that pre-enrollment variables per se did not directly predict persistence. It is recommended that the smallest set of factors that maintains the current level of prediction of persistence should be developed and used in retention studies to save on costs of data storage and analysis.

The various accrediting agencies and associations focus on a broad set of criteria that are generally perceived and promoted to be attributes of institutional program quality. The accrediting criteria of the six regional associations are used as guidelines to determine the extent to which institutions achieve their stated goals and objectives. The professional associations generally have developed more specific criteria. Accrediting criteria provide guidelines for program assessment, whereas standards establish baseline or minimum requirements for a number of program components (e.g., curricular structure and sequence skill development).  Accrediting has two distinguishing characteristics relative to considering quality: accreditation focuses on the institution's capacity to achieve, and the extent to which it does achieve, articulated goals and objectives; and accreditation evaluations are not competitive (i.e., institutions are not compared and ranked). Although the public may view accreditation as a pass-fail assessment of institutional quality (and stability), it is claimed that in practice accreditation is an assessment that does not generally distinguish or promote high institutional performance and capacity beyond accreditation standards (guidelines and requirements). With respect to the assessment of quality in higher education, the literature suggests that accreditation describes (usually in very general terms),  rather than distinguishes, the characteristics of institutional quality.

The system worked in real time to provide knowledge delivery services to real research problems through three phases of systems operations--diagnosis, search, and product design. Main systems elements included research paradigms as procedural scripts, information needs as weakly specified frame terminals, and content models as frames. The system's schema enables it to generate  representations of information needs as schemata, to plan and conduct targeted searches for relevant information, and to use its inductive and deductive inferencing capabilities.

Divided into two parts, the report first traces the history of the library from a gift of 50 volumes from the City of Paris to the City of Boston in 1843, to 3,000,000 volumes in 1979 when this rehabilitation project was undertaken. As the collection and catalog grew, the history of the Boston Public Library paralleled the evolution of modern cataloging processes, and the second part of the report describes the activities of the  first phase of the project, as catalog cards were translated into microfiche in order to preserve millions of deteriorating bibliographic records, expand access to the research collections of the Boston Public Library, and offer insights to other research libraries planning to integrate newer styles of cataloging into existing bibliographic files. The major phases of the project are briefly reviewed and presented as a chart. (RAA)",

Designed to enhance students' research skills and to give librarians a more active role in the educational process, the program provided bibliographic instruction for experimental groups from the English, History, Psychology, and Speech Departments; control groups did not receive such instruction. Presentations involved teaching the use of the card catalog and periodical indexes, search strategy, and bibliography, and a tour of the library.  Responses to a 45-question evaluation questionnaire indicated that student research skills did improve, with significant differences between experimental and control groups; however, students' attitudes toward librarians and the library did not improve. It was concluded that educational philosophy and admininstrative policy have a greater influence on the program's success than the characteristics mentioned above. Seven references are listed.

The iconic model, which incorporates an assumption from linguistics about the indirectness of meaning in a message text, is used to examine some of the intellectual processes shared by indexers and authors, as well as ways in which the individual tasks of these persons are different. It is believed that these similarities and differences, as reflected in the texts of the two types of written messages they produce, are partly responsible for  the behavior described by the truism. Eleven figures illustrate discussions of theoretical models, documents and indexes, research through references, critical research, citation indexing, the knowledgeable researcher, and the memory of research. A concluding discussion briefly reviews several other models proposed for use in library and information science, and a 34-item bibliography is attached. (RBF)",

Individualized Instruction for Data Access (IIDA), the computer system developed during the project, operates in an instructional and an assistance mode, and can be used to train users to perform online searches or to aid users in search performance. The system employs a set of diagnostics which alert users to the strategic and syntactic errors they make during the search process. When IIDA was  operational, a number of evaluations of the system were made, using first undergraduate computer science majors and experienced online searchers, then library science faculty and graduate students and undergraduate engineering students, and finally engineers at the Exxon Research facility in Florham Park, New Jersey. The evaluation studies indicated that individuals who had never done online searching were able, using IIDA, to do searches which produced satisfactory results. Detailed accounts of the design of the system, system operations, and the methodology of the evaluation studies are given, and the project bibliography is included. (JL)",

Institutional variables used for comparison are student enrollments, expenditures, and the Consumer Price Index. The majority of the tables indicate institutional control, type, and enrollment size, and provide means and quartiles as well as totals. Selected data items on library  collections, expenditures, and full-time staff are also shown by states. Analyses of the seven college and university surveys reveal substantial increases in collections, financial resources, staffing, and services. However, when changes in student population and inflation are considered, library conditions remained constant with regard to the number of books and circulation per student, and library expenditures in relation to education and general expenditures. Libraries declined in number of staff and expenditures per student, the proportion expended for library materials, and the number of books purchased.

Introductory material describes the Center's role in the project with regard to designing and conducting surveys, planning and conducting faculty workshops focusing on strengthening the humanities, disseminating findings, and evaluating the project. Next, the report reviews the activities of the Center in these areas. The activities included the following: (1) two versions of a community survey were designed to determine what community agencies, organizations, and groups are involved in the humanities; (2) workshops were organized on designing, administering, and analyzing questionnaires; (3) an audience survey was  developed for cultural events; (4) a student survey form was drafted and evaluated; (5) 14 workshops were conducted focusing on approaches to integrating the humanities into occupational programs, interdisciplinary courses, lay advisory committees for the humanities, and methods of organizing student and community surveys; and (6) articles, reports, and speeches disseminated information about the project and its activities. After an evaluation of the positive and negative results encountered so far, the report reviews the activities planned for 1981-82 in the areas of surveys, workshops, dissemination, and evaluation. Appendices include the survey instruments, workshop reports, and an inventory of current approaches to integrating humanities and occupational instruction. (AYC)",

It begins by outlining the purposes and functions of such groups. It then emphasizes the importance of faculty and administrative support for advisory committees and suggests evidence that can be presented to promote this support. After several examples are cited of ways in which lay advisory committees have been initiated at community colleges, the paper identifies several components of effective planning efforts and discusses the functions of a planning group made up of concerned faculty and administrators. Next, the selection, characteristics, membership rotation, and size of the advisory committee are discussed, and the roles and functions of key  committee members are examined, including the chairperson, secretary, and community college representative. The next sections of the guide suggest questions that should be addressed as the committee establishes its annual program of work and recommend possible committee activities in the areas of student recruitment, follow-up, and continuation; instruction; instructor quality; and community outreach. Next, guidelines are presented for conducting effective committee meetings and criteria are recommended for evaluating the meetings. In conclusion, the paper recommends additional bases for judging the effectiveness of advisory committees. Sample agendas and a list of additional resources are appended. (AYC)",

First, national post-secondary enrollment declines are projected and the implications of these declines are discussed for admissions and recruitment personnel. Next, the report considers Hispanic enrollments in Michigan and reviews the significance of these findings for recruitment. Two major findings are noted: the underrepresentation of Hispanics at every level of higher education and the concentration of Hispanic students in community colleges. Questions raised by these findings are then posed. The next section suggests two-year college recruitment strategies (e.g., aim literature at non-traditional students, emphasize the transfer function and  articulation, and provide satellite centers and flexible scheduling); recommends several retention strategies (e.g., insure quality curricula and staff and provide counseling before and after transfer); and suggests areas for research. Suggestions for recruitment, retention, and research regarding Hispanic students at four-year colleges are provided next, based on a report by the University of Michigan Coalition of Hispanics for Higher Education. These relate to offering Hispanic culture courses, enhanced support systems, financial aid, articulation agreements with Michigan community colleges, contacts with Hispanic communities, studies of attrition, and increasing Hispanic representation in administration, faculty, and students.

After five resolutions dealing with remediation are presented as they were adopted by the IBHE and State Board of Education, the report describes and presents the findings of two surveys on remediation. The report reveals that all of the state's community colleges and state universities were surveyed and asked: (1) to inventory and report on the magnitude of all remediation activities on their campuses; (2) to provide their rationale for offering remediation; (3) to explain how students were identified for remedial assistance and how they were  subsequently evaluated; (4) to indicate if credit toward graduation was granted for remedial courses; (5) to describe the organization of remedial activities; and (6) to predict the future of remedial studies on the campuses. The report then presents operational definitions for remediation, prerequisite courses, learning skills offerings, tutoring, and special assistance programs. The remainder of the paper describes remedial efforts at public universities and community colleges, provides a summary and assessment of the steps taken by the colleges to comply with IBHE policies, and presents further policy recommendations which are intended to facilitate progress toward the IBHE's goals of minimizing university remedial programs by 1983.

In addition to demographic data (i.e., length of residence in Central Contra Costa County, age, size of household, head of household's employment and marital status, and sex), the survey sought to determine if residents were aware of DVC and its policies, programs, purposes, services, and extracurricular offerings on- and off-campus; if they had attended or considered attending classes and for what purpose; their preferences in scheduling and course offerings; and their evaluation of teaching quality at DVC. The findings of the survey included the following: (1) most residents knew of DVC, and  71% had visited the campus; (2) one-third of the respondents had taken at least one course at DVC, with men being more likely to enroll than women; (3) 40% of the respondents were aware of DVC's art exhibit, and 68% were aware of the college's athletic programs; (4) awareness of DVC and participation in activities or courses increased with length of residence in the county; and (5) among those who had not taken classes, \"no spare time\" was the most common reason given.

Data collected prenatally and postnatally at 3, 6, 12 and 18 months of age were used in multiple regression analyses to identify antecedents of compliance. Maternal personality variables, infant characteristics assessed shortly after birth and mother/infant interaction variables assessed at 6 months were related minimally to compliance. The quality of mother-infant attachment (assessed with the Ainsworth-Wittig (1969) Strange Situation procedure) at 12 and 18 months did predict compliance at 24 months.  Securely attached infants were significantly more compliant than anxiously attached infants. (Author/RH)",

Elementary school students gave their perceptions of (1) the formal rules or expectations governing discourse at school, in play groups, and at home; (2) appropriate forms to get attention or influence others; and (3) discontinuities between discourse at home and at school. Although pupils recognized discontinuities between formal rules of discourse at home and at school, no ethnic or achievement level differences emerged in pupil responses. Identification of appropriate forms of address reflected pupils' awareness of their different status across settings. Sharp discontinuities between home and school discourse rules seemed better  understood than more moderate discontinuities, and rules governing classroom questioning seemed difficult for the pupils to comprehend. Chldrens' general lack of comprehension suggested the need for further research examining relationships between pupil perceptions of classroom questions, behavioral manifestations of understanding rules of discourse, and academic achievement. (It was found that participation in class discussion significantly reduced variance in final reading achievement; sex, entering reading skills, and student-teacher relationship contributed significantly to reducing variance in classroom participation.) Further studies were recommended to investigate indirect relationships between home-school discontinuities in rules of discourse and pupil success in school.  (Author/DB)",

Subjects were 165 children and their teachers in six second, third and fourth grade classrooms in a lower socioeconomic, multiethnic elementary school. Six teacher-planned language arts lessons were videotaped in each classroom over the course of the year. Transcripts of the lessons were also made. The videotapes and/or transcripts were analyzed using three different approaches to analysis of classroom language: a language dimensions approach, a speech act analysis, and an  analysis of the structural sequencing of question cycles. After comparing the data derived from the above three approaches, the conclusion was reached that the initial findings of the original study, (which was based on the language dimensions approach), were not only supported by the two alternative approaches, but more importantly, were considerably clarified, extended, and strengthened.

        "description":"Part of a year-long sociolinguistic study of teacher and pupil perceptions of classroom discourse, this study presents data on pupil perceptions of discourse in play settings. Subjects were 165 pupils from six second, third, and fourth grade classrooms in a lower socioeconomic, multiethnic elementary school. In each of the six classrooms six children were randomly selected (stratified by sex and peer status) to form six play groups. Each group of children was then videotaped while playing with construction toys. Videotapes were played back in short segments to all of the pupils in the classroom to which the play group belonged. Following each videotaped segment, pupils were individually asked to report on \"what they heard anyone saying\" in that segment of the videotape. Data  obtained was compared to data previously obtained during discourse in classroom settings. Findings indicated that certain language events or functions, such as attention-getting and information-giving, occurred frequently in both play and classroom settings. However, in both settings these events were not necessarily those most salient (i.e., most frequently \"heard\") to pupils. The data further show that peer status and sex are related to patterns of processing information in both lesson and play settings. Higher peer status subjects in both settings reported more total information (related to both language and the social context in which that language occurred). Girls appeared to be more alert than boys to the source of language in both settings, with girls reporting the comments of  other girls significantly more often than those of boys, while boys showed no significant difference in reporting of girls' versus boys' comments.

        "description":"This report presents a summary of findings from a year-long sociolinguistic study of pupil and teacher perceptions of classroom discourse. Subjects were 164 pupils, and their teachers, in six second, third, and fourth grade classrooms in a lower socioeconomic, multiethnic elementary school. Six teacher-planned language arts lessons were videotaped in each classroom over the course of the year. In addition, videotapes were made of conversations in the families of three third-grade pupils and of six randomly selected (stratified by sex and peer status) pupils in each classroom in an unstructured play setting. Videotapes were played back to pupils and a variety of tasks were used to collect data on pupil perceptions of the \"rules\" of discourse, the \"units\" and \"salient features\" of  discourse, and the functions of \"question cycles\" in each of the three settings. Comparisons were made of pupil responses over time, across settings, and in relation to pupil characteristics, including ethnicity, sex, entering reading achievement, peer status, and status with teacher. Pupil perceptions were compared to teacher perceptions, and both were compared to those of outside observers, chiefly sociolinguistic specialists. Important discontinuities were identified between children's perceptions of discourse in home and play settings and their perceptions of classroom discourse. Children's perceptions of and participation in classroom discourse, for example, appeared to be associated with differences in classroom language patterns, as identified by sociolinguists. Pupils' sex,  entering reading achievement, peer status, and status with teacher were all significantly related to perceptions of classroom discourse and participation in classroom discourse, but ethnicity was not. Frequency of participation in class discussions contributed significantly to explained variance in final reading achievement. (Author/MP)",

        "description":"Demographic data are used in this report to present information about infant mortality in more- and less-developed countries. One chapter is devoted to rising infant mortality rates in developed countries, which defy the typical post-World War II pattern. Severe economic conditions are linked to this increase. Direct causes of infant deaths are identified as birth defects, malnutrition, and disease. Infectious and parasitic diseases cause deaths frequently preventable by vaccination or proper sanitation. Not considered an outright killer of infants, malnutrition is seen as an accessory to the crime. Indirect causes of infant mortality are traced to social and physical environments. Poor medical care, ignorance, and low income are three factors in infant mortality that are aspects  of the social environment; poor sanitation and polluted water are the major factors included in the physical environment. The total number of children a woman has borne, although not clearly linked to infant mortality, is also considered important. A three-stage endeavor to reduce infant mortality is discussed in terms of quality of life, medical interventions, and care of sick infants. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"Using 1975-76 school-year data, the study describes New Mexico size adjustment factors for public school funding, compares them with the manner in which other states recognize smallness or sparsity, and delineates the impact of size adjustment factors on New Mexico school districts in terms of resources, net operational and proportionate operational expenditures, pupil-professional and pupil-adult ratios, and breadth of program. The study also investigates size adjustment factors as incentives for school reorganization and for school and district consolidation and the desirability of recognizing alternative schools within the distribution formula. Results support the concept of three-tier size adjustment recognition (school, district, and rural/isolation) and the current  recognition formulas for small elementary-junior high schools, small districts, and rural/isolation, but reveal a large disparity in the breadth of programs offered in small and large secondary schools and difficulties for very small schools to offer a breadth of program comparable to larger secondary schools, regardless of resources provided. Recommendations include: retaining without change the elementary-junior high, district, and rural/isolation factors; changing the high school adjustment factor to recognize schools with enrollments of 500 or fewer and reducing the multiplier to 1.5; and adopting incentives for small secondary school and small school district consolidation.

Primary data gathering occurred at the second, third, and fourth grade levels; these data included teachers' explanations of tests and the need and purpose of testing, students' perceptions and feelings concerning testing, extensive classroom observations, and individual interviews conducted with a sample of students and teachers. Data indicated that teachers and students at the lower grade levels functioned in a complimentary way although they had different models for the  testing event. By presenting the proper physical behavior during testing, the students seemed to satisfy many of the requirements of the teachers' model, although the understanding of the reasons behind testing were clearly different in both groups. When teachers had to change their model in the later grades, shifting the emphasis from form to content, and when, at that time, the reality of failing presented itself more strongly in the students' school life, the students' model became dysfuntional.

Some 30 tribal groups and agencies participated in a cultural adaptation of an assertive coping-skills training intervention program for a year. The general themes of coping, self-determination, and communication were reflected in the ultimate program goal, which was competence in a biculturally appropriate lifestyle. Program goals emerged from discussions among community members. Formal and informal modeling provided a variety of Indian coping models enacting appropriate assertive behavior in several Indian and non-Indian social, family, and business  settings. Indian and non-Indian persons rated 24 pre-training and 24 post-training role play scenes by 6 participants to determine whether relevant and noticeable change had taken place. Results indicated that the cultural adaptation of social skills training appeared to be more effective for American Indians than traditional psychological approaches. (CM)",

Bill S. 792 was endorsed by senators from Oregon and Hawaii and, with certain reservations, by representatives of eight Indian Tribes, Pueblos, and Associations. Indian representatives wanted Indian control on the Institute's Board of Trustees to insure sensitivity to Indian religious and cultural concerns for policy direction, the exhibition of Indian arts and crafts, and compliance with the American Indian Religious Freedom Act. There was support for the concept of developing regional institutions rather than a national institute. The Department of the  Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs opposed the enactment of S. 792 because the bill proposed to remove the Indian Arts and Crafts Board and the Institute of American Indian Arts from the Department. Statements from nine Pueblo leaders in New Mexico who opposed S. 2166 (a bill to establish a National Institute of Native American Culture and Arts Development) and various correspondence were entered into the record.

The purposes of the study were: (1) to identify and evaluate variations in environmental attitude between and among individuals within the subgroups, relationships between environmental problems and non-environmental problems as perceived by the subgroup populations, extent to which individuals within and among the subgroups were willing to &quot;pay&quot; for improvement in environmental quality, and media influences which have the  most significant impact in shaping the environmental attitudes of respondents; and (2) to correlate these findings with existing empirical data. Findings indicate, among others, that respondents do not believe environmental problems are among the most important faced by the nation, that respondents believe television is the most accurate source of information, concern for environmental problems decreases as one moves away from the center city, and that Mexican-Americans rank environmental concerns higher than Anglos.

The program is based on the experiences of intervention programs designed to increase the participation of non-minority underrepresented groups in mathematics related careers. It is proposed that in order to maximize the effectiveness of the intervention program activities aimed at impacting teachers, counselors, parents, students, and the school, curriculum should be undertaken on a sustained basis for a long period of time. The involvement of the local community and industry is a necessary ingredient for increasing the effectiveness of these efforts. Also recommended is the inclusion of a sound evaluation program in order to systematically  identify the successful activities which can or cannot be duplicated in other geographical localities.

The first meeting was part of the official NCTM conference program. The second meeting was sponsored by the National Institute of Education (NIE). Points from a total of three papers presented over the two meetings are discussed. A paper concerned with verbal problem solving in mathematics among Chicano students is the first to be summarized, as it was only discussed at the NCTM session. The other two were further discussed at the NIE-sponsored meeting. Broad areas of ideas from both these papers are combined in a summary that reviews the following  topic areas: bilingual education, curriculum, teaching and teacher training, ethnography, testing, and basic research. It is noted that there is a general lack of replications of research studies with minority students on findings and practices that are from mathematics education research that focus on the majority. It is felt the absence of such replications adds to the dubiousness of purportedly generalized outcomes, and needs to be remedied. (MP)",

It is felt that minorities and mathematics education issues have been largely neglected in recent investigations. This neglect is seen to have the potential to render tenuous the generalizability of empirical findings which have been observed among the non-minority student population. The studies abstracted here cover seven ethnic groups, with both sexes included. Collectively, they include populations in all levels of schooling. More specifically, two investigations include pre-elementary school populations, six involve grades K-6, six focus on grades 7-9, four on grades 10-12, seven include college  populations, and five involve adult professionals. Further, three studies do not specify what ethnic groups are included. Of the remaining, eight involve whites, seven pertain to blacks, and four include Puerto Ricans. Each of the groups American Indians, Chinese, and Chicanos is included in two studies, and one report includes Alaskan Natives. One study covers females only, the remaining include both sexes. (MP)",

Section One presents a general overview of environmental education in the region. Topics discussed include environmental problems, goals and objectives for environmental education, legislation, the nature of environmental education, curriculum and instructional materials, teaching strategies, teacher education, and evaluation. Papers in Section Two were first presented to a Regional Workshop on Environmental Education convened by Unesco in Bangkok, Thailand. They describe the status of environmental education in 17 different countries and vary greatly in scope, often focusing on one or more of the above topics. Section Three addresses common problems and various dimensions of  environmental education. Articles on population, the role of science, mass media, industrialization, and specific programs indicate that although environmental education is of relatively recent origin in countries around the world, much is being done in most countries in the region.

        "description":"In June, 1980, 38 secondary school science teachers and 10 specialists met at Phillips Exeter Academy to discuss the state of science education. Conference participants agreed that a crisis in science education exists. Events appear to indicate that the public is telling science teachers that what they are offering in the name of science education is not relevant to American society today. There have been no major changes in the teaching of secondary school science since the curricular reforms of the 1960's although circumstances have changed dramatically since those times. Conferees suggested that new materials, not new courses, need to be created so that material of societal and ethical character could be infused into present science courses, replacing 10% of present course  content. They also suggested that a national network of permanent Science Resource Centers (patterned on the County Extension model) should be established to create and distribute teaching materials addressed to societal issues as well as for other tasks.

The sample included 204 fourth-grade and 185 seventh-grade pupils. Data were collected on achievement in reading and mathematics, sex, prior knowledge of topic, mathematical content, graphical form, and graph comprehension. Results indicated all independent variables, except sex, are unique predictors of graph comprehension for fourth graders. For seventh graders, unique predictors included mathematics achievement, reading achievement, and prior knowledge of content. There were no significant sex-related differences with fourth-grade pupils, but seventh-grade girls significantly out-performed boys in mathematics achievement. The results are viewed  to imply that fourth graders focus their attention on a graph's surface structure, notably the topic and graphical form used. Seventh graders can scan graphs more effectively and become concerned with a graph's mathematical content. Implications for teachers are noted. (MP)",

This type of application would permit students to understand how algebraic symbolism develops out of natural needs. A pilot draft of the materials was field-tested during the 1974-75 school year, revised, and field-tested in three schools the following year. A basic element of the curriculum which evolved from the testing and revision was the development of a skill workbook which employed principles of mastery learning. Nationwide field testing was accomplished during the 1976-77 school year. The final product is a course similar to a standard algebra course in much of the content, but with more emphasis on probability, statistics, and  applications of word problems. Results of field-testing in 20 schools indicated little differences in measures of achievement between project and non-project classes. Teacher attitudes were divided, almost evenly, into two groups--those who felt the course to be appropriate for first-year students, and those who felt it was too difficult or non-traditional.

Also of major interest was whether particular strategies would be more effective for students having different verbal-visual preferences, different levels of mathematics anxiety, and varying proportional reasoning ability. The design was a posttest only control group design. Subjects were 421 high school students drawn from 10 schools which ranged from rural/small town to metropolitan settings. Among other things, it was found that students of high mathematics anxiety scored  significantly lower than did students of low mathematics anxiety, and that students of high proportional reasoning ability scored higher than did students of low ability. Findings related to the aptitude by treatment interaction indicate that students with high mathematics anxiety and an absence of another aptitude (visual preference or proportional reasoning ability) profited by instructional methods that contained supportive material that was not mathematical in nature. In a series of followup interviews, it was determined, among other findings, that students who did not understand the chemistry concepts were unsuccessful in problem solving and that students who were more successful used more organizing skills and used mneumonic notation.

A questionnaire was developed to determine the continuing education needs of employees of several state transportation departments. Analysis of replies revealed several reasons for failure of the program: (1) preference for short intensive courses; (2) availability of on-campus evening courses; (3) preference by employees in remote  areas for specifically job oriented materials; and (4) more interest in undergraduate than graduate offerings.

        "description":"This is a report of a conference held in Bermuda in 1981 to discuss a multilateral approach to disarmament. The conference was an informal, off-the-record exchange of ideas and opinions among 24 diplomats and scholars from 18 countries and two international agencies. Participants considered current disarmament concepts, assessed UN disarmament mechanisms and procedures, and explored new approaches to this issue. Significant highlights of the report include the following recommendations. A summit meeting between the heads of state of the United States and the Soviet Union should be organized as soon as possible, before the end of 1981. Discussions should include a wide range of political issues but principal focus should be on reaching general agreement on the framework of  strategic arms limitation and reduction. An international group of experts should be created to determine whether parity in force levels between the Soviet Union and the United States exists. Nations should make stronger commitment to regional arms limitation and disarmament efforts. Existing multilateral disarmament machinery, both deliberative and negotiating mechanisms, needs to be streamlined and better coordinated. Greatly increased educational and public information efforts should be undertaken to build a more effective constituency for arms limitation and disarmament. Independent initiatives and temporary confidence building measures should be undertaken by nations to stimulate disarmament progress. (Author/RM)",

The activities were chosen to meet objectives of the New Mexico Basic Skills Plan. Although geared toward ninth-grade-level students, the activities can generally be adapted for students at different skill levels. The activities are organized into three major sections: 1) law including criminal law, juvenile law, individual rights law, students' rights and responsibilities, and court system; 2) government, its structure, and political process; and 3) consumer economics including consumer awareness, consumer redress, and money. Each self-contained activity has a cover page which describes the activity, suggestions for  where to use it in the curriculum, and explanations of the procedures for using it. A variety of teaching strategies are utilized--brainstorming, opinion polls/surveys, role-play situations, simulations, case studies, mock trials, and field trips. (Author/RM)",

Secondary level history and geography texts were the focus of the study. There are five chapters to the report: Background to the Study; American Criticisms of Soviet Textbooks; Soviet Criticisms of American Textbooks; Recommendations for the Revision of American and Soviet Textbooks; and Conclusions and Recommendations. The report's conclusions state that there are a few ways in which books in the two nations can be judged similarly deficient. Both American and Soviet textbooks tend to: glorify the accomplishments of their own nation and to denigrate the contributions of  others; feature the least attractive aspects of life in the other nation; emphasize political affairs and devote scant attention to social and cultural life in the other country; and to be written from a Cold War perspective. Recommendations made include the following. When treating a topic involving a dispute between the United States and the USSR, authors should include information about how the issue is interpreted in the other country. Authors should strive to use the most accurate up-to-date information. When discusssing disputes that have arisen over violations of treaties and other agreements, textbook authors should provide the texts of the relevant portions of agreements in the texts so that students can judge for themselves the extent of violations that have occurred. Emotional  and pejorative language should be avoided. Respect for the national traditions and customs of the other country should be encouraged. (Author/RM)",

The units of analysis were all 100 counties in North Carolina. Data for the dependent variable, male-female involvement in crime, were obtained from the North Carolina Police Information Network. The 1970 U.S. Census was the source of data on the control variables which consisted of population density, degree of urbanization, percent unemployed, percent nonwhite, percent of the population female, and female age structure. Analysis of the data indicates that sexual equality does not significantly reduce the male-female gap in criminal behavior. Female labor force participation, urbanization, and income level are more important factors. The counties with the lowest  male-female crime differentiation are characterized by high female force participation, low urbanization, and a high income level. (Author/RM)",

In each assessment, 9-, 13-, and 17-year-olds were administered exercises designed to measure some of their cognitive abilities and attitudes about music and some of their experiences with music. Some exercises from the first assessment were readministered in the second assessment so that changes in music achievement could be detected. Also, data were gathered on the music training background of students. Achievement results are presented for national populations of 9-, 13-, and 17-year-olds as well as for subpopulations defined by region of the country, sex, race/ethnicity, parental education, type of community, and grade  level. Some major findings from the report include the following. About three-fourths of the students at each age appear to have positive feelings about music and appear able to make simple judgments about it. Many students have some knowledge of the elements and expressive controls of music--52% of the 9-year-olds, 61% of the 13-year-olds, and 57% of the 17-year-olds. Knowledge about music history and style is less widespread--58% for 9-year-olds, 36% for 13-year-olds, and 39% for 17-year-olds. Fewer 9- and 17-year-olds were successful in answering their respective exercises in the two assessments. The decline between assessments for the 9-year-olds was 3.3%; for the 17-year-olds it was 2.5%. The percentage of 13-year-olds able to respond correctly to the music exercises was about 41% in  both assessments. Primary type of information provided by report: Results (Selective) (Change).",

Forty-seven social studies teachers and administrators from New York City area schools, participated in the program. The program consisted of one-day long presentations in 1979 on anthropology, sociology, political science, economics, and psychology and additional full-day conferences devoted to each of these disciplines scattered throughout the following year. Presentations were offered by teams consisting of a social scientist, an experienced teacher consultant, and the project director (a social  science educator). Workshop participants were involved in a wide variety of activities, including viewing and analyzing social science topics, evaluating various teaching techniques and materials (including major texts, projects, and National Science Foundation sponsored programs in the social sciences). Pre- and posttest workshop surveys were undertaken to determine teachers' and administrators' familiarity with social science materials, willingness to try new materials and methods in the classroom, projected success in implementing new ideas (pre-workshop survey), and impact of the workshop on participants (follow-up surveys). Findings indicated that teachers and administrators possessed little familiarity with innovative social studies materials at the beginning of the workshop and  that most teachers demonstrated an increase in awareness, familiarity, and intent to use new materials and teaching methods as a result of participation in the workshop.

        "description":"This paper presents the results of an evaluation study of a sex equity program designed to affect the achievement and attitudes of early adolescent students in the middle school. The Self-Concept and Decision-Making Middle School Curriculum Program at Florida State University developed sex equity curricular materials titled &quot;Decisions About Roles&quot; that can be infused directly into the middle school curriculum of math, science, language arts, physical education, and social studies. To determine the effectiveness of the program, both formative and summative evaluation procedures were used over two years. During the formative evaluation of the first year, all materials were field tested and student pre- and posttests were administered. The materials were revised as a result of the  feedback. The summative evaluation of the second year employed a pre- and posttest design to contrast the gain scores of the students participating in the program (experimental group) and those not exposed to the materials (comparison group) for five dependent measures. Six hundred and thirty students in grades six, seven, and eight at two experimental site schools and 234 students in the comparison school participated. Evaluation instruments administered are described in the paper. Results indicated that the program which includes a substantial social studies component had a significant effect on pupils' achievement, sex-role perceptions, and decision making. Participants made achievement gains in content areas; gained more egalitarian perceptions of occupational, school, and family  roles for females and males; expressed more androgynous self-concepts (girls only); and gained confidence in decision making.

The purpose was to help secondary social studies teachers in the Memphis, Tennessee area develop geography based activities dealing with concepts of urban spatiality. The project staff organized and publicized through brochures and news releases to newspapers the four-week summer program to be held at Memphis State University. Fifty-six public school teachers were selected and organized into ten planning and writing task forces. Each task force was assigned to one of the following ten social studies courses: Tennessee history; American history I; civics; economics I; introduction to social studies; American history II; American  political behavior; economics II; sociology; and social interaction. Teachers designed each instructional module so that it would coincide with specific chapters in each textbook. The modules developed utilized a problem-solving approach, involve community resource people, and contain a wide variety of teaching methods--for example, games, films, role playing, and labs. A teacher's manual to accompany the activities was also developed. The activity modules are not included in this report. Project evaluation shows many positive effects including improved public school-university relations and curriculum improvement. Included in the appendices are a list and definitions of geography concepts and the summer workshop agenda. (Author/RM)",

An exploration of personal time perspectives is a step toward establishing effective patterns of behavior. Productivity may be high in the morning and low in the late afternoon, for example, and organizing some activities to fit these energy curves relieves stress and permits a balance of personal and professional needs. In setting realistic and attainable goals, time may be used to develop actions and plans for achieving them. Since much of the school environment is time-governed or time-bound, it is important to know which aspects of school life and school time cannot be controlled. Working within these constraints and eliminating interruptions during  controlled school time produces a more effective use of time. It is important to plan and to understand personal priorities, and to follow through on these priorities before accepting new responsibilities. Knowing and using the support system available is essential in accomplishing work that must be done. Other supportive teachers, secretaries, principals, students, or parents are essential for good time management. Other suggestions for wise use of time are: concentration on the task at hand, learning not to procrastinate, and following through and finishing projects. A time management check-list is included. Three time management activities, designed to pinpoint areas of time waste, procrastination, and priority organization, are appended. (JD)",

Programs are not planned or implemented well, and teachers are generally not involved with or committed to the programs. To perform the necessary evaluations of the programs, the planning of inservice teacher education programs must involve needs assessment, the setting of measurable objectives, and delivery services linked specifically to the objectives. Once this model has been adopted, a number of evaluation concerns can be addressed. One evaluation approach requires the involvement of planners, presenters, and participants. The approach focuses on responses to five basic concerns of the inservice evaluator: (1) Was the content of the inservice  activity informative and useful to the participant?; (2) Was the presenter of the inservice activity effective?; (3) Was there an immediate change in the participants' behavior as defined by the stated objectives?; (4) Were there long term changes in classroom behaviors?; and (5) Did the students of the participants change as a result of altered teacher behavior? Each concern can be integrated into an evaluation instrument that is usable and is time and cost effective. Samples of evaluation forms used by schools are included in this paper along with a bibliography of 21 references to inservice education and evaluation. (FG)",

        "description":"Collaborative planning between the Southwest Educational Development Laboratory (SEDL) and a school district in central Texas provided concrete data to implement changes in inservice training programs for bilingual teachers. Five instruments were developed to obtain the attitudes of 108 teachers of kindergarten through fifth grade who taught Mexican American children who had limited English proficiency. The teachers were regular classroom teachers, bilingual teachers, or special education teachers. Among the findings from the study were that the areas of greatest need for inservice were in the teaching of reading and attending to behavior problems. Courses in the philosophy and theory of bilingual education were not desired. Teachers of English as a second language felt that the  existing inservice program could be improved by developing more and better materials. All of the teachers wanted more authority in choosing their inservice training activities. The teachers also agreed that they did not receive enough feedback and assistance in implementing new knowledge and skills. The director of bilingual education for the school district announced changes in both the bilingual inservice components and the English as a second language program as a result of the study. Sections of this report on the project present information on: (1) introduction to the study; (2) background of the school district; (3) collaborative relationship between the SEDL and the school district; (4) research strategy; (5) data analysis; (6) discussion of findings; and (7) changes made in the  inservice programs. Appended are the survey instruments and the findings in chart form. (FG)",

        "description":"A framework of concepts in nutrition, environmental factors, genetics, and human growth and development is presented as a background for developing elementary and secondary curricula on responsible childbearing. Aspects of the four subject areas are outlined for instruction at five education levels: preschool through kindergarten, primary, upper elementary, middle/junior high, and senior high. Each of the subject areas is discussed in relation to goals and key concepts. The key concepts covered in the chapter on nutrition include the importance of nutrition for everyone and especially for pregnant women, food preparation methods, and eating habits. Those concepts discussed in relation to environment are the dangers of drugs and chemicals, infectious diseases, pollution,  radiation, and the baby's delivery process. The concepts in the chapter on genetics include heredity and environment, and the causes and consequences of genetic disorders and birth defects. The chapter on human growth and development discusses developmental stages and the physical, emotional, and intellectual needs that affect human behavior and health. In the discussions of each topic, information is suggested as a basis for class discussion and instructional development. Each chapter is followed by a list of references. Charts indicate the recommended education level for teaching the key concepts. A final essay endorses the idea of action on the local level to make courses on responsible childbearing a part of the school curriculum. (FG)",

In focused interviews, they were asked their perceptions of the characteristics of their personal and professional development and of the major influences on that development. The teachers' experience ranged from 4 to 28 years. The most striking finding was the evidence for stages of teacher career development. The teachers described different characteristics during identifiable periods in their careers. Developmental changes seemed to occur in an ordered, hierarchical sequence with each year characterized by different types of changes. The changes occurred gradually and were cumulative. Distinct characteristics were displayed in the first year; the second, third,  and fourth years; and the fifth year and beyond. At each phase or stage, there seemed to be an increase of knowledge, leading to a change in attitude, which increased ability, and subsequently changed job performance. The major influences on professonal development were other teachers and prior contact with children. Recommendations arising from this study are provided in the areas of: research, undergraduate teacher education, graduate teacher education, inservice teacher education, and supervision and administration.

The relationships among partners in the arrangement are examined with a focus on linking mechanisms and boundary-spanning roles. The case study is made of the Statewide Teacher Center Network, and two of its constituent members, the Arcadia Teacher Center and the Three Rivers Teacher Center. All are located in a large, sparsely populated midwestern state. Each of the two centers acted as an intermediary, linking a college of education with surrounding school districts and counties. A description is given of the origins of the Statewide Teacher Center Network and of the Arcadia and Three  Rivers Centers. In describing the first two years of collaborations between these institutions, consideration is given to events and activities, available resources, objectives, key persons, barriers and facilitators, and the dynamics of interaction between the institutions. The present collaborative effort is examined, focusing on the main events and institutional context, structure and procedures, changes in objectives, and resource changes. A discussion is presented of the outcomes of the collaborative effort and possibilities for the future. Profiles are given of specific projects at the Arcadia and Three Rivers Centers.

The Office of Field Experiences (OFE), founded at Eastern State University's College of Education in the 1960s, formally collaborated with five school districts to establish either teacher centers or professional development centers. Each of these formal collaborations, involving exchanges of resources to establish and maintain the centers, constituted a district-level interorganizational arrangement (IOA). Coordinators of the centers attended monthly OFE meetings. Additionally, OFE held its own retreat, special events, and workshops. The OFE represented a holistic IOA which formally and regularly brought together the coordinators of the separate district level IOAs. Part  One of this case study presents a history of the IOA, its historical and institutional context, and the founding of the first centers. Part Two outlines the present configuration of the IOA, changes in objectives, key persons, resource changes, activities, barriers, facilitators, and dynamics between participants. Descriptions are also given of operations of the Cardon County Center and the Hanburg County Center. In Part Three, outcomes are described for the IOA as a whole and for the Cardon and Hanburg Centers. Another section presents a discussion of future possibilities for all units of the IOA. A presentation is given of three episodes which illustrate the interorganizational dynamics of the Eastern State University case. (JD)",

The history of the Eastern Private IOA, its roots in 1920, its founding, its decline, and its renewal in the 1940s are related. The institutional structure and procedures are described. Profiles of key personnel (graduate students, directors, school district superintendents, and a college president) are presented with descriptions of their individual activities and philosophies. In discussing the  IOA, analyses are made of key events, management activities, the Fellows Program, research and written production, intergroup differences, barriers to collaboration, and successful collaborative activities. The dynamics of the IOA are examined, in particular the areas of conflict and consensus, bargaining and exchange, linkages, and knowledge transfer between participating school districts and the college. The future of the network is examined, focusing on the future socioeconomic context, institutional patterns, staffing, changing objectives, and potential resources.

It probed further to determine if it was taking the test or studying for it or both which effected learning and retention if indeed such effects were replicable. Test type (multiple-choice and short answer) and item complexity (knowledge and concept) were also variables studied. Moving from the cognitive domain to the affective domain, this study focused on the students'  feelings when they did/did not have to study for and take a test. Analyses of the resulting data showed that students who studied for and took a test not only achieved more but also retained their learning longer than students who \"studied in order to learn than for a test.\" However, student ratings of construction were lower when students were tested.

By considering: (1) who will use the evaluation results; (2) what kinds of information are users likely to find most helpful; (3) in what ways might this information aid in program improvement; and (4) are the potential benefits substantial enough to justify the cost and effort of evaluation. The purpose is not to be a comprehensive technical manual, but rather to help local school personnel identify issues that might merit further examination and to guide the choice of suitable evaluation strategies to  address those issues. From the initial program review methods, citing the human resource requirement and procedures for conducting self-study and outside review, the document outlines quantative methods (such as structured process evaluation, product evaluation and process-product evaluation) and qualitative methods (investigative evaluation, ethnographic evaluation, and documentation) and lists reasons to choose a method and outlines how to implement the plan. The underlying theme would have the reader use this as a springboard for beginning evaluation. (CE)",

        "description":"This resource book examines the value-added model approach when used in assessing early childhood Title I (ECT-I) programs. The evaluation design must be able to separate program effects from natural maturation. The basic idea behind the value-added model builds on the notion of natural maturation. The major strengths are that it does not require a comparison group or the use of a norm referenced test. The major weaknesses are its usefulness only for the assessment of skills or attributes which show a natural development with age over the duration of the program. Selection procedures may disguise the relationship between age and skill development among a particular group of program participants. Finally, it can require complex statistical calculations. This method attempts to  derive a great deal of information from a situation with little data and little external control. The validity of results from the value-added model may be questioned in situations where one wishes to assess the short-term impact of an ECT-I program and the available sample size is relatively small. A possible solution is pooling data across multiple years of the program or across several sites that are implementing similar activities. (DWH)",

        "description":"By 1985, nearly half of the nation's public school students will be required to pass a minimum competency test (MCT) for high school graduation. Supporters of objectives underlying the MCTs suggest that the tests will force school systems to take their responsibilities to all children more seriously. Critics argue that students who fail will become scapegoats for school system failure, with few, if any, new efforts made to meet their needs. The purpose of this study was to examine the validity of the critics' argument. For students who fail MCTs, are remedial services provided to help them pass the tests on later attempts and, if so, who is paying for these services? Analysis of data collected from thirteen states chosen for having an MCT program statewide, underway at survey  time, and MCT results determining high school graduation eligibility, revealed that most students failing the MCT the first time and remain in school eventually meet the competency requirements. Nevertheless, not all students pass, and failure rates are higher among minority students than among nonminority students. Potential problems were identified relating to the &quot;required by law,&quot;&quot;proportionate share,&quot; and &quot;comparability&quot; provisions of Title I in a section on funding remedial activities.

Comparisons between the testing procedures were made across five content areas in an introductory biology course from tests administered to volunteers. The criterion was the student's standing in the course, based on examinations and laboratory grades. Results showed adaptive tests resulted in mastery classifications more consistent with final class standing than those obtained from conventional test. This result was observed within individual content areas and for discriminant analysis classifications made across content areas. This result was also observed for two scoring procedures used with the conventional tests. Results  indicated that there was no decrement in the performance of the adaptive test when a variable termination rule was implemented. Further analyses shows that the adaptive tests administered differed from the conventional test for each content area as a function of achievement level. This evidence was used to explain why the adaptive tests resulted in more valid decisions than the conventional procedure. Variable-length adaptive mastery tests can provide more valid mastery classifications than \"optimal\" conventional mastery tests while reducing test length an average of 80% from the length of conventional tests.

The SDQ, along with measures of attributions and academic achievement, was administered to primary school students from two quite diverse populations. Separate factor analyses of responses from the two groups were quite similar and clearly demonstrated the seven factors that the SDQ is designed to measure. The small correlations among the different dimensions were similar for the two groups and consistent with the hierarchical structure in Shavelson's model. Consistent and predictable correlations were also observed between the different self-concept dimensions and: (1) attributions of responsibility for  academic outcomes; (2) academic achievement; and (3) the sex of the student. Somewhat smaller sex differences were observed for students who attended single-sex classes suggesting that they might be using a different reference group in forming their self-concepts. Overall, these findings provide compelling support for Shavelson's model of self-concept and the construct validity of the SDQ. (Author)",

        "description":"The professional orientation difference approach was operationalized as a stress on the importance of intellectual activity, autonomy, service and influence, with de-emphasis on the monetary, prestige, security and human relations aspects of a job. As a difference score, the index was subject to special reliability problems. This analysis identified six factors associated with the index. These included importance of expressiveness, learning, human relations, advancement, job security, and influence/prestige. Criterion variables were used to test the validity of these factors as professional orientation components. The influence/prestige factor was positively related to experience, organizational involvement, and management job activity variables. The advancement, job security,  and learning factors were negatively related to education, experience, and organizational involvement. Expressiveness was unrelated to the criterion variables, while human relations was negatively related to income. The author concluded a traditional difference score approach to a professional orientation measure was unreliable. Results argue for a temporal notion of the professionalization process assuming that an orientation toward human relations, advancement, security, and prestige job aspects may be a necessary prelude to a stress on autonomy, expertise, service, and commitment. The validity of a particular professional orientation measure should not be automatically assumed. (Author/DWH)",

Each question contained two evaluative alternatives from which children selected in responding to the questions. The results supported the hypothesis that three- to five-year-old children are more likely to choose latter response alternatives than are six- to eight-year-old children. Topic word abstractness was not found to influence children's use of the recency response set. In six- to eight-year-old children, understanding of the topic word concept was related to the frequency  with which latter response alternatives were chosen.

These were randomly sampled, systematically sampled, and selected data sets. The evaluative criteria used were fidelity of parameter estimation, asymptotic ability estimates, root-mean-square error of estimates, and the correlation between true and estimated ability. Test length appeared more important to calibration effectiveness than sample size. Efficiency analyses suggested that increases in test length were several times as effective in improving calibration efficiency as proportionate increases in calibration sample sizes. The asymptotic ability analyses suggested that the linking procedures based on Bayesian ability  estimation were more effective. The equivalent-tests method was no better than not linking. Bayesian scoring procedures were slightly superior to the others tested. Efficiency loss due to linking error was less than that due to item calibration error. Test length and sample size had a definite effect on calibration efficiency but no strong effects appear with respect to linking efficiency. For the systematically sampled data set, the anchor-test method produced the most efficient item pools in terms of linking efficiency. Bayesian scoring was preferred over the maximum likelihood scoring procedure. (Author/DWH)",

The purpose of literacy assessment must be established before selecting the appropriate instrument. The criteria to be considered are usability, validity, and reliability. The decisions to be made before a specific test or assessment approach are identified relate to the categories of literacy, the purpose for testing, the uses and users of test results, examinee characteristics and logistics. General guidelines for reviewing existing  published or unpublished tests are examined. These include preliminary screening and technical quality review. Assessment of everyday literacy activities may be determined through the use of one of several published tests designed for this purpose. Assessment of on-the-job literacy is usually limited to tests of clerical ability.

The hypotheses to be investigated were that the effects of small group learning on student achievement are produced by students' participation in group interaction, and in the providing and receiving of higher-order explanations. High and low ability students are more often involved in this process than other students. A treatment and control group of fifth grade students completed ability and attitude pretests. The treatment group was trained in small group interaction. All students received regular mathematics classroom instruction. They worked on assignments in mixed ability groups of four students. Achievement, retention and  attitude toward mathematics were assessed. A Mann-Whitney comparison showed that trained students participated in more task related interaction than control students. The effects of small group interaction depend on the ability level of the students. Interaction during small group work was most beneficial for low ability students. The study showed they can help themselves by teaching others. A high quality of interaction must prevail if the small group method is to be of maximal effectiveness. (Author/DWH)",

Focusing on the framework of economic and social factors that affect the inner-city white adolescent, the report attempts to integrate this information with available mental health studies related to drug taking behaviors. The results from the National Polydrug Study which differentiated drug use by race are presented. In addition, the report reviews data gathered by the National Center for Urban Ethnic Affairs on white ethnic drug abuse. These two studies provide data on types of drugs used, frequency of use, sex and age of users, and use by each ethnic group. The report concludes that rates of drug use among white ethnic adolescents are as high as among non-whites. (Author/APM)",

        "description":"A longitudinal analysis of the records of performance of cohorts of minority and nonminority students in two different undergraduate settings was used to determine the predictive validity of admissions tests and school rank in determining long range and short range outcomes for college students. It was also hypothesized that the performance of minority students would improve as the college record accumulates. The results showed that substantial across-cohort increases in average grades relative to average ability levels were greater for minority students in the college setting. Consequently, in later cohorts, minority and nonminority students were less sharply differentiated by their average grades than were their counterparts in earlier cohorts, and grade point average trends  suggested the possibility of \"late blooming.\" The report slates that the results did not explain the increases in average grades across cohorts and suggest that increases in the average level of grades awarded across cohorts did not necessarily reflect increases or invariances in the average quality or quantity of academic achievement. The report also states that admissions variables were valid success predictors for both minority and nonminority students. The ambiguity of these findings are said to further point to the need for special consideration of problems involved in setting and maintaining standards for evaluation of student achievement in future, comparative across-cohort studies.

The community studied consisted of three villages located about 20 miles from Kuala Lumpur. Forty child profiles were obtained through interviews with 32 families. The questionnaire for profiles of children less than two years old was based on Carey's temperament questionnaire, developed from studies by Thomas and Chess. The Thomas and Chess Parent and Teacher Questionnaire was used for the profiles of the older children. Results revealed that some of the components of temperament showed similar  distributions to those reported for American samples in previous studies while other components showed striking differences between the samples. In the Malay sample, 62.5 percent of the children were classified as easy temperament types, 7.5 percent as difficult, 7.5 percent as slow to warm up and 22.5 percent as mixed types. Malay parents reported sensory thresholds as being low for 72.5 percent of the children studied. Distractability scores were high. Approach and adaptability scores seemed comparable to those in the American groups. Regularity scores were somewhat affected by the practice of feeding children when they were hungry. In conclusion, some of the cultural differences in childrearing that affect the interpretation of a temperament questionnaire are discussed.  (Author/RH)",

Participant observation and related methods were conducted for two days a week (on average) in a small, traditional parochial school located in a lower-class integrated neighborhood in a large eastern city. In addition, the ecology of the children's groups and the organization of the school were investigated. It was found that second-grade children displayed only facsimiles of group structures: the group in the second-grade classroom was found to be an overlapping collection of friendships. By eighth grade, true groups came into existence. Among girls, rival groups formed within the class, and status was  partially conferred by group membership. As the eighth-grade children progressed from grade to grade they were seen by adult personnel as having mature group concepts and coalition dynamics, which they did not in fact possess. The school inadvertently encouraged an eighth-grade collective to turn itself into a hostile coalition by labeling it a &quot;clique.&quot; As a consequence, the &quot;clique&quot; learned what the functions of a group were supposed to be and promptly became a self-proclaimed adversary group with a full complement of criterial group features. Piagetian principles and related research were helpful in interpreting the children's group behavior. (Author/RH)",

Classroom observations were conducted by pairs of observers: one observer recorded information about the activity structure and behavior setting; the second observer used a strict time-sampling rotation method to study a subset of eight children in each classroom. In the analysis only instructional (as opposed to transitional) segments were examined. The data base consisted of 461 math segments and 474 social studies segments. The frequency distributions of various ecological features of segments were  examined; a chi-square test compared frequencies across subject matters. A similar analysis involving mean durations of segments with different properties and mean occupancy time (length X the number of students in the segment) was performed using ANOVA procedures. Results indicated that math and social studies classes differed with regard to distributions of instructional formats. Overall, more variety in format was found in social studies than in math.

        "description":"As part of a year-long sociolinguistic study of pupil and teacher perceptions of classroom discourse, this study examined the possible effects of pupil status variables on pupil attention patterns. Subjects were 164 children and their teachers in six second, third, and fourth grade classrooms in a lower socioeconomic, multiethnic elementary school. To determine attention patterns, six teacher-planned language arts lessons were videotaped in each classroom over the course of the year. These lessons were played back in short segments on the same day to pupils who had participated in the lessons. Pupils were then individually asked at the end of each videotaped segment, &quot;What did you hear anybody saying in that part of the lesson?&quot; Each response was recorded verbatim on a 3 x 5  card, and the question, &quot;What did you hear...&quot; was repeated until the pupil could think of no more responses. A computer program was developed to compute mean ratios of attention for each pupil based on each of six pupil status variables. These variables were sex, ethnicity (Mexican-American, Anglo-American, Blacks, Asians, Portuguese, and Native Americans), entering reading achievement (as measured by the Metropolitan Achievement Test), status with peers (measured by a sociometric test), and teacher perceptions of pupils' communicative behavior in the classroom. In general, data demonstrated that for the pupils of this study there were identifiable attention patterns which appeared to relate to each of the status variables. (Author/MP)",

All subjects were first given the Twenty Statements Test (TST), an instrument recognizing 20 answers to the questions, &quot;Who am I?&quot;, and were then individually administered three of the four Piagetian tasks designed to measure levels of concrete and formal thought. The statements from the TST protocols were content analyzed into 32 categories (such as activities, possessions, interpersonal  feelings and attitudes, kinship roles, sense of competence, moral worth, and existential aspect). Results of chi-square tests indicated significant increases, decreases, and curvilinear changes for both the age level and the cognitive-developmental level analyses. Results further indicated that researchers must be careful about treating age and cognitive-developmental level as equivalent factors. The hypothesis that the self-concept becomes increasingly differentiated with age was supported by neither the age nor the cognitive-developmental level analysis.

Specifically, the report reviews three dimensions of federal child care activities: programs and policies whose primary purpose is to assist families with child care; the provision of child care as part of major federal employment, training, and education programs; and the considerations given to child care by the federal government in its equal opportunity laws and in its role as an employer. Drawing on published journal articles and research reports, government documents, interviews with government officials, and interviews with other experts, the analysis attempts to clarify the extent to which these child  care activities and policies frustrate the federal goal of equal opportunity for women. It is argued that although the development of equal opportunity policies over the last 15 years by federal statutes, court decrees, and agency actions has produced notable gains in women's labor force participation and educational enrollment, federal government's goal of equal opportunity for women has not been realized. Women as workers and students, especially minority women, continue to be disadvantaged when compared with men; women have considerably more difficulty in securing employment and are much less likely than men to complete college or to receive advanced job training. An appeal is made for changes in those policies and programs that restrict women's equal opportunity.  (Author/MP)",

Previous studies have suggested that any ambiguous stimulus configuration might be effective if the child can be led to perceive it as his mother. After being separated from their mothers, 48 children (20 to 30 months old) were given either an unrecognizable or a sharply focused photograph of their mother to carry with them in an unfamiliar playroom. A female escort either correctly identified the photograph for the child (\"this is a picture of your mother\") or mislabeled it as a picture of a stranger (\"this is a picture of Mrs. Jane Smith\"), or gave it no verbal label. Children were observed for 5 minutes and  the durations of the time they spent playing with toys, gazing at the photograph, or holding the photograph were recorded. All instances of spontaneous verbal labeling of the photograph were also recorded. Results indicated that those children who were presented with a clear photograph of their mother not only held, looked at, and spontaneously identified the picture more than did children with an unrecognizable image, but that they also played, explored, and remained in the playroom longer. These results suggest that adjustment during necessary separations such as day care and hospitalization may be enhanced by providing young children with a photograph of their mother. (Author/MP)",

        "description":"By following the Washington Small Schools Curriculum format of listing learning objectives with recommended grade placement levels and suggested activities, monitoring procedures, and resources used in teaching, this music curriculum for grades K-3 encourages teacher involvement and decision making. Goals for the program focus on the student, encouraging each to value the study of music and recognize its usefulness, to participate in the performance of music, to create musical expression and to listen to music. Moving (rhythm), singing (melody), playing, sharing, creating and listening are the major concepts around which the curriculum is built. Rhythm activities stress beat, duration, accent, meter, tempo and response. Singing exercises emphasize melody, pitch, chords, intervals  and scales. Playing instruction includes introductions to the science of sound, instruments and environmental sounds. Sharing involves acquiring appropriate performance behavior and valuing the personal satisfaction resulting from musical performance. Creating focuses on structure and composition. Listening explores appreciation, mood and expression and careers. Included in a final section are song samples, patterns, devised notation, song and listening lists, a bibliography and a discography.

Chapter 1, Color, presents painter's terms, growth characteristics of 5-12-year-olds and their implications for art, and activities focusing on the color wheel and mixing and identifying color. Chapter 2, Line, emphasizes the variety and properties of line in creating pattern, texture, shape, rhythm and depth. Chapter 3, Pattern, suggests activities, including burlap weaving, vegetable prints, flags, magazine mosaics and beadwork, to study pattern. Chapter 4, Texture, stresses the difference  between tactile and visual textures. Chapter 5, Shape and Form, examines the difference between shape (two-dimensional) and form (three-dimensional) using rope tricks, beans and macaroni, snowflake transparencies, egg cartons, etc. Chapter 6, Composition, considers the arrangement of space through placement and size, choice of shape, and use of form, pattern and color. Chapter 7, Resources, includes guidelines for encouraging creativity, use of books, plans for visual arts centers, wet and dry techniques, and where to look for materials. The guide also provides chapter and subject bibliographies. (NEC)",

Along the way they will manipulate ideas and materials and, to a great extent, exercise control over their own effort. They can be questioned in such a way as to suggest relationships not previously recognized or have their attention directed to unnoticed events.\" The curriculum is divided into seven scope areas: change, cycles, energy, environment, organisms, property of matter, and symmetry. Activities presented enable the student to:  identify changes in plants and animals due to maturation; notice daily weather changes; understand seasonal changes; describe different forms of energy used in daily experience; classify things as living or non-living, plant or animal; and group objects according to color, shape, weight, size and texture. Observing, discussing, poetry and story writing, chart keeping, scrapbook making and arranging teacher-supplied pictures in sequential order are suggested as monitoring techniques.

This curriculum, developed during 1975 and 1976 by teachers and administrators at local, regional and state levels and used as a pilot program in 20 small school districts in the state, has been designed to allow districts to personalize the materials to meet their own educational programs. Additionally, suggested activities, monitoring procedures, and resources used in teaching the sequenced objectives are identified and correlated to 10 Goals for Washington Common Schools and to 7 broad K-12 social  studies program goals. Five major subject areas with learning objectives are included: myself and others; families; communities; land and people; and map and globe skills. Within each subject area are sections (28 in all) describing suggested activities in detail. Definitions of terms and discussions of format and student learning objectives are also presented. (AW)",

        "description":"An unexpected demographic development in the United States in the 1970's was the shift of nonmetropolitan areas to net inmigration, reversing a 70-year trend. Using the 1970 definition of metropolitan, the percent of the population living in metropolitan areas fell from 69% in 1970 to 67.8% in 1978. No easily identifiable set of reasons explained a majority of moves between metropolitan areas, between nonmetropolitan counties, or between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan destinations. While 53.1% heads of household moving from metropolitan areas to non-adjacent nonmetropolitan counties reported employment-related reasons, such reasons accounted for less than one half of the migration within the entire U.S. Family-related reasons explained between 15.6% and 19.4% of the four types  of migration, and various housing and neighborhood considerations explained another 7.1% to 15.8% of moves. The momentum to population growth in the nonmetropolitan sector resulted from the interaction of net migration and natural increase. Net inmigration of persons in their reproductive years may boost rates of natural increase in later periods, causing nonmetropolitan areas to continue to have high rates of population growth. At present the U.S. is still metropolitanizing, but only because of population growth in nonmetropolitan areas and their fusion into existing adjacent metropolitan areas. (NEC)",

        "description":"The problem of securing funds to support programs for the young handicapped child is a major one for rural service providers. The process of securing funds from within the rural community itself should include nine steps: (1) defining the needy; (2) determining responsibility; (3) identifying resources; (4) considering the message; (5) choosing the targets; (6) building the fund raising team; (7) developing public relations strategies; (8) executing the fund raising event(s), i.e., walk-a-thons, cook-offs, auctions, square dances, arts and crafts shows, contests, fashion shows; and (9) evaluating the results. State funds may be available, but to secure the funds for rural programs may require that program directors: develop a knowledge of their state; project an image of  competence, dependability, and enthusiasm; disseminate information about their project; create an advisory council; and diversify sources of funding or coordinate services. The $47.7 billion contributed to philanthropic causes in 1980 provides positive incentive for programs to solicit private contributions from individuals (as bequests or deferred giving), corporations (including corporate matching gifts and employee group-giving within corporations), and foundations.

The GAO review was limited to 11 colleges funded in 1980 plus the Navajo Community College. GAO found discrepancies in the full-time equivalent Indian student counts reported by 10 of the 11 colleges. GAO noted that the colleges had not required adequate evidence that all students were eligible Indians, had not maintained  up-to-date enrollment data, or had made counting errors. While college officials were unanimous in their support of the act's concept, they raised issues concerning its implementation and funding. Their concerns involved reduction in funds, failure to count Indian students not members of federally recognized tribes, BIA delays in certifying that students are Indians, the formula used for computing full-time equivalent Indian students, the cutoff date for computation, lack of funds for needed college activities, and funding of the Navajo Community College.

The weighted sample included 272 agricultural economics majors, 1,328 majors in production sciences, and 2,801 agriculture students. Of the three groups analyzed, agricultural economics majors were more likely to have farm backgrounds, education/work experience in agriculture, and greater commitment to careers in production agriculture; parents had primary influence in choice of major. Agricultural economics majors perceived themselves as being  friendlier and more altruistic, more sure of their career orientation, more seriously concerned with the state of the nation and the world, and more willing to accept new ideas than other agriculture students relative to non-agriculture students. Implications for education included probable increases in agricultural enrollment, particularly from among students lacking farm backgrounds/experiences, and thus a challenge for agricultural faculty to use experiential learning programs (cooperative arrangements, internships), expose students lacking farm experience to knowledge of occupational alternatives in agriculture, and augment curricula to compensate for agricultural deficiencies in student background.

The study  documented the increased number of women seeking admittance to the veterinary profession and broad acceptance of female participation in the profession. Many pre-veterinary students lacked farm and agricultural experience. Very few of them were black or of other minority groups. A vast majority of pre-veterinary students, regardless of sex, residence, or minority status, possessed largely positive attitudes toward agriculture and the agricultural industry.

Data from two universities and two community colleges in each of two states (California, Texas) were used because of high concentrations of Chicanos living there. In 1976, Hispanics comprised 5.29% of U.S. population, 15.9% of California population and 20.78% of Texas population. Chicanos represented 2.9% of U.S. public university full-time enrollment, 6.4% of U.S. two-year enrollment; 7.15% of California state college and university and 8.8% of Texas public senior college and university enrollment; and  10.15% of California and 16.57% of Texas community college enrollment. National data from two-year and four-year institutions indicated that Hispanics had significantly higher attrition rates that non-Hispanics. The percentage of degrees earned by Hispanics at all levels was disproportionately lower than the percentage Hispanics represented in the total population. A major finding was that data collected by national, state and local institutions were neither comparable or compatible, something of importance in a system where numerical counts determine decisions concerning allocation of courses, faculty, student services, and scholarships.

        "description":"Cultural and language differences of the elderly Hispanic population and socioeconomic and health problems which afflict them disproportionately represent a unique and difficult challenge to public and private service providers. Information from various federal agencies provided material for a report examining demographic characteristics, living arrangements, marital status, housing tenure, income, poverty, employment status, education, and health of the Hispanic elderly. In 1980, about 791,000 persons of Spanish origin (Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, and others) 60 years of age and over represented 2% of the 33 million persons in this age group in the United States. In March 1979, over 83% of older Hispanics lived in metropolitan areas; about 80% lived  in a family setting; half of them had completed 6.7 or fewer years of schooling. In 1978 the per capita income in Hispanic families with 65+ heads ($3,749) was only 64% as high as in non-Hispanic families ($5,898); 23% of elderly Hispanics had incomes below the poverty level. The health of the elderly Hispanic population was apparently poorer than that of persons of all races in the same age group, but older Hispanics were less likely to visit doctors or dentists or to be hospitalized.

Part I of this report discusses two studies that examine the relationship between mathematics achievement (including computation, algebra, and geometry) and visual-spatial skill. The results of the two studies indicated that visual skill and spatial orientation skill are somewhat distinct and both contribute to predicting mathematics achievement. Further research examining the development and  trainability of these skills is promoted. Part II focuses on visual-spatial training research that was carried on in 1977-1980. The 1979-1980 investigation is the focus, with the two earlier years of work ending with negative results. This earlier work is documented in the hope that others may profit in reading about these experiences and conclusions. (MP)",

One thousand ninety-seven algebra story problems were selected from nine standard algebra textbooks. These are divided into eight families based on the nature of the source formula involved; for example, nearly 300 problems were classified in the &quot;time rate family&quot; because they were based on the source formula, &quot;distance = rate x time&quot; or &quot;output = rate x time.&quot; Each family was divided into problem categories based on the general form of the story line; for example, the time rate family consisted of &quot;motion,&quot;&quot;current,&quot; and &quot;work&quot; categories. Each category was divided into templates based on the specific propositional structure of  the problem; for example, there were a dozen templates for motion problems such as &quot;overtake,&quot;&quot;closure,&quot;&quot;round trip,&quot; etc. This paper describes the procedure for generating families, categories, and templates and provides frequency counts for each observed template. Implications for fostering productive research and instruction are discussed. (Author)",

Results indicated that &quot;relational propositions&quot; (such as &quot;the rate in still water is 12 mph more than the rate of the current&quot;) were more difficult to remember than &quot;assignment propositions&quot; (such as &quot;the cost of candy is $1.70 per pound&quot;), problems with relational propositions were much harder to reproduce in coherent form than problems with assignment propositions, subjects were far more likely to convert a relation into an assignment than vice versa, and in making up problems subjects tended to use assignment propositions more than  relational propositions at a ratio of 25 to 1. In addition, subjects showed a knowledge of problem schemas by recalling relevant information much better than irrelevant details, recalling high frequency problem forms better than low frequency forms, converting problems from low to high frequency forms, and by constructing problems that matched standard textbook forms.

        "description":"Recent research on human memory and cognition with particular emphasis on research that might have some promise for mathematics education is reviewed. The focus is on techniques for analyzing the mind in two areas: (1) the architecture of the human memory system, using the information processing model; and (2) the content and structure of knowledge that a student brings to a problem, using the comprehension, schema, process, and strategy models. The document describes each of these models in separate sections, along with some recent findings by researchers using each analysis technique. It is felt that to understand mathematics learning and problem solving, one must understand both the hardware (e.g., the information processing model) and software (e.g., comprehension, schema,  process, and strategy models) that a pupil brings to a task. Promising signs are seen that there will be a continuing &quot;fruitful interaction&quot; between the needs of the mathematics classroom and the development of analytic theories in cognitive psychology.

        "description":"The development of a theory of algebraic problem solving is discussed. The domain of the investigation is restricted to single sentence word problems. There were three experiments, the first involving 42 college students from the University of California, Santa Barbara. These subjects were divided into two groups, half in an equation group and half in a word group. The results of experiment one suggested that the solution process used by subjects in the equation group involves planning, while the translation and solution process of the word group does not show the same sort of planning. A second experiment was conducted using another group of 42 students, with half writing a numerical answer for each word problem, and the other writing an equation for each problem. Both groups  displayed a pattern of performance similar to that displayed by the word group in in experiment one. A supplemental study was conducted to provide additional data on the problem-solving process of subjects, through interviews of eight college students. Evidence was provided that equation subjects engage in goal stacking. Results conflicted with a two-stage model of problem solving consisting of separate translation and solution processes. (MP)",

The following issues are addressed: (1) the national picture of the future supply of physicians; (2) physical supply in the south; (3) distribution of physicians; (4) increasing the number of black physicians in the south; (5) strategies for distributing physicians; and (6) issues in financing medical education. As a result of the near doubling of enrollments in the medical schools of the South and the reversal of the traditional out-migration of young physicians, the region is faced with the certainty of a surplus of physicians by 1990 and  beyond, especially in the surgical specialities. Projections show that despite the overall surplus, problems will still remain in the distribution of physicians to rural areas, inner city areas, primary care specialties, and public agencies. Shortages of black physicians in proportion to the part of the population that is black will also continue. (JN)",

The diffusion approximation is used for the calculation of neutron transport. Collision probabilities are used to calculate the effect of heterogeneous lattices of fuel and moderator on resonance absorption and slow neutron disadvantage factors. In this module, the three major problems of neutron diffusion in slow neutron fission reactors are reviewed. An energy-dependent diffusion equation, steady state epithermal multi-group equations, and a slow neutron  diffusion equation are introduced. The structure and organization of the remaining eight modules are outlined. These modules are intended to supplement textbooks and other lecture material generally available to students in their course work. It is assumed that students are familiar with elementary nuclear structure, neutron-nuclei interactions, and introductory material on fission chain reactors. (Author)",

        "description":"To shed light on the question of whether college geography students should be and/or are being instructed about the history and philosophy of geography, a survey was undertaken to determine the educational objectives and practices of geography educators. Approximately 215 American and Canadian geographic educators and chairpersons of geography departments were asked to respond to questions regarding the desirability of offering a course on the history and philosophy of geography and regarding the availability and status of a history and philosophy course in various degree programs. Findings indicated that most respondents regarded a history and philosophy course as unimportant in an undergraduate program, somewhat important in a masters program, and quite important in a doctoral  program. However, many departments of geography do not offer history and philosophy of geography courses at any level because of a variety of reasons, including lack of interest among students and faculty, lack of professional expertise among faculty on the topic, and lack of funds to develop a new course. The author claims that this lack of interest and expertise in the history and philosophy of geography threatens the capability of the discipline to educate properly. Reasons offered for the importance of the topic include that it is intellectually challenging, promotes self-awareness and identity among geography students, and alleviates students' confusion due to existing and emerging paradigms of thought and explanation within the discipline of geography.

In this survey, special emphasis was placed on the rate of development of the assumed political attitudes, the age and grade level of the emergence of clear political preferences, variations between ethnic and religious groups in rate of development, and sex differences. The hypothesis was that flags would be symbolic of political attitudes because they are important indicators of identification with political, religious, and social causes. The sample consisted of 1,541 males and females (ages seven through 18) in Israel and the West Bank. The group represented Christians, Moslems, nonorthodox Jews, and  Orthodox Jews (Israel); and Christians and Moslems (West Bank). The survey was based on projective responses to questions about the attractiveness of 20 flags in four categories--flags of Israel and her neighbors, other Middle Eastern countries, world powers with important concerns in the Middle East, and other countries not strongly identified with the Middle East. Students were directed to pick the most attractive flag, then the next most attractive, until all flags were chosen. Findings indicated that all children had a fairly sophisticated judgment of key flags by the age of seven, Israeli Christians differentiated flags early but changed preferences as they became older, Jewish children tended to develop flag sophistication somewhat earlier than average, West Bank children tended to  develop this sophistication somewhat later, and sex differences were greatest among Jews. The conclusion is that political attitudes can be measured by a projective instrument such as the flag scale. (DB)",

        "description":"Recent studies have shown wind power to be an eminently practical and potentially substantial source of electricity and direct mechanical power. Wind machines range from simple water-pumping devices made of wood and cloth to large electricity producing turbines with fiberglass blades nearly 300 feet long. Wind is in effect a form of solar energy--approximately two percent of the sunlight that falls on the earth's surface is converted to the kinetic energy of wind through a system in which warm and cool air move in different patterns. Wind power, which was first considered by planners and the business community as a serious power source only after the oil embargo in 1973, is already an economically attractive source of energy in many regions. It has been estimated that  approximately one million mechanical wind pumps are in use today, predominantly in Argentina, Australia, and the United States. To help realize the full potential of wind power technology, several developments are necessary, including new designs which can operate in the often harsh conditions of developing nations and an increased infrastructure that includes a market for spare parts and repair services. The conclusion is that wind power and other renewable energy sources can make a substantial contribution to energy needs in the near future. The implication is that governments should continue to fill wind power research gaps and should increase support of development efforts. (DB)",

The basic educational system consists of a preschool level of at least one year; a general basic education level of nine years (divided into three cycles of three years duration each--the first two cycles represent elementary education and the third cycle completes a student's general education); a more advanced level of two or three years duration, offering options such as health, fine arts, media, sciences and letters, business, industry, and agriculture; and the final level of higher education, which includes preparation of varying duration for professional careers. Funds to administer the educational system are provided by the General National  Budget Law. In 1976, the education budget, excluding supplementary budgets for higher educational institutions, represented over 29% of the national budget. Costa Rica's educational philosophy reflects the nation's historic dedication to orderly constitutional government, democratic principles, and human rights. Tangible evidence of this philosophy can be found in Costa Rica's literacy rate of 90%--one of the highest in Latin America. The educational system is administered in accordance with policy determined at the national level by the Higher Council of Education and executed by the Minister of Education. Teacher education, a part of the higher education system, varies according to the curriculum and objectives of the three public universities. Currently, efforts are being made to  coordinate educational planning at all levels so that Costa Rica's limited resources will be used to the best advantage. (DB)",

The intent of the study is to offer documentation and analysis of successful fund raising activities to other nonprofit, voluntary community groups which are interested in seeking financial support for their activities. Information is presented in six major parts. Part I discusses factors which community groups should consider in selecting the most appropriate fund raisers. Information is presented on targeting the amount of money the group wishes to earn, analyzing the make-up of the community, and identifying talents of community group members. Part II describes steps involved in planning fund raising, including preparation time, allocation of  responsibilities, and selection of a date for the fund raising event. Part III focuses on publicizing fund raising events. Part IV describes fund raising events of nine Seattle community groups. Details are presented on selecting, planning, publicizing, implementing, and evaluating the events. Part V offers a list of successful fund raising activities of 16 additional Seattle community groups. The final section contains a discussion of how a system of collecting dues from members of community groups can serve as a means of raising funds. The document concludes with an appendix which presents the 50-item questionnaire on which case studies in the report are based. (DB)",

The intent is to provide information to other neighborhood and community groups on successful citizen activism strategies. In the opening section, a chronology of events is presented to detail the process by which Montlake came to see the R.H. Thompson Expressway a threat. Information is presented on planning commission statements, highway department announcements, freeway-related bond issues, statements in favor of and opposed to the freeway, court hearings, and media coverage. The second section analyzes events discussed in the chronology, with emphasis on approaches within the anti-freeway effort  which were particularly successful. Topics discussed include the mobilizing ideology of the anti-freeway coalition, techniques used to organize home-owners in the proposed freeway corridor, political characteristics of anti-freeway activists, and application of lessons learned in the Montlake experience to other citizen participation efforts. Appended materials include maps of Seattle and the Montlake community area, copies of newspaper clippings, special bulletins related to the controversy over freeway construction, and an artist's conception of the proposed freeway.

These objectives are: (1) to prepare people to live according to a productive work ethic in which work and leisure pursuits are balanced; (2) to instill in students a life ethic in which individual identity is balanced with concern for others; and (3) to imbue students with a service ethic based on the realization that there is obligation beyond self-interest. To accomplish these objectives, educators must first help students break down their preconceptions and attitudes of certainty about what the future will bring. Specific issues with which educators should be concerned within the framework of these objectives include  individuality vs. collectivity, routine vs. novelty, global identity vs. local preoccupation, work vs. play, aggression vs. submission, and justice vs. mercy. One way educators can help students stop being concerned with various doomsday concepts and begin creating alternative futures is to help them share in the vision that alternate futures can actually be created. Educators will be successful in these endeavors if they help students assert a common values framework (based on the service ethic, the life ethic, and the work ethic), and if they help students realize that they will be better prepared for the future if they restore balance and moderation to thinking and action.

The projects are intended to awaken students to the realization that history is all around them. The projects utilize the community as a source of learning, assume that the basic motivation for studying the past is essentially personal, emphasize ethnicity, and, for the most part, involve students in out of school research activities. The ideas are general and require the teacher to adjust or adapt them to particular grade levels. Some examples of project suggestions follow. Students research and write their school history. The teacher obtains a set of  topographic maps of the county and students begin a process of coding \"event cards\" to \"event numbers\" carefully placed in their proper locations on the map. Using a topographic map of the county as a basic reference, students discover the origins of local place names. Students work together as a class to compile a multi-ethnic, multi-generational glossary of community slang. In other activities, students study cemeteries, compile a scrapbook of family history, put together photojournalism essays in county history, and tape old phonograph records. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"This monograph defines humanistic and positivistic geography, explores the dichotomy between these two thought systems, and suggests how geographers can work toward creating a humanistic positivism. Positivistic geography is interpreted as being based on a concept of 'rational' man who perceives a single objective world which has only spatial characteristics and is perceived uniformly by all human beings. Humanistic geography is interpreted as a thought system which has emerged as a reaction to positivism's stress on objective space and rationalism. Humanistic geography--which is based on existential philosophy--is characterized by a focus on human thought processes, recognition of the importance of the interaction of people and the environment, and the consideration that all  human phenomena must be analyzed without making any presuppositions about them. According to humanistic geographers, the world is subjective, complex, and full of variety, rather than objective, simple, and uniform. Ideally, the humanistic geographer investigates the world as it is, unlike the positivistic geographer who begins by simplifying assumptions about the world. Rather than reinforcing differences between these two approaches to geography, geographers should recognize the need for mutual compromise. For example, geographers can accept the basic focuses of humanistic geography on interaction of people and the environment and on the relativity of an object rather than its absoluteness and can, at the same time, recognize the importance of positivism's methodological sophistication  in areas such as creating generalizations, theories, and models.

        "description":"This paper presents an overview of the philosophical/historical background of moral education in the United States and describes an instructional program developed to teach junior high school students a behavioral strategy for acting ethically. Entitled &quot;Skills for Ethical Action,&quot; (SEA), this program was devised in the 1970's to help meet public demand for moral instruction in the public schools. Public interest in moral development in American society stems from the 17th century, when the Company of Massachusetts Bay passed an act which ordered every town to appoint a person to teach children to read and write so they could interpret the Bible and defend themselves from false representations of their Protestant faith. Education in the moral domain has continued to be important  in the schools, although the Protestant based value system has gradually given way to non-religious democratic values such as freedom, equality, justice, and respect for human rights. Various recent public opinion polls have concluded that the American public continues to have a strong interest in providing moral instruction for youth. The SEA Program meets this need by focusing largely on a cognitive decision-making approach. When participating in the SEA program, students are directed to reach ethical decisions by a process involving logic and reflection. Major steps in the SEA strategy are identifying the value problem, thinking up action ideas, considering possible effects on self and others, judging, acting, and evaluating. Feedback from participants in SEA programs indicates that  students generally report a gain in knowledge about themselves and an increase in learning about the importance of and methods for considering others before acting. In addition, teachers have reported that they notice a positive change in their students in both interpersonal and intraclass relationships. (DB)",

SEA is a program based on a set of audiovisual instructional materials developed to teach junior high school students a behavioral strategy for acting ethically. The overall objective of the SEA strategy is to help students &quot;do something which they have decided is fair after considering the possible effects on self and others.&quot; The six major steps in the SEA strategy are identifying the value problem, thinking up action ideas, considering self and other, judging, acting, and evaluating. The 38 lessons of SEA instruction evaluated in this report focused on student responsibilities in SEA, case studies about teenagers holding specified  values, uses of SEA strategies to handle personal value problems, and use of SEA to make a personal value more meaningful. The evaluation method involved review of all lessons by educators not involved in the project, review of all lessons by SEA staff with particular emphasis on affirmative action aspects of the course, studies of classroom use of SEA, analysis of all students' written SEA class work, and analysis of a questionnaire administered to all students upon completion of the program. The sample consisted of 323 students in 12 junior high school classrooms in four suburban and five urban school districts of a major American city. Findings indicated that students generally liked working with audio cassettes, sometimes reacted negatively to delivery styles of narrators employed on  the tapes, found some case studies inappropriate or unrealistic, and felt they learned a lot about consideration for others as a result of participating in the lessons.

The specific intent of this project was to help classroom teachers in Colorado overcome some of the obstacles to the use of local history in their classrooms. Major obstacles are identified as lack of prepared materials that can be conveniently brought into the classroom and lack of training for teachers in the use of local history materials. To overcome these and other obstacles, project directors arranged a five-week local history institute during the summer of 1980 for 11 high school teachers from 10 Colorado school districts. During the five week institute, teachers  were introduced to a variety of local history resources and source materials; instructed regarding how these materials could be adapted to classroom use; instructed on how to collect primary source material at major repositories of Colorado history (libraries, museums, municipal and county offices, the Colorado Historical Society); and directed to develop instructional materials and activities based on these sources. A wide variety of materials was developed by teachers, including slide presentations based on historical photographs, taped oral history interviews, fire insurance maps, photocopies and microfilm reels of census returns, and typescript copies of articles from old newspapers. One particularly beneficial outcome of the project was that teachers who developed local history kits  became resource teachers responsible for training other teachers to use the materials when they returned to their schools.

Specific conference objectives were to define the state of current understanding of how children learn economics, identify priority research questions in economics education for children, and suggest organizational forms or activities that would encourage additional research. Although no formal papers were presented,  discussion in the large and small group sessions centered on the following topics: (1) rationale for having children study economics, (2) curriculum development and curriculum needs, (3) appropriate economic concepts at various grade levels, (4) evaluating children's economic learning, (5) the role of the elementary school teacher, (6) research methodology, and (7) ideas to facilitate new research. For each of these topics, information is presented on scope of the questions, major approaches which have been taken in research on the topic, time periods covered by existing studies, policy implications of various research recommendations, variables which new research should consider, and methods which additional research might use.

        "description":"This report provides an information base about federally funded teacher center projects. The information was collected between January 1 and August 31, 1980 from 37 federally funded teacher center projects. During this eight month period, 247 structured telephone interviews were conducted. Three major categories of questions provided the focus for the interviews. The first was addressed to the policy boards and asked whether teachers were exercising their mandated right to participate in project decision making. In the second question category, specific questions were asked on program activities, their focus, instructional formats, instructors, length of program, and active participants. The third category of questions elicited descriptions of services that teacher center staff  provided for individual teachers and the resources that are available for teachers. The first chapter discusses the development of the study design and the rationale for the focus on the three major categories of questions. The second chapter describes the data collection and analysis procedures. The third, fourth, and fifth chapters give detailed discussions on the responses to the three question categories. Implications for inservice education are considered in the sixth chapter. Appended to the study is a Help Book that contains information on the logistics of teacher center documentation, including samples of instrumentation used in the data collection and the training manual that project documentors used in this study.

One important consideration in the model is that released time should be available for teachers participating in inservice programs. Preservice teacher education at MSU emphasizes field experience. Teaching interns in their junior and senior year work with cooperating teachers as a team. The availability of an experienced intern makes released time possible for teachers during the school day. The collegial  relationship between teachers and teacher educators is seen as an aid to teacher educators in becoming familiar with the reality of the classroom and its problems. The conceptual basis for development of preservice and inservice education at MSU progresses through three stages: (1) \"Learning About\" in a real world context; (2) directed practice and reflection in a real world setting; and (3) integrated decision making and action in the real world classroom.

The respondents to a questionnaire were 575 professors or instructors teaching elementary education courses at four-year colleges. There was general support for the concept of parent involvement at the elementary level. The home and school were seen as important to childrens' development, and a need was discerned for lessening tension between the two environments. Teacher educators viewed appropriate parent involvement as that which gives parents very little authority in making school decisions. The preferred type of involvement was providing training for parents in the  areas of discipline, tutoring, overseeing homework, and teaching parents about issues of child development or mental health. In each of these activities, the role of the teacher is basically to inform parents about ways they can improve their parenting skills. Teacher educators believed that teachers need skills in teaching or working with adults and knowledge about specific instructional materials. The implications for teacher education curriculum are discussed. (JD)",

Conditions covered are hearing and visual problems, sensory-motor problems, perception  problems, language and math problems, and general classroom behavior problems. In the second section, the role of the regular classroom teacher in the education of the handicapped is discussed. Two case histories are related, and the Individualized Education Program (IEP) developed for each student is outlined. Each IEP was developed by the principal, the director of special education, the math and reading resource teachers, the consulting teacher, the parents, and the student.

A priori categorical observation and evaluation systems measure what the system is designed to \"see,\" and may fail to record anomolies and salient events that affect teaching and learning in this one classroom. Through an ethnographic method, \"clinical descriptions\" of a classroom can be obtained and used for feedback. The intelligent, trained observer, in collaboration with the teacher committed to self-evaluation, can put ethnographic materials to immediate use in dealing with specific and unique situations. The clinical use of the ethnographic method, in conjunction with observers who have knowledge of the roles of  supervisor, researcher, and teacher-colleague, seems to be effective in the objective observation of classrooms, in determining the needs of individual teachers, and in providing feedback for teacher improvement.

Wherever possible, children's health is studied in the context of the nature-nuture controversy. The findings indicate that family characteristics (especially the mother's schooling) do have significant effect on children's health and that preventive care is an important vehicle in the case of dental health, but not in the case of physical health. Similarly, the greater availability of dentists has a positive effect on dental health, but greater availability of pediatricians does not alter the physical health  measures. (Author/JD)",

The field experience student is ordinarily not expected to ever take full responsibility for the instruction of an entire class for any period of time. The agenda for this student would include heavy emphasis on introductory and assisting activities. Some of these include becoming familiar with the school and the classroom routine, and working with small groups, helping individual students, some evaluation of pupil progress, and assisting in other class activities. The student teacher, after completing orientation activities, should participate in assisting activities, lesson planning, disciplinary activities, and  evaluation of pupil progress. The student teacher profits from steadily increasing amounts of interaction with pupils. The cooperating teacher can provide valuable guidance on the wise use of time for the student teacher. An inservice teacher specialist should be accorded the authority of a full teacher in the school. Mutual respect and cooperation between two inservice teachers is the key to a successful experience for a specialist in a classroom. (JD)",

The teacher &quot;thought aloud&quot; as she planned, and two researchers present took written notes. In general, her yearly planning was aimed at setting a projected schedule of instruction for each subject, analyzing and rearranging curriculum materials, and establishing an overall structure for the coming school year within which other levels of planning and action would be carried out. This broad outline of what she would teach, and to a lesser extent, how she would teach it, emerged from the mental review of the past year's events, combined with the adjustment of the sequence and pace of  teaching to accommodate new curriculum materials and new ideas consistent with her implicit theories of effective instruction.

        "description":"Three Washington state agencies, the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, the Council for Postsecondary Education, and the State Board of Education, cooperated in gathering data on the potential impact of the Council's off-campus plan for the inservice training of kindergarten through grade 12 certified personnel. The study evolved into an investigation of definitions and needs in inservice education and the current and future roles of schools of education. The report is in six sections: (1) an introduction; (2) an account of study procedures; (3) a review of literature and inservice activity in a national context; (4) findings on the status and nature of inservice activities in Washington; (5) the role of colleges and universities in inservice training; and (6) an  overview and description of the off-campus plan. One result of the study was the distinction made between professional development (program-related and credit-bearing) and staff development (all post-certificate educational activities except additional certificate and degree work). The executive staff recommendations covered both professional and staff development, including a call for greater state and local agency cooperation, the development of a state plan for staff development, quality control guidelines, and the continuation of support for the off-campus plan.

        "description":"Whenever one uses ordinary least squares regression, one is making an implicit assumption that all of the independent variables have been measured without error. Such an assumption is obviously unrealistic for most social data. One approach for estimating such regression models is to measure implied coefficients between latent variables for which one had multiple manifest indicators. The problem with this approach is that overidentified models yield multiple estimates of the associations among latent variables. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) can be used to obtain estimates of these overidentified parameters. The recent development of a computer program for confirmatory factor analysis by Joreskog, Gruvaeus, and Van Thillo has made MLE computational procedures practicable.  The resulting variances and covariances of the latent factors can be used to estimate the parameters of a structural model assumed to exist among the factors, and Joreskog and Sorbom have developed a program which incorporates MLE procedures for both the confirmatory factor analysis model and the linear structure model. This program is called LISREL, an acronym for linear structural relationships. This paper provides a nonmathematical introduction to LISREL. (Author/BW)",

One way of conceptualizing what the PCI measures is the extent to which each individual's particular response pattern contributes to, or detracts from, the overall consistency found in the group's mode of responding. One use of the PCI consists of spotting anomalous response patterns that result from a student's problems. From this it is a short step to utilizing the PCI for identifying a subgroup of students for whom the given set of items approximately constitutes a unidimensionally scalable set. The duality between students and items then permits selection of a subset of items for further improving the unidimensionality. A  measure of how constant an individual's response pattern remains for parallel subsets of items ocurring earlier and later in a test was developed and called the Individualized Consistency Index (ICI).

In addition to these two methods of test construction, the independent variables of the study were test length and type of criterion-referenced test data, varying in sensitivity to instruction. The dependent variables of the study included two indices of the amount of measurement error present in a set of test scores. The results were consistent across four data sets. Tests created by selecting appropriate difficulty levels for students based on the Rasch model yielded smaller errors  of measurement than tests which were created by randomly sampling items.

Order analysis concepts are discussed and graphically represented before the general consistency index used in the procedure is introduced and defined. Procedures for chain extraction follow, in which it is stated that the dominance matrix can be reconsidered as a labeled digraph. From this digraph, all subgroups with perfect consistency are generated, and  these in turn are used as starting points in the chain extraction process. The original dominance digraph is then reduced until the chain is found from each subgraph. The graph-theoretic algorithm may be carried out using a series of matrix manipulations performed on the dominance matrix. An illustrative example of the method is provided. In conclusion, possible extensions of the method are suggested. (Author/AEF)",

Ten Kansas Competency Based Tests, in reading and mathematics, were administered across five grade levels in a state-wide minimal competency testing program.

Descriptions of the types of judgments required and the procedures used for deriving a standard are given for each method. Methods of analysis are documented and are followed by results of their discussion. Statistical evidence is provided in the eight tables appended. Table 8  provides a framework within which to view the pattern of results for the ten tests. Data indicate that performance score standards are consistently ranked, and that discrepancies were substantial between methods but internal consistency was high. It is concluded that, since standard setting methods differ and competency level is a continuous variable, methods are bound to produce different results. The superiority of a single method is neither supported by existing literature nor data. (Author/AEF)",

This study examined the impacts of item variance on factor stability and structure. The attempt was to determine empirically whether unnumbered graphic scales scored using a larger number of scale steps produce more stable factors than do unnumbered graphic scales scored using a smaller number of scale steps. Inservice teachers read and rated their preference of summaries of 16 models of teaching. The scales were rescored using five different numbers of scale steps. Results suggest that researchers need not be concerned that an overly-specific scoring metric will distort the meaning of the identified factors. In addition, it is concluded that  unnumbered graphic scales are a promising method of collecting attitudinal data, particularly if the scales are scored with a reasonably large number of scale steps.

An instructional strategy for teaching examinees to use partial information in taking multiple choice tests under formula scoring conditions was tested on 280 fourth, fifth and sixth grade, private and public school students from the United States Virgin Islands.

Parent/child interactions were stimulated by means of a figure identification task and recorded on cassette audio tape recorder. Verbalizations resulting from the task were coded into speech acts, defined as statements, requests, and responses. Reliability for the coding procedure was ninety five percent. Analysis indicated: differential use of speech acts by parents and children across achievement differential performance rates and task outcomes across achievement levels, a  relationship between achievement and socioeconmic status and a relationship between language function and task performance. The data are illustrated in tables. Parents of high achievers appeared to use proportionatly more statements in their verbalizations with the children, while the parents of low achievers made proportionaltely more requests. Excerpts illustrate the different ways in which parents used language to help their children overcome a performance impasse. (Author/AEF)",

If the accuracy and completeness of the subjects' expected variables is related to content, then performance on laboratory and naturalistic tasks should differ systematically. The subjects' expected variables were measured by having subjects name variables and by a group survey. Use of the controlling variables strategy was measured by four questions about constructing, criticizing, planning, and analyzing experimental results. Subjects of different ages and socioeconmic groups were used. Results revealed a strong influence of content on reasoning performance. Contrary to Piaget's writings, content effects were systematic. In addition, by choosing physics  problems and questions which deemphasized content, Piaget avoided many content influences. Thus, it is suggested that educational implications generated from Piagetian theory may be incomplete; content effects require more emphasis. (Author/GK)",

A definition of organization is offered that is linked to a problem solving view of list learning. The second section attempts to provide an overview of the different types of organizational processes and strategies that fall within the domain of a theory of organization. Of particular concern are the problems that have arisen because single and multiple measures of organizational strategies have been derived in the absence of specific  process theories.

It emphasizes that the Research and Development Exchange is designed to disseminate information about research and development (R&amp;D) outcomes to educational practitioners; to feed forward information about practitioner needs and activities; and to link practitioners with information resources and training services. Undergirding the RDx (and thus by association, the SEDL/RX) are two assumptions: (1) That R&amp;D should guide change of improvement, and (2) That &quot;real&quot; consumer needs should guide R&amp;D.  Perhaps a further assumption is that the R&amp;D outcomes are not widely used to improve education because they are not responsive to felt &quot;real&quot; educational needs. The persons and institutions directly involved with the RDx (whether members of Advisory Boards, RDx staff, and National Institute of Education staff) believe that accomplishment of RDx goals (and SEDL/RX objectives) will contribute greatly to operationalizing the second assumption which in turn should actualize the first assumption.

It was hypothesized that students higher in general ability would obtain higher posttest scores on the average than lower ability students, and that verbal and figural explanatory supplements to minimal instructional materials would reduce the regression of general ability on outcome. It was expected that students with higher aptitude scores would obtain higher posttest scores. The effects of a more task-specific aptitude, graph processing, were explored, and involved both immediate and delayed learning outcome measures. A course in Economics was presented to high-school students using one of three sets of instructional materials. Before the course, participants took a three-hour aptitude battery and  were randomly assigned to treatment. Posttests were administered at the end of the course and two weeks later. Generalized regression analysis was used to assess the effects of aptitudes, treatments, and interactions. This study provided evidence that neither aptitude nor instructional treatment alone can fully describe learning outcomes. Further, instructional supplements, can be effective in filling in for student weaknesses and reducing differences between high and low ability students. (Author/GK)",

The purpose of the Pennsylvania Preschool Inventory is to furnish a cognitive assessment device, incorporating the qualities of practicality, accuracy, and reliability. The 61 items are  divided into six separate sections: Passive Vocabulary, Complementary Relationships, Noncomplementary Relationship, Number Concepts, Verbal Analogies, and Awareness of Self. The Testing Manual includes complete instructions for administration; and standardization and technical information, such as a description of the test construction and standardization procedures, information on scoring and interpreting the test, norms based on Title I eligible children, and reliability and validity data. The Test Plates are the pictures used for administration of the PPI. (Author/BW)",

Exercises were used to assess the attainments of samples of 9 year olds, 13 year olds and 17 year olds. Upon this basis, generalizations about the probable performance of all students in these age-groups were made. The set is divided into four brief sections and two extensive appendixes. Part (1) explains assessment and scoring procedures, and describes the documentation accompanying each exercise. The rationales behind the development of questions for the 1979-80 assessment are provided in Part (2) and exercises appear in Appendix A. Part (3) discusses the developmental  rationale for the 1970-71 assessment exercises. These were recently released and now appear in Appendix B. Cross-reference tables, for the purpose of locating subsets of exercises, are given in Part (4). Both multiple choice exercises and the following five types of open-ended exercises requiring different skills and levels of ability are given: general response exercises; emotional response exercises; evaluative exercises; analytical exercises; and exercises requiring the use of inference.

Performance assessment is defined in terms of assessment context, stimulus conditions, response mode, and scoring procedures, while problem solving is discussed as a psychological and educational construct. A historical review of strategies for the measurement of problem solving is followed by a synthesis and review of thirteen published tests of problem solving ability, with special emphasis on the role of performance assessment in these. Test profiles appear in the appendix, and are compared  in terms of operational definition of problem solving, measurement strategies, response mode, and technical adequacy. In conclusion, three directions for future research are presented: (1) the determination of how general intelligence and problem solving can be used to understand real-life problem solving ability; (2) the development of simulated problem solving measures and; (3) the integration of problem solving activities with instructional programs, such as those dealing with the gifted, minimum competency students, and special education programs for the handicapped.

        "description":"As the percentage of societal investment in an organization such as a local school district increases, so too will the amount of external regulation and control, and the organization will proliferate a formal structure responsible for self-evaluation. With the increase in extra-local control, evaluation tends to be used externally rather than internally and takes on a signal nature stressing accountability above performance evaluation. Consequently, evaluation personnel have increasingly minimal influence over internal organizational policies and little connection to actual organizational tasks, ambiguity of the information is stressed to make external evaluation more problematic, and a narrow range of evaluation takes place. Status of evaluation personnel decreases as a result  of the ambiguity. These central hypotheses are tested using data drawn from a national survey of evaluation units in school districts, combined with measures of federal and state funding and control of school district organization, and additional variables. This preliminary analysis has shown evaluation units to be more prevalent in school districts reliant upon a greater degree of external funding, and indicates that the degree of institutionalization does vary as a function of differences in the amounts of state and federal funding and control.

The purpose of this paper is to present a computer system named TESTLEN, which allows test developers to determine optimal criterion-referenced test lengths via simulation according to user-specified conditions. Such conditions may include ability distribution, item statistics, cut-off score, advancement score, test model, number of examinees, and number of replications. Output includes item statistics and values of decision consistency, kappa, and decision accuracy for each replication. The mean, range, and  standard deviation of decision consistency, kappa, and decision accuracy are reported across replications. Also reported is the proportion of the examinee group assigned to each mastery classification. A school district developing a test as a diagnostic examination is used as an example of TESTLEN's practical application. Recommendations and directions for the use of TESTLEN appear in the appendix.

Nineteen resources for tracing individuals are listed and the following fourteen described and evaluated in detail: telephone directories; Haines Directory Service; Department of Motor Vehicles; Post Office; TALENT participating schools; Pre-TALENT High Schools; Post-TALENT high schools/colleges; former classmates; marriage bureau records; voter  registrars' offices; employers; and birth/death records. Differences between nonrespondents and respondents in terms of academic aptitude and family socioeconomic status, and methods for conducting the follow-up survey by means of regional coordinators and in house staff are also outlined. Success in locating 10th grade nonrespondents is compared to the success with 11th and 12th grade samples.

Unfortunately, the social experiment conducted on traditional lines depends upon the extent to which control can be applied to the investigation; yet the achievement of such social control, through the manipulation of &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have nots&quot; may come into conflict with new assumptions concerning social justice and democratic freedom. The problem of truth or, to put it another way, the problem of uncertainty is also ever-present in social research. The debate over these issues will continue, but two ideas should be  kept in mind: (1) an evaluation is an intervention in a debate whose terms of reference are never quite the same as those addressed by the evaluation; and (2) the context of an evaluation or case study is not the same as the context of the action that might flow from it.

At issue is whether the task demands in writing assessment can be simplified to involve the production of paragraph-length writing samples and/or multiple choice testing, rather than full-length essays. This study considers data generated by senior high school students in three response modes: written essay, written paragraph, and multiple choice items. The general issues of concern in this paper are the factorial equivalence of the scale scores derived in different response modes, and the comparative discriminant validity exhibited by the set of scores across response modes. The results suggest that repeated applications of the method of analytic scoring used  in this study produce measures of the same underlying content; and that the factors reflecting the content of the five subscales (General Impression, Focus, Organization, Support, and Mechanics) are highly intercorrelated, and this interdependence is present no matter what response mode subjects are assessed in.

        "description":"In the past several years, evaluation researchers and practitioners have become concerned about the apparent failure to utilize evaluation information. A simplified model of decision making is presented, in which the decision maker is confronted with a situation requiring a choice, generates potential solutions, assesses the probabilities that a given alternative will lead to certain outcomes, and develops a preference ordering among outcomes. Two arguments are made: (1) that in organizations, participants have preferences for outcomes which reflect organizational as well as individual goals; and (2) that the decision process is one of bargaining and negotiation as various actors attempt to pursue their interests. In this political process, information becomes a potentially  important, or threatening, commodity. This paper discusses the concept of &quot;rationality&quot; as it applies to organizational decision making and information use, the impact of organizational goals and incentives on the model already presented, and a number of potential biases in information processing which may affect the use of evaluation information.

The methods examined include a norm-referenced vs. a theoretical criterion; cut-off scores based on acceptable risks of mis-classification; Huynh's optimal decision rule model; Wilcox's optimal cut-off score based on observed scores and an external criterion; and Wilcox's method for approximating true score distribution.

Students at each grade level were randomly selected to participate in the mathematics assessment. The CAEP assessment is designed to provide results by size of community, sex and regions within the State. National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) items were used to provide comparisons with achievement levels of students in the nation and in the Northeast Region. Results on repeated items from the first Connecticut mathematics assessment in 1976-77 provide an important review of student progress  over time. The report reveals continuing and serious problems with certain mathematics skills, but significant improvement can be noted in others. Overall, longitudinal comparisons are encouraging in grade 4. The results and recommendations in this report assist the statewide local school districts in planning for curriculum improvement, and will be used to monitor Connecticut's progress toward meeting the State Board Objectives for Public Education.

        "description":"The Connecticut Assessment of Educational Progress is a continuing program designed to measure objectively the adequacy and efficacy of the educational programs offered by the public schools. In 1979-80, students in grades 4, 8, and 11 were tested in science. Three goals were selected: (1) know the fundamental facts and principles of science; (2) apply the fundamental principles of science; and (3) understand and apply the processes of science. Grade 4 students answered correctly 69 percent of the items for goal 1; 52 percent of the items for goal 2; and 68.7 percent of the items for goal 3. Grade 8 students answered correctly 62.5 percent of the items for goal 1; 56.9 percent of the items for goal 2; and 67.4 percent of the items for goal 3. Grade 11 students answered correctly  55.5 percent of the items for goal 1; 49.4 percent of the items for goal 2; and 64.4 percent of the items for goal 3. Results are also reported comparing Connecticut with the nation and the northeast region, comparing the 1979-80 results with 1974-75 results; and comparing total test achievement of selected groups of Connecticut students. The results from a student attitude questionnaire are also reported. (Author/BW)",

In 1979, sixty-three administrators participated in a week long summer workshop, during which project staff and speakers from within the Division of Special Education presented topics such as: discussions on Public Law 94-142; due process in Special Education; Child Study Evaluation Team (CSET) procedures; models for staff development; availability of resources inside and outside the school district; and the use of the Special Education Program Checklist, an instrument to assist principals in observing and assessing special education classrooms in their schools.  Pretests-posttest self-rating evaluations were conducted of the participants' perceptions of their knowledge acquisition about thirteen selected special education topics. Results showed mean post ratings increased on all thirteen items; these are illustrated in tabular form. Participants' skill in the use of the observation checklist could not be measured due to insufficient data. Appendix A contains the questionnaire distribued to obtain participants' reactions to the usefulness of the workshop. A major accomplishment of the project was the refinement and field testing of the Checklist. (Author/AEF)",

On this basis, groups of recommendations are made to both Congress and the Department of Education. These are presented in an opening summary and the discussed more fully in each chapter. The first chapter is designed as an introduction to the background and scope of the report. A definition of evaluation is given in chapter two, which also addresses congressional concern with uniform methods and measures in the context of delineating different types of evaluation and their appropriate use. Improvement  of the quality of evaluation forms the substance of chapter three. Discussion in chapter four centers upon the utilization and dissemination of evaluation results. The final chapter makes recommendations for improved management and organization and presents implications for this derived from preceding chapters. Appended are a glossary, references, and three appendixes concerning types of federal educational evaluation activities, the parties who conduct them, and the organization of the evaluation system at state and local levels.

        "description":"Minimum competency testing programs present educational decision makers with a new opportunity to reconsider some fundamental issues in American public education. First, what is the goal of our elementary and secondary educational system? In particular, one must consider the role that minimum competency testing plays in the struggle for equality of educational opportunity and quality educational opportunities for all students. A second issue raised by minimum competency testing is designating as \"educated\" a student who has successfully passed the required tests. The process of defining \"education\" on the basis of test performance is especially controversial when the testing mandate goes beyond the basic skills. Finally, the issue that must be examined in relation to minimum  competency testing is that of who the decision makers are that will answer the first two questions. These individuals must be accountable to legislators and to the public. In addition, they must be able to evaluate the actual educational processes involved in the measurement of minimum competencies. In sum, it is important that both decision makers and educational observers realize that what happens with minimum competency testing will have an impact on the definition and goals of American public education.

        "description":"Urban school administrators are being asked to desegregate their schools without adequate financial or legal support. For every example of a national commitment to the goal of school integration, counter instances can be identified. The greatest resistance to desegregation has been at State and local levels, but even the Federal government has refused, on occasion, to use its enforcement powers. The issue of busing reveals the ambiguity with which school integration has been pursued. State legislatures have disallowed the use of State funds for buses used to achieve school desegregation, and Congress prohibits the use of Federal funds for busing. Unfortunately, busing remains the least expensive and disruptive short term solution to segregated schools. The courts, too, have been  less than consistent in framing desegregation policy. The most pressing issue that the courts have yet to resolve is desegregation across district lines within metropolitan areas. Metropolitan integration is unlikely to occur, however, apart from court action. Further research on desegregation effects, metropolitan solutions, financial support alternatives, the role of the courts, the political context of desegregation, and social consequences of desegregation can help to clarify and strengthen the goals and policies of school desegregation.

On first view, it appears these interactions are what impede rational policy initiatives in the teacher personnel area. However, it is not so much the interactions as the way in which policy is typically implemented across the several levels of government that impede such initiatives. The demands of higher government agencies for strict compliance, accompanied by mandated evaluations, frequently produce consequences that are the antithesis of those the policy intends and that may result in miseducative endeavors at the local level. The local option alternative and the educative alternative to the compliance approach may yield  better educational results for local schools while simultaneously achieving the larger aims of Federal and State policy efforts. The attainment of these results is more likely if operational policies for teaching personnel are kept to an essential minimum. (Author/APM)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to examine the nature, role and impact of staff development in an urban desegregated school district. The study was a collaborative effort that involved arrangements with district personnel, participating schools, and community members. An attempt was made to determine the contribution made by staff development to school success in the areas of academic achievement, attendance, program completion, and community support. Schools for study were selected to represent various degrees of success in such areas and various degrees of staff development activity. Interviews were conducted with administrators and teachers, and observations were conducted in classrooms, staff development meetings, and the general school area. Staff development appeared to have the best  prospects when a norm of collegiality and of continuous improvement existed in the school. Successful staff development programs were marked by community, evaluation, and collaboration between teachers and administrators. (Author/APM)",

        "description":"Many educational and employment problems of racial minorities, women, older adults, and the handicapped are associated with equity, discrimination, and equality. In economics, the concept of equity and its relevance to employment and education can best be understood through an analysis of two labor market theories. The theory of human capital sees the solution to problems of inequity and inequality in the realms of education; the dual market theory sees the solution in integration of secondary workers into the primary market. Discrimination in the labor market has made it difficult for minority groups to achieve economic equity in terms of employment and income. Future underutilization of the human resource potential for minorities may worsen the distribution of income. Since the  1960s educational programs have been designed to assist minorities in achieving economic equity and employability. Vocational education has been especially responsive and has increased their earnings and employability. Because of increasing minority demand for vocational education, equity considerations in vocational education will become of major significance to their economic progress and can be instrumental in improving economic equity and the distribution of income.

A second set of papers is concerned with enhancing productivity by concentrating on specific subgroups of the nation's population. Each of the papers in both sets was presented at the conference and is followed by a reaction that was also presented. Finally, two papers are included as a conclusion. The first attempts to summarize the observations, concerns, and  recommendations included among the preceding papers. The second lends a general vocational education perspective to the concept of worker productivity.

        "description":"A study was conducted to assess the impact of the Florida State Student Assessment Test (FSSAT) (Functional Literacy Test) on the enrollment in secondary-level vocational education courses. The 67 school districts in Florida were grouped according to population density into three levels of urbanization (low, medium, and high). Ten percent of the public high schools in each level of urbanization were randomly selected to participate in the study. Intact twelfth grade classes were randomly selected, and students in these classes were divided into vocational and nonvocational education groups. These students and county vocational education directors, vocational education teachers, and principals were surveyed. Contrary to the beliefs of vocational educators, vocational education  enrollments increased. Disproportionate enrollment trends did exist; that is, while secondary-level vocational enrollments increased in Florida, total secondary-level enrollment declined. Very few students were deterred from enrolling in vocational courses because of the requirement to be remediated in order to pass the FSSAT. However, a substantial proportion of vocational students who failed the FSSAT did not re-enroll in vocational education courses. The overall effectiveness of the remedial practices was found to be low. It was recommended that (1) systematic, standardized remedial efforts be made; (2) procedures for measuring effectiveness of remedial practices be established; and (3) the reasons that students who failed the FSSAT did not re-enroll in vocational courses be studied.

Coordinators could carry out these mandates more effectively if they could form cooperative linkages with other personnel mandated by other federal laws. These personnel include coordinators under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; members, especially women members, of local  advisory councils on vocational education under Section 105 of Public Law 94-482; compliance officers under Office of Civil Rights Guidelines; state coordinators under the Career Education Incentive Act of 1977; assistance and training personnel under Title IV, and field officers of the Equal Opportunity Commission under Title VII, of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; planning and private Industry Council members under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act Amendments of 1978; and affirmative action staff under Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

Based on the collective input and refinement of national leaders in adult basic education, the handbook provides coverage of program planning, staff development, student recruitment and retention, instructional approaches and techniques, instructional materials, and evaluation, among other concerns. Each chapter of the handbook has been written to stand alone. Following introductory material describing the handbook's purpose, development, and intended audience, the guide is divided into two parts. Part 1 focuses on organizing an adult literacy program, and includes chapters on preparing for an adult literacy program; public relations in a literacy program; delivery of instructional services;  staffing; selecting instructional approaches and materials; and planning for evaluation, including means of assessment and steps in evaluation. Part 2 concentrates on the management of adult literacy programs, covering the following material: working with adult learners; recruiting adult learners; the instructional program for adults; and retaining learners in adult literacy programs. Examples of recordkeeping systems for adult literacy programs are included in the handbook's appendix. (KC)",

        "author":["Drew, Jenifer D.",
          "And Others"],
        "description":"A study was conducted to determine the extent to which federal policies, as defined in the Education Amendments of 1976, have affected the content and objectives of Consumer and Homemaking Education (C&amp;HE) programs. The study was conducted during 1978 through 1981 in 10 states. More than 500 federal, state, and local educators and administrators were interviewed, and 100 local programs were observed. In addition, an analysis of federal and state expenditures and enrollment data was conducted. The study drew the following four conclusions: (1) targeted programs with special needs and secondary &quot;Adult Living&quot; classes are most responsive in terms of content, student population, and sex equity; (2) Subpart 5 (that deals with C&amp;HE), as written, does not ensure that states use federal  money to provide C&amp;HE programs to those who need them most; (3) federal funds have their greatest potential to prompt responsiveness when they support outreach programs for adults, inservice training staff, and administrative staff, and are given to programs that specifically reflect federal priorities; and (4) C&amp;HE has an appropriate role within vocational education as an adjunct to wage-earning programs. From these conclusions a general recommendation was made that the upcoming legislation should clarify Congressional intent and limit the federal role in C&amp;HE to providing support for only those activities which are most consistent with federal priorities.

To provide an orientation to the environment that stimulated the current interest in occupational competency testing, chapters 2 and 3 review competency-based vocational education and discuss evaluation concerns in vocational education. Next, chapter 4 presents some background information along with definitions of a few key terms used in competency testing. The current efforts of a number of organizations in the field of competency testing are reviewed in chapter 5. They are organized into three categories: Department of Education-funded organizations,  state agencies and consortia, and job performance assessment in the military. Chapter 6 describes recent developments that merit attention from test developers in vocational education--simulations, adaptive paper-and-pencil tests, confidence testing, and Rasch modeling. The technical and legal problems in setting standards of performance on competency tests are discussed in chapter 7. A 10-page list of references is provided. (YLB)",

The step-by-step guide aims to identify teachers' existing capabilities that may be appropriately used with these students, plus point out new techniques and resources that other vocational educators across the state and nation have found to be effective in preparing these students for occupational placement. This program manual contains six sections, covering the following topics: (1) introduction--a look at the student with limited English proficiency, review of terms and outreach efforts; (2) assessment of LEP  students; (3) selection of a program model--describes several models, such as bilingual vocational education, vocational English as a second language (VESL); prevocational English as a second language, survival ESL, basic skills ESL, literacy ESL, and considerations for selecting program components; (4) funding sources; (5) program implementation; and (6) occupational placement and follow-up. Appendixes list resources that can be used in preparing programs for LEP students, such as guides for competency-based instruction for survival skills, basic skills, home management, and general vocational and literacy ESL; teaching competencies for job-specific ESL instructors; new vocational materials for LEP students; strategies for modifying vocational instructional materials for LEP students;  and professional resources for vocational educators of LEP students.

        "description":"This collection of four policy papers on vocational assessment for the handicapped deals with personnel development, interagency coordination, current research and development, and providing individualized assessment services. Discussed in the initial paper on program improvement in vocational assessment for the handicapped are federal legislation concerning vocational education for the handicapped, the scope of vocational assessment and vocational evaluation, tools and models for assessment/evaluation, use of findings, inservice program development and implementation, technical problems of assessment, personnel preparation and selection, and agency coordination. Determining who should do vocational evaluation, identifying tasks necessary to the vocational assessment process,  planning inservice training programs for evaluation personnel, and obtaining resources for delivering inservice training are the main issues examined in the second paper. Covered next are various aspects of assessing special education's responses to the career needs of handicapped youth (issues of school-based vocational assessment, establishing a structural basis for assessment, and facilitating the assessment process). Planning vocational assessment activities within educational settings having an interdisciplinary focus is the subject of the final paper. (MN)",

        "description":"Five experiments were conducted to determine whether properties inherent in some training procedures may subtly influence the adaptability of skilled performance of complex tasks. The first two experiments assessed the insensitivity of low-rate performances. Examined in the third experiment was the issue of whether instructions that focus attention on the contingencies can engender responding under the control of the contingencies. The fourth experiment involved developing a more efficient procedure for assessing the sensitivity of responding to natural contingencies, while the fifth experiment addressed the effects of verbal guesses about the contingencies on motor behavior under the control of the contingencies. Results indicated that instructionally induced insensitivity is a  basic behavioral phenomenon, rather than a by-product of behavior that does not make contact with contingencies. If instructed insensitive behavior makes contact with contingencies, it appears likely that sensitivity to those contingencies will eventually develop. If training procedures explicitly call attention to natural consequences, instructionally induced insensitivity may be avoided. Thus, partial training where trainees are allowed to develop personal styles based on contingency contact would be beneficial. The fifth experiment reinforced the distinction between verbalization and motor performance and pointed to the need for further research on their potential interaction. (MN)",

        "description":"Six skilled typists were studied while they transcribed English text. The typists showed stable patterns of performance, but with significant individual differences among themselves. Inter-keypress latencies for two-finger digraphs (typed by two fingers on the same hand) were particularly variable among typists. Two typists showed large differences in two-finger digraph latencies, but similar overall typing speeds. Finger movement trajectories, determined from analysis of videotapes of these typists, indicated that the differences in two-finger digraph latencies correspond to differences in the independence of within-hand finger movements. A high-speed film of one typist showed that finger movements of this typist almost always overlapped. The starting times of movements were six  times as variable as the ending times, suggesting that it is the completion rather than the initiation of the movements that is controlled in skilled typing. These studies demonstrate the importance of considering individual differences in constructing a theory of skilled human performance, even in a highly automatized task such as transcription typing.

        "description":"This study examined the background characteristics, work experience, extent of contact with the world of work, and attitudes towards work of teachers in secondary schools in Queensland; and these teachers' views concerning the role and aims of secondary education, particularly as they relate to preparation for the world of work. Comparisons are drawn between teachers having different amounts of full time work experience, in different types of schools, of various ages, and of either sex, and teaching in different curriculum areas. The results show that more than half of the teachers had some full time work experience. However, the work experience, other than teaching, that teachers had participated in had been mainly for less than two years. The impression given by the results is  that teachers see secondary schools as having a role to play in helping students enter the working world, that more emphasis should be given to this aim, and that they would be willing to participate in programs of alternative work experiences and to take students to visit places of employment or to have business persons visit their classrooms. Nonetheless, teachers considered helping students to prepare for the working world to be but one aim of secondary schools, and some teachers felt that students were prepared for the world of work through a general education. Issues for further consideration uncovered by the study include the possibility of alternative work experience programs for teachers, discussion of the aims of secondary education in teacher preparation institutions, and  examination of ways of providing teachers with greater exposure to the world of work.

(2) What are the views and attitudes of employers concerning the recruitment of graduates and diplomates, the training they expect graduates and diplomates to have, and their reasons for accepting or rejecting graduates and diplomates for employment?, (3) What are the attitudes of graduates , diplomates, and students toward employment?, and (4) How do graduates, diplomates, and students adjust or accommodate their  expectations and aspirations to the opportunities available to them? The investigation encountered difficulty in comparing courses of study, defining and measuring rates of unemployment for the graduates and diplomates, gathering relevant background information, and preserving confidentiality. Nevertheless, data gathered in the study were analyzed in a matrix framework, and numerous findings are reported regarding the student-graduate-employer relationship according to the four terms of reference analyzed.

The analyses were limited to 522 pairs of white youth. It was found that young men were apparently advantaged in their educational progress compared with young women. Sibling position or sex of other siblings had little, if any, influence. The extent of parental education did have a major effect, and the educational progress probabilities for sons were higher than those for daughters, regardless of the parents' education. Greater  ability for boys and girls was associated with higher probabilities of education completion. Parental encouragement did affect the ability of youth to succeed. In general, youth's aspirations about educational attainment exceeded their actual attainment.

        "description":"Solar proponents claim that a solar- and conservation-oriented economy will create vastly larger numbers of jobs than the conventional and nuclear alternatives. Comparing energy alternatives in terms of job creation potential is tenuous at best due to the paucity of analysis in this area. Ideally, both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of job creation should be compared among alternatives. Due to the relative newness of the solar and conservation industries, however, only general comparisons of the direct employment impacts among energy alternatives can be made. A tentative conclusion from recent studies is that the general direction of changes in terms of direct job creation will be toward greater employment opportunities. A review of the literature shows that for the  same amount of energy, solar creates 55-80 times as many direct jobs as natural gas. For the same amount of energy, conservation measures create 26 times as many direct jobs as natural gas at about one-ninth to one-fifth the cost. For the same amount of energy, solar heating systems create 2-8 times more direct jobs than conventional powerplants. Conservation measures create direct jobs at less than one-third of the cost/job of nuclear power and will be economical in all parts of the country. (YLB)",

Current quantitative employment estimates show solar technology-induced employment to be generally greater than for conventional technologies. Discussing the qualitative employment effects focuses on the relative size and spatial distribution of the various technologies. The effects of solar systems are more positive than those of conventional energy facilities. This is due to the small size, dispersed locations, and gradual implementation of solar heating and cooling of building (SHACOB) systems. (YLB)",

Chapter 1, which supplies legislative background on the governor's grants with special emphasis on the effects of the 1978 CETA amendments, covers state employment and training councils, governor's coordination and special service plans, supplemental vocational education assistance, educational linkages, and special statewide youth services. Discussed next are the structure and coordinating role of the state employment and training councils. A broad description of how the states planned to allocate their funds programmatically during  fiscal 1980 (with emphasis on planning processes, program activities, and organizations funded with respect to the areas of coordination and special services, supplemental vocational education assistance, educational linkages, and special statewide youth services) is also presented. (A companion volume to this report, which further documents the programmatic use of the governor's grant funds through a catalog of program descriptions in each of the states is available separately through ERIC--see note.)

Part 1, which identifies programs funded under the coordination and special services grant, outlines programs dealing with coordination, planning, technical assistance, rural areas, labor market/occupational information, research, special target populations, economic development, and apprenticeship. Examined next are programs funded under the educational linkages grant, which are targeted in the areas of coordination, technical assistance, information exchange, development and dissemination,  expanding educational opportunities, curriculum development, assessment and testing, elimination of artificial barriers, and jointly funded training and services. Activities involving apprenticeship linkages, employment and training for special target populations, labor market and occupational information, coordination, and cooperative efforts are summarized next. Presented in part 4 is a state-by-state list of resource persons who may be contacted for further information on programs.

In addition, followup supervisor ratings of job performance were available for approximately 800 students. Data from these sources were compiled and analyzed with respect to the relationship between 36 program characteristics (in the  areas of advisory councils, administration, public relations, staff, facilities, recruitment, counseling, curriculum, student organizations, and placement services) and the three program outcomes. Relationships between characteristics and outcomes were presented where consistent trends were found and several speculations were made concerning these relationships.

Two survey instruments were created specifically for the study: (1) a worker survey form, designed to assess demographic and personality characteristics of the worker and his or her satisfaction with training received from the alternative vocational education delivery system, and (2) a supervisor rating form, which assessed knowledge of job skill, quickness in learing a new job skill, work attitudes, dependability, and ability to get along with others. A total of 155 trainee/worker forms and 199 supervisor rating  forms were completed. Participants' ratings of satisfaction with their program and employers' ratings of job performance indicate that on the whole the alternative delivery systems are meeting the needs of participants. Statistical analyses were performed to determine whether participants in the four programs differ in terms of demographic and personality characteristics and job performance ratings of worker satisfaction. Differences were found to exist, and their significance is discussed. (A related study of the relationship between proposed vocational program quality indicators, student satisfaction, placement, and job performance ratings is available separately through ERIC--see note.)

        "description":"A study examined whether middle-aged adults' attitudes toward persons could be changed in a positive direction through planned educational experiences designed specifically to change attitudes. A sample of 162 middle-aged adults from various sections of North Carolina (89 of whom constituted the experimental group and 79 of whom comprised the control group) participated in the study. Both groups completed the Kogan Attitudes Toward Old People Scale, the Purpose in Life Test (PIL), and a general informative test both before and two to four months after the experiment. While the control group received no instruction, the experimental group participated in a series of six two-hour workshops on aging. The adults' attitudes toward older persons changed significantly in a positive  direction following the workshop series, whereas attitudes of those in the control group decreased. Those adults with higher PIL scores held significantly more positive attitudes toward the aged than those with lower PIL scores. Other variables that seemed to be linked to attitudes toward aging include marital status, race, and family income, with unmarried non-white adults with annual incomes above $12,000 having the most positive attitude changes. Recommendations call for further research to examine different age groups and additional variables. (MN)",

        "description":"While most training and development/institutional development professionals are familiar with either the world of formal higher education or the world of training in the business/industrial sector, few training and development practitioners are familiar with both. It is necessary to coordinate the efforts between these two spheres in order to develop the curriculum needed to produce professional trainers and human resource development (HRD) specialists. To determine where joint efforts between these two worlds will be beneficial, one must first explore the similarities and differences between higher education and training and development as they exist in the following areas: regulation of the education/training process, training/education goals, method of delivering training  (credit versus skills), perceptions of the learner's role, and learner motivations in different settings. Educators entering the trainer's world must work for credibility in that world by adopting the mindset of the local training community. They must strive for a balance between theoretical and practical experiences in designing course-work and projects. Most important to establishing a program to train HRD practitioners is a willingness to accept trainers as professional educators working in a different setting with different constraints and resources.

The survey focused on former students after high school, their homemaking responsibilities, and the impact of homemaking instruction. The 155 students in the random sample were from 62 North Dakota school districts; they had taken at least three semesters of consumer homemaking and were males and females from all academic ranks. Following graduation, 70 percent had enrolled in a postsecondary program. Homemaking responsibilities included greatest initial involvement in money management, housing, personal development and relationships, time management, and clothing. Most (79 percent) stated that homemaking classes had assisted them in preparing for  independent living responsibilities. Foods and nutrition was identified as being helpful by the highest number (85 percent). Students also indicated assistance in money management (68 percent), time management (44 percent), personal development and relationships (62 percent), and clothing (79 percent). Almost all students (96 percent) identified personal gains from enrollment, including greater confidence, increased independence, satisfaction, and greater understanding of oneself and others. Of those who had belonged to Future Homemakers of America (42 percent), 72 percent indicated personal gains from participation.

It describes attempts at coordination with vocational education by CETA's most significant antecedent, the Manpower Development and Training Act of 1962. Complex dimensions added to the relationship between federal education policy and employment and training policy by CETA's creation are then explored. Mechanisms for coordinated planning as specified in the Education Amendments of 1976 and administering the planning requirements are described. A discussion of developing strategies for coordination takes into consideration the reinforcing effects of the Youth Employment and Demonstration Projects  Act, effects of the set-aside funds that required school system agreement, and the agreements process. Next, the reauthorization of CETA in 1970 is described--an act that resulted in refinement of CETA's relationship with vocational education. The flow of funds from CETA to education programs is also addressed. Pooling resources is considered as one way to view coordination.

Chapter 2 considers allocation provisions for vocational education funds, inclulding the federal and states' formulas. Chapter 3 discusses distribution of vocational education resources by four objects: enrollments, services, target populations, and occupations.  Examination of the evaluation requirements of the 1976 amendments is found in chapter 4. Chapter 5 describes different forms of coordination between the VEA and CETA. Chapter 6 reports on a study of Consumer and Home Economics programs to determine content, kinds of students, influence of 1976 legislation, and effects on learners. The concern of chapter 7 is effect of participation in vocational education on learners. Chapter 8 examines the effectiveness of the VEA in equalizing opportunities to and in vocational education.

Retrospective studies suggesting an association between childhood anti-social behavior and the subsequent problem of alcoholism are presented, supported by studies of the personality inventories of college students who later developed substance abuse problems. Information from adoptive studies and a study supporting the concept of childhood minimal brain dysfunction in a subtype of genetically-related alcoholism is also included. Research examining sex differences in antecedent characteristics of alcoholics is presented, along with a study supporting the interpretation of pre-alcoholics as more rebellious, impulsive, and socially aggressive than  their peers. The materials offer evidence that on the average, some personality features may be discernible in both male and female clinical alcoholics long before treatment. The methodological shortcomings of many studies quoted in this review are discussed, and recent improved research techniques are reported. (Author/NRB)",

        "description":"Extrinsic job characteristics focus on the work environment and include working conditions, co-worker relations, supervision, company policy, salary, and job security. Intrinsic characteristics deal with the content and tasks involved in the job as well as opportunities provided for self expression and self actualization, e.g. the type of work done in terms of responsibility, variety, skill and autonomy, opportunities for personal growth, and feelings of accomplishment. Relationships between intrinsic and extrinsic job characteristics and job satisfaction among workers of different ages were examined. Multiple regression analyses ascertained the relative importance of 8 perceived job characteristics in relation to job satisfaction among a national probability sample of 1,533  workers. Role strain and financial rewards-promotion were included in the regression equations for all age groups.

The results indicated that both intrinsic and extrinsic job characteristics were strongly related to job satisfaction among younger workers while extrinsic characteristics were of relatively greater importance among older workers.

        "description":"Suicide rates vary greatly by sex and race, but the methods employed by these groups have not been studied closely and across time. Annual official national statistics for specific methods of suicide by sex and specific racial group were examined from 1923 to 1978. During this time period, shifts occurred in the proportions of suicides by method, most noteably for women and Asian-American groups. Although women continued to kill themselves with solid and liquid poisons more often than men, in recent years firearms became a more frequent method. Among Japanese- and Chinese-Americans, the most common methods of suicide were hanging, strangulation, and suffocation. However, the proportions declined over time, while those for methods such as firearms increased. Firearms continued to  be the method most often used in completed suicides by Caucasian, Black, and American Indian males. Results suggest that acculturation, changing societal roles, and problems with the compilation of official statistics may be possible factors affecting changes in method choice. (Author/NRB)",

Past research has suggested that a moral disposition implies only moral behavior, while an immoral disposition implies both moral and immoral behavior. The effect of these implicational schemata on attributions of morality was investigated to examine the relationship between moral dispositions and moral behaviors. Subjects (N=40) read stories about 4 persons, each of whom behaved either morally (returning lost money) or immorally (keeping lost money). Situational demands surrounding the behavior (peer pressure) facilitated either one or the other of these behaviors. Results from the measure of attributed morality revealed an interaction of behavior and situational  demand. Compared to attributions on moral behavior, attributions on immoral behavior were relatively unaffected by situational demands. Immoral behavior resulted in relatively immoral attributions, regardless of situational demands. (Author/NRB)",

Based on an analysis of these definitions of burnout, the paper proposes a new definition encompassing emotional or physical exhaustion, lowered work productivity, and overdepersonalization. The five sources which present statistical analyses relating individual or organizational variables to burnout are reviewed and research methodology issues are posed. The future research section is based  on research to date, authors' conversations with researchers and other professionals, and writings in areas such as psychopolitics, client labeling, the interrelationships of clients, care givers, and systems, and causes and prevention of burnout.

To explain sex differences and job satisfaction within the framework of subtle treatment discrimination (a situation variable) and beliefs about roles for women (a person variable), 1578 employees of a large corporation completed demographic questionnaires and scales measuring job satisfaction, beliefs about roles for women, and perceptions of female isolation from power acquisition situations. Results indicated that the most satisfied group was the traditionally-oriented females who did not perceive isolation, while the least satisfied group was the nontraditionally-oriented females who did perceive isolation. The findings indicate that sex differences in job satisfaction  exist; however, orientation (a person-centered variable) does not seem to have as much impact on satisfaction as gender and isolation.

To determine whether spontaneous self-esteem (SSE) increases when a valued aspect of self is made salient, college students completed a questionnaire dealing with level of satisfaction with personal physical attractiveness and academic progress. From these responses, subjects were divided into two groups. Students in the High Academic group (N=13) had positive feelings about their academic progress, but negative feelings about their physical attractiveness. Students in the High Attractive group (N=8) had positive feelings about their physical attractiveness, but  negative feelings about their academic progress. In later sessions, the SSE of both groups was assessed in situations that made either physical attractiveness or academics salient. The High Academic group had greater SSE in the academic than the attractiveness situation, whereas the High Attractive group tended to have greater SSE in the attractiveness rather than the academic situation.

Policy considerations for local treatment programs, state and federal initiatives, and the professional community are discussed. The monograph concludes with conceptual shifts and subsequent proposals that may institutionalize new ways of thinking about dysfunctional behavior. A report of the Office of Program Development and Analysis on the practice of  primary prevention in family therapeutic work is included. A recurring theme throughout these papers is the supposition that specific family-related antecedents are associated with specific problematic behavior, that certain generic family factors are associated with dysfunctional behavior, and that investigations of the apparent commonalities would be useful.

        "description":"Numerous advocacy groups concerned with &quot;death with dignity&quot; have formed in response to medical advances which extend the process of dying. Natural death legislation and the Living Will are but two examples of suicide advocacy for the terminally ill. These groups are emerging world-wide and range from conservative insistence on passive refusal of treatment to radical suicide advocacy and the establishment of new voluntary euthanasia societies in several countries. Suicidologists and suicide-prevention workers need not regard these groups as inimical to suicide prevention; the two kinds of groups can make important contributions to each other's work. Data gathered by suicidologists and those with clinical experience in suicide prevention may be able to determine the point at  which, in the normal stages of dying, the terminally ill person may be most likely to attempt or commit suicide. However, suicide advocacy suggests that sometimes such attempts should not be interfered with, since effective suicide prevention in these cases may mean forcing an individual to stay alive in intolerable circumstances. Both suicide prevention and suicide advocacy are basically humanitarian-oriented; this commitment to the interests of individual human beings provides the basis for accommodation between the two.

Social work programs were introduced into the schools by private organizations and community groups and were formed to prevent truancy and delinquency, to rehabilitate poor families through relief services, and to \"Americanize\" the foreign-born populations. Visiting teachers hired to staff these programs focused on environmental conditions rather than on the individual child. After World War I, a period of intense professionalization in school social work began, lasting from 1920 until 1965. Significant forces affecting school social work during the 1920s were the formation of the Commonwealth Fund of New York City and the mental hygiene movement. The expansion of federal relief and  welfare programs after the depression allowed professional social workers to refocus efforts on case work and individual therapy; only after World War II did the services of social workers and counselors again flourish in the schools. In the era of federal intervention (1965-1972), local schools purchased social services from private agencies suggesting that, although schools had \"housed\" social service programs, such programs were never fully absorbed by the schools.

A comparison of services needed by women with services actually available to women found that special treatment services for drug-abusing women were needed in the areas of medical treatment, counseling, employment, and child-care services. Nationwide female-oriented drug programs were identified, and staff members from 21 drug-free and 4 methadone maintenance programs completed questionnaires about demographics, drug use, and treatment services available for women in treatment during a 3-month period. Results indicated that the majority of the 547 female drug abusers received basic drug treatment services, i.e., routine medical  examinations and drug counseling. About half received psychological and family counseling; one-third received skills assessments and educational counseling. However, large percentages had not received such essential services as opthalmological and gynecological examinations, birth control counseling, and dental care.

Female undergraduates (N=140) completed several questionnaires, including the Bem Sex Role Inventory to determine sex-role self-concept, the Semmel Attributional Style Scale to measure attributional style, and the Janis-Field Feelings of Inadequacy Scale to measure self-esteem. Data analysis indicated that the masculinity component of sex-role self-concept was closely related to a positive attributional style. Femininity, although not strongly related to attributional style, was correlated slightly with stability attributions for negative outcomes. Results did not  support previous research findings linking an androgynous self-concept with a positive attributional style. (NRB)",

        "description":"In a review of instruments measuring gender-related constructs, a number of shortcomings were found in existing scales. A new scale to measure sex-role attitudes was developed and tested by first proposing the construct of sex-role egalitarianism and then initiating the process of construct validation by developing a reliable measure of the construct. Sex-role egalitarianism was defined as an attitude which causes a person to respond to another individual independently of that other individual's sex. Five domains in which the attitude would manifest itself were specified: marital roles, parental roles, employment roles, social-interpersonal-heterosexual roles, and educational roles. College students' responses were used to reduce the initial 520 items to two 95-item parallel  scales. Data obtained from the administration of the resulting Sex Role Egalitarianism Scale to other college students (N=252), senior citizens (N=59), and police officers (N=56) indicated acceptable coefficients of stability, equivalence, and internal consistency. The pattern of mean scores demonstrated support for the construct's validity. Findings suggest that the scale has potential research value as a paper-and-pencil measure of sex-role egalitarianism.

        "description":"Researchers in the area of human learning and memory have stressed the need for systematic studies of the factors involved in information processing and their effects on the retention and recall of the information processed. One such important factor may be self-reference. A lecturer may stimulate self-reference in students through self-disclosure. The effects of teacher self-disclosure on male (N=32) and female (N=32) college students' recall of lecture material and their perceptions of the teacher were examined. Subjects listened to one of two recordings of a lecture on learned helplessness by a male professor. Half of the subjects heard a tape containing teacher self-disclosure statements. The other half heard a tape containing impersonal hypothetical examples. Subjects then  completed a free recall measure of the lecture and rated the teacher's expertness, attractiveness, and trustworthiness. Self-disclosure lowered the females' free recall and raised the free recall of the males, but did not affect teacher ratings. Teacher self-disclosure self-reference, and self-reference improved memory. Findings suggest that male students may have been better able than females to identify with the self-disclosures of the male teacher. (Author/NRB)",

        "description":"The role of affect in information processing has recently received attention, and several possible influences of affect have been suggested. The informational and directive effects of affect were investigated with subjects (N=61) who either described events in their recent past that made them feel good, described events that made them feel bad, or gave no description of life-events. Additionally, subjects expected to be put in either a good or a bad mood as a result of an external factor, or had no expectations concerning their mood. Describing positive life-events increased reported happiness and life satisfaction relative to a control group, while describing negative life-events decreased the indices of well-being. The impact of describing negative events was eliminated when  subjects expected to feel bad due to an external influence, but was nonsignificantly increased when subjects expected to feel good because of an external influence. Subjects describing positive life-events were not affected by mood expectation manipulations. Results suggest that persons use perceptions of their affective states in judgments of well-being, and that affective states have a directive effect on the search for and use of information.

The influence of situational factors affecting a recipient's interpretation of the arousal induced by communication were investigated with smokers (N=37) who were exposed to a fear-arousing anti-smoking movie. Prior to viewing the movie, subjects were given a placebo pill described as having either arousing, tranquilizing, or no side effects. Following the movie, subjects completed a questionnaire on smoking behavior. Subjects who expected the pill to have arousing side effects reported less intention to reduce smoking than those who expected no side effects. Those who expected tranquilizing side effects reported more intention to reduce smoking than  the no side effects group. During the two weeks following the experiment the number of cigarettes smoked decreased in both the tranquilizing and no side effects groups, but not in the arousing side effects group. Although findings about subjects' intentions were consistent with predictions derived from discounting and augmentation principles, behavioral data showed a discounting effect but no augmentation effect.

An Attributional Style Assessment Test (ASAT) was created and administered to college students, along with the Beck Depression Inventory and the UCLA Loneliness Scale. Correlational analyses revealed distinct attributional style differences between the more lonely and less lonely people, especially when attributions were assessed for interpersonal failure situations. The more lonely people attributed these failures more than less lonely people to their unchangeable character defects (abilities and personality traits), and less to their changeable behavioral mistakes (effort and strategy selection). Parallel  results were obtained when depression was used as the criterion variable. A second study using a modified version of the ASAT with other college students replicated these findings. Results appear to support the theory linking attributional style to motivational and performance deficits in lonely and depressed populations. (Author/NRB)",

Male and female undergraduates (N=191) participated in interviews exploring demographics, high school experiences, college and career plans, perceptions of engineering, experiences of sex discrimination, and other related topics. Results indicated that women did not differ significantly from men in ability or career motivation. However,  the women engineers were subject to many interpersonal and social barriers to their choice of engineering, e.g., social isolation, family and career commitments, negative critical incidents, and sex discrimination. Characteristics of the women engineering students paralleled those found in other studies; the women were autonomous and capable, despite existing obstacles. (Author/NRB)",

In addition to the traditional causes of effort, ability, luck, and task difficulty, students (N=114) in math and psychology courses were asked for attributions concerning teacher's performance and interest in the course. Questionnaires about perceptions of and reasons for their performance in the course were presented to the students late in the semester. The highest attributions for performance were made to effort, teacher's performance, and interest. Successful students made higher  attributions to teacher's performance, effort, ability, and interest. Correlational analyses indicated that for males, attributions to ability increased with perceived success; for females, attributions to interest and effort were correlated with perceived success. The results demonstrate that attributions for extended performance in an academic course are similar to those made in less ego-involving tasks. (Author/NRB)",

The effectiveness of gloss  activites that claim a dual focus on content and process must ultimately be demonstrated by a specific effort (content directed) as well as a more general effort (process directed).

        "description":"After employees of private firms completed several rapid reading classes and achieved remarkable gains on the Nelson-Denny Reading Test, the question was raised as to whether the increases in scores were due to the increased number of items attempted on the posttest. A preliminary analysis indicated that students attempted an average of 14.6 and 4.2 additional items on the vocabulary and comprehension tests respectively. Protocols of the posttest were rescored to determine percentile ranks on the same number of items that had been completed on the pretest. Percentile scores were then recorded for the pretest, posttest, and adjusted posttest for the 60 students in the study. Computations between various scores showed that the gains on the vocabulary test and on the comprehension  test were due to the increase in the number of items attempted on the posttest. The results also indicated that when the posttest scores were adjusted to control for the number of items attempted, there were mean losses on the vocabulary and comprehension tests. The findings suggest that the validity of such tests to measure growth in a rapid reading course are highly suspect. (Author/HOD)",

After briefly describing each of the five components of the program, (Survey/Read/Recite/Record/Review), the paper describes three pilot studies that tested the technique with three different groups: engineers, secondary school administrators, and seventh grade students. The paper then reports the following conclusions based on the studies: (1) reading-study methods controlled by teachers rather than by students may be the distinguishing feature that causes such methods to be recognized on a broader scale, and (2)  perhaps the most effective way to influence student use of reading-study techniques independently is to use them in the classroom.

Initially, the absence of sufficient reinforcement material in the basal readers required increased amounts of reading practice material, so small readers using the adopted preprimer vocabulary were written, printed, and distributed to the children. Once the children mastered a specific reading exercise, they received new pages with additional words. Progressively more difficult materials were made for the children moving ahead, and additional materials were available for children needing extensive reinforcement. Comprehension checks were built into the  program in the form of oral and written question tasks, and vocabulary tasks keyed to specific stories. This highly individualized program resulted in significant increases in reading achievement for first and second grade students. Factors critical to the success of the program included (1) political support by the school board and administrators, (2) coordination of all federally funded reading programs with the school's program, (3) reading many materials over extended periods of time, (4) abundant materials, and (5) \"teacher trainers\" to help each teacher implement the program.

Because of its complexity, the task of reading requires strategies for controlling the proliferation of hypotheses. Four of these strategies are (1) jumping to conclusions, (2) maintaining inertia (refusing to abandon a hypothesis in spite of contradictory evidence), (3) relying on background knowledge, and (4) working backwards from the goal (choosing hypotheses that are clearly and directly related to the goal despite insufficient evidence). These strategies are necessary and are used to good effect by successful readers, but they also sometimes lead to unexpected difficulties. Understanding the reading process from this perspective of hypothesis testing can help teachers diagnose  underlying causes of poor reading comprehension. Examples from oral protocols of children and adults answering questions about a reading test passage illustrate both the effective use of the strategies and some of the problems arising from their use.

The report presents the results of an exploratory coding of a sample of basal reader stories and children's trade books, and then discusses the coding, which revealed a distribution of types of conflict, inside view, and point of view that may increase the distance from the text that a reader feels and may provide inadequate  preparation for the full range of stories that a skilled reader is likely to encounter.

The series analyzed were &quot;Pathfinder,&quot; published by Allyn and Bacon; &quot;Reading 720,&quot; by Ginn and Company; &quot;Bookmark Reading Program,&quot; by Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich; &quot;Houghton Mifflin Reading Series&quot;; and &quot;Basics in Reading,&quot; by Scott, Foresman and Company. These series were chosen because of their current copyright dates and because they were leading sellers and were promoted widely. The analysis revealed that the manuals gave more attention to assessment and practice than to direct, explicit instruction. When instruction did appear in the manuals, the connection between what was being taught and how to read was  either minimized or entirely overlooked. As a result, identifying referents for pronouns, distinguishing between fact and opinion, finding topic sentences, and similar activities became ends in themselves. One possible consequence is that children receiving the instruction will be unable to see the relationship between what is done when they read in school and what they should do when they read on their own. Finally, the large number of written exercises supplied by the programs might discourage children from wanting to read on their own. (FL)",

Nor do they account for reader-specific factors such as interest and the purpose for reading. Second, readability formulas lack solid statistical grounding. The most respected formulas have been validated by test lessons that were intended only as practice exercises, never as measures of text comprehensibility or as indicators of reading  ability across age, class, or cultural groups. Third, readability formulas are used inappropriately in two of the contexts in which they appear to be most valuable.

Recent examinations of instructional practices suggest that there are not many worthwhile teaching practices for developing or improving comprehension. If teachers can better understand the nature of reading comprehension and learning, they will have a basis for determining what might facilitate the development of comprehension. From the schema theory perspective, the following considerations can serve as guidelines to implement reading comprehension curriculum changes which  determine whether the reader (1) has relevant schemata for understanding a text, (2) engages the appropriate schemata during reading, (3) exhibits flexible processing across different texts read for different purposes, (4) understands the text adequately, and (5) recognizes how to transfer this knowledge to other reading situations.

Four preschool children--one with many prereading skills and three with few skills--participated in the study. Student-teacher interaction that occurred in an early reading lesson was compared with that occurring in a later lesson to determine if differences existed between the teacher's interaction patterns with the &quot;high knowledge&quot; child and with the &quot;lower knowledge&quot; children. The results showed that over time, the children did learn how to make more accurate and more extensive use of social patterns to participate in a lesson. An analysis of the teacher's interaction with the four  students revealed that the teacher was affected by the &quot;high knowledge&quot; student's displays of competence and tended to repeat, acknowledge, or praise that child's answers more frequently than those of the other children. The findings of the study suggest that the problem of how to interact with a group of children rather than with one child can be resolved by routine use of a familiar participation pattern--by using exactly the same set of tasks. Such a pattern would allow the teacher to gradually diminish his or her role in the learning process. (FL)",

Hebrew was the target language of the study, because a change of vowel signs in Hebrew may or may not involve a change in the phonemic value of the words. Also, Hebrew readers begin reading instruction with words in which vocalic information is transmitted by vowel signs written below and above the letters, later learning to read the same words without the vowel signs. The 80 fourth grade students in the study were asked to name Hebrew words by their letters only,  with the words sometimes \"vowelized\" correctly, sometimes either \"unvowelized\" or \"misvowelized\" in a way that either preserved or did not preserve phonemic values. When these data were compared with related data on college students, it was found that both the children and the adults were unable to resist grapheme-to-phoneme translation, that both children and adults benefited from redundant information in their normal reading, and that children, but not adults, were sensitive to minor changes in graphemes that still preserved phonemic values.

There were also effects that suggest the three cultural groups used somewhat different strategies for choosing initial and final sentences and for making narratives internally cohesive. Social class, sex of student, and school location (suburban versus inner city) did not appear to affect the task. (Author/RL)",

The analysis of data in the first study showed that a significant improvement on the Nelson-Denny Reading Comprehension test scores accompanied an improvement in the quality of posttest text flowcharts produced by experimental students. In the second study, an experimental group of less skilled readers improved significantly more than a comparable control group on the Nelson-Denny Reading Comprehension test. On another comprehension test, designed to  measure students' sensitivity to interpropositional relations, experimental students performed significantly better than control students. In addition to the statistical analyses in the second study, samples from experimental-group students' written products were subjected to in-depth analyses.

The study examined the cultural and situational differences in one aspect of communication: the use of internal report, or words used to refer to internal states, processes, or experiences. Conversations produced by 39 preschool children from different socioeconomic and racial backgrounds were recorded in two different situations--dinnertime at home and during teacher directed activity at preschool.

Adjunct materials included such instructor devised aids as study questions, graphic organizers of text concepts, discussion statements, and vocabulary guides. The guides emphasized critical reading of text concepts by including questions or statements that not only fostered students' understanding of explicit information in the text, but extended this understanding through interpretive and evaluative items. Faculty and students in the two academic disciplines of history and philosophy were selected for participation in  the project. An evaluation of the project indicated that while both the philosophy and the history portions of the project contributed to students' critical reading, the history-reading minicourse combination was the most successful of the two.

        "description":"A study analyzed the cohesive elements found within a text and the difficulty of their resolution within a particular text structure. The specific cohesive form used was pronominal reference. Each of forty-four students in grades ten through twelve was asked to read, sentence by sentence, a text which contained pronouns and pronoun referents. They were interrupted occasionally and asked to report the correct referent for a pronoun that had appeared in a sentence they had just completed reading. With this probe task motivating them, the subjects' reading times were found to be closely related to structural properties of the text. Text variables found to be important included the number of potential referents available, &quot;topicalization&quot; of the correct referent, staging of referents  to the correct or to the alternative noun phrases, and the degree of ambiguity of the semantic constraints within the target sentence. The results supported a reinstatement theory in which a number of available, potential referents are brought into memory at the time a pronoun is encountered. The selection of a single referent from the set of potential referents is based upon a set of rules that are sensitive to the staging of ideas within the text and to features of surface syntactic structure as well as to propositional content.

Thus a \"cognitivistic-mentalistic\" rather than a behavioristic analysis of the reading act will occur. However, future instructional trends will not and should not eliminate the positive attributes of the structure of scope, sequence, and pacing that are inherent in various basal reading programs. Diagnosis and instruction may be influenced by what we learn about factors such as specialized brain functioning, auditory-visual integration, bioneurological differences between boys and girls, and cognitive style. Instruction will be differentiated by factors  related to what an individual can learn and how the individual might learn most efficiently, rather than by when instruction \"should\" occur. Though traditional diagnostic procedures will continue to dominate the educational setting, the enriched perspective that may result from the understanding of learning factors such as auditory-visual integration abilities may help us to understand the more difficult cases of reading problems where individuals were unable to originally develop particular skills or could not take advantage of subsequent concentrated instructional activities aimed at teaching these skills.

Consequently, the International Reading Association (IRA) has passed a resolution recognizing the right and responsibility of parents to monitor their children's education, but opposing policies that deny children access to certain reading materials. The most vicious censorship battles seem to occur when a teacher or principal refuses to listen to a parental complaint and in school districts that do not have clear procedures for dealing with complaints. The best defense against censorship is to form a local group familiar with the strategies of censorship  organizations and to initiate a dialogue in order to deal with legitimate complaints. Other strategies include keeping written statements of text selection criteria and course objectives on file, establishing well-publicized complaint procedures, and carefully matching individual students with selected texts. IRA members at state and local levels can also join with other educators to handle censorship attempts effectively and with the educational well-being of students as the primary goal. (HTH)",

These stereotypes increase with age and become particularly debilitating for females in math achievement. Though reading is strongly identified as \"feminine,\" boys are apparently resiliant enough to overcome the stereotype. The identification of reading as feminine is not true universally and is more closely associated with North American countries. However, while sex differences in reading are common before age ten in the United States, they tend to disappear by adulthood. One possible explanation for this is that after elementary school, reading is no longer defined as a course  but as a process, and becomes an essential tool in all school classes. An examination of studies that have analyzed sex differences in reading and math--after controlling for intelligence, reading readiness, spatial ability, and differential course taking--reveals that cultural and environmental factors are the primary explanations for such differences.

        "author":["Stovall, James Glen"],
        "description":"From the breakin through the pardon of President Nixon, the London &quot;Times&quot; maintained thorough coverage of the Watergate scandal--a difficult task, considering the complexities of the American judicial and political systems. A special Watergate section was added to the other sections of the &quot;Times,&quot; and even the British parliamentary election campaign failed to move Watergate from the front page. Editorially, the &quot;Times&quot; was at first sympathetic to President Nixon, and as the investigation was undertaken by all three branches of government, the &quot;Times&quot; accused the Washington &quot;Post&quot; of creating a &quot;trial by press&quot; situation by its persistent involvement. However, the &quot;Times&quot; later ran an editorial pointing out that the American judicial system was different from that of the  British, and when Nixon refused to give up the crucial tape recordings, the &quot;Times&quot; could no longer support him. The working reporters for the &quot;Times&quot; were anti-Nixon from the beginning of the story, exhibiting a bias that showed plainly in their news columns. The major difference between the American and the British press was that the latter was unencumbered by &quot;objectivity.&quot; The major strength of &quot;Times&quot; coverage of Watergate was a thorough understanding of the intricacies of the American political process and a &quot;special relationship&quot; between many British and American journalists.

        "description":"Because student-teacher conferences appear to be more effective than other methods of writing evaluation, a study was conducted to observe how students' writing changed over a semester and whether those changes were related to the conversations in student-teacher conferences. Two college freshman composition students--one strong and one weak writer--were observed during four conferences with their teacher. The topic of conversation was the basic unit of analysis. The number of times a topic was mentioned did not necessarily correspond to the proportion of the conference time devoted to the topic. The weak writer showed a preoccupation with mechanical errors, and the teacher worked to keep the focus off mechanics by trying to shorten the discussion of the issue each time the  student brought it up. It was only by admitting the validity of the student's concern and suggesting a strategy for handling that concern that the teacher could finally focus on idea development. The stronger writer was concerned with generating ideas, while the teacher was concerned with organization. These two students had individual concerns while the teacher had similar but not identical concerns for each student. The teacher was able to converse with the stronger writer about shared concerns much earlier in the semester than with the weaker writer, indicating that shared concerns are at the base of effective teaching and learning.

Factor analysis located five principal television viewing motivations: passing time, information, entertainment, companionship, and escape. Canonical correlation analysis identified two viewer types. The first viewer type--the one who used television out of habit, to pass the time, and for entertainment--exhibited sizable levels of television viewing, affinity (the importance of television in the life of the respondent), and realism (how realistic the television portrayals were perceived to be). The second viewer type used television to  seek information or to learn, but not for escape. This motivational pattern resulted in overall higher levels of television viewing, particularly of talk-interview, news, and game show programs. Multiple regression analyses indicated that motivational structures of television viewing were useful in explaining television viewing levels, affinity, and realism. (Author/RL)",

        "description":"Library historians and historians of literacy have been more creative than journalism historians in using individual-level historical data such as deeds, wills, depositions, surveys, and census figures to study reading behaviors of the past. For example, the series of family cost of living surveys conducted in the United States by state and federal bureaus of labor statistics in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries can be of great use to journalism historians. These studies of working class family budgets include detailed information on family makeup, income, and expenditures--including expenditures on reading materials. A computer analysis of a sample of cotton textile worker budgets taken from an 1889-90 survey found that expenditures for newspapers were associated  in interesting ways with family income, region of residence, ethnicity, and family life cycle. The analysis also found some evidence that working class families read newspapers more for diversion or amusement than for educational or self-improvement purposes. (FL)",

        "description":"In February 1942, a letter to the editor of the Pittsburgh &quot;Courier,&quot; the nation's largest black owned newspaper, started the &quot;Double V&quot; (for victory at home and victory abroad) campaign, which stressed the right of blacks to have equality in the United States since they were fighting inequality abroad. As the &quot;Courier&quot; devoted a great deal of newspaper space to the campaign, the campaign was endorsed by many other black owned newspapers as well as by white owned papers and organizations. A content analysis shows, however, that the campaign was virtually dead by October 1942, which is significant because it was the first evidence that any black owned paper outside the South had cut back on the campaign and because the &quot;Courier&quot; had originated the campaign. One possible  explanation for the gradually toned-down campaign of the &quot;Courier&quot; is that the war-time prosperity of middle class blacks demanded a movement that would conserve black progress rather than one that might undo it. Black men were being commissioned for the first time in the armed forces, and black men and women were being hired in large numbers at defense plants. The Double V campaign had accomplished all that it was able to accomplish. As the campaign began to decline, the &quot;Courier&quot; demonstrated its good faith by replacing campaign material with positive articles and picture layouts about black gains. (HTH)",

It is important, therefore, for teachers of these courses to develop a systematic method of evaluating all writing assignments. One method of doing this is to concentrate on elements common to all such assignments. These are (1) purpose--what the writing is to make a public think or do; (2) persuasive strategy--how copy achieves its purpose; (3) medium--the appropriate style, format, and presentation; (4) accuracy--the facts, grammar, spelling, and punctuation; (5) creativity--originality in approach, strategy, and use of medium; and (6) effectiveness--why a piece of writing did or did not work. As each writing assignment is  made, the teacher might give the students a &quot;prewriting form,&quot; to help them focus their work. (A copy of a prewriting form is attached.) (FL)",

        "description":"A study examined the use of cable television in the context of general patterns of media use and habits of media users. Data came from telephone interviews with approximately 600 household heads, a third of whom did not subscribe to cable television. Information gathered included respondents' use of newspapers, television, and radio. Cable subscribers were asked their reasons for subscribing to cable television, the programs they watched on cable, their satisfaction with those programs, and the impact of cable television on their normal media use habits. Results showed that cable television subscribers were drawn disproportionately from home owners, married viewers, and those with children at home. Movies were most often viewed by those who rented their homes, single viewers, and  the young. Sports programs were more popular with renters than with home owners, the young, and the male audience members. Religious programs were more popular with the stable, older members of the audience, and with those who had less formal education than with audience members who were more highly educated. In terms of the effect of cable television on the use of other media, the findings were inconclusive. There was, however, a suggestion that use of radio for news and weather information was adversely affected by cable use. (FL)",

        "description":"Test-study spelling instruction (diagnostic-prescriptive) involves a pretest on words, practice with mispelled words, and a posttest. Study-test spelling (nondiagnostic-prescriptive) involves the study of all words, known or not known, followed by a test. A review of the literature reveals overwhelming support for the test-study method, but it is almost impossible to find a test-study basal program in use today. A study was conducted among 25 second-grade classrooms, in which the teachers, using a study-test text, agreed to pretest their students on Monday rather than on Wednesday (as recommended in the text) and again on Friday. All other aspects of the weekly schedule were followed. Analysis of the pretests and posttests showed that students learned only 2.9 words per week and  almost half of the students scored 80% or higher on the pretest. One-half of the students had little need for instruction and learned fewer than three words during 75 minutes of instruction per week. The study indicates that study-test spelling instruction prevents teachers from knowing whether instruction is needed and from determining the number of words that are learned each week. Study-test instruction also forces students to spend time studying words already known. (HOD)",

The answers that follow each question are derived from an earlier study of handwriting instruction undertaken in Ontario, Canada, schools. The questions in the first section of the booklet deal with current handwriting instruction practices in Ontario schools and provide a general view of how handwriting should be taught in the elementary schools. The questions in the second section consider handwriting instruction for preschool and kindergarten children. The third section presents ideas for printing instruction in grades one and two, while section four deals with handwriting instruction in grades three through six. Section five considers ways to  evaluate students' handwriting, and section six suggests ways for improving handwriting instruction for left-handed students and children with learning disabilities. The final question considers possible future directions for handwriting instruction in Ontario schools. (HOD)",

        "description":"The basic communication skills of prospective teachers at the University of Georgia were assessed with knowledge and performance instruments. The knowledge instrument was a criterion referenced test in communicative arts (logical reasoning, library research, composition, language, communications media and careers, literature, reading, and oral communication). The performance measures included teaching plans and materials, classroom procedures, and interpersonal skills. Other data, such as the National Teacher Examination (NTE) scores and ratings by cooperating teachers or university supervisors, were also collected. The data show the general estimates of the interns' ability to write but not of their ability to teach writing. These correlations also show that commonly used  objective measures like the NTE or criterion referenced tests follow the same pattern. In comparing these results with assessment results from two other states, four conclusions can be drawn: (1) teacher candidates are being checked for basic skills, (2) the primary mode for checking their writing is a direct measure of writing, (3) most English teacher candidates pass these writing tests, and (4) assessments of the writing skill of prospective teachers might identify their writing ability, but not their ability to teach writing.

The fourth chapter explores the impact of reading aloud to children. Chapter five examines the various curricular areas for literature opportunities, while chapter six contains examples of how eight teachers successfully integrated literature into the curriculum. Chapters seven and eight suggest resources that can enhance the literature curriculum, and offer hints for ways to involve parents and other volunteers in the program. A summary chapter restates the purpose of the booklet and presents an example of how many curricular areas can be &quot;webbed&quot; around one book. (FL)",

        "description":"A policy capturing approach was used in a study that investigated teacher judgment during the selection of instructional activities. This approach uses a simple (usually linear regression) model to reproduce the inferential responses of a particular judge. Central to the approach is the manner in which the judge weighs and combines information in the form of discernable cues or features of the objects being judged. Nineteen fourth and fifth grade teachers were given descriptions of 32 language arts instructional activities reflecting five dimensions that teachers use to judge the quality of teaching materials: (1) amount of student involvement, (2) difficulty for students, (3) integration with other skills or subject matter, (4) demand on teacher time, and (5) fit between stated  purpose and instructional process. Individual and composite models showed that integration, difficulty, and demand were the most influential judgment dimensions for the teachers. However, the findings suggest that in a realistically complex judgment task teachers use a wider variety of information than can be represented adequately by a linear regression model. (FL)",

The paper notes that both these criteria espouse a Platonic view of criticism, which regards literature and literary response in terms of its rhetorical effects rather than its aesthetic structure. It then offers analyses of two works, Ernest Hemingway's &quot;The Killers&quot; and Robert Bolt's &quot;A Man for All Seasons,&quot; as examples of how &quot;content and feeling&quot; approaches to literature can misconstrue literary meaning, affect the role of  the teacher, and influence educational policy. Finally, the paper suggests an alternative approach that argues for the critical response and the perception of literary form as the basis for literary experience and curriculum design. (FL)",

        "description":"Thirty-two speech anxious college students participated in a study that examined whether four treatments that have been effective when applied separately would be equally effective when applied in combination. The treatments were (1) systemic desensitization (SD), (2) speech skills training (SST), (3) SST combined with coping skills training (CST) involving relaxation and self-instructional training, and (4) SST, CST, and paradoxical directives. Subjects were pretested and then assigned to one of the four treatment groups or to a control group. At the end of a six-week treatment period, all subjects were posttested. The results showed that treatments for speech anxiety that involved coping skills in combination with speech skills were more effective in reducing speech anxiety  than were other treatments. Specifically, adding coping skills training to speech skills training resulted in reduced self-reported speech anxiety, reduced ratings of behavioral anxiety, and reduced reports of general communication anxiety.

        "author":["Meyrowitz, Joshua"],
        "description":"Students have little intuitive insight into the process of thinking and structuring ideas. The image of metaphor for a phenomenon acts as a kind of methodology for the study of the phenomenon by (1) defining the key issues or problems; (2) shaping the type of research questions that are asked; (3) defining the type of data that are searched out; (4) shaping the language in which the problem and results are expressed; (5) determining the procedures that are used to examine and collect data; and (6) determining what problems, questions, data, and procedures are ignored. For example, the most common metaphor for a medium is that it is a kind of \"conveyor belt.\" The medium is seen as a passive delivery system of important messages. A very different metaphor for a medium is that it is  a \"language,\" that is, a specific way of encoding a message. This leads to the analysis of production variables or a study of the expressive potential of the particular medium. In television and film such variables as shot selection, choice of lens, camera angles, and so on can be studied to see how they affect perception and interpretation of the content. A third possible metaphor in media research is \"environment.\" The medium is seen as a type of social context or social situation that includes and excludes participants. The use of metaphors is one way to start students thinking about thinking before they fully realize it. (HOD)",

The study assessed the level of interest in the program of 13 adolescent and 38 adult Hispanic-American viewers and of 23 members of the general audience. Data were collected through focus group discussions, questionnaires, and the Program Evaluation Analysis Computer (PEAC), which monitors viewers' moment-to-moment responses to a program. Overall response to the show was positive. The adolescent Hispanic group  was very satisfied with the program as it was. However, the two adult groups expressed diverging concerns--the Hispanics reported that the program did not go far enough in providing positive role models for those experiencing integration, while the general audience suggested that the program did not do enough to satisfy their desire for information about traditional Hispanic culture.

The paper begins by providing a rationale for the concern about regulating electronic news. Next, it discusses the developing technology of teletext (one-way transmission) and videotext (two-way transmission) systems, defining and categorizing the systems and their associated terms. The paper then shifts to the legal questions associated with  electronic publishing, offering information on electronic information systems as they relate to three types of media (broadcasting, telephone, and cable). Following a discussion of the constitutional aspects of electronic information systems, particularly the First Amendment rights of broadcasters and cable operators, the paper lists some of the future problems inherent in electronic publishing, developing the conclusion that these problems appear to presage more rather than less government regulation.

        "description":"Despite its rapid rise as leader of the religious broadcasting industry, Jim Bakker's &quot;PTL Club&quot; (People That Love) has experienced numerous financial problems. In 1979, three former PTL vice-presidents charged that the club was diverting thousands of dollars in donations for missionary projects to the club's general fund to pay bills. The subsequent Federal Communications Commission (FCC) investigation shifted Bakker's role from evangelist to Chairman of the Board, and his relationship with his congregation from that of shepherd and flock to that of executive and stockholders. Nonetheless, Bakker attempted to divert his followers' attention by repeatedly denouncing the press, the FCC, and the government from the pulpit (citing religious persecution), and by persuading his  congregation to dismiss the allegations and concentrate instead upon their role as Bakker's partners in defending the Faith. With his unethical but successful rhetorical strategy, Bakker appears to be creating a closed society as a leader possessing ultimate power and control over a group of fiercely devoted followers with a common enemy--any person opposing his ministry. However, his persuasive strategy may diminish the credibility of other ministries, having already lost the endorsement of many notable Christian leaders. (HTH)",

Four field interviews with supervisors responsible for training and evaluating professionals were subjected to phenomenological content analysis. Unlike the methods of experimental science, phenomenological analysis seeks to determine the meaning of experience for the participant rather than to describe the relationships among the variables in behavior as observed by nonparticipants. Analysis of the interviews revealed their essential themes, which were then integrated into a description of the fundamental structure of the positive supervisory experience. The results indicate that supervision focuses on resolution of those conflicts affecting a supervisee's acquisition  of or improvement in a professional role. The supervisor resolves the conflicts by structuring the experience so that congruent perceptions of the supervisee's problems emerge. As the supervisee experiences success, the focus of supervision shifts to examination of more personal conflicts; the supervisee governs the rate of disclosure. The supervisor controls the depth of his or her involvement in this personal exploration. Learning and growth are evident in both the supervisor and the supervisee as conflicts over ending the relationship are resolved. (Author/PGD)",

This report describes the design and analysis of this study and demonstrates how the resulting information was used to reformulate the state's policy and program for school improvement. The paper documents the utility of Knott and Wildavsky's seven proposed standards as a framework for assessing a successful knowledge utilization activity. In conclusion, the paper argues that the high impact of the interview study on policy revision was due in part to the identification of consensus among groups of educational administrators and to the provision of a systematic research-based way to bring the linguistic  and conceptual frameworks of the educational administrators to bear on the problem of revising the school improvement policy. It is also suggested that Knott and Wildavsky's standards might be useful for both planning and documenting knowledge utilization activities directed toward policy revision. (Author/PGD)",

In fact, when a high percentage of the population attains a certain level of education, that attainment ceases to provide socioeconomic benefits; instead, those few who have not reached that educational level find themselves suffering from socioeconomic liabilities. Some of the relationships between educational attainment and socioeconomic benefits are explored in the two mathematical models discussed in this paper. The Aggregate Model rests upon idealized normal distributions of benefits and educational attainment within a meritocratic society. The Probabilistic Utility Model assumes more flexible distributions. The models indicate  that, at least in theory, educational policies that seem to promote equity may in fact cause socioeconomic hardships and disequilibrium. (Author/PGD)",

Blau has demonstrated that as organizations increase in size, the levels of hierarchy and the number of horizontal components increase at a decelerating rate with the result that large organizations have proportionately fewer administrators than do smaller organizations. Hypotheses were tested explicating such aspects of the theory as the relationships between increasing size and horizontal and vertical differentiation, administrative ratio, and relative size of components. It was found that, in the main, Blau's theory substantially explains the occurrence of increased subunits, increased coordinators, and proportional decreases in the administrative ratio as a consequence  of increased size.

Desegregation plans typically bring together two diverse communities--the white middle class and the minority poor--and often effect cataclysmic change. In this circumstance, the principal must remain strongly committed to desegregation, be willing to take risks in building a positive school climate, and make his or her personal presence felt. A positive school climate is generated when all parties work together toward a common purpose. Recognition for conscientious staff work with personal and public commendation and sharing of worthwhile ideas can reinforce cooperative teamwork. Other important principal behaviors  include providing leadership, practicing active listening skills, and being highly visible in the school building. In the initial years of desegregating a school, discipline is an important issue. Parental involvement in determining discipline policy helps all to feel that the program is fair and consistent. Finally, principals must address the problem of white flight. There are several steps they can take to provide a positive busing experience and encourage families to stay in the district. (WD)",

        "description":"An adequate theory of educational administration demands an emphasis on understanding rather than legitimation; the inclusion of qualitative as well as quantitative constructs; and the incorporation of philosophical concerns, especially those dealing with epistemology and ethics. Developments in the &quot;new sociology&quot; of education and in the ethnography of schooling offer the possibility of developing such a theory which would focus on the relationships between structures of knowledge and of control, the influence of educational administration in mediating such structures, and its impact on the processes of cultural negotiation and transmission. The new sociology of education claims that previous studies of education have failed to examine the assumptions that lay behind the  sociological analysis of schooling. Over the past decade, a substantial body of ethnographic and observational data has become available that cannot be adequately interpreted within the currently dominant bureaucratic/organizational models of schooling. The established need to include assessments of people's understanding, aspirations, meanings, and interests in any analysis of educational organizations is clearly capable of amalgamation with the traditions of educational ethnography. The alternative theory, outlined here, might be based upon Weick's application of loose coupling to educational administration, with the addition of a cultural dimension. (Author/WD)",

        "description":"Dominant theories of educational administration have viewed the field as a rational and technical science concerned with the bureaucratic control of education. These theories have recently come under attack for ideological and empirical reasons. More current theories characterize educational administration as less rational objective, and structured and emphasize the &quot;loose coupling&quot; of the units or events within education and the tighter coupling of education as a whole with the external environment. The theory of loose coupling can be taken a step further to the &quot;cultural coupling&quot; theory maintaining that educational organizations, although they may have tight internal coupling, respond not to technical or rational demands but to the external demands of the surrounding culture.  This theory of cultural coupling refers to the employment of myths, metaphors, and ceremonial categories as processes of coupling among educational organizations and between these institutions and their environments. This view of educational administration sees administrators as negotiating cultural claims and legitimizing them within the school. This model may help reconcile the long-standing divergence of administrative theory from practice. (Author/JM)",

Data were collected through personal interviews and analyzed through &quot;phenomenological content analysis.&quot; Four very different images of effectiveness emerged. The first image or conception emphasized program characteristics of effective high schools. The second image focused on the characteristics of personnel as the central determinants of effectiveness. Rules, regulations, and job descriptions were emphasized in the third image, the bureaucratic conception of effectiveness. The last image, a unified concept, combined characteristics of the other images and appeared to view effectiveness  more holistically. The most frequent image was a combination of the program and personnel images. Ways to check the construct validity of the images include the use of Cronbach's definition of construct validity, an examination of the internal logical consistency among images, and an analysis of the responses organized into chart form. Metaphors and assumptions about the purposes of schooling can be inferred from the images. (Author/JM)",

Questionnaires asked about the functions and characteristics of middle schools regarding (1) students, (2) teachers, (3) principals, (4) curriculum, and (5) facilities and organization. Data analyses included an examination of frequency of responses across the five categories for each item, examination of the mean item responses, intercorrelation and factor analysis of the items, and investigation of the responses aggregated within the five major areas. In addition to revealing opinions regarding each aspect of the middle school, overall findings indicated general agreement among  principals and movement leaders within the five subcategories, although both groups responded within the context of their roles, movement leaders being concerned with promoting effective middle schools and principals being concerned with instructional leadership. In addition, principals and movement leaders did not support the national emphasis on training teachers specifically to work with early adolescents nor did they see the need for utilizing research findings in the classroom. All emphasized basic skills but stressed the need for maintaining a balanced curriculum. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Consequences of the first allocation of public aid to independent schools in British Columbia in 1979 and 1980 were explored in this study. Interviews and questionnaires were used to query principals, education committee (or school board) members in private schools, and superintendents and presidents of teachers' associations in public schools. Three high officials of independent school associations were also interviewed. Findings (which are considered only tentative) suggest that the effects of British Columbia's program of aid to independent schools have been overwhelmingly positive, although some independent school leaders have expressed discomfort and worry about the accompanying regulatory procedures. Overall morale in insolvent independent schools apparently has been  raised. The most affluent schools have been the most cautious about becoming dependent on the aid, using it almost entirely for scholarships, but more insolvent schools have readily allocated the funds for basic operating expenses, making it unlikely that they could withdraw from the program. There is little evidence of notable effects of the program on public schools, although public school leaders are fearful of enrollment loss, particularly of brighter students. A future study will look at effects on the social climate of schools. (Author/JM)",

The social indicators are to help formulate U.S. foreign policy and will be used by the State Department's Bureau of Human Rights in its annual country reports to Congress. Problems in selecting indicators of adequate living standards include data accuracy, data comparability across diverse cultures, appropriateness of the measures to U.S. policy, and proper interpretation of the indicators when making policy. In light of these problems, ten criteria were developed for the selection and presentation of the indicators. Education, health, nutrition, and  income emerged as the basic needs to cover. Within these limits, the Bureau selected 12 social indicators, including infant mortality rate, population growth rate, primary school enrollment rate, household income shares, and calory supply per capita. Because of the change from the Carter to the Reagan administration, the indicators may not be used, but the process of choosing the indicators has helped clarify the issues and problems surrounding social indicators.

The first section includes two papers: one reviews common textbooks and other writings on educational administration to show how organizational theory is implemented in practice, and the other argues the utility of multiple perspectives in understanding organizational behavior. The second section offers an inventory of models, theoretical/logical structures, and  interorganizational perspectives that are presently being discussed as alternatives to the bureaucratic view. Section 3 reviews the literature on the dynamic elements of organizations: communication, power, and making sense of organizational experience. The fourth section summarizes the major challenges to the dominant (bureaucratic) organizational perspective being posed by contemporary organizational theorists. (Author/WD)",

Two basic assumptions made are that innovation depends on multiple factors and that innovation itself is a three-stage process involving initiation, implementation, and incorporation into an organizational structure. The most important of the stages is implementation. The distinction between educational reform, which happens at the system-wide level, and educational innovation, which occurs at much lower levels, dictates that research on the implementation of innovations must focus on the \"micro\" level, that of the school and the classroom. A summary of research on the determinants of implementation indicates that they comprise four sets of factors, including the  nature of the innovation, the characteristics of the school, the attitudes and attributes of the teachers, and the particular strategies chosen for implementation. However, researchers on innovation should not ignore the role of larger sociopolitical influences, such as the lack of long-term continuity in governmental policies. (RW)",

Thirteen elementary principals were interviewed to discover the strategies used by principals before referring a student for special education, as well as the preparatory activities they engaged in prior to multidisciplinary team (MDT) and individual educational program (IEP) meetings. The principals' responses regarding their role in such meetings reflected a lack of consensus. In general, the principals viewed themselves as responsible for insuring that students who require special education receive the needed services. Most often principals perform a validating role in which their  presence at MDT and IEP meetings lends greater validity to the proceedings. Specific suggestions for principals include getting all relevant people involved in such meetings, helping participants define their roles, and periodically monitoring the progress of special education students.

        "description":"The Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM) has been designed to describe change as it affects individuals and to prompt more successful change efforts. CBAM views the teacher as the focal point in school improvement efforts, yet also acknowledges social and organizational influences. This paper describes the application of the model to a curriculum implementation effort in revising the science curriculum in grades three to six in the 80 elementary schools of Jefferson County (Colorado). The design for curriculum implementation was based on an understanding of teachers' concerns and how they change over time. Two CBAM measures of teacher change were used: Stages of Concern About the Innovation and Levels of Use of the Innovation. These measures and their application to a  representative sample of teachers are explained. Some of the study's results have direct implications for facilitators of change efforts. First, that the actions taken by building principals to support or inhibit a change effort have direct effect on how teachers feel about and ultimately use a new program. Secondly, implementing an innovation takes more than one year. Change facilitators and policymakers should set realistic expectations for themselves, teachers, administrators, and evaluators.

        "description":"The Arizona state legislature met from November 1979 to April 1980 for the sole purpose of restructuring and codifying rules that define school financial policy and reforming tax structures that support educational institutions. This case study investigated the role of special interest groups in shaping state educational policy at that session. Data collection activities were structured around identifying (1) the special interest groups or individuals that attempted to influence the legislature; (2) the major issues or concerns of these groups; (3) the methods of contact employed; and (4) the extent to which those individuals or groups were successful. Data were collected by means of a mail survey of all 90 state legislators and all special interest groups and by open-ended  interviews with 51 legislators and 52 representatives of special interest groups. Content analysis was used to analyze the data. The demographic and economic factors that precipated the special session are explained and the policy results of the special session reviewed. The special interest groups are identified, their concerns summarized, and methods of contact and influence discussed. The conclusion states that educational policy relative to school finance in Arizona is not being shaped by any special interest groups. (Author/MLF)",

        "description":"Characterized by rapid growth and the increasing infusion of federal money into schools, the 1960s and 1970s can be labeled the &quot;Federal Era&quot; in U.S. educational policy making. This period produced three major initiatives to enhance the quality of educational opportunity: the Elementary Secondary Education Act (ESEA) Titles I and VII (Compensatory and Bilingual Education) and the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (EHCA). Both the ESEA and EHCA were conventional products of a broad social concern. However, policy initiation did not occur through traditional avenues or agents. The executive and legislative branches of government, rather than educational representatives, designed the bills and pressed for their enactment. In implementation, then, the exclusion of educators  began to backfire as administrators and school board organizations decried the burden of onerous federal regulations. The conditions leading to the passage of ESEA and EHCA are unlikely to occur again. Moreover, developing demographic, economic, and political trends portend limited future federal interest in educational policy issues. There is little likelihood of federal resources being allocated to educational programs at the expense of federal initiatives in other areas. The major burden of support for public schools and their improvement will likely rest with state and local governments. (WD)",

        "description":"The reading and writing behavior of seven mildly mentally retarded and 12 moderately retarded adolescents was analyzed. Data were collected in the classroom on 11 language tasks, including drawing, forming letters and numbers, and performing general print production. Ss were also asked to answer historical/experiential questions and conceptual/qualitative questions about reading and writing. Ss' book handling knowledge and oral reading skills were also examined. Attitudes toward reading and writing, parental attitudes and models of reading, and the relationship between language and home environment was noted. Miscue analysis was also performed. Among research findings were that the home did not appear to be an instrumental factor in acquiring and using reading skills in the Ss;  although all moderately retarded Ss could reproduce writing expected of them in a particular program, none could produce meaningful or original thought through written language; and the reading comprehension of the mildly retarded Ss was heavily dependent on sight word identification and utilization of the graphophonemic language cue system. Thirteen implications included the need to infuse a practical awareness of reading and writing in the home environment, the importance of meaningful reading and writing to students, and the value of observing adults, siblings, and friends gain pleasure from reading.

The project has accommodated five major shifts in generally held concepts about young handicapped children, including the general recognition of the need for early intervention, the increased role of the parents, and a greater realization of the infant's competence. Intervention in the behavioral-developmental orientation included classroom programs for infants/toddlers, an integrated toddler class, a toddler class strictly for handicapped children, a preschool class, an integrated kindergarten class, and a public school  special education kindergarten class. A home component served underage children or families living too far from the center. Services to parents included educational, social, and advocacy assistance. Research efforts centered on examination of strategies to enhance early developmental processes and evaluation of program effect on the children. Consistent positive progress of enrolled children was demonstrated on standardized and specifically designed instruments. Further, the project provided training for university students and opportunities for onsite research. (CL)",

Six major issues were examined: strategies used by states to implement P.L. 94-142, major impact of P.L. 94-142 on the SEAs, creation of unintended and/or unforeseen consequences at the SEA level, ways in which SEAs coped with unforeseen consequences, patterns of implementation and impact, and creative coping strategies used by SEAs to implement P.L. 94-142. Among findings were high levels of staff time and effort related to the implementation of the SEA supervisory role which has yet to be fully implemented in any of the states; umbrella-type advocacy organizations influenced the implementation process;  withdrawal of services by other state agencies and creation of tensions within the SEA and between the SEA and other agencies were unintended and unforeseen consequences; and in all states, the number of professional staff within special education increased. Eight policy implications, recommendations are presented, including that the SEA supervisory provision should be changed, and that uniform implementation of related services should not be expected.

        "description":"Intelligence quotient (IQ) scores are widely accepted as measures of academic potential. However, both hereditary and environmental factors also play a role in performance. The limitations of IQ tests require that they be handled differently when administered to students from backgrounds other than the dominant cultural group. In addition, teachers, administrators, and psychologists must be weary of assigning labels to test results because these labels often tend to shape teachers' expectations. Although these facts are accepted, there is evidence that this acceptance does not readily transfer into educational practice. In some educational contexts, a disproportionate number of immigrant and minority language students are being assigned to special education classes and vocational  streams as a combined result of the indiscriminate use of mental tests and the cultural and linguistic orientation of school programs. This report reviews Canadian literature on this topic and relates the findings of a study in which teacher referral forms and psychological assessments of more than four hundred New Canadian children were analyzed. The report discusses (1) the origins of bias in IQ tests, (2) the Canadian context, (3) quantitative and qualitative analyses of the teacher referral, (4) the psychological assessment, and (5) policy implications.

Nor can an oral proficiency test, involving a lengthy tension-inducing interview and relatively inconclusive scoring, provide the information necessary for developing instructional programs. The Colorado Test measures student knowledge of the English language. In employing the test, the teacher presents the student with a question and follows it with a self-initiated structured response. As a speaking test, the test is a reliable and valid measure of language skills. However, as with all tests, success depends on the skills of the administrator to administer the test and on  the evaluator to accurately read and judge the results. The test consists of a morphology and syntax section accompanied by pictures and a phonology section in which the student is to repeat a series of minimal pairs. Directions for test administration and scoring and for the interpretation of responses are included. Test results aid in the assessment of areas for teaching concentration. Linguistic aspects of English are presented for teachers with no prior training in English linguistics. (JK)",

        "description":"The standard view of language attitudes in a creole continuum is that the creole is considered bad and the standard language is considered good. This standard view fits with the theory of decreolization by which such continua are thought to have come about. A study was carried out in Guyana in an effort to overcome the perceived limitations of the standard view. A matched guise experiment, along with other means of eliciting language attitudes in a systematic way, was conducted. The respondents were 24 persons whose speech had been sampled extensively and who represented equally the two major social classes in the community: the Estate Class, whose members worked in the fields, and the Non-Estate Class, or white collar workers. The evidence indicated that there are social class  differences in language attitudes; in particular, that while the Estate Class respondents agree with the Non-Estate Class respondents in the positive evaluation of English on one dimension, the job scale, they reveal a diametrically opposed endorsement of creole norms on other dimensions. It is suggested that the most accurate picture of language attitudes, linguistic variation, and linguistic change in creole continua is one in which it is recognized that there are ambivalent attractions to creole and English norms present in the various social classes in varying proportions.

In translating rules into the reader's perspective, reader's grammar turns them inside out. Reader's grammar does not primarily focus on rules of decoding, nor are its implications limited to reading skill. The reanalyses are of sufficient power to offer effective alternative strategies for achieving integrated, and even purely oral-aural, goals. The uniqueness of the rules of reader's grammar in both their formulation and their hierarchical relationships is demonstrated. Consequences for method of presentation and ordering in curriculum are revealed. A discussion focuses on  two primary rules of reader's grammar, generalizable across languages notwithstanding certain language-particular details. The \"analog rules of synthesizing and filtering\" represent the integrative and selective capacities of first language reading process, but with a special twist to serve as the hitherto missing link to second language reading.

        "description":"A study is undertaken to determine whether the nonlinguistic priority of the agent of an action facilitates the comprehension of word reference. The subjects were twelve male and twelve female infants at the one word stage of language production. The children were presented with three nonsense names (presented as part of a narration of a filmed action event) to learn in habituation series. Each nonsense name was associated with a puppet. Findings indicate that action role has implications for learning to name objects. In general, the infants did dishabituate to all mismatches in all conditions and transferred their knowledge of the word-referent relationship from the film presentations to the actual objects involved. The perceptual strategy of giving priority to the agent is  important in the acquisition of a word. Semantic concepts which are easier for the child to grasp may provide natural focal points for language acquisition. The data also suggest that participation in an action event increases a child's attention to a new word more than nonparticipation in an event. Specific attention directing strategies, such as giving attentional priority to the agent of the action, are critical aids to the acquisition of word-referent relationships. (Author/JK)",

A quantitative analysis of the data collected on question repertoire indicates that, in general, questions occur more often in the language in which the children are more proficient. The results show no significant difference in the number of questions asked by each child. Discussing measures of language proficiency, it is concluded that a test that measures more than one aspect of language competence is a better predictor of the speaker's communicative competence than one which  is limited to a single aspect of that competence. In addition, the paper concludes that tests currently used to measure language proficiency examine aspects of language use that are irrelevant to children's linguistic performance and fail to take into account most of the richness of the children's language repertoire. New test constructs for measuring language proficiency that are more holistic in nature and that are based on what children actually do with language need to be developed. (JK)",

        "description":"This study examines some aspects of the interaction of one Hmong family with the English-speaking community to determine what sort of language contact situations they encounter and what means they use to communicate in those situations. Observations revealed that English language use outside of the classroom was limited. The subjects did not seek out and, sometimes actively avoided, situations requiring the use of English. Where the use of English could not be avoided, communal communication strategies involving spokespersons or interpreters (occasionally a younger member of the family) were employed. Only when spokespersons were unavailable did adults attempt to communicate directly. This action questions the common assumption in second language teaching that what is taught in  the classroom will be reinforced through outside language contacts. This Hmong practice may reflect not only a lack of appropriate language learning skills but also a tradition of community isolation and self-sufficiency carried over from the Hmong experience as a geographically isolated minority in Laos and China. Communal strategies of survival communication might provide a way for the community as a whole to succeed even though some individuals might never learn to communicate in English well enough to survive alone.

        "description":"The origins and early history of a system of regional colleges in Israel are analyzed in the context of an emerging postsecondary system, based on the work of John Meyer and others who look at the institutional side of organization. It is argued that the terms used to define legitimacy, as well as who defines it, are crucial issues in the institutionalization of educational organization, especially colleges and universities. In such organizations, symbolism is more important than efficiency, and this is especially true when there is disagreement about the identity and definition of the organizations among resource providers. For years, the assumption among kibbutz members was that studying for itself was more important than gaining credentials and degrees, although the kibbutz  sent members who showed special talents in the arts or who desired specialized education to institutions of higher education. The climate was right for the establishment of regional colleges with the kibbutz, the Ministry of Education, and local authorities. Almost from the beginning the regional colleges operated both as centers for continuing education and as university extension centers. When the first regional college opened in the mid-1960s, its leadership and management came almost exclusively from the kibbutzim. Developments that led to the withdrawal of full support from the kibbutz movement are traced. The regional colleges became intertwined with five separate major organizations, each of them highly institutionalized but without a strong basis for working together.  (SW)",

The BEOG program is the largest of six federal student financial aid programs. During the 1979-80 academic year, 2,537,835 individuals, or approximately 29 percent of all undergraduates in the United States shared over $2.5 billion in grants from BEOGs. The primary feature that distinguished the BEOG program from other forms of financial assistance is its entitlement concept: all students meeting certain criteria are guaranteed aid, with the amount of aid determined by financial need and educational cost. The major portion of the report is statistical tables, accompanied by narrative, that describe in detail selected aspects of program activity. Contents include the following:  general information such as the total number of applications processed, the number of grant recipients, the types and number of institutions participating in the BEOG program, and typical income-related characteristics of applicants and recipients. An in-depth analysis of selected demographic characteristics of applicants and recipients and the impact of these characteristics on grant levels is included. The interrelationship of factors such as recipient age, family income, dependency status, student eligibility index, and educational cost is examined. Summary information is provided on the numbers, type, control, and location of BEOG participating institutions. Selected aspects of the Multiple Data Entry Application Processing System are examined, and information about the eligibility  status of applicants by income level is presented.

        "description":"The impact of changes in student aid policies on the way students and their families pay for college is examined. A major focus is how student loans fit into the overall framework of student finance. Information is presented on the National Direct Student Loan program and Guaranteed Student Loan program. Both programs provide the opportunity to borrow at a below-market interest rate and have interest-free in-school and grade periods. Two major databases on student finance are considered for their utility in indicating how much nonreturnable loan aid the government dispenses and who receives it. The first source, the annual freshman survey of the Cooperative Institutional Research Program (CIRP) is found to be lacking because it covers only freshmen and because its data on family  income and student aid awards are collected in a manner that makes them difficult to use. The Department of Education's surveys conducted as part of the Study of the Impact of Student Financial Aid Programs (SISFAP) avoid many of the drawbacks of the CIRP, but they do not provide a complete picture of how students pay for college. The data are used to estimate the average net student burden (the amount that a student must contribute from work and loans, minus the nonreturnable portion of loans) faced by students at public two-year colleges, public four-year colleges, and private four-year colleges in 1978-79 and 1979-80. It is found that the burden is generally fairly low: no more than 25 to 30 percent of the student's cost of education. The burden appears to be roughly equal across all  income levels: there is little evidence of a middle-income squeeze. Implications of these findings for future data collection for federal student aid policies are considered. (Author/SW)",

Separate sections analyze the departmental administration and health science areas, compare the 1976-77 results to 1978-79, and examine faculty resource allocations as well as research and public service expenditures. In most instances the results are displayed by course level (lower division, upper division, etc.) and institutional type (doctoral and regional universities, The Evergreen State College, and community colleges).  The community college data are displayed by academic and vocational categories. Direct instructional costs per FTE student are determined by adding faculty salaries and benefits and direct support cost per FTE student. Total instructional and related costs are the sum of the direct instructional and the indirect or overhead costs per FTE student. Among the findings is that support costs for the vocational programs at the community colleges and the upper division and graduate programs at the regional and doctoral universities are somewhat higher than the lower division academic average costs for direct support. The methodology used to relate student tuition and operating fee levels to the total instructional and related costs is described. Appendices provide data for each individual  community college, student credit hour and faculty FTE information by level and discipline, and an outline of the step-by-step process used to allocate indirect costs.

In contrast to practices in the 1950s and 1960s, there is currently a new understanding that the campus and the community have common concerns that need to be addressed together. Between 1957 and 1967 the need for more and better facilities resulted in expansion of colleges and universities into their surrounding communities. The beneficiary of renewal was to be the university and many of the redevelopment plans for cultural centers and scientific research complexes were abandoned after the land had been acquired and buildings torn down.  Currently, joint planning groups, with representatives from both community and university, are common, and the focus of planning is as likely to be on community projects as it is on university projects. The concepts of partnership, community participation, and small-scale development are now embraced by the federal government as well. Eight case studies of renewal are examined as follows: University Circle, Cleveland; Xavier University; St. Louis University; Pratt Institute; University of Pittsburgh; Brown University; Ohio State University; and Aquinas College. Additionally, strategies being used by more than 20 institutions are addressed, including the following: campus-related commercial development, renovation of community buildings, shared cultural facilities, community housing  improvements, and expanded range of campus security. Principles of partnership include good communication, commitment, openness, and a willingness to cooperate. (SW)",

The six support systems are: federal policy toward black colleges, a research base, a human resource system support, dealing with socioeconomic and sociopolitical issues; higher education planning; and monitoring and evaluation. Analysis of the literature, surveys of programs, and interviews of program staff and experts were undertaken. Information was obtained on federal bureaucrats' perceptions of policy, formal and informal policy development processes, the question of who makes policy in the federal government, and the question of what policy initiatives in the federal government have  implications for black higher education. For various federal agencies and programs, information is presented on policies specific to higher education and to black higher education. The data needs of black higher education are considered in relation to the database, required research initiatives, educational policy research, and a model for a total research system. Sources of information that can be used to begin a partial analysis of certain subject area concerns of black higher education are identified. Data and recommendations are presented regarding representation of blacks in decision-making positions in foundations and at the federal and state levels. Among the social issues that are addressed are the following: institutionalized racism, political participation and policy-making  roles, the job market, and economic factors. Statewide higher education planning and the federal role in planning are addressed, along with evaluation and monitoring of equal educational opportunity programs. (SW)",

        "description":"Teaching strategies used by precepters at a hospital-based family medicine center were investigated with seven preceptors who had previous teaching experiences and were board certified (six in family medicine). A third-year senior resident presented and discussed two patient cases to the preceptors in separate one-to-one teaching sessions, and the preceptors were told to treat the case as they would for a first-year resident. The senior resident constructed fictitious history, physical, examination, and treatment information for an acute patient problem (unambiguous case) and a chronic patient problem (ambiguous case). Certain points of information judged critical to diagnosis and treatment were withheld but would be given to the preceptor upon request. Preceptor views of the  objectives for the teaching conference were also elicited. Preceptors were found to differ on the questioning strategies used; on each case the individual preceptors varied on the number of lower and higher order questions asked. The preceptors required more time and asked more questions for the acute problem case. However, the preceptors who asked many or few questions kept the same relative pattern for both cases. There appeared to be a correlation between use of treatment questions and preceptor effectiveness. Preceptor effectiveness was also measured by rank ordering by a faculty member based on pre-identified criteria. Based on these rankings, it is suggested that organization and specificity of preceptor goals may be a variable related to effectiveness. In debriefing sessions,  preceptors requested more information on their teaching performance and expressed interest in learning about alternative teaching styles. (SW)",

        "title":"The Use of Student Journals in Teaching Psychology.",
        "author":["Harris, Richard J."],
        "description":"The use of student journals in teaching introductory psychology was investigated at Kansas State University. Students in both a small honors class and a large general psychology lecture were asked to keep a journal with at least one entry weekly. While they were encouraged to relate course material to their own lives, nothing was restricted. The instructor commented in the journals but did not grade them; the student was given credit for turning in the journal. Some principles for teacher response to the journals are as follows: respond prolifically, affirm the student, reassure the student that he/she is normal, and use questions rather than imperatives. The content and tone of the journals varied widely but several classes of entries were identified: an account or log of  activities in the life of the students; direct relation of class material to own experience; reflections on self; and in many cases the teacher-reader became a significant person for the student in the sense of someone to react to his or her thoughts. Among the problems in using the journals are the great amount of time required to read the journals, the student who cannot or will not think of very much to say, and the student who says too much (is seriously troubled and needs counseling or other professional help). Advantages of this approach include: the practice in writing can help sharpen a student's composing and editing skills; course concepts may be better understood; students may better understand themselves; and the teacher-student relationship may be improved. The use of  journals in four other types of psychology classes (psycholinguistics, psychology of mass communication, information processing, and problem-solving and decision-making) is briefly noted.

        "description":"A program designed to provide students a background in computers and computing that was implemented by the Department of Behavioral Sciences at Millikin University, Illinois, is described. The program was implemented in three overlapping stages: faculty preparation; course preparation; and course implementation. The development of faculty expertise in computing was accomplished through self-training (particularly the learning of statistical packages, etc.), conference attendance, and coursework. Computer training was incorporated into courses already existing within the behavioral science curriculum. Computer labs were introduced in methodology courses in psychology and sociology, and computer-based assignments were used in a number of sociology courses. Additionally, a new  psychology course entitled &quot;Computer Applications in the Behavioral Sciences&quot; was established. While students undertook statistics and research methodology coursework, they were introduced to procedures for carrying out data analysis using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) and SAS (Statistical Analysis System). Introductory sociology students were briefly introduced to research methods; provided with a description of NORC's General Social Survey (GSS) data base; introduced to the use of SPSS with a written manual; and assigned simple SPSS exercises involving variables contained in the GSS. More advanced sociology student coursework also used computer-based assignments. The new computer applications course will include such topics as: data processing with statistical  packages, writing programs for data analysis using an Apple II microcomputer, and program writing to facilitate experimental procedures.

        "description":"The development of policy to respond to reduction and financial exigency in higher education was studied, based on a survey of presidents of 19 public and 35 private colleges and universities. In addition to assessing policy development, the survey was directed to efforts to increase enrollments and revenue and to reduce expenditures and criteria for the retrenchment of faculty and staff. Fifty-nine percent of the respondents indicated that informal policies were implemented or that formal policy was being developed regarding reduction of expenditures. In contrast, formal policy related to financial exigency was in effect at 63 percent of the public and at 31 percent of the private institutions. Additionally, 30 percent indicated that exigency policy was being developed. Most  institutions indicated that they would increase recruitment efforts to offset enrollment declines, and other possible responses included combining programs or merging institutions, adding or deleting program offerings, and altering institutional missions or goals. Approximately 90 percent of institutions that have experienced or expect reductions in funding indicated that increased development activities was or will be a priority action, seeking grants and gifts to supplement other revenue. Other methods to increase revenue and methods to decrease expenditures are assessed, as is the impact that a reduction of personnel would be likely to have on instructional and support staff. Criteria for the retrenchment of faculty appeared to be based primarily on program needs. Seniority received a  high priority among public institutions, while performance was given to private colleges. Internal policy development and external cooperation among public and private institutions are suggested to enhance institutional survival. (SW)",

Criteria issues by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, &quot;Revised Criteria Specifying the Ingredients of Acceptable Plans to Desegregate State Systems of Public Higher Education,&quot; focused on three major areas: the dismantling of the dual system with respect to black and white colleges; the desegregation of student enrollments, particularly at the traditionally white institutions; and the desegregation of faculty, administration staffs, nonacademic personnel, and governing  boards. It is recommended that the Department of Education should monitor the implementation of the desegregation plans in Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Oklahoma, and Virginia, and that Title VI compliance should be determined for the remaining states that formerly maintained de jure dual systems of higher education. It is suggested that the adequacy of the criteria for eliminating the effects of past discrimination and for achieving a unitary system should be reviewed. Additionally, suggestions for strengthening the criteria include the following: black public institutions need to expand missions that include more diverse curricula and new degree programs; current funding to traditionally black institutions should be equal to that granted to white institutions and sufficient funds should  be allocated to compensate for past inequities; programming to avoid duplication should emphasize specialized, career-oriented degree programs at black institutions.

        "description":"The need for medical record administrators in New Jersey, and specifically in hospitals, was studied using a methodology that projects requirements and accounts for the utilization of Registered Record Administrators (RRAs) in alternative health care settings by 1990. Furthermore, employment opportunities in such nontraditional settings as insurance and pharmaceutical companies were explored. Surveys of hospitals were conducted to determine staffing patterns and personnel needs of the medical records departments. Positions were rated both in terms of the job title and professional certification of each individual employed. A survey, distributed to 100 New Jersey Medical Record Association (NJMRA) members at their January 1981 state meeting, collected data on present employment  position and setting, educational training, and interest in further education. Response rates ranged from 62 percent for a mail survey to 94 percent for the survey of NJMRA members. The survey results were supplemented by a series of telephone conversations with state and national experts in the field. A shortage of 250 RRAs by 1990 was estimated. The continuing inability of hospitals, the principal employers of such personnel, to attract and retain RRA is presumably due to the increasing complexity of medical record management and to the lack of baccalaureate programs in New Jersey. It is recommended that two baccalaureate programs in medical record administration be established in the state, one in the north and one in the central or southern region. Evening and weekend courses are also  recommended for continuing professional education. Survey forms are appended. (SW)",

        "description":"The quality of off-campus degree programs is considered in relation to quality control models and efforts that have been used to achieve quality control, the parties responsible for quality control, the effectiveness of programs to improve the educational quality of nontraditional education, and future prospects. It is suggested that quality control efforts must reflect newly created dimensions and variables that these off-campus programs introduce so that their level of performance can be assessed accurately, and the academic quality of these programs can be addressed at the same time. It is claimed that outcomes evaluation is underdeveloped at present but that innovative efforts in this area may help improve the reputation of off-campus degree programs and further develop more  nontraditional delivery systems in higher education. A shift in focus from a predominantly \"process\" approach in quality control efforts to a mixture of process and outcomes approaches appears to be a likely consequence of an expanded number of nontraditional programs. A key element in improving the quality of off-campus degree programs is the continued development of internal quality controls by individual colleges and universities (e.g., an extensive approval process for off-campus programs and courses; stringent standards for faculty hiring; and student evaluation of off-campus courses, faculty, and support services). It is suggested that external controls exercised by accrediting bodies and state education agencies have made a positive contribution to program quality, but colleges and  universities must assume primary responsibility for maintaining quality in off-campus programs. The sequential evaluation model of the North Central Association's Commission on Institutions of Higher Education is described. A bibliography is included. (SW)",

Subjects viewed a videotape containing prequestions or postquestions of the knowledge or comprehension type, either with or without feedback. This yielded eight experimental treatment conditions, each with 13 subjects. A control group of 30 subjects which only viewed the videotape was also included. The results indicate that AQs have a facilitative effect on learning from videotape learning materials intended for viewing in a  group. Total learning and relevant learning were enhanced by the addition of AQs to the videotape, while incidental learning was not affected. The results further suggest that AQs may function differently in a videotape than in a written prose text. Three tables of data and a 17-item bibliography are included. (CHC)",

        "description":"This survey, which was conducted to assess the general needs of adult Americans that could be served by educational programming for television, had three component parts: (1) a series of focus group interviews; (2) a telephone survey of 1300 adult Americans in order to ask the public directly about their predominant concerns; and (3) a series of personal interviews with experts in a variety of broadcasting, educational, and social-science related fields to obtain an analytic perspective on the direction in which television programming should move. Divided into five sections, the report initially provides an overview to the problem being addressed, the background of the study, and research objectives. Additional chapters present the methodology employed for each of the three study  components, the findings from each of these efforts, and some recommendations for future educational television programming.

        "description":"This report describes the evaluation activities associated with the development and production of POWERHOUSE, a motivational television series designed to help 8- to 12-year-old children take active, personal responsibility for their own health and well being. The evaluation of POWERHOUSE was divided into two major sections: the Writers' Notebook and original formative research. The Notebook consisted of a literature review and analysis. The first task accomplished by the original research was to establish the health knowledge information base that target age children would bring to their viewing of the series. Focus-interviews with children and follow-up questionnaires, using a larger sample, provided information on knowledge of drugs, sex, body systems, and general health and  nutrition. The next evaluation procedure was to assess the reactions of children, teachers, and youth leaders to narrative versions of three different scripts. At the same time that the script treatments were tested, pictures and brief character descriptions of potential series regulars were also evaluated. In November of 1980, a market test of the pilot series was conducted in a representative demographic market, Toledo, Ohio. An 85-item bibliography is attached. (Author/LLS)",

        "description":"This study is a controlled longitudinal analysis of the impact and meaning of television among Algonkian Indians of central Canada which incorporates eight years of extensive participant observation field work and objective social and psychological testing in the pre- and post-television periods. The impact of television is discussed in terms of stress and modernization, and it is argued that positive and negative television inputs in these areas are heavily conditioned by meanings derived from analogies between television and certain cultural traditions, which promoted exaggerated copying, identification, and trust in TV characters on the part of naive viewers. A report of the ethnographic findings resulting from long term field work in three Algonkian communities reviews the  impact and meaning of television in these communities as revealed in field observations and interviews. Findings based on psychological and sociological tests, economic sales records, video tape experimentation, and questionnaire opinion surveys are also reported, and the final section provides a review of the work and its implications, clarifying some of the issues in telecommunication policy for developing areas and making some recommendations. A study of the relationship between music associated with a TV show and its appeal to an Ojibwa audience is appended. (CHC)",

A user panel, selected to interact with the education and marketing experts of such STI suppliers as Chemical Abstracts and Engineering Index, confirmed the original premise for the study, added the resolution of supplier images as a goal, and expanded the concept to include examination of communication channels as well as the educational promotional media. The panel discovered five user audiences, each with its own peculiar needs and interests: policy managers, technical managers, practitioners,  intermediaries, and teachers. Major findings indicate that information is not perceived as a direct research tool by four of these five audiences, that the goals of suppliers are not clearly understood by users, and the degree of STI perception varies widely among the five audiences. Desired results based on these three basic situations are specified for each audience served and categories of educational approaches to STI are outlined, with suggestions for planning educational programs for STI and evaluating the results.

After discussing the irrelevance of traditional history texts to the cultural identity of these students, the report describes the oral history assignment as an alternative means of instruction and details the assignment's requirements. Students were expected to perform initial research on a decade in the 20th century;  develop and review a list of interview questions dealing with events in that decade; use these questions in an interview with a community resident; and complete a final paper evaluating the interview in terms of the reliability of the information obtained and the relation of the interviewee's experiences to the larger societal experience of the period.

Correlations were determined between two dependent and 21 independent variables. The dependent variables were the achievement of a first-semester grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 or above and re-enrollment for a second semester.

The first regression analysis used data for Fall 1980 entering students and results were separately analyzed for liberal arts and vocational students. In the second analysis, data were combined for students entering in Fall 1979 or Fall 1980.

A rationale for the project is presented first, based on the inordinate amount of time required of the instructor to individually tutor students; the unsatisfactory nature of commercially prepared workbooks; and the positive results of an initial pilot study. The report then outlines specific project goals: to reduce the dropout rate and the number of attempts students needed to demonstrate competency for each course objective; to improve student attitudes toward physics; and to leave the instructor with more time to  help the students with the most serious difficulties. The report then describes the special features of the tutorial lessons, which are programmed on micro-computer cassettes and which require the student to establish problem-solving methodologies with gradually decreasing amounts of assistance. Implementation problems posed by time constraints and limited memory capacity are examined prior to an evaluation of the system based on a comparison of student progress using the system with the progress registered by students prior to its implementation and student evaluations of the system.

Selected findings indicate that, of the 687 responding colleges, 413 had organized staff development programs. The most frequently mentioned program goals centered on the development of faculty, rather than non-teaching staff, and the availability of travel funds was rated the most effective staff development activity.

        "description":"As colleges take on increasing numbers of nontraditional students who have had only minimal exposure to mathematics, instructors must alleviate patterns of math anxiety and math avoidance which impede academic success, and, in a technological society, limit career opportunities. Among the obvious causes of math anxiety are: instructors' insistence on the right answer; the need to perform math skills with speed; and the fact that math knowledge is cumulative. Less obvious factors are: the defeat experienced when a student cannot master the next highest level of math skills; the myth that some people are not \"mathematically minded\"; and the inability of some students to handle frustration. Still another dimension of math anxiety is the low math self-esteem of many women. Research  shows that while there is no difference between men's and women's math ability, many women believe that men are more mathematically capable. Given these anxiety patterns, math instructors must concentrate more on enhancing students' self-confidence. While some may argue that the introduction of anxiety-reduction techniques may water down course content, a study at Middlesex Community College (CT) has demonstrated that students experiencing such instruction continue to higher-level math courses more often than students in traditional courses.

Chapter I examines the weakness of general education programming, comparing general education to a spare room that has no agreed upon function. Chapter II notes the recent surge of interest in general education; examines the variety of social and educational problems general education is being called upon to solve; and compares this resurgence of interest with two earlier general education movements in the 20th Century. Drawing upon this historical analysis, Chapter III argues that the fundamental rationale for general education lies in the need to help students in today's fragmented society understand the human community to which they are accountable. Chapter IV critically examines current general  education practices in terms of: course content; the place of general education in the curriculum; and the information, attitudes, and values students are expected to acquire through general education courses. Finally, Chapter V proposes a structure for general education curricula based on six areas of shared human experience: language, membership in groups and institutions, the activities of production and consumption, the scientific workings of the natural world, history, and the development of values and beliefs. Chapter V also discusses alternative delivery systems for general education and the receptiveness of students and faculty to increased general education programming. (JP)",

Sixty-four 4- and 5-year-olds learned three novel concepts (animal-like, plant-like, and machine-like). Subjects were presented with either four different examples of each concept (multiple item training condition) or with one example of the concept which was repeated four times (single item training condition). Following acquisition, children identified a set of recognition, generalization, and discrimination items. Neither age nor training condition affected rate of acquisition. Age and training condition affected all other measures (recognition, generalization, and discrimination). Older children and children trained with  multiple items generalized more but discriminated less than did other children; these results were obtained even when recognition differences were accounted for. The pattern of results suggests that developmental changes in concept generalization may be due to changes in the liberality of children's response criteria rather than to changes in memory or the ability to abstract information.

        "description":"In January 1980, the National Neighbors (NN) conducted a survey to determine the types of difficulties that families with children experience in the rental housing market due to exclusionary rental policies. In order to reach the families who experience such problems, NN ran public service announcements on television and radio stations inviting persons discriminated against to call a toll-free number and tell of their experiences. Five hundred and fifty-four people from several metropolitan areas (Los Angeles, Atlanta, Dallas/Fort Worth, Hartford, Oklahoma City and Columbus, Ohio) responded to the announcements. Among the findings, 99 percent of the respondents reported that they had had difficulty in finding a place to live because of no-children policies. Most of the  respondents complained that rental housing which accepts children is either too expensive or substandard, and sometimes both. When controlling for an income level of $15,000 and above, it was found that there was a significant difference between the housing problems experienced by minorities and those experienced by whites, with minorities reporting serious problems more often. These findings suggest that restrictive rental policies against children seriously affect the lives of a very diverse group of families--small and large, middle-class and poor, blacks and Hispanics.

The influence on the kindergarten by the primary grades seems to be changing kindergarten practice. In reconstituting the kindergarten to make it more responsive to the needs of primary education, a number of strategies have been taken. One is to adopt prescribed prepared educational programs that are a downward extension of textbook series in academic areas. Other kindergarten-specific, prescriptive programs have been designed to ensure that children will learn prerequisites necessary for success in later school learning. A number of influences have led to the present situation. Among the influences  are the following: (1) kindergarten attendance has become the rule rather than the exception; (2) there have been major shifts in the orientations of early childhood curriculum; (3) there have been parallel shifts in developmental theories used to justify early childhood curriculum; (4) there has been a societal press to offer academic instruction at an early age; (5) there has been an increase in the use of standardized achievement tests in evaluating the educational progress of young children; and (6) many kindergarten teachers are inadequately prepared to be effective early childhood curriculum makers.

Data were gathered from every state except Hawaii. Twenty-eight states had some arrangement for special funding for isolated rural and/or small schools. Although the plans were diverse, they usually addressed program eligibility and assistance mechanisms. Among eligibility factors, enrollment levels were a key element of the program in 16 states. Six states considered number of teachers or instructional units, six focused on population density, nine looked at isolation from other schools, and two addressed the rural  district's minimum financial contribution. Despite great variety, assistance mechanisms in the 28 states generally fell into three categories: added weightings to the basic support formula (13 states); minimum support levels (5 states); and size adjustments and special payments (6 states). Completing the study is a detailed explanation of each state's funding arrangement. Definitions, statutes, and formulas are included to describe eligibility considerations and assistance mechanisms.

The unit introduces the decision making process; provides practice in applying the process (especially to personal decisions); and presents background information about taking risks, using decision strategies, making educated decisions, and acting on decisions. The unit is organized into five color-coded lessons, each containing complete instructions for classroom activities and homework, learning objectives, detailed lesson plans, student activity sheets, and teaching tips. The unit also contains an introduction to the series;  an appendix with additional teaching hints, information about group dynamics and discussions, and more student activities; and an adaptation manual with instructions for tailoring the unit to local needs. The field-tested curriculum is designed for the rural Midwest but the program contains detailed adaptation manuals for four other rural regions in the United States (the Northwest, Southwest, Northeast, and Appalachian South areas).

Through experience simulation, students apply skills learned in Unit II to the information from Unit I; they project their future lives and simulate their responses to problems that might stand in the way of self-realization. The unit concentrates on a simulation game, &quot;The Game of Life: Choice and Chance,&quot; and a Learning Activity Package on assessment skills. The game is based on life stages and the role of choice and chance at each stage. The game packet, included with Unit III, contains monitor's instructions, a list of &quot;identities,&quot; chance and consequence sheets for the various life stages, instructions  for scoring life's &quot;satisfaction points,&quot; and five game boards. Unit III also includes a teacher's guide, learning objectives, 10 complete lesson plans, an appendix of additional teaching tips and student activities, and an adaptation manual designed to help school personnel tailor the program to a particular area.

Results indicated that: relatively few Native American women have participated in higher education; they tended to major in education or social service fields and intended to work after graduation; they were given as much or more family encouragement to enter college as their male relatives; Indian men and women have had similar problems in getting a college degree; undergraduates perceived discrimination against them as more racist than sexist; and the greatest pressures on Indian women may  have been those associated with traditional Indian values toward home and family. Recommended research topics were aspiration to college of male and female Native American high school students, parental attitudes and encouragement, and the role of personality differences in college success or failure. Appendices include statistical data, questionnaires, and tabulated responses on birthplace, age, tribe and degree of Indian blood, pre-college schooling, college class and major, career and degree objectives, race and sex discrimination, and family background and attitudes.

Completed questionnaires for both 1969 and 1975 were obtained from 702 youth (50% male, 50% female); 29% were black and 71% were white. Questions concerned educational and occupational aspirations, marriage age and family size expectations, and future residence aspirations. Data indicated that life plans, as expressed by high school age youth, were influenced by background factors and the effects of parenting on the grade school child. For all sex-race categories, the higher the educational expectations,  the higher the mental ability, the higher the occupational expectations and the higher the perceived educational wishes of parents. The higher the mental ability score, the higher the prestige of the expected occupation. Data indicated few identifiable factors related to age at marriage expectations, and few common variables related to family size expectations. Apparently, no background factors were associated with residential preference. Recommendations included: (1) improve child's attitude toward school; (2) encourage grade school children to have higher expectations; (3) encourage mothers to have higher educational expectations for their children; (4) produce in teenagers a more receptive attitude toward moving from the home community; and (5) raise the occupational expectations of  teenagers.

Many communities begin a community-based education program by using school buildings as community-centered schools for educational, social, and community events. The school, community groups, and individuals share responsibility for development of lifelong learning and enrichment programs. Coordinated  activities of service and governmental agencies and social, youth, and civic groups can produce a total program to meet community needs. Citizens participate through a community council which takes an active role in developing and implementing all aspects of the community-based education program. Through integration of solutions to home, school, and community needs, the program strengthens and reinforces learning experiences and provides a means of reinforcing values, beliefs, and attitudes. Finally, community members can exert their collective power to bring about needed changes. A general comparison of school-based and community-based educational philosophies is included. (CM)",

NCES' private school data will increase the schools' visibility and help inform government policy makers who propose laws and regulations that ultimately affect private schools. Results of a 1976 to 1979 mail survey of private schools, sponsored by NCES, the Council for American Private Education, and the National Catholic Education Association indicated that in 1979, a total of 19,663 private schools existed in the United States, serving 5,084,297 students with 272,664 teachers. An average of 259 students  attended each school, 80% of which were parochial schools and 50% of which were Catholic schools. Two-thirds of all private school students attended Catholic schools. Private schools comprised 18.4% of all schools and served 10.7% of all students with 11.9% of all teachers. Enrollments in boarding schools declined but enrollments in schools serving one sex increased. National longitudinal studies of high school seniors in 1972 and 1980 indicated that 1980 seniors were more interested in money and academics and less interested in correcting socioeconomic inequalities than 1972 seniors.

Although the totals reported are estimates because many values had to be statistically imputed, many patterns emerge. The proportion of private schools to all schools has varied only slightly since 1932. Although the number of private schools is currently decreasing at a faster rate than the number of public schools, private enrollment shows a slower decline. Eighteen percent of all elementary and secondary schools are private. Private schools enroll over 10% of all students; employ 11% of all teachers; account for 10% of all high school graduates; and generate and spend about 6% of the total amount spent for elementary and secondary  education. Among private schools, 80% have church affiliation; 50% are Catholic schools enrolling 64% of all private school pupils. Enrollments in Catholic schools are declining but those in other church schools are rising. Also, 65% of private schools are elementary level with 59% of all private schools students; 12% are secondary with 21% of the students; and 17% combine both levels with 18% of the students. Pupil-teacher ratios are generally lower than the 1976 public school average. (SB)",

The program was designed to encourage inner-city Philadelphia black and Puerto Rican 10-grade students who were proficient in mathematics and science to consider seeking careers in the fields of engineering technology. The program was jointly planned, executed, and evaluated by Temple University staff, Philadelphia School District teachers and counselors, and local business and industrial personnel. Ninety students participated in the project. The program's components included workshops, job placement, and job  and career counseling. Results showed that 35% of the females and 27% of the males enrolled in engineering programs upon graduation. (Author/DS)",

The focus was on junior high and secondary schools, with a special emphasis on general mathematics. The purposes of the conferences were: (1) to describe and explore promising techniques for improving students' problem-solving abilities; (2) to provide direction on the effective use of the calculator in class; (3) to explore important curriculum options for general mathematics courses; and (4) to provide resources, describe techniques, and prepare participants for conducting in-service experiences in their own school  systems on the above topics. A major portion of this document contains materials distributed to conference participants, and consists of papers compiled or written by the Conference Development Team.

The session was designed to review whether the programable calculator has a place in the school mathematics program, in light of the current availability of the microcomputer. The presentations at the symposium supported the view that such calculators do have a role to play in the curriculum, and the collected papers of the contributors provide ample evidence of the many ways programable calculators can be used. In addition to the presented papers, two other contributions solicited by the editor to enhance the usefulness of this work to educators are included.  (MP)",

        "description":"Reported is a research project which investigated whether junior high students in the Ithaca, New York, area can acquire and use the &quot;concept mapping&quot; and &quot;Gowin's 'V' mapping&quot; strategies to facilitate meaningful learning. Concept mapping involves the identification, hierarchical organization, and graphic depiction of relationships among concepts in a body of study material. These procedures are consistent with Ausubel's theory of meaningful learning. The second learning strategy involves recognizing that all knowledge in the sciences is constructed by using records and record transforming procedures which are guided by the concepts, principles and theories that people employ. Gowin's &quot;V&quot; is a heuristic device that students use to graphically illustrate the interplay between the  methodological and conceptual elements of each episode of knowledge-making, such as a laboratory investigation. Although many project activities centered on implementation of the two learning strategies, the positive cognitive and affective data lend support to the effectiveness of this &quot;learning how to learn&quot; project. Included in the appendix are the teacher's handbook and samples of student-constructed concept maps and &quot;V&quot; maps. (Author/WB)",

Relationships between these two variables were predicted. It was hypothesized that introverted, intuitive thinking and perceiving MBTI personality types would exhibit an application, questioning, or application/questioning cognitive preference orientation, that is, an inquiry orientation toward learning. It was further hypothesized that extraverted, sensing, feeling and judging MBTI personality types would exhibit a memory, memory/application, or memory/questioning cognitive preference orientation, that is, a traditional orientation toward  learning. This study also attempted to determine if students differed on these measures according to sex or intelligence. The predicted relationships were not supported by the analyses in the study. Differences between the sexes were not noted. Differences in intelligence between sensing and intuitive students (in favor of intuitives), between judging and perceiving students (in favor of perceivers), and between students classified according to cognitive preferences were found. It is suggested that data from individual measures may give classroom teachers better insight into the individual differences of their students. (Author)",

The developers state that the document may be useful for a variety of purposes such as test construction, textbook writing, curriculum and course revision, and educational planning. The document is presented in seven chapters. Chapter one discusses the scope of the study, explains why a comprehensive overview of citizen education is needed, and presents background information. Chapter two offers a brief survey of political education in the United States. Chapters three through five consist of summaries of recent  trends and curriculum projects in civic/political education in elementary and secondary schools in the United States during the 1960s and 1970s. Information is presented on key topics, key target groups, learning approaches, neglected areas, community influences, and intra-state patterns of social studies offerings. Chapter six identifies major themes and offers conclusions and recommendations, including that citizen/political education programs should continue to reflect America's cultural pluralism, and that educators should become more aware of the influences of the mass media, should work toward improving collection and analysis of political/citizenship educational materials, and should take into account cognitive-moral development and steps when they devise materials for specific age  levels. The final chapter offers a bibliography of sources used for the 1960s indices. (DB)",

        "description":"The ideal of good citizenship is examined in light of current social and political unrest brought about, at least in part, by the agitation of special interest groups. Emphasis is placed on the role of citizenship education in the schools. The monograph is intended particularly for educators who want to improve citizenship education programs. The document is presented in five chapters. Chapter one identifies the major citizenship education challenge of the 1980s as the conflict between privatism in politics (due to a deterioration of national trust in the political system) and pluralism in education (resulting from attitudes that glorified doing one's own thing and from the belief that authority for education should rest primarily with the diverse pluralistic communities in  American society). Chapter two contrasts ideas of citizenship in modern democratic societies and in Greco-Roman republics. Chapter three presents an historical perspective on citizenship education in the United States from the 1770s to the 1970s. Chapter four identifies major approaches to reform of civic education, including academic disciplines (particularly, history and sociology), law related education, social problems, critical thinking, values education, moral development, community involvement, and institutional school reform. The final chapter offers suggestions for improving citizenship education programs, including incorporating political values, political knowledge, and the skills of political participation into the curriculum; encouraging common understanding of and commitment  to democratic values; and encouraging student understanding of citizenship concepts such as justice, freedom, equality, diversity, authority, privacy, due process, participation, and international human rights.

        "author":["Kemmis, Stephen"],
        "description":"Trends within the literature on program evaluation are reviewed and the implications of various trends for education are explored, with particular relevance for distance education. Distance education is an alternative educational approach based on correspondence, broadcasting, and long distance communication between teacher and student in a non-home based study study situation. Two major trends are identified--first, the trend toward the technologisation of reason (i.e., the acceptance of problem solutions by experts), and second, a trend toward concern with preserving a human dimension (i.e., convivality). With regard to educational evaluation, these trends have their counterparts in the move toward technical/quantitative assessment of performance and objectives and in the  increasing interest in more individualized and responsive evaluation methodology. A new model is proposed to counteract shortcomings of these types of evaluation models and of other models in widespread use today (engineering models, ecological models, democratic models, illuminative/responsive models, etc.). This new model, based on evaluation as self-reflection and convivality, comes closer than any of the other models to patterning what people do in ordinary situations when they try to evaluate without the aid of specialists. Specifically, the evaluation as self-reflection model stresses rationality, autonomy and responsibility, the community of interests among participants in a specific program, value differences, explicit rules which govern procedures, and appropriate methods for  evaluating the specific program or curriculum being studied. The conclusion is that this self-reflective evaluation model can help educators recognize one another's (and students) social being and develop a perspective which is more critical and reflective and less dominated by purely technical solutions.

        "description":"Research in law-related education has not led to cumulative knowledge that is of much use to curriculum developers or classroom teachers. Among the reasons for this state of affairs are that researchers concentrate on nonessential topics, educational research does not generally meet criteria for scientific research, educational research is too often conducted in isolation from prior research and theory. Also, researchers often lack sensitivity to the realities of the classroom due, at least in part, to their failure to involve teachers in planning, conducting, and interpreting research. Ways in which research in law-related education can overcome these problems include that researchers should show more respect for empirical research and previous research findings, that educators  should become more realistic with regard to their expectations for educational research, and that researchers pay more attention to developing explanatory concepts and to integrating and interpreting research literature. Major activities in law-related education in the 1980's will more than likely center on developing, implementing, and institutionalizing educational programs in schools and other institutions. (DB)",

        "author":["Vinovskis, Maris A."],
        "description":"A case study of events involving the Beverly High School (Beverly, Massachusetts) circa 1860 exemplifies educational trends in mid-19th century Massachusetts. The hypothesis is that the political situation in mid-19th century Massachusetts was much more complex than has been suggested by radical revisionsts who tend to interpret educational and social developments in terms of social class conflict. The Beverly High School (which was abolished by popular vote in 1860 after two years of existence) was selected for study because it represents a means of investigating whether mid-19th century school reforms were the product of working-class efforts to educate their children (the traditional view) or were imposed on the working-class by upper-class leaders who wanted to instill their  own morality and values on others (the revisionist view). Analysis of the debate over closing the Beverly High School and the ensuing vote to close it indicate that many factors, in addition to social class, played large roles in a more general way in educational reform in Massachusetts during the period under study. Most important among these factors were party politics, religion, occupation, attitudes toward state law (which, in the case of Beverly High School was important because the law required a public high school for towns the size of Beverly), and the age of the voters (younger voters were more likely to support public schooling than were older voters). The document concludes with comments delivered at a 1979 conference on community studies in urban educational history.  (DB)",

        "description":"A study was undertaken to determine American attitudes toward sex education and contraceptive services to adolescents and toward the related topics of teenage pregnancy and related welfare and medical costs. The study was based on the premise that policy decisions regarding whether to offer sex education and contraceptive services to adolescents are influenced by policy makers' conceptions of public opinion. The method used was to integrate all available data on American public opinion toward sex education and birth control for teenagers and to relate findings from an analysis of the resulting data compilation to educational and public health policy at different time periods from 1943 to 1980. Data consisted of previous research studies in the fields of social science, medicine,  and public health and of surveys by the American Institute of Public Opinion (the Gallup Organization). Several difficulties were encountered in interpreting data from different sources and time periods, including that questions asked at one time were neither parallel nor similar to questions asked at another period. In spite of the difficulties, however, findings indicated several clear trends. Most important among these findings are that a solid majority of the public has always been in favor of sex education for teenagers; that, recently, the public is overwhelmingly in favor of providing birth control information as part of this education; and that there has been a generally upward trend in approval of providing birth control for teenagers. The conclusion is that current policy  concerning sex education and adolescent birth control is much more conservative than public opinion and that provision of more and better contraceptive services and sex education to teenagers would be supported by the American public.

A program is considered an international education program in this inventory if it fosters understanding and/or cooperation between the United States and another country or countries through education, which is broadly defined to include training. To gather information, a questionnaire was sent to the director of each federal agency whose general function might conceivably indicate possible administration of an international education program. Of the 70 agencies contacted, 28 responded. Programs are organized by their administering agency: ACTION; Department of Agriculture; Civil Aeronautics Board; Department of Commerce; Department of Defense; Department of Energy;  Export-Import Bank; Federal Communications Commission; Department of Health, Education, and Welfare; Department of the Interior; International Communication Agency; Japan-United States Friendship Commission; Department of Labor; Library of Congress; National Academy of Sciences; National Endowment for the Arts; National Endowment for the Humanities; National Science Foundation; National Transportation Safety Board; Office of Personnel Management; Postal Service; Small Business Administration; Smithsonian Institution; Department of State; Tennessee Valley Authority; Department of Transportation; Department of the Treasury; and the Veterans Administration. For each agency there is a section that gives the purpose and scope of the agency's activities and services and specific programs. The  specific program descriptions then follow. Information provided includes the name, address, and telephone number of the unit administering the program; a description of the program activities, primary beneficiaries, and any international travel involved; legislative information--the name of the authorizing act and its Public Law number; funding source and amount; and data concerning the number of projects or participants in a program preferably broken down by country or region.

        "author":["McDonald, Scott C."],
        "description":"A study was undertaken to discover the impact of strategies devised by the California Coalition for Sex Equity (CCSE) on reducing sex bias in schools. The strategies (referred to as power-based strategies) were based on identifying key decision makers in school districts and enlisting their support in helping staff identify and reduce gender bias in education and, specifically, in modifying institutional practices to conform to Title IX. The method involved using interviews and a pre- and posttest design to evaluate change among experimental and control groups in response to exposure and/or lack of exposure to the sex equity strategies. The sample consisted of administrators, teachers, students, and school board members in 23 experimental and 13 control school districts in  California. Interviews and test scores were statistically analyzed. Findings indicated that school change processes are disorderly; network strategies, such as those which focused on interaction between teachers and administrators, are particularly effective in implementing affective and behavioral objectives; districts reach a threshold beyond which additional pro-equity training and services result in diminishing returns; and the power-based strategies were effective in combatting sex bias in all 23 school districts, although, of course, there were differences in degrees of effectiveness among school districts. The conclusion is that all school districts can benefit from power-based strategies to reduce sex bias and, in particular, those districts will benefit most which designate the  superintendent or assistant superintendent to be the CCSE liaison, in which the teaching staff exhibits good overall morale, and in which flexiblity is stressed over bureaucracy and red tape.

However, evidence does not indicate that combining these processes into a single training methodology provides any advantage for teacher trainees. Teaching also may be influenced by providing information about teaching skills, inducing cognitive conflict, and arranging for selective reinforcement. Although teaching skills may have been acquired or modified, their use cannot be assumed. The complexity of a skill, its acceptance philosophically, its utility in terms of student learning, and the supervisory support that it receives all influence the extent to which a teaching skill is adopted and used. To extend and refine the knowledge about  these processes will require a refining of criteria to include both qualitative standards and more complex definitions of teaching skills. (Author/JD)",

In the first paper, it is noted that routine intelligence tests cannot be relied upon to identify the gifted, and that a more stringent case study approach should be adopted to take into account the particular gifts and talents that students may have. In the second paper, educators are encouraged to recognize the inherently complex problem of developing a curriculum adapted to the unique cognitive styles of gifted children. The third paper explores the problem of math avoidance on the part of gifted girls. Research on a counseling program to meet the particular needs of gifted children is described in the fourth paper. The fifth paper deals  with building an agenda for gifted programs that is based on a recognition of the psychosocial needs and cognitive abilities of talented students. (JD)",

        "description":"This report explores the question of what constitutes success in teaching from the perspective of the teacher. A survey of elementary and secondary teachers was conducted using both questionnaires and interviews. Responses were classified as cognitive, affective, or other. Responses were judged cognitive when pupil learning was indicated as a sign of successful teaching. An affective rating was used when responses indicated a positive attitude or feeling that occurred within the classroom. The affective category yielded the highest number of responses across all grade levels. Regardless of teaching level, most teachers defined their success in terms of their pupils' behaviors rather than themselves or other criteria. It was clear from the interviews that teachers defined success  in the classroom from a unique perspective that research has yet to explore. It is proposed that, by paying more attention to the needs of preservice and inservice teachers for success, teacher education programs might provide models of teacher behavior in the classroom that evoke positive student response.

Two classes of each teacher were videotaped for the first ten days of the school year. The teachers were selected because they taught students of comparable ability, and because they were confident enough of their own abilities that they would not be threatened by extensive observation. Thirteen categories of behavior were derived and used to compare the teachers, particularly in the following areas: (1) teachers' procedural statements; (2) teachers's statements concerning student behavior; (3) desists; and (4) student questions concerning procedure. Significant variance was found between the teachers, which  could be explained by the differences in the kinds of learning activities used (lecture, seat-work, use of an overhead projector, and groupwork). However, analyses of the videotapes suggest that a major factor in the variance was the student expectation of the consequences of behavior that deviated from the prescribed routine. This was clearly seen in the way each teacher dealt with unauthorized talking. The conclusion is that teacher behavior during the first few class days has profound effect during later sessions.

Three prominent reasons for the change were: to make football more interesting to the spectator; to balance the competition between offense and defense; and to modify the dangerous elements of the sport. The growing popularity of the game on college campuses is described, and its eventual commercialization is discussed. The compromises football imposes on educational values are considered. (JD)",

Field experience is concurrent with theory and methods courses and is divided into four sequences, each lasting one semester. The introductory sequence provides students with a realistic basis for making a decision about their future role in education. Sequence II includes  courses geared for education specialties and planning, implementing, and evaluating language arts and reading activities. At the end of this sequence, students are expected to become actively involved in appropriate classroom activities, conduct formal peer evaluation, and teach lessons in science, social studies, and mathematics under the supervision of cooperating teachers. Students in Sequence IV strengthen and refine their skills and ultimately do one week of solo teaching. An evaluation model matrix for each of the four sequences is appended, indicating student behaviors which relate directly to the objectives of the program. (FG)",

In attempting to resolve this problem, some researchers have developed the theory and practice of teachers as researchers, similar to Kurt Lewin's action research. Lewin argued for a system of analysis, fact finding, conceptualization, planning, and execution, and then a repetition of the whole cycle. The process involves the participants of the social world under investigation at every stage. Although not at the forefront of research developments in education, the impact of action research in education is seen in the trend toward reconceptualizing the field in more participatory terms. Action research  has several essential features: (1) an interest in participatory democratic processes for social and intellectual reconstruction; (2) a linking of the development of theory and practice; (3) a means for producing authentic critiques of practice; and (4) the development and strategic use of programs of social action as tools. Action research is sufficiently well established in Australia to have substantive and methodological problems that need to be solved. (FG)",

The work on planning reveals that teachers typically do not use the objectives-based, rational models stressed in textbooks, but instead concentrate on the activities included in a curriculum as they seem to relate to the needs and interests of the students. This indicates the need for training teachers to plan more effectively, and suggests the formation of alternative models of the planning process which might be more appropriate than the rational model. Research on teachers' perceptions, thoughts, and decisions during the teaching process is just beginning, but it suggests exciting possibilities. Work done to date suggests that: most teacher perceptions about students are accurate; most teacher  decisions about students are logical and based on appropriate information sources; and teachers' behaviors when interacting with students may be monitored and controlled more consciously than previous work would suggest.

The triune brain concept and the left and right hemisphere concepts are among the many complex theories evolving from experimentation and observation. The triune brain concept suggests that the human forebrain has expanded while retaining three structurally unique formations that reflect early ancestral relationships to reptiles, early mammals, and recent mammals. The left and right hemisphere and division of labor theories attribute functions to specific regions of the brain. These theories lead to the conclusion that educators must be concerned with educating all areas of the brain, since all of the areas interact. The research suggests that a basic education must include informational and processing skills  as well as creative behaviors and artistic activities. Educational issues such as learning disabilities, genetic and biological differences, and instructional designs have already been in influenced by brain research. Teachers must use current developments to make preparations for future practices. (FG)",

The characteristics and personality of the teacher, while impinging to some degree on student performance, appear to have less influence on motivation than what the teacher does to and with students.

A section on evaluating instruction examines the roles of classroom observation, rating scales, student questionnaires, content analysis and techniques for self examination. A review of the implications arising from new demands on the educational system cites the classroom climate and the concept  of individual differences as major areas that need research.

A majority of the teachers agreed that science should be an integral part of elementary education, that teachers should improve their knowledge of science, and that teachers would teach more science if they could update their knowledge in science content. The National Science Foundation provided funding for a one year program to instruct 48 teachers in environmental science education. The program's goals were to improve knowledge, to aid teachers in the use of environmental science education resources, and to develop cooperation and program support between scientists at a local university and the teachers. To understand  the effects of the program and to measure its success, a study was designed to evaluate data from program participants. Data were collected using a Stages of Concern questionnaire and an Environmental Education questionnaire. Individual profiles of two teachers in the program were also analyzed. Results revealed that the attitudes of the teachers who participated in the program changed significantly as compared to a set of control group teachers. The two questionnaires proved to be useful instruments for identifying change in teachers in a specific and definite manner. Implications for inservice programs and future research are presented.

Particular attention was paid to the motivation and roles of participants. It was found that participation is complex and varied. There were three major findings: (1) Voluntary participation and initial motivation were not as important to participant satisfaction as factors which emerged later; (2) Participant roles and activities varied considerably, influencing the attitudes towards innovation and therefore the motivation for participation; and (3) The representativeness of the participant group was more important to successful dissemination than voluntary participation. Important incentives and deterrents  were: anticipated educational benefits; the opportunity for increased interaction among teachers and with administrators; compatibility between classroom and project goals; the costs of participation; and the perceived likelihood that innovations would be continued or expanded.

The courts and other branches of government are devoting more attention to regulating schooling. As the rights of students have been articulated through litigation and legislation, the duties of schools have become crystallized. The current legalistic conception of schooling contains no reference for assessing the nature and content of educational practice or how it affects the child. This rationalistic view is often at variance with the spontaneous and humanistic theories held by many teachers. While teachers must adjust to the rational theory held by the controlling forces of schools, they are inclined to adhere to their own views in actual  classroom practice. Within this conceptual framework, a future study will be conducted to examine teachers' perceptions of their work, of education generally, and of the rationalistic model currently enforced by government and bureaucracies.

The classroom management styles of 158 experienced teachers and 155 education majors were examined using a questionnaire based on the induction-sensitization paradigm of socialization. The results of the personality measures indicated that the inductive approach to management was associated with an internal locus of control and openness to new ideas for the education majors. This study has demonstrated that experienced  classroom teachers and teacher education majors approach student misbehavior in very similar ways. Gender differences, although present in both groups, were stronger for the education majors. Detailed analyses of these results and suggestions for future research are provided. (Author/CJ)",

It began in 1976 with state funding, and serves 500 teachers in nine rural and small town districts. An initial needs assessment provided a basis for planning and responding to individual teachers' needs as well as producing regional programs. Inservice planning teams were established at every school in the region, with a RISE staff member acting as facilitator at meetings. One-shot workshops were the chief means of inservice until the limitations of such random and short term offerings were recognized. A transition point was reached in 1980 with a new district inservice format, involving small groups of teachers working together  over a longer period of time, drawing increasingly on each other and their administrators instead of outside experts. Former teachers or local teachers on leave are employed by RISE to serve as consultant/advisers. A Teachers' Center Policy Board, a Superintendents' Advisory Council, and an Interdistrict Committee form the governance structure of RISE. (FG)",

During the second year, the testing program was expanded to include the elementary grades. Basic skills performance in reading, math, and language was assessed in grades 3 and 11, math skills in grades 5 and 7, and reading and language skills in grades 4, 6, and 9. One of the major goals of the Basic Skills Assessment Program is to provide useful test data for program evaluation as well as individual diagnosis. These pamphlets are designed to inform parents, teachers, and administrators about the  DODDS Basic Skills Assessment Program. Instructional goals for reading development, language arts, and mathematics are included at the various grade levels and measurement terms are defined. The administrator's pamphlet is designed to help him or her integrate results of the assessment with other input on student performance and program effectiveness, and to use these results to make instructional and curricular decisions.

II is delimited by validity, reliability, and utility of MFF as a measure of the reflective-impulsive construct. Validity, reliability and utility of construct assessment may be improved by utilizing: (1) a prototypic scoring model that will enable development of MFF norms; and (2) item analyses (performed on MFF test items) results which will reveal good test items, reveal defective test items, provide a graphic display of item performance, explain the origin of the current imbroglio about MFF test reliability and validity, and indicate steps necessary to enhance MFF instrument and research integrity. The impulsive-deliberative score (ID Score) is discussed as a potentially  better scoring procedure than the double median split procedure for users of reflective-impulsive category information.

The present study investigated the relationship between mathematical background and problem perception in two experiments. Experiment 1 employed hierarchical clustering analysis to compare the way that experts (nine mathematics professors) sorted 32 mathematics problems typical of college mathematics courses with the way that novices (19 undergraduates) sorted the same problems. The experimenters assigned an a priori mathematical \"surface structure\" and a mathematical \"deep structure\" characterizations to each problem. \"Surface structure\" refers to the items described in the  problems themselves. \"Deep structure\" refers to the mathematical principles necessary for solution. Results indicated that the two groups use different criteria for considering problems to be related. Experiment 2 compared changes in mathematics problem perception of students who took a computer course during the same time period. Training in problem solving resulted in the experimental group's problem perception being more differentiated and more like that of experts. Appendices contain the 32 problems used in the experiments and the mathematics pretest. (Author/RL)",

Four judges ranked the live auditions, while five evaluated videotapes of the same performance of the high school seniors. The auditions were videotaped in black and white. A single camera was used, fixed at an intermediate distance so as to give a whole-body view. Tapes were mailed to the judges for viewing on playback equipment. Correlations between the two sets of assessments indicated considerable agreeement across methods of evaluation, though they were not equivalent to one another. In the present sample, the use of videotapes for final decisions about nominations for awards would have resulted in a completely different group of nominees from those actually  chosen. On the other hand, videotapes used as a screening device would have permitted a 60% reduction in those invited to give live auditions with a loss of only one individual who was eventually determined to be among or near the five most accomplished. Despite the limitations of this effort, its results point clearly to the usefulness of videotapes as a screening device. (Author/RL)",

        "description":"In an adaptive test, the test administrator chooses test items sequentially during the test, in such a way as to adapt test difficulty to examinee ability as shown during testing. An effectively designed adaptive test can resolve the dilemma inherent in conventional test design. By tailoring tests to individuals, the adaptive test can approximately achieve the high point precision of a peaked test and can extend that high level of precision over the wide range of a uniform test. As a result, a well-constructed adaptive test should be more broadly applicable than a conventional test of comparable item quality and test length, since its precision characteristics make it useful for classification about one or many cutting points, as well as for measurement over a wide range. This  paper defines adaptive mental testing in relation to conventional mental testing, outlines the major research issues in adaptive mental testing, and reviews the state of the art for each of the research issues. The research issues are: (1) psychometric theory; (2) design of adaptive tests; (3) scoring adaptive tests; (4) the testing medium; (5) item pool development; and (6) advances in measurement technology.

This review of the literature was originally intended to follow meta-analysis procedures, but that type of analysis had to be abandoned because only 11 of the 20 research studies published in the 1920s used any form of control group. Things improved only slightly by the 1970s with two thirds of the major studies of ability grouping in the United States using some form of control group. Unfortunately, the control groups were often intact schools with numerous between school differences in both student and teacher populations. Other characteristics of the quantitative literature which preclude a valid meta-analysis approach are undefined or inconsistent  criteria for forming ability groups, undefined, vague or single-study unique criteria for comparing grouped and non-grouped classes, and combining treatment (grouped) and not-treatment (no ability grouping) conditions for individual children. In addition, a great many of the important articles on ability grouping are qualitative and based upon subjective rather than objective data. Along with a tabular summary of the quantitative studies, an overview of qualitative studies and discussions of ability grouping are presented. (Author/RL)",

The process of automating exams was accomplished by using the Statistical Test Item Collection System (STICS). This system was first used to select a set of questions based on course requirements established in advance; afterward, STICS was utilized to generate multiple exams from this collection of questions. The procedure for automating exams involved five steps: (1) establishing course objectives for the material to be covered; (2) selecting a question frame, or collection, to reflect the established objectives; (3) editing and extensive review of the questions considered for use; (4) refining the question frame and possible additions to it; and (5) generating exams  using the conversational program BEGET. These five steps were covered in detail. The exam production process was illustrated by applying STICS in the context of an imaginary course that purported to promote student adoption of the critical, questioning outlook expressed in Huff's book, How to Lie with Statistics. Fifteen objectives defining what is expected of students completing the course, and exam questions and answers are provided in appendices. (Author/RL)",

In this study, Weiner's model for causal attributions was employed to explore these perceived attributional differences. Data were gathered from 184 teachers from two metropolitan school districts. Of the 184 teachers, 60 taught grades 1-8, 124 taught grades 9-12; 69 were male, all of whom taught at the secondary level. Teachers were asked to complete a questionnaire which asked them to divide 100 percent among four probable causes for a classroom situation in which they were either particularly successful or unsuccessful with a group of students. Causes related to their teaching abilities, effort put into teaching,  difficulty of the task and luck. Statistically significant differences between attributions for positive versus negative outcomes were identified along the dimensions of both internality/externality and stability of cause. Relations to overall efficacy, teaching experience, grade level taught, and teacher gender were also explored. However, only grade level differences were found to be statistically significant. Elementary teachers tended to attribute their lack of success to lack of effort more than did secondary teachers. (Author/RL)",

The impetus for the study came from occasional reports by school administrators that their school level grade equivalent suggested above average performance while the state assessment percentile rank seemed low by comparison. Achievement test scores at the building level, obtained from approximately 302 school districts, were merged with state assessment scores in reading, writing skills and mathematics for grades 5, 8, and 11. Correlations in the .70 to .85 range revealed a similar rank ordering of schools by commercial and  state assessment tests. Rather than average building performance being equivalent to the grade-month of testing, as believed by many administrators, the distribution of building mean scores for several commercial tests indicated that &quot;average&quot; corresponded to a grade equivalent of six months to a year beyond that point. Commercial achievement test scores examined included those from the California Achievement Tests, Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills, Iowa Tests of Basic Skills, Metropolitan Achievement Tests, Science Research Associate Assessment Survey and the Stanford Achievement Test.

Data were gathered from 44 intermediate and high school level teachers who particpated in an inservice training workshop on mastery learning strategies. Correlations between teachers' initial expectations for students' achievement and students' final examination scores, final grades, and teachers' follow-up expectations for students, were all significantly lower in mastery classes of those teachers who experienced some positive change in their instructional effectiveness. The degree of change in instructional effectiveness was determined by comparing each teacher's mastery and control classes  in terms of the following two outcome measures: (1) percent of students in each class receiving an A or B as course grade; and (2) average percent correct on a common course examination. Implications regarding related teacher perceptions and classroom behaviors are discussed. (Author/RL)",

        "description":"Item response changing as a function of test anxiety was investigated. Seventy graduate students enrolled in a basic statistics course completed 73 multiple-choice items on the course content and the Test Anxiety Scale (TAS). The TAS consisted of 25 items that students indicated were descriptive (true) or not descriptive (false) of themselves. Students were classified as high, moderate, or low-anxious based on their TAS scores. Changed answers on the multiple-choice items were identified by inspection of the tests as well as marksense sheets and were classified as correct changes (wrong-to-right), incorrect changes (right-to-wrong), and neutral changes (wrong-to-wrong). Students were unaware of the nature of the research project when taking the tests. Data supported the  hypothesis that high test anxious students make more item response changes than low test anxious students. Results also suggested that both high and low anxious students profit to a similar extent proportionally from answer changing. It was further found that more responses were changed on difficult than on easy items for both high and low anxious students. Test anxiety is suggested as a factor forming test-taking style.

One hundred eighty nine students from four campuses of a city consolidated community college system were divided into two groups and taught over an 18-week semester by: (1) experienced teachers under mastery learning conditions; or (2) other techniques (controls). The Adult Achievement Responsibility (AAR) scale was used to collect attributional information and was administered in the third, tenth, and seventeenth weeks of instruction. An individual's AAR score was defined as the total number of internally oriented choices selected by the student. Student effort was assessed by observation of overt time-on-task  behaviors, and by collecting data on the student's patterns of classroom absenteeism. Achievement was considered to be a cognitive measure of the student's level of performance on formative and summative examinations, as well as his or her final grade in a course. Results indicated that an individual's attributions are significantly related to measures of effort and achievement, but are manipulable only when certain learning conditions can be achieved.

Validity coefficients with shorthand dictation achievement ranged from r=0.44 to 0.55.

The  Teacher's Manual contains the following six sections: (1) Purpose of the LSAT; (2) Administering the LSAT; (3) Scoring the LSAT; (4) Interpreting LSAT scores; (5) Technical Data from Three Validations Studies; and (6) Collecting Other Validity Data.

Data are the responses of approximately 36,000 children during 1978-79 to two test forms of the California Assessment Program's Survey of Basic Skills: Grade 6 (SBS:6). Performance on specific arithmetic items is studied and involves the concepts of whole numbers, fractions, and decimals. These skills are tested both as simple computations and as story problems. Of the six problems presented in this study, three showed sex differences in the patterns of responses; boys were more likely than girls to answer the story problems correctly after missing computation items requiring the same skills. From these two forms, the indications were that girls are selecting the same  distractors regardless of performance on the computations. In contrast, boys' responses seemed to depend upon success or failure on the computations. Analysis of distractors does not explain why boys and girls differ in their responses. However, such analyses can be useful in identifying the areas in which the sexes differ. (RL)",

The survey analysis showed that those served by the program received a fraction of the services given to public school students. The investigation of the 50 districts identified a number of practices that limited the quantity of private school students included in Title I programs, and the quality of services they received. It also found that the present approach has an impact on the organization of private schools, especially the  centralization of their administration, school-teacher relations, and relationships between schools and parents. The report reviews the development of the current interpretation of the First Amendment, as it involves schools, and proposes an alternative approach that would avoid the entanglements of the public with the private experienced in the present program. It concludes by reviewing the approach taken to provide services in the Indian territories. (Author/MK)",

        "description":"During the 1979-80 academic year the Bilingual Program in Community School District 16 in New York City, which served first through sixth graders, emphasized four areas: student achievement in English and Spanish reading, mathematics, and Puerto Rican history and culture; staff training; parental involvement; and supportive services. Student achievement was evaluated through norm and criterion referenced tests. It was found to vary from school to school within the district with most students making gains in most areas. The staff training component offered preservice, inservice and formal training at a university to bilingual staff members. The evaluator found that all activities were carried out successfully. Parents were encouraged to participate in advisory councils, workshops  and cultural activities, and in English, Spanish, and High School equivalency classes. Family assistants were also available. The evaluator determined that family assistants and teachers provided a needed liaison with the community and that parents were involved in many activities. Supportive academic and cultural activities were offered by a bilingual resource teacher and were found to be effective. (MK)",

Bilingual support personnel were available for LEP students. LEP students who achieved proficiency in English were transferred out of the program while receiving additional academic support services. LEP students were mainstreamed in all subject areas. A team of guidance counselors and family assistants supported pupil adjustment and parent involvement. The program was evaluated through  a questionnaire which asked school principals to identify the strengths and weaknesses of Project SELL and through evaluator observations.

A few select examples are illustrative of a broad range of forces, trends, and effects which intrude upon the policy-making and resource allocation functions of postsecondary education. These forces include the educational revolution (quantity, equality, quality); accountability; the realization of finite resources; change in the work place; the rights movements; and the increased rate of technological and societal change. From an analysis of these trends, implications can be drawn for the planning function in general and for technical education in particular. A planning process is needed to  keep technical education viable in the 1980s. Components of the planning process include planning protocol and structure, planning assumptions, goal specification, and program development. In launching a comprehensive planning process, a college must make a commitment to the personnel development component to complement these structural components. It is certain that comprehensive institutional planning must make progress from the \"ad hoc\" to the \"planned\" end of the planning continuum in the 1980s; trend analysis will be an integral part of the process.

        "description":"A study was conducted to identify and organize a discussion of the most important issues to be considered in building or modifying an occupational employment projection system to best suit local area conditions and information needs. After a review of information-generating techniques in use by various public agencies, state offices and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the various forecasting techniques were classified into four major approaches. These approaches are (1) the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) program based upon the industry-occupation matrix used by the BLS; (2) regional econometric models used to represent the complex economic relationships among sectors of a local economy; (3) the regional input-output model approach, which describes in detail the  inter-industry linkages (purchases and sales) within the local economy; and (4) employer surveys. It was concluded that, in general, neither regional econometric nor input-output models can significantly add to the overall quality of occupational employment projections that are currently being developed using the OES approach. Ten recommendations are made for future employment needs-trends projections research and practice. (KC)",

To answer this question, two national surveys on functional competencies in occupational adaptability and consumer economics were conducted. Competencies were first identified and then four respondent groups (national samples of the general adult population, high school seniors, public school teachers, and employers) were asked three questions about each competency: If a person did not have this ability, how well would he/she do at work? Where should a person be taught this? and Where do most people actually learn this? Results (summarized in this report) show that, in general, abilities pertaining directly to basic  skills (especially mathematics skills) were perceived to be the school's responsibility for teaching. Abilities perceived to be the home's responsibility were abilities having to do with taking care of belongings. But overall, public opinion was divided among whether these abilities should be taught at home, in school, or self-taught. (The report also contains a \"viewpoint\" section--the authors' viewpoints on alternative interpretations and recommendations based on the results of the survey reported as well as other related research; a tentative guide for curriculum-planning dialogue; a bibliography; and the survey ability statements/task areas/enabling behaviors.)

        "description":"Research methodologies are \"word-specific,\" that is, they assume frames of reference which do not include all of reality. They are like the \"sets\" in mathematics in which axioms apply only within certain realities. (Parallel lines do converge, for example, on the horizon; the geometric postulate that says they do not holds only for the set of a flat world.) The idea of a theory of sets in educational research is advanced on the strength of four postulates. These postulates are the following: (1) the aim of social research is self-definition; (2) change characterizes social reality; (3) all investigative initiatives manipulate and transform reality; and (4) appropriate research method compensates for the manipulative/transformative effects of observation by directing its skew in a  direction similar to the commonly, self-defined direction of the observed social reality. It follows from these four postulates that research methodology in education evolves out of and has direct applicability to the particular system in which these practices give rise. In the case of adult educators, the choices of the paradigm have become quite limited in scope. The choice and values of the set have been limited by the narrowing practice of adult education in the United States, by the increased institutionalization of adult education with the consequent reduction of adult learning to adult schooling, and by the emerging systemic which controls the previous two practices. This theory of educational research sets can be applied to research on \"liberatory education,\" nontraditional  education for adults which is often at odds with traditional education when traditional education tries to include it. It explains why the two educational sets are at odds--their perceptions of reality differ. (KC)",

This preliminary typology is unique in that it represents a break-through in providing researchers a classification system theoretically based and empirically tested. It also provides further understanding of the dynamics of the work-centered and person-centered dimensions of programs and their effects on learner outcomes. The study was divided into phases: in 1979 interview data were collected and in 1980 an instrument was developed that could more readily collect data similar to that of the interviews and thus enable classification of the programs. The first year's work identified nine program  characteristics that could be used as indicators of normative-personalistic relationships. Interview data were organized around these characteristics, enabling a three-class typology. The 1980 year's work consisted of transforming the interview data-collection process into a more efficient method using an easy-to-administer instrument that could be used with all students, staff, and employers associated with an experiential program. Several pilot tests of the instrument were conducted in Columbus, Ohio, and in Massachusetts. After the pilot instrument was revised, thirty-one programs in six states were finally pilot-tested. Results of the pilot revealed that the instrument developed can readily gather data on normative-personalistic relationships, can be administered to all students, can  be scored easily, and provides a better picture of the normative-personalistic dynamics than the interview data.

From the Morrill Act of 1862, through New Deal policy initiatives and on to the &quot;active&quot; manpower policies operating in Europe, the record of government programs and the economic theories underlying them are surveyed and assessed. Special attention is given in this review to the identification of the role assigned education and training as a work-life adjustment mechanism. The account traces the enduring tension in public policy responses between adjustment to change (epitomized by the education and training approach) and resistance to change in the American workplace. A case is presented for the  fuller development of countercyclical education and training policy incorporating relevant and useful elements of the European experience. Such a policy would call for programs which would expand public education and training opportunities during business cycle downswings or other planned-for slack periods in the labor market, as in the 1980 case of a planned recession. Through such expanded education and training opportunities, the stock of workforce skills and worker mobility would be preserved and enhanced. Such a policy stands in sharp contrast to present policy and practice in the United States, in which both public and private education and training activity diminishes during economic downswings. How countercyclical programs are designed and financed abroad and could be structured  in the U.S. are discussed. (KC)",

Information was gathered by interviews with Polaroid management officials in the Human Resources Development Group; staff of the Education and Career Planning Department; and employees who have participated in the program; review of internal policy; and library research. The study examines the structure, provisions, and administration of the company plan; the experience and motivations of plan managers and plan participants; and the corporate context in which the plan operates. Findings show that the company has a systematic and comprehensive series of courses and programs for its hourly and salaried employees,  including internal and external programs, organizational development, and career and education counseling. The Tuition Assistance Plan is an integrated component of this overall employee development program. It pays 100 percent (for full-time employees) of tuition in advance for a broad range of company approved courses. Polaroid encourages employees to participate in the Plan by educational counseling, publicity in house organs, and word of mouth. According to Polaroid figures, approximately 6,000 (50 percent) of the corporation's domestic employees participated in an average of one-and-one-half internal or external education and training activities during 1977-78. Ten percent of the eligible domestic workforce participated in the Tuition Assistance Plan, and of these, 40 percent were  from the hourly ranks. Factors contributing to this high rate of participation appear to be the paid tuition, supervisory encouragement of education and training, and an atmoshphere that emphasizes the rewards of education.

The reasons for this growth include (1) the aging of the U.S. population; (2) the changing role of women in society; and (3) the declining enrollments of traditional college-age students combined with the evergrowing fiscal crisis in institutions of higher learning. This growth in participation in education and learning has consequences for the individual and society. This monograph is intended to provide a better and more comprehensive understanding of adult participation in learning activities. The paper first assesses participation in different types of  education programs for different subgroups of the adult population. Possible reasons for participation are then explored, followed by a discussion of reasons for nonparticipation. The final section of the paper presents a summary, and policy and program implications.

Despite these figures and despite widespread interest in the tuition-aid idea, a low 3 to 5 percent of eligible employees currently take advantage of the educational benefit. This manual is designed as a guide for those interested in developing or improving tuition-aid plans. The guide first defines and describes prevalent forms of tuition-aid plans as well as their benefits and payoffs. Key features of effective plans are then outlined, and concerns of different parties are addressed in questions and answers. Next, the plan-implementation process is explored and ways to overcome barriers to plan use  are presented. Fianlly, a sample tuition-aid plan is provided, as well as resources for further investigation of the area. The guide is based on the findings of a study of tuition-assistance programs in the private and public sectors over the past four years. Key aspects of that examination have been (1) a major survey of negotiated tuition-aid programs in the private sector which involved detailed analysis of 79 tuition assistance plans, and interview and paper surveys of 50 company officials, union officials, and 100 workers; (2) on-site case studies of three highly used tuition-assistance programs; and (3) the operation during 1979 and 1980 of three workplace-based model tuition-assistance demonstration projects.

The programs are those of the Education Fund of District Council 37 of AFSCME; Polaroid Corporation's Tuition Assistance Plan; and the Education Opportunities Plan of Kimberly-Clark Corporation. The case studies describe the historical background and design of the programs, how they function and are accessed, how well they meet the purposes of users and sponsors, and what factors seem to account for worker use rates well above the national norms of 4-5 percent of those eligible. Discussed are the main features of these three highly diverse tuition assistance programs; the elements common to all three programs and their operating environments, as well as salient  differences; requirements for and limits to the broader implementation of the promising practices and support arrangements contained in these programs; and an informed assessment of what the experience of these programs tell about the role tuition aid can play in meeting education and training needs of workers and employers.

        "description":"Adult Americans have been participating in formal education and training programs in record numbers in recent years. Yet studies of participation by working Americans in tuition assistance programs have consistently revealed that few take advantage of them. This report describes and analyzes the Kimberly-Clark Corporation's tuition-assistance program, the Educational Opportunities Plan (EOP). The EOP is recognized as having an unusually innovative plan structure, an extensive administrative system, and an extremely supportive corporate environment, all of which combine to create a climate in which employee participation in education thrives. While the average rate of worker participation nationally for such plans is around 4 percent, eligible employee use of the EOP was  approximately 30 percent in 1978. The report explores how the EOP was designed and established and why it works. The study covers four major areas: current corporate, geographic and cultural environments; the history of the EOP's design and early implementation at Kimberly-Clark; the plan itself--structure, specific provisions and administration; and EOP success--how it is empirically measured by employee participation rates and how it is qualitatively perceived by corporate management, individuals involved in plan administration, and Kimberly-Clark employees. The study is based on interviews with those persons, combined with extensive documentation of the EOP. (KC)",

        "description":"This paper reviews and summarizes the current and projected status of education and employment, and their relatedness, for working women, and suggests avenues for improvement. It examines women's increasing role in the labor force and the social, economic, and demographic trends and projections relevant to that role. In evaluating the impact on women of existing programs of worker education and training, the paper assesses federal, local, private, and union offerings for working women. After this delineation of the female workforce, its educational opportunities, and the spurs and barriers to use of those opportunities, consideration is given to policy implications for government, private sector, and educational institutions. The focus of the paper provides a rationale for a  special focus on working women's educational opportunities. Its context is that when women are not specifically targeted by a program, they are underserved by it; artificial barriers stemming from sex-role stereotypes render unequal their opportunity to benefit from the program. Thus, while all workers can profit from greater consideration of their educational needs, it is the aim of this paper to help program designers understand the specific needs of women, so that predictable obstacles faced by female workers may be addressed preventively rather than remedially.

        "description":"The population of the United States is aging and will age even more rapidly in the coming years. Yet our public and private retirement and benefits policies continue to favor early retirement--in spite of clear demographic trends, in spite of legislation raising the mandatory retirement age from 65 to 70, in spite of the fact that many of our older citizens can't live on their pensions in these days of double-digit inflation, and in spite of the fact that fewer people are having to support pension plans for an ever-expanding group of longer-lived retirees. This monograph examines education and training policy in view of the labor force implications of this changing age phenomenon. First, the paper provides an overview of the state of existing knowledge related to aging,  education, labor force retention, and retirement. Second, it provides an overview of labor force disincentives in current Social Security and private pension policies which all but push older workers into retirement, and contrasts these policies with the influences of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). Third, it looks at personnel policies generally and how they affect different age groups. Fourth, it looks at retirement for the individual and some alternatives to retirement. Next, it explores some of the principles of education and training and examines some precedents in human resource development which take age and aging into account. Sixth, the paper considers new levels of cooperation between education institutions and employers that use age factors in a positive  manner, and then examines some of the long-term policy implications of extended working life. Finally, a series of recommendations is offered. (KC)",

The reasons for this growth and what trends in adult education can be projected for the future are the subject of this policy research monograph. The monograph began with the question, &quot;What will the clientele and scale of adult education likely be in 1990 if present trends continue and if there are no marked changes in the way work institutions, education institutions, and American workers behave toward adult education?&quot; The report is a portrayal of the next ten years of adult education, assuming continuation of past trends in participation for various age, sex, race, educational attainment, and income groupings in the population. It assumes no significant change in the way major work and educational  institutions value and support worklife education opportunity. These projections suggest a future of widening disparity in educational attainment between majority and minority population, between the more affluent and the less afluent, younger and older adults, and between high educational achievers and those with low prior educational attainments.

The study involved the following four data collection procedures: (1) analysis of existing data concerning educational, social, and economic factors for all 50 states, with a more detailed analysis of data in 584 local education agencies in seven states, (2) questionnaires sent to 22,000 respondents in 62 local secondary education sites in the seven states, (3) a comprehensive review of literature, and (4) case studies conducted in eight local secondary education sites in seven states. The dependent variable for the study was the percentage of former secondary vocational education students from a local education agency employed in a  field related to their training. Data revealed eight major categories of factors affecting job placement of these students. The factors are community; labor market; education; philosophy; legislation, regulation, and funding mechanisms; curriculum; teachers; and admissions. Other factors isolated include student clubs and community and school concurrence in viewing vocationally educated students as a valued economic resource. (A selected bibliography is included.)

        "description":"Locating and assessing new and emerging occupations is a required task for those vocational/technical educators who want to prepare for meeting the needs for skilled workers in the future as well as for those currently in demand. This ongoing process requires contact with a wide range of people and organizations. Information concerning job duties, education and training requirements, employment outlook data, employment settings, career opportunities, agencies and individuals to contact, and existing program offerings all must be assessed when examining a new occupation. Educators must monitor state and national legislation and resulting policy implications, changing economic conditions and social values, and technological developments. Information about jobs can be gained from  employers, professional associations, special interest groups, newsletters and publications, and personal conversation and correspondence. Occupational projections available from both traditional and less expected sources should be analyzed by the vocational/technical education planner even when &quot;new&quot; jobs as a category may not be included. State Occupational Information Coordinating Committees may be especially helpful; or surveys of employers can provide occupational projection data as well as other information needed to plan for vocational/technical training. Local factors must always be taken into account prior to implementation of a program for what appears to be a new and emerging occupation. (KC)",

        "description":"A study investigated the relationship of learning to problems that occur in the lives of adults. Of special interest were the dynamics of learning in natural/nonformal settings and the role of literacy in learning. Examination of research in reasoning and problem solving revealed two trends: increasing realization that much of what people do is determined by peculiarities and particularities of situations or context in which they find themselves, and what is important in understanding how people think and learn is not the process but the content or knowledge. Three problems were identified to aid in finding out how problem-solving and learning contribute to an adult's ability to cope with his environment. They were identification of some adults, selection of situations  representative of these adults' normal task domains, and analysis and representation of adults' interaction with these situations. An interpretive framework for the research was indicated which involved interviews semi-structured, open-ended, and probing in nature. A second year of the project has been planned to involve data analysis, development of simulated problem solving scenarios, interviews with a new sample, and follow-up. Data analysis would be based on a \"reduction\"--a type of textual analysis accomplished in four stages: atomizing, categorizing, thematizing, and schematizing. (YLB)",

        "description":"All thirty-two prime sponsors of Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) program in Pennsylvania were surveyed in order to determine their observations about the nature and effectiveness of CETA/educational linkages in their areas. The respondents were also asked to nominate programs in their areas that they considered as good or poor examples of linkages. The program operators of these nominated programs were then surveyed to ascertain their rating of the effectiveness of their CETA/educational linkages and suggestions for improvement of, or establishment of, such linkages. Of 145 nominees, 138 responded. Sixty-eight program operators and twenty-six prime sponsors were interviewed in depth. Review of pertinent literature and the findings from these interviews and  surveys resulted in the general conclusion that divergent philosophies concerning goals, lack of communication, personality conflicts, frequent change in personnel, different fiscal calendars, inflexible regulations and eligibility criteria, unnecessary and burdensome paper-work, local conservative and political differences, local transportation deficiencies and political pressures all play a role in determining the effectiveness of CETA/educational linkages. Ten recommendations for improvement were made. (The study report is largely made up of the viewpoints and comments of the respondents and interviewees.) (KC)",

Three variables--job aspirations congruence, the categorical stability of jobs and aspirations over one year, and the predictive validity of jobs and aspirations over one to five years--were assessed in parallel fashion. Data revealed the following: (1) eventual congruence of category of job (realistic, investigative, artistic, social, enterprising, and conventional) and apirations was achieved more often by men changing aspirations to match jobs rather than vice  versa; (2) aspirations for category of work generally were not as useful as category of jobs for predicting category of jobs held from one to five years later; and (3) the aspirations of lower- and middle-class men were equally predictive of later jobs. Level of work is more important to men than is category of work, and differences between lower-class youth and middle-class youth in their level of job aspirations exist from the earliest ages studied.

The study involved 66 volunteers (reduced by attrition to 48) who attended one of three six-hour, one-day sessions: guided field trips; cognitive decision-making training; or behavioral problem-solving training. Two self-report inventories, the Career Information Search Survey (CISS) and the Extent of Planning (EP) scale from the Career Development Inventory, and one specially designed behavioral measure, the Career Information Request, (CIR) were employed to assess career exploration. Career exploratory behavior was defined as the frequency of self-initiated career information-seeking incidents. Career decision-making behavior was  defined as the extent of knowledge about and application of decision-making principles to career-related problems. Measures were taken to separate any observed effects of the career guidance methods from academic achievement level. A one-way multiple analysis of covariance (ANCOVE) statistic was computed for treatment effects. No demonstrable effects resulting from the one-day workshops were found, but the study has implications for guidance practices and research procedures. (KC)",

Approximately equal numbers of women in male-dominated programs (nontraditionals) and female-dominated programs (traditionals) completed the self-administered questionnaire regarding (1) demographic/family background; (2) support/encouragement from others; (3) peer experience with nontraditional programs; and (4) personality and sex-role  orientation. Results revealed the student subgroups differed most significantly in the amount of support, encouragement, and discouragement they received from the important others in their lives.

The discussions yielded policy implications in five major areas. These are access to the private sector, educational strategies and institutions, supportive services, public job creation, and management. Roundtable participants also commented on nine issues relating to the policies of business and education/human services groups. These issues were (1) hiring practices, (2) major barriers to hiring more youth, (3) special career and vocational needs of minority students, (4) employer contacts with local Comprehensive Employment and Training Act  offices, (5) the projected performance of Youth Education and Development Act-fostered relationships, (6) changes in work force needs in the next five years, (7) education and job training programs for youth, (8) facilitating cooperation between educational institutions and the private sector, and (9) the role of the federal government in helping industry hire more youth. The format and approach of the roundtables was also discussed.

In section 2, &quot;Lessons from Program Emperience,&quot; the following topics are covered: program elements; underlying approaches; delivery, design, and organizational lessons; and management of youth employment and training programs. Section 3, entitled&quot;Restructuring and Reorienting the Youth Employment and Training System,&quot; covers new program directions, budget and policy options, and recommendations. Six appendixes, constituting over half the document, provide a graphic analysis of youth employment problems, the employment and training portions of the Youth Act of 1980, program elements, management information systems for the local program, interest group perspectives, and an analysis of youth program resource allocations.

Following an introductory chapter, the manual is divided into three parts with the greatest weight given to the second part. Part I elaborates on development of the horticulture therapy and rehabilitation field and puts into perspective the breadth of the current horticultural programs. Part II consists of the fundamental building blocks of the program. It includes guidelines for leadership, administration, community assessment, funding, personnel, and federal regulations. General training guidelines pertaining to admission, evaluation, and wage determination are also considered. Four program models are described:  greenhouse, plant sales, grounds maintenance, and contracting. The greenhouse and grounds maintenance program models are broken down into prevocational training, vocational training, and work co-op operations, and the requisite needs of planning, management, training, business, facilities, equipment, staff, etc., are discussed. Part III briefly presents a history and overview of the Melwood Horticultural Training Center, Inc., to exemplify the models presented earlier. Appendixes, amounting to approximately one-fourth of the manual, include sample personnel job descriptions, universities with horticultural therapy programs, curricula, and training and evaluation.

Appendix A presents data descriptive of the distribution of competencies within the developed taxonomy for each study and for the total pool of competencies  across the fourteen studies. These charts show frequency and percentage of competencies across the taxonomy consisting of two dimensions: twelve role function categories (instructional/planning, coordination, basic educational foundations/preparation, implementing instruction, evaluation and assessment, administration and supervision, counseling and guidance, collaboration and liaison, record keeping and accountability, classroom management, public relations, extracurricular activities), and three levels of specificity (general, intermediate, and specific).

Also interviewed were the cooperating business and industry personnel who were directly involved in working with the selected educators. Part 2 of the project was conducted through the use of survey questionnaires sent to all educators and administrators who had been involved in the staff exchange program since 1974. Among the findings was that the teachers who were interviewed indicated that the staff exchange experience had had a positive effect on vocational instructional methods. At least half  the teachers felt that the selection and/or preparation of instructional materials was better; the ratio of group to individual instruction had changed in a positive direction; more simulation techniques were being used; and the ratio of lab/shop activities to classroom activities had also changed in a positive direction. Teachers perceived the most important outcome of the staff exchange program to be the development of occupational knowledge and skills. (LRA)",

Although focusing on a specific vocational area (food service), the unit's step-by-step design can be applied to other vocational areas. Section A deals with the step processes undertaken by vocational educators in separating task preparation or performance into its component parts. Characteristics of hearing-impaired students and special considerations in teaching such students are overviewed. Some resources are listed. Two models illustrate the four-step process: (1) write out directions of task or assignment; (2) the breakdown directions into steps and list  materials, processes, tools, etc.; (3) categorize and list from step 2; and (4) continuously add new words to Master Classification List. Section B, for special educators, deals with the seven steps in determining lip-reading capability of words: separate words in syllable(s); group words homophenously, group words by obscurity, group words by blends, categorize into five roles (similar sounding, inadequate visual cues, same initial placement, more than one meaning, unfamiliar words), tally words, and rank words. An overview to lipreading is provided as well as classification of words. Section C is a glossary. (YLB)",

The five papers in section 1 discuss some major developments in nursing education research, including (1) past and future of research in the south, (2) conducting clinical instruction of health science students and evaluating student competencies and teacher effectiveness, (3) response to the second paper from a nursing viewpoint, (4) clinical laboratory in nursing education, and (5) factors affecting faculty development for women in higher education. The second section contains abstracts of 17 collaborative research studies conducted during the project. This research is related to four nursing education issues: clinical performance evaluation,  curriculum, laboratory and clinical teaching strategies, and faculty development. Each study is summarized, and findings and/or conclusions are outlined. The three papers in section 3 offer three views of collaborative research. One presents results from surveys of researchers participating in the project regarding process and impact of participation. The other two papers are a dean's perspective of collaborative research by faculty and a faculty point of view. Section 4 contains three papers emphasizing the importance of publishing research results. The two papers in the final section focus on finding and obtaining research funding for nurses and nursing's impact on federal legislation. (YLB)",

        "description":"In 1971 the Appalachian Community Service Network (ASCN), a non-profit community service network, headquartered in Washington, D.C., with broadcast facilities in Lexington, Kentucky, began to beam teacher education courses via satellite to teachers at 45 community receiving sites located in 13 states throughout the Appalachian region. The project was entitled the Appalachian Educational Satellite Project (AESP). The ATS-6 satellite, which reversed the functions of the satellite and earth stations, provided a major cost breakthrough. When the system acquired time on RCA's SATCOM 1 satellite, the ASCN grew geographically, conceptually, demographically, and temporally. Included in ACSN programming are community service offerings, college-level telecourses, professional development  programming, and selected workshops. Recent data reveal that the average undergraduate course viewer is 35 or younger and a childless female who lives in either a rural or suburban community and who works as a fulltime professional. Most viewers are college graduates with some formal schooling within the last year. Viewers select ASCN courses to complete degrees, upgrade employment skills, or pursue an interest. Graduate/continuing education course viewers include nurses, teachers, and engineers. ASCN's aim for the future is to further diversify, responding to future audience needs. (MN)",

The sample or organizations included the 75 largest industrial firms, the 15 largest nonindustrial firms, and the 12 largest labor unions. Interviews were conducted with the individual in each organization who was responsible for educational or community relations. Among the findings was that over one-half of the organizations, other than energy and chemical firms, had some awareness of career education in general. Further, most representatives had a reasonably accurate understanding of the objectives of career education. Only three organizations, or four  percent of the sample, had adopted policy statements supporting career education, and only two had issued guidelines for local site or branch-level involvement in career education activities. Over three-fourths of the organizations contacted were engaged in at least some career education-type activities (i.e., activities aimed directly or indirectly at promoting students' awareness of the work world and career planning/decision-making skills).

Forty-six men and women completed the Career Maturity Inventory, the Temperament and Values Inventory, and rating forms that required self-estimates of the characteristics purportedly measured by the Temperament and Values Inventory. Self-appraisal was defined in terms of difference scores between self-estimates and Temperament and Values Inventory scale scores. Pearson correlations of the difference scores and each of the six Career Maturity Inventory scales (with coefficients corrected for attenuation by measurement error) provided strong support for the proposition that self-appraisal is a function of career maturity.

        "description":"The occurrence of unpredictable and often unavoidable aversive seizures in epilepsy bears a striking resemblance to the conditions known to induce learned helplessness. Additionally, depression and other characteristics associated with helplessness seem to occur more frequently among persons with epilepsy. Data from a national survey of individuals having epilepsy (N=286) suggest that certain seizure experiences may contribute to a sense of helplessness and that this, in turn, may influence health related behaviors. However, the proportions of explained variance in each of these relationships, while statistically significant, was far less than the proportion which remained unexplained. Results indicate that social support may either mitigate against the development of learned  helplessness or serve to disrupt existing helplessness. (Author/KMF)",

        "description":"A multi-dimensional approach to evaluating psychological well-being or distress is essential for a full description of subjective mental health. Factor analytic techniques were used to explore dimensions of subjective mental health with data collected from two, nationwide representative sample surveys of U.S. adults. Indices were constructed concerning aspects of adjustment in marriage, parenthood, and work, self-perceptions, and symptoms of distress. Analyses revealed three dominant factors involving strain, feelings of low morale, and personal inadequacy. Distinct year effects also emerged: for women, a generational change in the relationship between self-perceptions and perceived problems in raising children; and for men, a shift toward greater compartmentalization of job  concerns and the development of a distinct \"help-seeking\" orientation.

A slide/tape presentation containing information about each therapist at an urban mental health clinic was used to help clients choose their own therapist. Clients (N=21) were administered a questionnaire to assess their reactions to being allowed to choose and their reasons for choosing a particular therapist. Findings indicated that the act of choosing had a positive impact on clients and that when choosing, clients placed more importance on relationship factors than physical likeness or active-therapist  qualities. The slide/tape presentation appears to be a simple, practical procedure for allowing clients to select their own therapists. Results suggest that there may be positive implications for therapy outcome when clients exercise their right to choose their therapist. (Author/NRB)",

Youth (N=73) were assigned to one of three conditions: (1) the control group receiving usual court treatment; (2) the family condition involving a trained undergraduate volunteer who worked with the delinquent for 18 weeks and focused entirely on the family; and (3) the multi-focus group using volunteers who focused on several life domains. Outcome measures included police and court data, self-reported delinquent behavior, and school data. Process interviews were also conducted with youth, parent, peers, and volunteers. The multi-focus group showed a greater decrease in the frequency and seriousness of court and  police contacts and reported less delinquent behavior than did the other groups. The multi-focus group was also superior in terms of school interactions. The broad-based multi-focus intervention appears to be preferable to the targeting of the family alone. The two experimental groups experienced less incarceration during the program than did the control group, thus supporting the continued use of diversion as an alternative to normal juvenile justice system processing.

Androgynous, masculine, feminine and undifferentiated males and females (N=73) attributed reasons for female success to three types of cues: male-dominated, female-dominated, and exclusively female achievement areas. For external attributions, there were no differences among males, but feminine females were more likely than androgynous or masculine females to externally attribute female success. For internal attributions, feminine females were less likely than feminine males to use internal  attributions across cues, while undifferentiated females were more likely than undifferentiated males to internally attribute across cues. Androgynous and masculine men and women reacted exactly opposite to each success activity. Results suggest that sex, sex role identity and situational variations occur in the prediction of female achievement behaviors. (Author/NRB)",

Longitudinal data from a national survey of low-income aged (N=4494) was analyzed to assess the social impact of widowhood on older persons. Widows interviewed in 1973 and again in 1974 were classified into three categories according to the length of their widowhood and compared to married persons on measures of family, friend, and neighbor interaction. Findings indicated that the recently widowed, while manifesting stability in family and friend relations, exhibited more interaction with neighbors than married persons. Respondents widowed more than four years manifested lower levels of family interaction, suggesting that the  maintenance of family relations in later life is more difficult for those widowed early in life. An examination of the effects of sex and race on social interactions among the elderly revealed higher social participation among males than females, and greater neighboring activity among non-whites than whites. Non-whites also scored higher than whites on measures of friend and realtive interaction. (Author/NRB)",

A structured survey instrument based on intensive interviews was constructed and administered to a random sample of subjects to assess their psychological well-being. Results indicated that the sample showed a high level of well-being which was not affected by the presence of children,  chronological age, menopause, or hysterectomy. Sexual satisfaction contributed to well-being and was not affected by age, menopause, or hysterectomy. Although health was rarely cited as a problem, future concerns about health were evident, particularly in terms of aging.

The first classroom of students (N=14) received regular classroom instruction. The second classroom was composed of two experimental groups, i.e., 7 students who participated in the training program and 7 students who were exposed only to training program students. Teachers and trained observers rated students on 19 specific behaviors occurring in French and  mathematics classes before treatment, and at 1- and 3-month intervals after treatment. Results indicated that training in classroom participation skills modified the behavioral repertoire of both training and exposure groups.

To determine concurrent validity, a preliminary version of the scale was administered with four additional measures of marital and life satisfaction. Results indicated  that the Cleminshaw-Guidubaldi Parent Satisfaction Scale demonstrated validity with regard to other satisfaction scales.

Variables such as age at marriage and timing of children showed both sex and socioeconomic status (SES) differences, with males and middle SES students anticipating later ages for marriage and parenthood. More males than females expected to start full-time work at earlier ages; young women anticipated an exit and re-entry to the labor force due to child rearing.

The psychological treatments of milieu therapy, psychotherapy, behavior modification, and aversion therapy vary widely and cannot reasonably be ranked in such a manner. Psychologists must be prepared to answer questions about their therapies, to enlighten legal professionals about the distinctions among therapies, and to encourage the courts to specify particular therapy procedures for involuntary clients.

Three hypotheses were formulated to test the viability of the leadership substitutes concepts. Questionnaires were administered to hospital managers (N=63) and engineers (N=71). Instrumental and supportive leader behaviors were defined by scales developed specifically for hypothesis-testing with the Path-Goal Theory. Potential substitutes for leadership were measured by scales developed by Kerr and Germier. The two subordinate criterion measures consisted of organizational commitment based on data from the Organizational Commitment Questionnaire, and general job satisfaction based on results from the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire.  Statistical analysis indicated that the two samples differed on many dimensions. The results provided only limited support for the concept of leadership substitutes as suggested by previous research.

Initial interviews of adults (N=2299) were conducted in 1972; a follow-up study was conducted in 1976 with 1106 adults. The findings confirmed the conclusions of previous studies, i.e., that the absence of intimate ties was a disadvantage in coping with stressful life events. There was a lower frequency of confiding relationships among the elderly, although the oldest individuals with intimate relationships reported less distress and higher self-esteem than the oldest individuals without intimate relationships. Confiding in a spouse appeared to be slightly more effective for handling stress  than confiding in friends or relatives. (RC)",

        "description":"It is necessary to provide a comprehensive program of visual literacy skill development to provide a firm foundation for reading comprehension. A taxonomy of visual literacy can suggest an outline for such a program. Once the student has been made aware of the desired thought processes in familiar contexts, it is then appropriate to guide the student to translate the same visual understandings to less familiar, more varied contexts. Visual interpretation begins with the student identifying appropriate visual elements on the basis of direct definition or description, since part of the problem regarding visual illiteracy is the inability to associate the correct element with the appropriate descriptor. Though visual literacy enhances comprehension, it also has potential as a  generic, nongraded, nonthreatening, remedial strategy for the older student. It can provide a foundation for comprehension processing prior to the student's encounter with written discourse. Once the logic of comprehension is built by having students interact with classroom situations, share movies or television shows, discuss pictures and oral stories, the oral and visual processes developed by these means can ease the transition into similar processes in written language. This transition phase helps guide students into the notion that written language has meaning and that this meaning has logic that is familiar to their experiences. (HOD)",

The modified paraphrase items follow the WH- detail format while substituting, whenever possible, synonymous words or phrases for the content words in the passage sentence.

Observations were made of 36 first through sixth grade students reading orally in groups composed of one good reader, one poor reader, and one good or poor reader playing the &quot;teacher.&quot; The observations were followed by individual interviews. The form of assistance to miscues offered by students in the teacher's role consisted exclusively of providing students with the text word. The pattern of selection of miscues responded to replicated findings of earlier research with experienced teachers in a similar instructional context. The students in the teacher's role were (1) more likely to respond to miscues that affected meaning substantially; (2) more likely to  respond to miscues in difficult rather than easy materials; (3) more likely to respond to the miscues of poor readers than to those of good readers; and (4) more likely to respond quicker to the miscues of poor readers than to those of good readers. The interviews revealed that most students perceived the teacher's giving of text words helpful, that poor readers seem to express a more favorable attitude toward oral reading than good readers, that good readers in the teacher role were much better judges of who were good and poor readers, and that good readers were better judges of their own ability to understand the text they had just read.

A code scheme was developed to categorize the quantity and quality of time devoted to each reading-ability group; the discipline patterns in each group; the patterns of praise, criticism, and stated expectations for performance in each group; and personal relationships among children and teachers. The findings supported the notion that children in top reading groups, in comparison to children in lower ranking ones, had more opportunities (1) to learn academic skills, (2) to demonstrate personal  competence, (3) to participate in autonomous, self-directed learning, and (4) to develop expectations for future academic success. The findings also suggested that students in top groups enjoyed more trust in their interactions with teachers, engaged in more equal status relationships with teachers, and had more opportunities to form close personal relationships with teachers.

Adaptations to modes were scored in three ways: intonation patterns were marked, fluency was described, and the telling and dictating were described holistically with a descriptive narrative. Results indicated that a large number of five-year-old  children showed the ability to sound as if they were dictating; that children were able to sound as if they were telling a story and to actually maintain an oral monologue; that children who were high in reading abilities adapted dictation toward writing; and that children who were low in reading abilities moved their telling more toward the conversational mode.

As part of a reading assessment system, two measures of literal comprehension were developed: the Literal Comprehension Details Test (LCDT) and the Paraphrase Reading Test (PRT). Both the LCDT and the PRT assume the possession of visual and phonetic skills prerequisite to comprehension but do not presume to assess those skills necessary for processing beyond the apprehension of the explicit meaning of the text. The LCDT was conceived as a battery of test passages, scaled by difficulty level, with accompanying rule-based items for measuring literal comprehension, whereas the PRT was developed for use as a criterion measure of literal  comprehension. The passages for the PRT are the same passages that are used in the Multiple-Choice Cloze Exercises. The basic difference between the PRT and LCDT items, then, is that the PRT items involve paraphrase. A study of validity indicates that the LCDT has high face validity as a measure of literal comprehension and that the face validity for the PRT is higher than that for the PCDT.

The paper defines logical necessity as &quot;the unconditional guarantee of truth that accompanies valid deduction from axiomatic premises.&quot; It then shows that whereas hypothetical conservation and transitivity problems have solutions that are accompanied by logical necessity, physical embodiments of those problems as tasks do not. The remainder of the paper outlines problems associated with learning logical concepts from physical examples, and discusses the ambiguity of the word &quot;must.&quot; It suggests a set of criteria for inferring a grasp of logical necessity  and briefly discusses the consonance of the ideas presented with those of Jean Piaget.

        "description":"An experiment was conducted to test the effects of isolating and identifying generalities and instances in written prose instruction on student performance. Eighty college students were given either a typical chapter from a college textbook that included a summary, the same chapter with the summary removed, a modified version of the chapter in which generalities and instances of those generalities were isolated and irrelevant material was eliminated, or no instruction. Isolating generalities improved performance on a 20-item memory and application level test. Isolating generalities and instances bettered efficiency, which was defined as test score divided by time spent. An unexpected interaction between treatment and the sex of subject occurred. Males exposed to the chapter with  the summary had higher test scores than males exposed to the modified chapter. These results were reversed for females. The results provided support for the proposition that instruction designed to teach a given generality should be structured by isolating and identifying descriptive statements and instances of that generality.

Approximately 8,000 students in grades four, eight, and eleven were tested. The results indicated that older students spent less time watching television than did younger students. In addition, the number of students reporting &quot;enjoyment&quot; with reading decreased with age while the number of students reporting a &quot;dislike&quot; of reading increased with age. Reading scores for the fourth grade students, the heaviest television viewers, were relatively unrelated to television  viewing. However, for the eighth and eleventh grade students, those watching more than four hours of television a day scored lower on achievement than those watching a more moderate amount, indicating an inverse relationship bewteen heavy television viewing and reading achievement. This may be due to the cumulative effects of television viewing, to the increase in vocational and social involvement of older students, or to the fact that students with poor reading skills continued to be heavy viewers.

A microanalytic description of three different written language  events from the social studies classroom revealed an emphasis on procedural aspects for completing the instructional task. Students were observed to have learned the procedures of the patterns but not how the patterns were used to communicate across space and time. It appeared that reading or written language was, in effect, a set of procedures one enacts. The study suggests that students learn a \"cultural stance\" toward the written language (and communication in general) of their culture. (HOD)",

The focusing hypothesis suggested that the schemata activated by the reader's perspective might identify relevant information to which additional processing would then be directed. The slot-filling hypothesis suggested that the schemata would provide a structure to which relevant information could be readily assimilated with no additional processing. The 106 subjects read and recalled a passage from one of three assigned perspectives (burglar, homebuyer, control). The effect of &quot;naturally occurring&quot; perspective was tested by recruiting subjects from a real estate class, an  educational psychology class, and a police training institute. The results confirmed the powerful role of perspective in determining perceived importance and likelihood of recall. Consistent with the focusing hypothesis, readers spent more time on sentences containing information important to their perspective. (Author/RL)",

The preservice teachers rated the high quality responses higher than the low quality responses. For most of the high quality responses, the presence or absence of nonstandard dialectic markers did not significantly affect ratings of responses. However, low quality responses that did not contain nonstandard dialectic markers generally were rated higher than low quality responses  that contained nonstandard dialectic markers. These findings support conclusions of previous research showing that students' standard English responses are rated generally higher than responses containing black nonstandard dialectic markers. This conclusion implies that preservice teachers tend to rate student responses in much the same ways as experienced teachers reportedly rate student responses. (RL)",

Over a three-day span, the subjects (1) thought and made notes about the topic, (2) wrote an essay, and (3) wrote a revision/second draft. In addition, the expert writers made revisions of the inexperienced writers' first drafts. The results showed certain characteristic differences in how the different groups of writers revised their work. The experts turned out to be the most infrequent revisers. The inexperienced  writers' changes were overwhelmingly surafce changes, while the experts' changes were more evenly distributed between surface and text-base changes. The advanced students were the most frequent revisers of the three groups, making surface changes as often as did the inexperienced writers and text-base changes much like those of the experts. The experts' changes of the inexperienced writers' first drafts were predominantly macrostructure changes, particularly additions, substitutions, and distributions.

Most investigations of this aspect have focused on prewriting behavior or on &quot;heuristics,&quot;&quot;frames,&quot; or other approaches that presuppose that organization is something imposed from the outside and that the composing process begins with the choice of a pattern within which individual sentences are fitted. The fields of critical thinking and applied logic suggest a wholly different perspective: logic, which treats organization, coherence, and relevance as integral features of an exposition or argument. If the logical structure of the composing process is examined, it can be seen that individual topics, theses, or sentences themselves guide  the production of what follows (a premise points to a conclusion, a question dictates the sort of answer that will be considered, a claim dictates the supporting evidence to be supplied). These constraints and internal patterns can be discovered in bad reasoning as well as good, and affect both the form and the content of the written product. Failure to recognize these constraints, or general lack of attention to the internal organization governed by applied logic, can lead to a distorted or incomplete model of the composing process. (The paper contains examples from student papers to illustrate the constraints imposed by logic.) (Author/FL)",

Specifically, the study examined whether high writing apprehensives would perform differently than low apprehensives on standardized tests of writing-related skills and on two different types of essays. Based on the results of a writing apprehension measure, 55 high apprehensive and 55 low apprehensive writers were chosen for the study. In addition to the writing apprehension measure, the students completed eight measures of writing competency and wrote one narrative/descriptive and one argumentative essay (in which they were not allowed to use personal experiences). The results revealed that high writing apprehensives scored lower than low apprehensives on tests  of writing-related skills for all but two measures. The measures showing a significant effect for apprehension were two assessments of general verbal ability, a measure of reading comprehension, and two objective tests of writing ability. The high apprehensives also produced essays that were significantly shorter and less syntactically mature than did low apprehensives. However, differences in indices measuring syntactic development and in judgment of writing quality were observed only in the narrative/descriptive essays, not in the argumentative ones--suggesting that high apprehensive writers may be more anxious about expressing themselves than about arguing for a particular viewpoint.

Hart's rhetorical sensitivity scale--rhetorical sensitivity, noble self, and rhetorical reflector--would correspond, respectively, to the categories of androgyny, masculinity, and femininity in Bem's Sex Role Inventory. The two instruments were administered to 426 college students (211 men and 215 women). The theoretical hypotheses received mixed support. Rhetorical sensitivity was shared by women with low levels of masculinity, women with moderate femininity, and men with high levels of femininity. Noble selves included women high in masculinity and women high in femininity. Rhetorical reflectors included men high in femininity. Apparently, Hart's rhetorical sensitivity scale is based on communication competence as moderation  rather than behavioral flexibility; and it may be biased by the cultural preference for instrumentality.

Preliminary interviews with ten new employees and ten experienced employees indicated task-related performances for oral or written organizational communications--structured tasks were associated with the written mode, unstructured tasks with the oral mode. Based on these interviews, an experiment was designed in which 120 college students were divided into four groups. Two of the groups received orientation information through oral communication, while the other two groups received the information in a written form. For each mode of communication, one group completed a structured task and the other group  completed an unstructured task. Half the subjects in each task condition were given job-specific information orally, while the other half of the subjects in the task condition received only written instructions. The results demonstrated the importance of mode of communication in transmitting information to newcomers. Specifically, the subjects receiving written organizational information received higher accuracy scores on their tasks than did those who were exposed to the oral presentations. These scores did not vary as a result of the type of task (structured or unstructured). (RL)",

However, estimates hold that at best only one-half of those seeking positions in television will actually find them. This indicates the need for a media student to receive a good general education in areas other than communication and to receive specific production/management training in nonbroadcast media. A nonbroadcast institutional media program should be founded on the study of basic communication and should provide training in methods of systematically analyzing alternative approaches to meeting specific behavioral objectives and of designing effective instructional and persuasive messages that make use of appropriate media. It should  provide concentrated study of production principles and techniques through directed practice and drill in small-format television and synchronous sound/slide program preparation and should progressively increase student responsibility through full production management of all aspects of planning and execution. The program should also provide opportunities to supplement production courses with those in administration and management, technical operations and engineering, and performance; and should incorporate professional practices or internship opportunities for seniors in corporate or institutional settings.

A systemic mode of planning provides an ongoing mechanism that assures an institution's responsiveness to society's changing needs. Achieving consensus by appropriate groups regarding environmental assumptions that affect an institution is an integral part of the planning process. Sources of such assumptions about environmental factors currently affecting higher education include a shift from quantity revolution to an equality revolution; a switch from educational opportunity for all to educational opportunity for each; a spectacular increase of older students; effort to link the world of work and the world of education. Market analysis, or the identification of the  relationship between the needs of students and the way the institution can meet those needs, is another environmental source of information useful to planning. It consists of a coherent way to plan responses to market conditions. Another important step in the development of the planning process is the interface of the budgeting process. The budget is a vehicle for communication of details about institutional priorities and objectives, and a means for assessing how well the institution achieved its purposes. (JEH)",

The second chapter covers the management aspects of staff development, suggests ways school districts and schools can develop a coordinated system, outlines administrative responsibilities, and describes  the processes and activities that take place in quality programs.

Fourteen volunteers, including twelve retirees, were trained to use Laubach reading materials in tutoring fourth and seventh graders. In evaluating the project one year after its inception, this report provides a general program and location description, a review of the literature on volunteer tutoring programs, a discussion of program objectives, and interpretation of the data. The findings indicate that the tutoring experience did not effect significant differences between tutored and nontutored students in reading achievement, absenteeism, attitude towards school, or grades. However, the  one-to-one relationship with an adult role model was found to have a favorable impact on student self-concept, especially at the fourth-grade level. Recommendations include targeting the program to the lower grades, recruiting more volunteers, and developing closer coordination between teachers, administrators, and tutors. (Author/WD)",

Three further papers analyze government and private litigation over two large federal programs, the Community Development and Law Enforcement Assistance Administration  block grants. A fourth paper gives tips and guidelines to state and local governments for arguing before the U.S. Supreme Court. To exemplify the legal, political, and fiscal implications of federal grant law, a paper in the form of a play presents a hypothetical case involving a city government and regulations regarding the disabled.

Exercising such control means effecting a congruence between what should be taught (the school district's objectives), what is taught, and what students learn. In the first method of assessing curriculum quality control, the school district looks at its own curricular documents, using the following criteria: clarity and validity of objectives; compatibility between curricular objectives and testing measures; clarity of the grade-by-grade sequence of objectives and of the description of major instructional tools; and curricular adaptability to classroom use. In the second method, called the Educational Performance Audit,  independent auditors gather data from school visits and interviews as well as curricular documents. The auditors then assess curriculum quality control according to whether a district (1) can demonstrate control of resources, programs, and personnel; (2) has measurable and valid objectives; (3) has documentation explaining program development, implementation, and conduct; (4) uses results from its own assessments to correct ineffective programs; and (5) has improved \"productivity\" (the level of pupil achievement). The document also suggests steps for citizens to take and barriers to overcome in improving their schools' curriculum management. (RW)",

The instructional grouping arrangements include (1) cross-age and peer tutoring, (2) developmental programs, based on primary school children's physical development, (3) learning centers within classrooms, (4) pull-out programs for students to work outside the classroom, (5) staggered or split scheduling, (6) subject matter grouping, and (7) team teaching. For each grouping arrangement, the catalog gives a brief definition, discusses the grouping's goals, structure, coordination and support,  advantages, and problems, and lists the survey respondents using it. The four concerns noted by the catalog are the use of aides, time for teacher coordination, communication with parents, and scheduling of teachers and students. The catalog offers successful strategies for handling each concern and mentions the programs that developed them. An index of all survey respondents, with addresses and telephone numbers, allows catalog users to contact programs directly for answers to questions. (RW)",

A review of major research studies on student fear provides the theoretical framework for a discussion of the most probable victims of fear, the conditions or events to which fear is related, and the side-effects of fear. Fearful students are more likely to have few friends, less parental support, lower grades, and a lower self-perception of their reading ability than unfearful students. Four primary factors influencing a student's level of fear in school are the student's grade level, the location of the school, recent victimization of the pupil while at school, and crime in  the immediate neighborhood. Apprehensiveness among students reduces concentration on assigned tasks and creates an atmosphere of mistrust. A crime reduction program or an improvement program in education, public relations, and school spirit can help to reduce fear. Suggestions for further research include use of interviews and observations to enrich the data base, refinement of the measures of apprehensiveness, delineation of antecedents and consequences of fear, and the study of schools' responses to climates of fear.

HEW's National Coordination Study telephoned 187 agency personnel at federal and local levels in 54 HEW programs and talked in-person to 50 Seattle-area local agencies. The conversations covered the intent of statutes or regulations mandating coordination, the extent of and barriers to present coordination, and recommendations or additional needs for coordination. Among the study's conclusions were that (1) much coordination already occurs at the local level mainly to improve services; (2) federal coordination mandates have no effect, positive or negative, on actual  coordination activities because they do not specify the functions or agencies to be coordinated; and (3) barriers to coordination include agency competition over &quot;turf,&quot; lack of organizational staff or resources, and federal policy rigidity or mismatching in funding, eligibility, timing, and administration. To ameliorate these problems HEW should specify in its coordination mandates the functions, agencies, and activities to be coordinated; identify a coordination contact point in each regional office; offer special coordination incentive funding; and reform policies that are rigid or promote mismatched activities.

The data uncovered the need to improve instructional management, improve staff communication, individualize instruction, expand the range of supplemental materials, assist slow learners, provide inservice training on teaching strategies, articulate curricula, and provide instruction for teachers on how to assist students in applying skills in new situations. As a result of PSIP activities, 196 staff members were trained in a problem-solving approach to school improvement. Initial data on students indicate a  trend toward better scores on standardized tests. During the course of the project several resource materials and strategies for program improvement were developed.

However, this approach fails to recognize that youth unemployment is also caused by the demographic bulge of youth entering the labor market in recent years, minimum wages for youth that exceed the value of their productivity, and poor economic conditions under which youth suffer more than older job-seekers. This paper explores each of the causes of youth unemployment with respect to underlying arguments, policy implications, and strength of evidence. The preponderance of evidence suggests that the deterioration of economic conditions bears the major  responsibility for youth unemployment. Thus, the solution to the problem is not likely to be found primarily in the education arena. (Author/WD)",

As long as it was believed that educational expansion was a principal ingredient for securing economic growth, democratic political processes, and greater equality of economics and social participation, the tenets and practice of educational planning were rarely questioned. However, in recent years the failure of education and educational expansion to produce economic growth, political democracy, and reduction of inequalities have raised serious questions about the role of educational planning. Four specific roles of educational planning include logistics, technocratics, politics, and research. When planners convert political decisions into actual accomplishment by ascertaining the specific resource needs and  details of implementation, their endeavors are said to involve logistics. The activities of educational planners as technocrats are characterized as using technical skills and principles to accomplish educational goals without regard for values. Educational planning becomes an expression of politics when it contributes to a political agenda. Educational planning as research involves attempts to uncover knowledge about the basic relations between educational changes and their consequences. No longer encumbered by tradition, educational planners can now choose new roles to create order out of the present state of confusion. (Author/JEH)",

The results suggested that the delivery of reinforcement per se has substantial effects on behavior. When large amounts of noncontingent positive reinforcement was provided each child, noncooperative behavior decreased very significantly.

Section I examines programs that are effectively preventing mental retardation through biomedical intervention. Subsections consider genetics (including genetic counseling and screening of newborn infants), perinatal intensive care, and immunization. Programs at Columbia University, Memphis (Tennessee), and the Rose F. Kennedy Center for Mental Retardation and Human Development are noted. Considered in Section II are environmental prevention programs with discussion of preparation for parenthood, programs for mothers and children,  mother training programs, infant and toddler stimulation, home teaching programs, Head Start, and elementary school programs. Project Impact, a program to help low income and minority individuals prevent mental retardation and a Taos (New Mexico) program to prevent mental retardation among native Americans are highlighted. Multifactorial conditions such as teenage pregnancy, nutrition, and lead poisoning are the focus of Section 3. Highlighted are two programs at the University of Alabama. Prevention resources are considered in the final major section and include the University Affiliated Facilities' activities in mental retardation research centers, and maternal and child health prevention programs and special initiatives. States with particularly good programs in the areas of  prevention, genetic screening, and early casefinding are identified. Also included are the previous recommendations on prevention by the Committee, a summary of the report, and the Committee Resolution on Prevention which advocates a vigorous national prevention effort.

The project was conducted in three phases: (1) development, field testing, and revision of the planning materials; (2) development and testing of workshop materials to teach the use of the planning process to local and state educational administrators; and (3) planning and implementation of a series of regional dissemination workshops to distribute the materials to every state. Field test findings suggested that, while some revisions were required in the materials before general use, the  Planning System was a viable tool for planning for accessibility. The field test also suggested that administrators were ready, willing, and capable of addressing the accessibility issue--particularly if the means for addressing accessibility improved programs, provided for personal growth and advancement, and moved the system toward federal compliance.

In Study I, 60 EMR and 60 normal elementary Ss were presented easy or difficult tasks in one of three instructional conditions--relevant, irrelevant, or control. Glancing was measured to record whether Ss glanced at the task, the experimenter, or the room. Results tended to confirm the general theory of outerdirectedness. EMR Ss demonstrated similar amounts of glancing as the normal Ss for the irrelevant cue and control conditions. However, their total amount of glancing for the relevant cue condition was less than half as much as normal Ss'. In Study II, 35 mainstreamed ERR Ss were paired with normal peer models and completed a  worksheet under one of the three instructional conditions--explicit, general, or control. Contrary to prediction, little glancing was manifested and there was no evidence that Ss were outerdirected or distractible. It was suggested that EMR Ss did not glance at information that was relevant and useful because of socialization, their need to appear self sufficient, and/or the dynamics of their general deficit.

Sets of descriptor variables in six domains were identified from program records and were used to predict language performance at program entry and relative language improvement over 2 to 3 years. Age was the strongest predictor for all analyses. In general, the primary research factors in the study (42 variables representing IQ, socioeconomic status, physical/neurological and social-emotional  background) failed to account very well for either language performance at program entry or for relative language gain. In prediction of pretest language performance, IQ and physical factors played the strongest role. The two factors contributing significantly to prediction of relative gain were IQ (although suprisingly weakly) and social-emotional status. Characteristics of those children who progressed most in the program were identified. Additional information was presented bearing upon policy issues such as validity of the program model and streamlining of diagnostic and data keeping procedures. (Author)",

        "description":"The report examines cultural and social forces in the United States which discourage innovation and creativity. The history of American innovation is reviewed; innovation is defined as the process by which new knowledge is generated and applied in the material and intellectual operations of society. Effects on innovation of the changing economic environment are noted; and trends in demographics, education, institutional structure, and the international environment which work against innovation are analyzed. Schools are criticized for ignoring the needs of gifted and talented, treating science as a fringe benefit that can be deleted from the curriculum, and developing a two track academic and vocational system. Informal learning environments which stimulate innovative skills are  said to involve parenting and personal contact, toys as a teaching tool, film and drama, books and magazines, science museums, television, and prizes and awards. Six critical issues in public school education are raised, including the identification and encouragement of the specially gifted and the rejuvenation of an aging teaching population which enjoys tenure but suffers from professional obsolescence. Also considered is the situation in professional education, the corporate environment, university-industry relations, and military training. Recommendations are made regarding informal learning environments, continuing education, public schools, vocational education, government/industry/school system participation, and university/corporate cooperation.

        "description":"Developed through a literature review and a meeting with California policy makers, the paper examines the local special education variables necessary in developing state special education fiscal policies. The first chapter reviews the shifting focus in state special education and finance systems and finds three distinct phases of public policy and fiscal responses: Phase 1--the benefactor role (in which public education for handicapped children is seen as a charitable activity by the state); Phase 2--the programmatic role (in which the states became the driving force in mandating change in the provision of services to handicapped students); and Phase 3--the facilitator role (in which the state facilitates the local school district's provision of educational programing). Examined  in the second chapter are the following eight policy factors and their associated local policy variables (in parentheses): population characteristics (population size, density, increasing or decreasing enrollment, eligibility criteria, interagency shifts, and the magnet effect); individual educational needs (procedural protections, intensity of services, duration of services, multiple agency criteria); service delivery systems (program services, service providers); governance structures (type of governance units, responsibility vs. authority, and special education and the local school budget); system costs (geographic location of the education agency, price level variations, contract negotiations); resources (revenue generating wealth, tas levying authority, availability of community  resources, private services, personnel resources); timing and predictability (dollar flow, fiscal stability, and contingency capability); and accountability (state education agency responsibilities, local education agency responsibilities). The final chapter presents four general principles such as the following: the number of children requiring similar special education and related services will influence the per capita cost of delivering such services; and the range of special education services required by exceptional children in a school district and the manner in which such services are determined and provided will influence the cost of delivering such services.

Policy definitions were researched in state statutes, regulations, and annual program plans. State definitions were compared with the definition in P.L. 94-142, the Education for All Handicapped Children Act. Data are presented in tabular and narrative form for the following categories: consistency of state definition with P.L. 94-142 equivalent terms in the various states, and inclusion/exclusion of autism and socially maladjusted. Among findings reported are the noncategorical approach of Massachusetts, consistency of only 35 states with federal definition requirements that emotional disturbance characteristics be exhibited \"over a  long period of time and to a marked degree,\" consistency of only 40 states with the federal definition requirement specifying that the child's condition must adversely affect educational performance, inclusion of autism or schizophrenia in the definition by only 10 states, and no mention of socially maladjusted children by over two thirds of the states although the federal definition specifically excludes them. Issues for further research (such as the impact of the qualifier \"seriously\" on the identification of emotionally disturbed children) are identified. It is concluded that there are many gaps between state policy definitions and the P.L. 94-142 definition. Appended are the references for the state definitions. (DB)",

Of the 138 respondents, 49 were interviewed in their home environment by the evaluation team. A point system was used to quantify the daily use aspects of equipment use, change in life style through equipment use, and reasons for nonuse of the prescribed equipment. Eighty-one percent of the devices were found to be in working condition and 50% of them were being used an average of 9 hours per day at the time of the study. Twenty-two percent of the devices had been outgrown and the average life span per device was 30.0 months. Since the average cost per device was $1,650.00, the  cost per day for use of the device through its life span was $1.50. It was concluded that the assistive devices enabled many persons with severe motor impairment to achieve educational and employment opportunities and that the overall cost benefit ratio appeared to be satisfactory. Appended are definitions used in the study, demographic data, equipment pictures, and an assessment form. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"The report briefly reviews research on the concepts of attention, memory, and linguistic deficits, as well as maturational lag and interactive factors; and considers possible implications for assessment and instruction of reading disabled/dyslexic children. Early theories relating to dyslexia or specific reading disability are traced from S. Orton's first theoretical paper to such recent theories as that of intersensory integration. Problems in definition of learning disability are noted, as well as the confusion regarding etiology. Selected research is cited and implications for assessment and instruction are drawn from the findings. Among conclusions are the following: early identification of potential reading difficulty through predictive test batteries is often valid; while  informal assessment may have disadvantages, recent theories increasingly warrant such techniques with dyslexic children in the absence of valid standardized approaches; few valid subclassifications of dyslexia exist which enable teachers either to group such children for instructional purposes or to match a particular remedial program to an individual child; and daily instruction is needed to produce gains in disabled readers.

Nine chapters address the following topics: the problems of stress and burnout for educators, the problem of burnout for special services personnel, assessment of individual and organizational stress, modification of special education policies and procedures, inservice training, management of stress and prevention of burnout, the administrator's role, the role of the special services professional, and strategies for preservice training. A final chapter summarizes each of the nine  previous chapters and concludes that on a formal level, schools and colleges of education in cooperation with local school districts should encourage and support major research in the areas of stress management and burnout prevention; and that on the local level both school boards and teacher organizations should carry out informal study projects aimed at investigating what makes a superior teacher superior and what prevents a poor teacher from becoming significantly better.

The exploration of Chinese writing is begun with an exercise designed to convey the importance of a written communication system, as well as the problems and frustrations involved in developing such a system. Students then participate in a set of three discovery exercises, offering them an opportunity to decipher Chinese characters, to trace the development of several characters from ancient to modern forms, and to become acquainted with particular features of the Chinese writing system. An investigation follows into the communication difficulties created by the presence of dialects. The final  exercise encourages students to evaluate the present goals of &quot;language reform&quot; in the People's Republic of China. The content and design of the unit are aimed at upper elementary-middle school students, but the unit can easily be adapted for other levels. Students are encouraged to work in small groups. Extensive instructions to the teacher and a bibliography make it unnecessary for the teacher to know Chinese. (JB)",

The focus of this part of the study is sentences with filler-gap relations, such as, \"This is the girl the teacher wanted to talk to\" and \"This is the girl the teacher wanted to talk.\" Forty-eight sentences were constructed modelled on these two examples. The sentences, intermingled with other sentences of varying structures, were presented on a computer-controlled video display to 48 college-student subjects who were instructed to indicate whether or not they thought they understood each sentence, on the basis of an intuitive decision. Another experiment was  conducted with sentences in which the verbs prevented possible ambiguity, in order to determine whether or not other information is used in initial comprehension. It was found that readers initially fill a gap in a sentence with the most salient possible filler, and that this strategy is followed even when semantic control information about a verb seems to prohibit it.

Gestures were found to be marked for such contrasting grammatical features as agent and patient, and transitive and intransitive. &quot;Beats,&quot; or imprecise gestures, were not found to have the correlations characterizing iconic gestures. Furthermore, iconics correlate positively and beats negatively with handedness. Many metaphoric gestures, which iconically depict the vehicle of a metaphor, were identified.

The children, ranging in age from 5 to 15 years, represented four ability groups with respect to their reading skills in their first and second languages. A picture-word interference task assessed the degree to which children processed word meaning automatically. The task required children to name pictures in their first language while ignoring distractor words printed within the pictures' borders. On same-language (SL) trials, the printed distractor words appeared in the child's first language. On cross-language (CL) trials, the distractor words appeared in the child's second language. The results  indicated that second language words were automatically processed to the level of meaning early in the course of second language reading instruction. Both the pattern and the amount of CL interference generally matched that for SL trials. The common pattern of interference for both the SL and CL manipulations across several conditions that varied the picture-word meaning relation suggested that a superordinate conceptual representation served both language lexicons.

Perkins is a graduate professional school of theology preparing persons for leadership in the church, and the internship normally follows the second year of academic study. The intern is placed in a teaching congregation that accepts the student's learning as a high priority of its ministry, and the field instructor is the pastor or other competent professional person who is the immediate supervisor for the intern. The intern is required to prepare weekly verbatims or reflection papers on her/his own acts of ministry, and theological reflection is a critical part of this process. An intern committee consisting of from six to eight lay persons of  mature faith participate in the negotiation of the learning covenant and share regularly, individually, and as a committee with the intern for support, feedback, and evaluation. Other components of the internship program are as follows: a consultant, who may be a mental health or social service professional, trains field instructors in supervision and facilitates the personal growth of the interns; the district superintendent in the United Methodist Church and the bishop provide supportive roles; the faculty for the internship program consists of five full-time persons; and evaluation/feedback is of vital importance throughout the internship. It is suggested that the internship is a contextual appropriation and execution of all that makes up ministry, including the academic knowledge.  (SW)",

        "description":"The Baltimore College of Dental Surgery (University of Maryland) measured direct and indirect costs of the school's 1981 accreditation visit. The four objectives of the cost study were these: (1) to determine the direct (wages and operating expenditures) and indirect (effect on school goals and morale) cost of accreditation to the Dental School; (2) to determine the effectiveness of the institutional accreditation process; (3) to develop a cost model for other institutions; and (4) to develop strategies for future accreditation visits. The Cost Assessment Program (CAP), established to evaluate costs associated with accreditation, was divided into three phases: Phase One established a cost center to monitor the direct and indirect cost of accreditation; Phase Two involved the  initiation of the self-study; and Phase Three concerned itself with direct operating and personnel cost. Among the findings were that faculty, administrators, and secretarial staff spent almost 10,000 work hours on the self-study; student attitudes on the whole were positive, although 82 percent felt greater student involvement was necessary; and direct costs of preparing for the site visit, from August 1980 to January 1981, were about $39,000. It is concluded that the accrediting process provides a good mechanism for reevaluation, planning, and goal setting. Appendices include statistical data as well as letters, forms and charts used in the study, and references. (LC)",
