EACH TEST CONSISTED OF FINDING TOKENS PLACED BEHIND 5 DOORS IN A PREDETERMINED PATTERN. THE CHILDREN WERE ALLOWED 50 TRIALS TO DISCOVER THE PATTERN. THE PERCENTAGE OF CHILDREN LEARNING EACH PATTERN SHOWS AN INCREASE FROM GRADE LEVEL TO GRADE LEVEL, EXCEPT FOR AN INVERSION AT GRADE 4. THIS INVERSION, WHICH WAS NOTED IN EARLIER WORK AND HAS BEEN SEEN BY SOME OTHER EXPERIMENTERS, MAY BE DUE TO INCOMPATIBLE RATES OF DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION-PROCESSING AND HYPOTHESIS-GENERATING ABILITIES USED IN PROBLEM SOLVING. THE STRATEGIES WHICH  THE CHILDREN WERE USING WERE INFERRED FROM THE SEQUENCES OF THEIR CHOICES. YOUNG CHILDREN TENDED TO LOOK FOR THE PREVIOUS PATTERN IN A NEW TEST. AT ABOUT THE FIRST GRADE LEVEL THEY BEGIN TO ASSUME IT WILL BE DIFFERENT. IN GENERAL, YOUNGER CHILDREN TENDED TO USE SEQUENTIAL SEARCH PATTERNS. RANDOM SEARCHING APPEARS TO BE A LATER DEVELOPMENT. THE PATTERN 1, 3, 5 WAS EASIER TO IDENTIFY THAN THE PATTERN 3, 3, 5, BECAUSE THE CHILDREN SHOWED A PREFERENCE FOR HYPOTHESES LIKE 3, 3, 5, 5 OR 3, 5, 3, 5 AND WERE VERY RELUCTANT TO ABONDON THEM. FURTHER, WHEN THEY DID ABANDON THEM, THEY TENDED TO BEGIN SEARCHING RANDOMLY RATHER THAN TO MODIFY THE HYPOTHESIS. (DR)",

MANY OF THE REASONS FOR THIS PROBLEM PARALLEL THE PROBLEMS OF OTHER AMERICAN MINORITIES, NAMELY, (1) DISSIMILARITY BETWEEN THE VALUES OF THE MINORITY SUBCULTURE AND THAT OF THE MIDDLE-CLASS WHITE-CITIZEN ORIENTED SCHOOLS, AND (2) A SEEMING INABILITY OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM TO BE CAPABLE OF THE FLEXIBILITY AND INSIGHT TO ADAPT THE INSTRUCTION AND THE FACILITIES TO THE NEEDS OF THE PUPILS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE SIOUX CULTURE INCULCATES IN ITS YOUTH THE VALUES OF INDEPENDENCE, VITALITY, PHYSICAL COURAGE, AND INTENSE LOYALTY TO PEERS, AMONG OTHERS. WHEN THE SIOUX YOUTH GOES OFF TO HIGH SCHOOL, WHICH IS  GENERALLY A BOARDING SCHOOL, CONFLICTS DEVELOP. THE HIGH SCHOOL EXPECTS FROM STUDENTS OBEDIENCE, NARROW AND ABSOLUTE RESPECT FOR PROPERTY, AND ROUTINE AND DISCIPLINED CONDUCT. IN THE CLASH OF VALUES THAT FOLLOWS, THE SIOUX YOUTH BECOMES DISCONCERTED. HIS ADJUSTMENT PROBLEMS ARE ADDED TO BY RACIAL OR CULTURAL MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND BY LONELINESS. THE END RESULT FOR TOO MANY OF THE YOUTH IS THAT THEY DROP-OUT OF SCHOOL.

IN 1930-1938, THE BEHAVIORS OF 138 NURSERY SCHOOL CHILDREN WERE CHARACTERIZED BY THEIR TEACHERS IN TERMS OF 61 MOLAR VARIABLES. SUB-SAMPLES OF THIS GROUP WERE LATER RATED IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ON A SUBSET OF 20 BEHAVIORAL VARIABLES AND ON 6 ACHIEVEMENT MEASURES. PRINCIPLE COMPONENT FACTOR ANALYSIS WITH VARIMAX ROTATIONS WAS USED TO DETERMINE BEHAVIOR PATTERN FACTORS. TEN FACTORS, CONSISTING OF COMBINATIONS OF FROM 5 TO 12 OF THE BEHAVIORAL VARIABLES, WERE FOUND IN THE NURSERY SCHOOL SAMPLE. THESE COULD BE CHARACTERIZED BY SUCH TERMS AS EMOTIONAL REACTIVITY, SOCIABILITY, AND SOCIALIZATION.  THE CONSISTENCY OF THE FACTORS WAS DEMONSTRATED BY PERFORMING INDEPENDENT ANALYSES ON HALVES OF THE BASIC SAMPLE. SEPARATE ANALYSES ON BOYS AND GIRLS FOUND SIMILAR FACTORS, BUT THEIR RELATIVE IMPORTANCE IN ACCOUNTING FOR BEHAVIOR VARIANCE DIFFERED. LONGITUDINAL STUDIES COMPARING 69 OF THE CHILDREN AT AGES 3 AND 4 1/2, AND SAMPLES OF 78, 61, AND 32 OF THE CHILDREN IN GRADES 1, 3, AND 5 FOUND SIMILAR BEHAVIOR PATTERNS. BUT SOME NEW FACTORS APPEARED IN THE OLDER CHILDREN. A COMPARISON OF THE NURSERY SCHOOL AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOL FACTORS INDICATED THAT ALTHOUGH THE FACTOR PATTERNS WERE MODERATELY CONSISTENT, THE RELATIVE RANKINGS OF THE INDIVIDUAL CHILDREN ON THE FACTORS EXHIBITED LITTLE CONSISTENCY.

IN THE BELIEF THAT LANGUAGE SHOULD BE STUDIED AS A PART OF SOCIAL INTERACTION, THE CHILDREN'S SPEECH WAS RECORDED AS IT WAS BEING USED IN FAMILAR HOME AND SCHOOL SETTINGS. IN THE FIRST STUDY (TO AVOID INTRODUCING ALIEN ELEMENTS WHICH MIGHT HAVE MODIFIED NORMAL LANGUAGE) A TRANSMITTER WITH AN INTERNAL MICROPHONE WAS CONCEALED INSIDE A 3-YEAR-OLD CHILD'S CLOTHING. HE COULD MOVE ABOUT FREELY AS HIS CONVERSATIONS WERE BROADCAST TO A BATTERY-OPERATED RADIO AND RECORDED ON A TAPE RECORDER. IN THE SECOND STUDY, NURSERY SCHOOL SUBJECTS (AGED 4), EACH WORE A SMALL POCKETBOOK CONTAINING A TRANSMITTER. A MICROPHONE WAS CLIPPED TO THE POCKETBOOK'S SHOULDER STRAP, ABOUT  6 INCHES FROM THE CHILD'S MOUTH. FIVE MINUTE SPEECH SAMPLES WERE RECORDED EVERY 20 MINUTES OVER 2 MORNINGS FOR EACH CHILD. SOUNDS WERE TRANSMITTED TO A TUNER AND TAPED. AN ADVANTAGE OF THE METHODS OF COLLECTING LANGUAGE SAMPLES USED IN THESE STUDIES IS THAT THE RECORDINGS HAVE A POINT OF VIEW, WITH THE CHILD'S SPEECH RELATED TO ANOTHER PERSON'S. TRANSCRIPTS OF THE LANGUAGE SAMPLES ARE INCLUDED. THIS PAPER WAS PRESENTED AT THE BIENNIAL MEETINGS OF THE SOCIETY FOR RESEARCH IN CHILD DEVELOPMENT (NEW YORK CITY, MARCH, 1967). (MS)",

COORDINATED MAIN CLAUSES, WHICH ARE USUALLY A SIGN OF IMMATURITY, WILL THUS HAVE NO EFFECT ON THE INDEX. HUNT'S STUDIES, BASED ON 1000-WORD SAMPLES, INDICATED THAT T-UNIT LENGTH, CLAUSE LENGTH, AND NUMBER OF CLAUSES PER T-UNIT INCREASED FROM GRADES 4 TO 12. TO SEE IF THE INDICES COULD BE RELIABLY COMPUTED FROM SHORTER SAMPLES, 80 CHILDREN IN GRADES 4, 6, AND 8 WERE ASKED TO REWRITE A NARRATIVE COMPOSED OF SIMPLE DECLARATIVE SENTENCES, COMBINING THESE  INTO LONGER UNITS. ALSO, 69 CHILDREN IN GRADES 4, 8, AND 12 WERE ASKED TO REWRITE A STRUCTURALLY SIMPLIFIED EXPOSITORY ESSAY USING LONGER SENTENCES. OBSERVED INCREASES WITH GRADE IN THE CLAUSE LENGTH, T-UNIT LENGTH, AND NUMBER OF CLAUSES PER T-UNIT WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. BECAUSE OF THE INTERRELATION OF THE INDICES, T-UNIT LENGTH APPEARS TO BE THE MOST USEFUL INDEX.

SECONDARY PURPOSES WERE TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT IN PROBLEM STATEMENTS OF (1) PHYSICAL OR PICTORIAL AIDS, AND (2) THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF TRANSFORMATIONS. A TEST OF CONSERVATION OF NUMEROUSNESS THAT DIVIDED CHILDREN INTO 4 LEVELS WAS DEVELOPED IN A PILOT STUDY.

SUCCESSFUL OPERATIONS WITHING THE SOCIO-CULTURAL MILIEU PRODUCE A POSITIVE SELF IMAGE WHILE  LITTLE SUCCESS PRODUCES A NEGATIVE ONE. PROBLEMS OF ACCULTURATION ARE CAUSED BY THE DISFUNCTIONS BETWEEN THE SOCIAL SYSTEM IN WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL IS FORCED TO OPERATE AND THE VALUE SYSTEM TO WHICH HE IS COMMITTED.

IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THIS PROGRAM, THE FOLLOWING AREAS ARE PROPOSED AS BASES FOR FORMULATING HYPOTHESES WHICH WILL BE TESTED LATER--(1) PRIMACY OF ORAL LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT, (2) MEANINGFUL CONTENT, (3) LANGUAGE SKILLS, AND (4) CULTURAL UNDERSTANDING. THIS SPEECH WAS DELIVERED AT A WORKING CONFERENCE ON RESEARCH AND ACTIVITY IN THE LANGUAGE ARTS FOR THE PRE-PRIMARY/PRIMARY CULTURALLY DIVERSE NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING CHILD, ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO, JUNE 4-6, 1967.

THIS TOTAL NUMBER WOULD BE EVEN LARGER IF SO MANY RURAL PERSONS HAD NOT MIGRATED INTO THE URBAN AREAS OF OUR COUNTRY. THE RURAL POOR POPULATION IS CHARACTERIZED BY--LOW INCOME, A HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT RATE (4 PERCENT NATIONALLY AND 18 PERCENT FOR RURAL AREAS), LOW EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT, POOR HOUSING, HUNGER, MALNUTRITION, AND A HIGHER INFANT MORTALITY RATE THAN AMONG THE LEAST PRIVILEGED GROUP IN URBAN AREAS. THE PRESIDENT'S NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMISSION ON RURAL POVERTY HAS CHARTED A COURSE TO ELIMINATE RURAL POVERTY, AS NOTED IN THE FOLLOWING RECOMMENDATIONS--(1) THE U.S. SHOULD ADOPT AND EFFECT A POLICY OF EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL PEOPLE, (2) THE  NATIONAL POLICY OF FULL EMPLOYMENT, INAUGURATED IN 1946, SHOULD BE MADE EFFECTIVE, (3) OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD ASSURE ALL PEOPLE ENOUGH INCOME FOR A DECENT LIVING, (4) MANPOWER POLICIES AND PROGRAMS SHOULD BE REVAMPED, (5) RURAL EDUCATION SHOULD BE IMPROVED, (6) BETTER HEALTH SERVICES WITH FAMILY PLANNING SHOULD BE PROVIDED, (7) AN IMPROVEMENT SHOULD BE MADE IN RURAL HOUSING, AND (8) MULTICOUNTY DISTRICTS SHOULD BE FORMED TO PLAN COOPERATIVELY AND COORDINATE PROGRAMS FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.

THESE SAME RESPONDENTS WERE REINTERVIEWED IN 1956 AND AGAIN IN 1967 (152 AND 143 RESPECTIVELY RESPONDED FOR THE 2ND AND 3RD INTERVIEWS), CONCERNING THEIR MIGRATION PERFORMANCES AT THOSE PERIODS OF TIME. THE PURPOSES OF THIS PAPER WERE--(1) TO ANALYZE FACTORS RELATED TO MIGRATION PERFORMANCES OF A SAMPLE OF RURAL YOUNG PEOPLE, AND (2) TO DETERMINE THE FACTORS RELATED TO AGREEMENT (CONGRUENCY) BETWEEN MIGRATION EXPECTATIONS AND PERFORMANCES. THROUGH ANALYSIS OF DATA FROM THE ABOVE CITED STUDY, IT WAS FOUND THAT OF THE 64 PERCENT OF RESPONDENTS WHO HAD MADE A DECISION CONCERNING THEIR MIGRATION EXPECTATIONS IN 1948, NEARLY 80  PERCENT ACHIEVED THEIR GOAL BY 1967. THOSE WHO PLANNED TO MIGRATE FROM THEIR HOME COMMUNITIES HAD THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF CONGRUENCY BETWEEN MIGRATION EXPECTATIONS AND PERFORMANCES. OF THOSE WHO WERE UNDECIDED CONCERNING MIGRATION EXPECTATIONS, 40 PERCENT REMAINED IN THEIR HOME COMMUNITIES AND 60 PERCENT MIGRATED TO OTHER AREAS. THE DATA ALSO INDICATED THAT SEX, MIGRATION EXPECTATIONS, AND COLLEGE ASPIRATIONS WERE RELATED TO MIGRATION PERFORMANCE.

WE NEED A NATIONAL POLICY TO SLOW THE MIGRATION OF PEOPLE FROM RURAL TO URBAN AREAS.

ELEMENTARY EDUCATION IS PROVIDED THROUGH A LARGE NUMBER OF RELATIVELY SMALL VILLAGE SCHOOLS. ALTHOUGH SOME OF THESE SCHOOLS ARE TOO SMALL, MOST PEOPLE AGREE THAT EDUCATING THE YOUNGSTERS IN A BOARDING SCHOOL SITUATION IS NOT DESIRABLE. SINCE IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO OFFER A COMPREHENSIVE HIGH SCHOOL PROGRAM IN EACH SMALL VILLAGE, IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH AND OPERATE SECONDARY BOARDING SCHOOLS, WHICH ARE BETTER ABLE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE YOUNGSTERS. THE BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS, WHICH OPERATES THESE BOARDING SCHOOLS, HAS ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING EDUCATIONAL GOALS BY 1970--(1) 90 PERCENT OF THE NATIVE YOUTH TO GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL, (2) 50  PERCENT OF THE NATIVE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES TO ENTER COLLEGE, AND (3) 50 PERCENT TO GO ON TO SOME OTHER KIND OF POST-HIGH SCHOOL VOCATIONAL TRAINING.

SUCCESSFUL STUDENTS IDENTIFIED THREE FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THEIR SUCCESS--A GOOD SELF-CONCEPT, PARENTAL LOVE, AND TEACHER CARE AND INTEREST. THESE FACTORS ARE THE TYPE TO CONSIDER WHEN EVALUATING THE INFLUENCES OF EDUCATION PROGRAMS ON UPWARD SOCIAL MOBILITY, EDUCATIONAL GOALS, AND ACCULTURATION. EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS HAS BEEN RESTRICTED DUE TO SOCIO-ECONOMIC LEVEL, CULTURAL DIFFERENCES, FAMILY COHESIVENESS AND SIZE, THE FATHER'S OCCUPATION, PARTICIPATION IN COMMUNITY AFFAIRS, DEGREE OF BILINGUALISM, AND PARENT'S ASPIRATION. A LIST OF PROBLEMS IS INCLUDED  WHICH ARE ASSOCIATED WITH EVALUATION OF MEXICAN-AMERICAN STUDENTS AND WITH SUCCESSFUL EVALUATION PRACTICES, THE LATTER INCLUDING USE OF OBJECTIVE QUESTIONS, ORAL REPORTS, VERBAL METHODS, DRAMATIC PLAY, GROUP ACTIVITIES, AND LEARNER'S OWN EXPERIENCES. FOR BEST TEACHING RESULTS, TEACHERS MUST BE CONCERNED AND SINCERE, MAKE HOME VISITATIONS, GIVE TANGIBLE REWARDS, DEVELOP SKILL IN OBSERVATION, RECORD OBJECTIVELY, PROVIDE APPROPRIATE MOTIVATION, AND DEVELOP FEELINGS OF EQUALITY, TRUST, AND MUTUAL RESPECT IN THE STUDENTS.

HOWEVER, THOSE WITH THE GREATEST FINANCIAL NEED, INCLUDING MANY MEXICAN AMERICANS, OFTEN RECEIVE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF ASSISTANCE, DUE TO THE LACK OF SKILLED PERSONS TO BREAK THROUGH COMMUNICATION BARRIERS. WHILE PLANNING CONSUMER EDUCATION PROGRAMS, HOME ECONOMISTS HAVE FOUND THAT MEXICAN AMERICANS VALUE THE SAME BASIC THINGS FOR THEIR FAMILY AS DO OTHERS, FOR EXAMPLE, GOOD HEALTH, COMFORTABLE HOMES, ATTRACTIVE AND COMFORTABLE CLOTHING, TIME TO ENJOY FRIENDS AND FAMILY, AND MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEIR CHILDREN. NEW IDEAS AND METHODS FOR PROVIDING CONSUMER EDUCATION FOR MEXICAN AMERICANS ARE EVOLVING FROM THREE PROGRAMS IN TEXAS--(1) THE RESEARCH STUDY IN EL  PASO, (2) CONSUMER EDUCATION PROGRAM, COMMUNITY ACTION COMMITTEE, EL PASO, AND (3) FAMILY AND HOME MANAGEMENT COMPONENT, COMMUNITY ACTION PROGRAM, TARRANT COUNTY. THROUGH THE EFFORTS OF THESE PROGRAMS, FAMILY STABILITY WILL BE ATTAINED BECAUSE OF MORE ADEQUATE CONSUMER COMPETENCE.

THESE WERE PRESENTED IN CONVENTIONAL PROGRAMED FORM FOLLOWING A PARAGRAPH-QUESTION-KNOWLEDGE OF RESULTS SEQUENCE WHICH VARIED ACCORDING TO THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS COMPOSED OF 72 EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY STUDENTS. SEVEN OTHERS SERVED AS THE CONTROL GROUP. RESULTS SUPPORTED ROTHKOPF'S FINDINGS THAT QUESTIONS HAVE A GENERAL FACILITATIVE EFFECT ON RETENTION AND THAT  RETENTION IS IMPROVED WHEN KNOWLEDGE OF RESULTS IS PROVIDED. THE LONGER THE PASSAGE, THE BETTER THE RETENTION OF INCIDENTAL MATERIALS. HOWEVER, RETENTION QUESTIONS WERE MORE EFFECTIVE WITH PASSAGES OF MODERATE LENGTH. QUESTIONS, RETENTION OR INCIDENTIAL, PLACED BEFORE THE PASSAGE REDUCED THE RETENTION OF INFORMATION. THE POSITION OF QUESTIONS, HOWEVER, DID NOT MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE IF KNOWLEDGE OF RESULTS WAS PROVIDED. QUESTIONS WERE MOST USEFUL AFTER THE PASSAGE, IF KNOWLEDGE OF RESULTS WAS NOT PROVIDED.

THE RESPONSES OF THE PUPILS ILLUSTRATED THAT THE RESULTS OF A TEST SUCH AS THE GATES CANNOT BE ANALYZED FULLY UNLESS THE MANNER IN WHICH THE RESPONSES WERE DERIVED CAN BE DETERMINED. ON THE IRI, WHERE THE MAJORITY OF TESTING IS ORAL, GUESSING IS HELD TO A MINIMUM. AN ANALYSIS OF PARTIAL READING INDICATED THAT PUPILS CAN READ INACCURATELY AND STILL OBTAIN THE CORRECT ANSWER TO ITEMS ON A STANDARDIZED  TEST SUCH AS THE GATES. THEREFORE, INACCURATE READING ALONE DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR CORRECT OR INCORRECT ANSWERS ON THAT TEST. SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TESTS INDICATE THAT THE GATES GRADE-PLACEMENT SCORE REFLECTS A MORE GLOBAL MEASURE OF READING PERFORMANCE THAN DOES THE INSTRUCTIONAL LEVEL OF THE IRI AND THAT THE GATES SHOULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO GIVE A SCORE EQUIVALENT TO THE INSTRUCTIONAL READING LEVEL OF THE INFORMAL TEST.

READABILITY WAS DETERMINED THROUGH THE DALE-CHALL FORMULA AND THE FINDINGS OF AN EARLIER STUDY USING SPACHE'S FORMULA. CHAPTERS RANDOMLY CHOSEN FROM THE INTERMEDIATE AND JUNIOR HIGH TEXTBOOKS AND ALL THE PRIMARY TEXTBOOKS WERE STUDIED TO INVESTIGATE THE AMOUNT OF READING REQUIRED. WORD LISTS WERE CONSTRUCTED FOR EACH LEVEL AND COMPARED WITH THORNDIKE'S WORD LIST FOR VOCABULARY LOAD. RESULTS INDICATE THAT THERE WAS A WIDE RANGE OF READABILITY LEVELS WITHIN EACH TEXTBOOK. ONLY THE FOURTH, FIFTH, AND SIXTH GRADE TEXTBOOKS FELL WITHIN THE INTENDED RANGE.  THE INTERMEDIATE AND JUNIOR HIGH TEXTBOOKS REQUIRED A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF EXPOSITORY AND STORY-PROBLEM READING, BUT THERE WAS NO ORDERLY PROGRESSION IN THE AMOUNT OF READING REQUIRED. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT GAP BETWEEN THE THIRD AND FOURTH GRADES.

ATTAINMENT VALUE MEASURES CORRELATED MOST HIGHLY WITH CONCURRENT MEASURES OF ACHIEVEMENT  AND EFFORTS, WHILE ACHIEVEMENT EXPECTANCY MEASURES HAD STRENGTH AS PREDICTIVE MEASURES. STRONGER PATTERNS OF RELATIONSHIP WERE FOUND FOR GIRLS AS CONTRASTED WITH BOYS AND FOR WHITE SUBJECTS AS CONTRASTED WITH NEGRO AND INDIAN SUBJECTS. SCATTERGRAMS INDICATED U-SHAPED DISTRIBUTIONS WITH HIGH AND LOW ACHIEVERS REPORTING HIGH MOTIVATION TO ACHIEVE. IT WAS NOTED THAT THIS GROUP OF INNER CITY FIRST GRADERS REPORTED GENERALLY HIGH MOTIVATION TO ACHIEVE. APPENDIXES, TABLES, AND A BIBLIOGRAPHY ARE INCLUDED. (AUTHOR/BK)",

        "description":"A BEGINNING READING PROGRAM FOR SPANISH-SPEAKING CHILDREN IS REPORTED. A STUDY, SPONSORED BY THE SOUTHWEST REGIONAL LABORATORY FOR EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (SWRL), DEVELOPED LEARNING SEQUENCES FOR A BEGINNING READING PROGRAM FOR KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOMS WITH SPANISH-SPEAKING CHILDREN THROUGHOUT THE SOUTHWEST REGION. EACH OF 21 10-MINUTE PROGRAMED LESSONS DEVELOPED WAS PRESENTED THROUGH A TAPE RECORDER AND VISUAL DISPLAYS ON CARDS TO SPANISH-SPEAKING PRESCHOOL CHILDREN. EACH CHILD WAS REQUIRED TO MAKE ABOUT 60 ORAL RESPONES DURING EACH LESSON. INSTRUCTIONS IN ENGLISH WERE GRADUALLY SUBSTITUTED FOR INSTRUCTIONS IN SPANISH ONLY AFTER THE CHILD HAD MASTERED THE TASK. THE CHILD WAS ALWAYS ASKED TO RESPOND IN ENGLISH. CORRECT FEEDBACK WAS PROVIDED THROUGH PROMPTING AND  CONFIRMATION. THE TEST SCORES OF SPANISH-SPEAKING CHILDREN WHO RECEIVED INSTRUCTION THROUGH THIS PROGRAMED ADJUNCT, WHEN COMPARED WITH THE TEST SCORES OF ENGLISH-SPEAKING CHILDREN WHO RECEIVED REGUALR CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION, SUPPORTED THE THESIS THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO INCREASE THE PROBABILITIES OF READING SUCCESS FOR SPANISH-SPEAKING CHILDREN AFTER CAREFUL IDENTIFICATION OF LEARNER TASKS AND SELECTION OF INSTRUCTIONAL PRACTICES THAT ELICIT THE DESIRED RESPONSE TO PRINTED STIMULI. THIS PAPER WAS PRESENTED AT THE AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ASSOCIATION CONFERENCE (CHICAGO, FEBRUARY 6-10, 1968). (NS)",

THE SAMPLE IN THE STUDY CONSISTED OF 75 SECONDARY EDUCATION  GRADUATES AND 75 ELEMENTARY EDUCATION GRADUATES WHO WERE SELECTED USING RANDOM SAMPLING TECHNIQUES. IDENTICAL RATING SCALES WERE SENT TO THE TEACHERS AND TO THEIR PRINCIPALS, EACH OF WHOM HAD INDICATED WILLINGNESS TO COOPERATE IN THE STUDY. A TEACHER'S AND HIS PRINCIPAL'S STATEMENTS WERE USED IN MATCHED PAIRS. THE DATA WERE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH TEACHERS AND THEIR ADMINISTRATORS PLACED HIGH VALUES ON DIFFERENT INVENTORY ITEMS. CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS OF THE AGREEMENT AMONG RANK ORDERS OF THE TWO GROUPS WERE CALCULATED. VARIMAX ROTATION WAS USED TO DETERMINE THE PATTERN OF TEACHERS' AND ADMINISTRATORS' JUDGMENTS. THE DATA SHOWED--(1) THAT THERE WERE PATTERNS OF DISAGREEMENT SUCH THAT IT WAS ESSENTIAL TO DEVELOP TWO DIFFERENT SETS OF ITEMS, ONE TO BE USED WITH  ADMINISTRATORS AND ONE TO BE USED WITH TEACHERS, (2) THAT THE TECHNIQUE EMPLOYED WAS A USEFUL WAY OF IDENTIFYING TEACHING SKILLS, (3) THAT THE ITEMS SELECTED ARE NOT SKILLS BUT RATHER THEY ARE BEHAVIORAL GOALS, AND (4) A FOLLOW-UP STUDY OF TEACHING SKILLS OF GRADUATES SHOULD BE DONE USING TWO DIFFERENT INSTRUMENTS FOR TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS.

POSSIBLE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF EXPERIENCES AND CHANGES IN HIGHER LEVELS OF COGNITIVE FUNCTIONING AND LINGUISTIC AND QUANTITATIVE APTITUDE WERE ALSO EXPLORED. FOLLOWING A PRETEST FOR KNOWLEDGE OF MAGNETISM AND ATOMIC STRUCTURE, 16 CLASSES IN A JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO ONE OF FOUR TYPES OF PROGRAMED INSTRUCTION. THE VARIATIONS RESULTED FROM SUPPLEMENTING A BASIC LINEAR PROGRAM WITH DIRECT LABORATORY EXPERIENCE, SILENT MOTION PICTURE DEMONSTRATIONS, OR STILL PICTURE DEMONSTRATIONS. FOUR CLASSES OF STUDENTS WITH LEARNING DIFFICULTIES WERE  ALSO ASSIGNED TO THE DIFFERENT MODES OF INSTRUCTION. POST-TESTS WERE DEVELOPED SPECIFICALLY FOR EACH MODE OF INSTRUCTION. EACH INSTRUMENT INCLUDED QUESTIONS WHICH TESTED THE STUDENT'S (1) KNOWLEDGE OF THE SUBJECT, AND (2) ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE PRINCIPLES, SOLVE PROBLEMS, AND TRANSFER FROM ONE MODE TO ANOTHER. FINDINGS WERE INTERPRETED THROUGH ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE. NO DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND IN THE PERFORMANCE OF EITHER REGULAR OR ADJUSTED CLASSES DUE TO INSTRUCTION MODE, TEST FORM, OR TRANSITION FROM ONE MODE TO ANOTHER. NO DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS ON THE SUBTESTS REPRESENTING TYPES OF HIGHER COGNITIVE FUNCTION WERE DETECTED. THE LACK OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE MODES OF INSTRUCTION NEGATED ANY TEST OF RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN APTITUDE AND THE ABILITY TO DEAL WITH CONCRETE EXPERIENCES.  (AG)",

THESE PREFERENCES WERE VIEWED IN RELATION TO--(1) ACHIEVEMENT, AND (2) ABILITY. A COGNITIVE PREFERENCE TEST INSTRUMENT FOR HIGH SCHOOL CHEMISTRY WAS DEVELOPED AND USED. IT CONSISTED OF 100 ITEMS TO WHICH THE STUDENT COULD RESPOND BY ANY ONE OF FOUR STATEMENT OPTIONS, EACH OF WHICH WAS CORRECT, BUT REPRESENTED DIFFERENT COGNITIVE PREFERENCES. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP INCLUDED 24 TEACHERS AND 433 STUDENTS CHOSEN FROM SCHOOLS  WHICH WERE USING THE CBA CHEMISTRY PROGRAM. THE CONTROL GROUP, USING A TRADITIONAL CHEMISTRY PROGRAM, UTILIZED 30 TEACHERS AND 622 STUDENTS. IT WAS FOUND THAT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE OBTAINED BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. THE CBA GROUP SHOWED A PREFERENCE FOR (1) CRITICAL QUESTIONING, AND (2) FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OPTIONS ON THE TEST. THE CONTROL GROUP SHOWED PREFERENCES FOR RECALL OF FACTS OPTIONS, WHILE BOTH GROUPS SHOWED THE SAME PREFERENCE FOR APPLICATION OPTIONS. THE POSSIBILITIES OF DIFFERENCES BEING DUE TO (1) ABILITY, AND (2) ACHIEVEMENT WERE TESTED AND REJECTED. (DH)",

TWENTY-ONE OF THE ISSUES REQUESTED AN EXAMINATION OF THE NATURE OF ENGLISH, ITS GOALS, CONTENT, AND TEACHING PROBLEMS, AND 14 QUESTIONED THE PREPARATION, CERTIFICATION, AND IN-SERVICE TRAINING OF ENGLISH TEACHERS ON THE ELEMENTARY, SECONDARY, AND COLLEGE LEVELS.

AN INTRODUCTION CONTAINS A RATIONALE AND SUGGESTED TEACHING PROCEDURES FOR DEVELOPING SKILL IN PRODUCING A PERSONA AND IN IDENTIFYING AN AUDIENCE. UNIT I, &quot;IDENTIFYING THE WRITER,&quot; COMPARES A VARIED SELECTION OF PERSONA IN FOUR LESSONS--(1) HOW CHARACTER IS REVEALED IN PLAYS, (2) HOW THE AUTHOR STRIKES A POSE, (3) HOW THE PERSONA DEFINES VISION IN POETRY AND IN MASS MEDIA, AND (4) HOW STUDENT WRITERS ASSUME PERSONAE. UNIT II, &quot;IDENTIFYING THE AUDIENCE,&quot; INCLUDES FIVE LESSONS--(1) HOW ONE PROCESS IS DESCRIBED DIFFERENTLY FOR FOUR  DIFFERENT AUDIENCES, (2) HOW A PARTICULAR STYLE CAN PRODUCE A PARTICULAR KIND OF AUDIENCE AND IMITATORS, (3) HOW ONE THEME IS DEVELOPED THROUGH SEVERAL DIFFERENT MATERIALS, (4) HOW PERSONA CAN ADAPT TO VARIOUS AUDIENCES, AND (5) HOW PUBLIC MEN PROJECT THEIR PERSONAE FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. EACH UNIT PRESENTS STUDY NOTES AND WRITING PROBLEMS DEVELOPED AROUND WRITING MODELS WHICH RANGE FROM RECENT MAGAZINE OR NEWSPAPER ARTICLES AND STUDENT WRITING TO POETRY AND EXCERPTS FROM PLAYS.

TWO OF THE METHODS INVESTIGATED, ONE IN WHICH THE NUMBER OF SCORES WAS MULTIPLIED BY THE RANK CORRELATION SQUARED, AND THE OTHER IN WHICH THE NUMBER OF SCORES WAS MULTIPLIED ONLY BY THE RANK CORRELATION, YIELDED CORRELATIONS SLIGHTLY BELOW THE ECT VALUE FOR THE REDUCED SAMPLE. THE THIRD METHOD, USING FISHER'S R-Z TRANSFORMATION AND COMPUTING NZ, YIELDED A CORRELATION WITH THE TOTAL ESSAY SCORE WHICH WAS SLIGHTLY HIGHER. THE IMMEDIATE CONCLUSION DRAWN WAS THAT UNDER THE BEST PREDICTIVE CONDITION, MULTIPLE  REGRESSION WEIGHTINGS, THERE IS LITTLE OR NO DIFFERENCE AMONG THE SCORING PROCEDURES. USING TOTAL REARRANGEMENT SCORES TO PREDICT ESSAY SCORES, THE ORIGINAL SCORING IS SUPERIOR. IT WAS DEMONSTRATED, HOWEVER, THAT FACTORS OTHER THAN THE SCORING TECHNIQUES PER SE, INHERENT IN THE DATA AND TESTING CONDITIONS, COULD HAVE SEVERELY RESTRICTED THE PREDICTIVE VALIDITY OF THE TEST.

IN THIS PAPER ARE IDENTIFIED CONCEPTS AND CLUSTERS OF CONCEPTS WHICH DEFINE WHAT KNOWLEDGE A STUDENT MUST POSSESS IF HE IS TO CRITICALLY EVALUATE EVERYDAY DISCOURSE. THE TAXONOMY, COMPRISED OF 12 CONCEPT CLUSTERS AND RELATED CRITICAL ABILITIES, IS DERIVED FROM TOULMIN'S PRESENTATION OF INFERENCE AS A RULE-CONSTITUTED ACTIVITY AND FROM THE NATURE OF THE FIELD OF ORDINARY DISCOURSE.

BECAUSE MUCH OF THE ALIENATION THAT THE DISADVANTAGED STUDENT FEELS IS THE RESULT OF A CURRICULUM WHICH STRESSES FUTURE GOALS AND DWELLS ON WHAT THE STUDENT THINKS IS USELESS INFORMATION, ONE'S METHOD OF TEACHING MUST PROVIDE THE STUDENT WITH A SENSE OF IMMEDIATE UTILITY AND REWARD. TIMID AND CAUTIOUS STUDENTS WHO ARE FREQUENTLY CLASSED AS SLOW LEARNERS MAY BE AS INTELLIGENT AS ARTICULATE STUDENTS, BUT MAY NEED REASSURANCE AND A FREE ATMOSPHERE WHICH ALLOWS FOR LEARNING BY DOING. THE TEACHER MUST ALSO BE AWARE THAT A STUDENT'S READINESS FOR EACH UNIT OF MATERIAL IS OF  PRIME IMPORTANCE, AND THUS THE CURRICULUM MUST BE CAREFULLY STRUCTURED TO EXPAND SEQUENTIALLY. DIFFICULTIES WITH LANGUAGE CAN BE OVERCOME BY ALLOWING STUDENTS TO USE THEIR SUB-STANDARD DIALECTS WITHOUT FEAR OF INTIMIDATION BY THE TEACHER, WHILE THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF AND COMPETENCE WITH STANDARD ENGLISH IS INCREASED THROUGH SUCH ACTIVITIES AS CHORAL READING AND WORD GAMES. FINALLY, PROGRAMS FOR DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS MUST BE DIAGNOSTIC IN NATURE AND IMPLEMENTATION, AND BASED ON AN ACCURATE APPRAISAL OF THE CHILD'S POTENTIALITIES AND WEAKNESSES.

AN ANALYSIS OF THE REPLIES SHOWED THAT THERE WERE--(A) 148 SCHOOLS WITH A LIGHT LOAD OF FOUR COURSES, (B) 304 SCHOOLS WITH AN AVERAGE LOAD OF FIVE COURSES, (C) 39 SCHOOLS WITH A HEAVY LOAD OF SIX OR MORE COURSES, AND (D) 379 SCHOOLS WITH NO RESPONSE (FROM WHICH IT WAS INFERRED THAT THESE WERE SCHOOLS WITH A HEAVY LOAD). THE CONCLUSIONS INDICATED THAT THE STUDY PROCEDURE WAS NOT ACCURATE ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY ANY SIMPLE CLASSIFICATIONS AND THAT THE CHICAGO  SUBURBAN SCHOOLS DID NOT FALL GENERALLY INTO THE &quot;LIGHT-LOAD&quot; BRACKET, DESPITE THEIR LARGE TAX BASE, COMMUNITY INCOME, AND BONDING POWER. IT IS HOPED THAT THE APPENDED LIST OF HONOR SCHOOLS MAY PROVE VALUABLE TO TEACHERS SEEKING BETTER WORKING CONDITIONS AND TO COLLEGE SENIORS LOOKING FOR GOOD SCHOOLS FOR THEIR FIRST PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYMENT.

RESULTS INDICATE THAT (1) THE DIFFERENCES AMONG RATING GROUPS DID NOT CHANGE WITH THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE ESSAYS, (2) THE ESSAYS RECEIVED SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME SCORES FROM  ALL FIVE RATING GROUPS, (3) THERE WERE HIGH INTERCORRELATIONS AMONG SYSTEMS, EXCEPT FOR THE DIEDERICH SCALE, AND (4) THE HIGHEST RELIABILITY SCORES WERE EVIDENCED BY THE ENGLISH MECHANICS SCALE, THE LOWEST BY THE CLEVELAND COMPOSITION RATING SCALE.

(2) THE IDEA OF IMPOSING A STATIC AND EXTERNAL CURRICULUM ON THE SCHOOLS SOLELY IN THE INTEREST OF CONTINUITY WAS REJECTED.

MANY ANECDOTES ILLUSTRATE THE PROCESS OF COMMUNITY ADJUSTMENT. SPECIAL ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO DISCIPLINE, SOCIAL ACTIVITIES, ATHLETICS, AND INSERVICE TEACHER EDUCATION IN THE INTEGRATED SCHOOLS. THE MOST COMMON FEAR OF PARENTS WAS THAT INTEGRATION WOULD LOWER EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS FOR ALL CHILDREN. WHEN 1955 CITYWIDE ACHIEVEMENT TESTS WERE CONSIDERABLY BELOW NATIONAL STANDARDS, ORGANIZED COMMUNITY PARENTS DECIDED TO WORK ON THE PROBLEM BY DEMANDING BETTER FISCAL SUPPORT FOR MORE TEACHERS TO REDUCE CLASS SIZE AND TO SET UP SPECIAL CLASSES FOR THE RETARDED. AT THE TIME OF THE PUBLICATION OF THIS PAMPHLET, A BROAD SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM HAD BEEN DEVELOPED, AND  ALREADY COMPLETED CURRICULUM REORGANIZATION HAD RESULTED IN INCREASED HOMOGENEOUS GROUPING AT ALL LEVELS. A SKILLS PROGRAM HAD BEEN RE-EMPHASIZED AND PROMOTIONAL PRACTICES HAD BEEN RE-EXAMINED. EMPHASIS ON SUBJECT MATTER STANDARDS HAD INCREASED. SPECIAL EDUCATION FOR THE ATYPICAL SLOW LEARNER AND THE EDUCATIONALLY AND EMOTIONALLY HANDICAPPED WAS BEING STRESSED, AND PLANS WERE BEING MADE TO REDUCE CLASS SIZE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS AND TO INITIATE AN EXTENSIVE BUILDING PROGRAM.

THE MOST DIVISIVE ISSUE OF THE CONTROVERSY WAS THE PLANNED TRANSFER OF WHITE PUPILS TO NEGRO SCHOOLS, WHICH CAUSED MOST WHITE FAMILIES TO AVOID INTEGRATION BY USING THE OPEN ENROLLMENT POLICY. THUS OPEN  ENROLLMENT CAN EITHER IMPEDE OR ENCOURAGE INTEGRATION, WHICH WILL NOT BE ACHIEVED IF WHITE YOUNGSTERS ARE SENT TO INADEQUATE NEGRO SLUM SCHOOLS. SUCH A POLICY IS \"EDUCATIONALLY UNSOUND\" AND \"POLITICALLY UNTENABLE.\" CLOSING SLUM SCHOOLS AND ABSORBING NEGROES INTO BETTER WHITE MIDDLE-CLASS SCHOOLS IS THE BEST WAY TO ACHIEVE INTEGRATION. SUCH EXTERNAL FACTORS AS THE STATE EDUCATION COMMISSIONER'S ORDER TO BALANCE THE SCHOOLS AND THE EMERGING CIVIL RIGHTS REVOLUTION SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT IN THE RESOLUTION OF THIS LOCAL CONFLICT.

THE &quot;JIBAROS,&quot; THE RURAL POOR OF THE HIGHLANDS, ARE LANDLESS AGRICULTURAL WORKERS WHO ARE MORE ISOLATED, LESS LITERATE, AND LESS ACCULTURATED TO URBAN LIFE THAN OTHER PUERTO RICANS. THEY TEND TO BE IDEALIZED AS THE PROTOTYPES OF THE ISLAND FOLK CULTURE. THEIR FAMILY STRUCTURE IS CHARACTERISTICALLY MALE-DOMINATED AND AUTHORITARIAN. &quot;JIBARO&quot; WOMEN TEND TO COMPENSATE FOR THEIR INFERIOR POSITIONS THROUGH CLOSE ATTACHMENT TO THEIR OFFSPRING, ESPECIALLY TO THEIR SONS. THE COASTAL POOR, VERY SIMILAR TO THE &quot;JIBAROS&quot; OF THE HIGHLANDS, ARE LANDLESS LABORERS ON THE SUGAR CANE PLANTATIONS WHO ARE ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON WAGES FOR THEIR SUBSISTENCE. MORE A UNIT OF CONSUMPTION THAN PRODUCTION, THE  FAMILY OF A COASTAL SUGAR CANE WORKER USUALLY LIVES IN CROWDED HOUSING AND LACKS THE DIGNITY OF THE &quot;JIBARO&quot; FAMILY. THE URBAN POOR ARE MUCH MORE DIVERSIFIED AND LEAD A MORE MARGINAL EXISTENCE. AMONG ALL LOWER-STATUS PUERTO RICANS, CHILDREN ARE HIGHLY VALUED, WHETHER FROM CONSENSUAL OR LEGAL MARRIAGES, AND GODPARENTS PLAY A PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE FAMILY LIFE. HOWEVER, POPULATION DENSITY ON THE ISLAND IS REACHING CRITICAL PROPORTIONS AND THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT IS ENCOURAGING CONTRACEPTION, INDUSTRIALIZATION, AND EMIGRATION TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE. BUT URBAN ENVIRONMENT ON THE U.S. MAINLAND CHANGES TRADITIONAL SOCIAL CONTROLS, SOCIABILITY PATTERNS, AND HOMEMAKING PRACTICES, AND FORCES NEW LIFE STYLES AND VALUES.

IT IS NOTED THAT ALTHOUGH HOUSING PATTERNS MAY ACCOUNT FOR A LARGE PART OF THE RACIAL IMBALANCE IN SCHOOLS, GERRYMANDERING OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES PLAYS A VERY SIGNIFICANT ROLE. SCHOOL BOARDS ATTEMPTING TO DESEGREGATE SCHOOLS ARE FACED WITH THE ISSUES OF WHAT THE LAW REQUIRES AND WHAT IT ALLOWS THEM TO DO ABOUT DE FACTO SEGREGATION. ACCORDING TO SEVERAL LEGAL DECISIONS, A SCHOOL BOARD MUST NOT ACT &quot;ARBITRARILY&quot; OR &quot;UNREASONABLY&quot; IN APPLYING POLICIES THAT USE RACE AS THE DETERMINING FACTOR IN DECIDING TO REORGANIZE A SCHOOL DISTRICT. THIS CRITERION APPLIES EQUALLY TO PLANS FOR PREDOMINANTLY WHITE SCHOOLS AS WELL AS TO  NEGRO SCHOOLS. IN GENERAL, SCHOOL OFFICIALS USE SIX BASIC PLANS TO ALLEVIATE RACIAL IMBALANCE--REZONING, OPEN ENROLLMENT, BUSING, CONROLLED BALANCE INVOLVING A SPECIFIED RACIAL PERCENTAGE, SITE SELECTION, AND SCHOOL REORGANIZATION. THE MOST DRAMATIC PLANS PROPOSED ARE THOSE INVOLVING CHANGES IN THE FUNDAMENTAL STRUCTURE OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM. AN EXAMPLE OF SUCH A PLAN IS THE &quot;4-4-4&quot; PROPOSAL, RECOMMENDED IN THE ALLEN REPORT (NEW YORK STATE). REGARDLESS OF THE PLAN USED, HOWEVER, NEWLY INTEGRATED MINORITY GROUP CHILDREN OFTEN NEED SCHOLASTIC REMEDIATION AND CULTURAL ENRICHMENT.

THREE MAJOR FACTORS MAY BE RELATED TO HIS CULTURAL VARIANCE--(1) \"ETHCLASS,\" OR THE INTERACTION OF SOCIAL CLASS AND ETHNIC GROUP, (2) ECONOMIC FACTORS, WHICH CAUSE 53 PERCENT OF AMERICAN FAMILIES TO BE CLASSIFIED AS POOR OR DEPRIVED, AND (3) ECOLOGICAL FACTORS, WHICH INCLUDE SUCH PHENOMENA AS RESIDENTIAL MOBILITY OF THE INNER-CITY POOR, FARM TO CITY MIGRATION, MIGRATORY LABOR, LOW-INCOME FARMERS, AND FARM PROBLEMS.

ALTHOUGH MANY PROJECTS REPORTED PERSONNEL SHORTAGES, USE  OF TEACHER AIDES AND OF CURRENT STAFF ON AN EXTENDED TIME BASIS SOMEWHAT OFFSET THIS PROBLEM. INSERVICE STAFF TRAINING AND COOPERATIVE ACTIVITIES (E.G., WITH COMMUNITY ACTION AGENCIES) WERE INTEGRAL TO NUMEROUS PROJECTS.

THE TWO IMMEDIATE PURPOSES OF THE STUDY WERE--(1) TO DISCOVER HOW TO IDENTIFY, DESCRIBE, AND LABEL MORE PRECISELY THE CHARACTERISTICS OF EDUCATIONALLY HANDICAPPED CHILDREN, AND (2) TO FURTHER CLARIFY THE CAUSES OF LEARNING DISABILITIES. FIRST EDUCATIONALLY HANDICAPPED CHILDREN AND THEIR SAME SEX SIBLINGS WERE MATCHED WITH ACADEMICALLY SUCCESSFUL CHILDREN AND THEIR SAME SEX SIBLINGS. THE CHILD'S ORDINAL POSITION WITHIN THE FAMILY WAS NOT FOUND TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO HIS LEARNING DISABILITY. THEN TO EXPLORE OTHER FAMILIAL ASPECTS OF  POOR LEARNING ABILITY, THE PARENTS OF THE CHILDREN IN BOTH GROUPS WERE COMPARED. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE SOCIOECONOMIC AND EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUNDS OF THE PARENTS DID NOT DIFFER MARKEDLY. HOWEVER THE PARENTS OF THE ACADEMICALLY SUCCESSFUL GROUP DID BETTER ON HIGH SCHOOL READING TESTS ADMINISTERED AS PART OF THE STUDY THAN DID THE PARENTS OF THE EDUCATIONALLY HANDICAPPED CHILDREN. THEY ALSO HAD RECEIVED HIGHER GRADES IN HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH AND LANGUAGE ARTS COURSES. IN MATHEMATICS THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FATHERS IN THE TWO GROUPS ALTHOUGH THE MOTHERS OF THE ACADEMICALLY SUCCESSFUL GROUP HAD RECEIVED HIGHER HIGH SCHOOL GRADES THAN DID THE MOTHERS IN THE HANDICAP GROUP.

        "description":"IN CHOOSING BETWEEN SCHOOL DESEGREGATION AND SEGREGATED COMPENSATORY EDUCATION, POLICY MAKERS MUST CONSIDER THE CAUSES OF THE EDUCATIONAL RETARDATION OF NEGRO YOUTH AND THE SOCIAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND FISCAL COSTS OF EACH POLICY. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN SOCIAL CLASS AND THE RACIAL COMPOSITION OF THE SCHOOLS RATHER THAN &quot;CULTURAL DEPRIVATION&quot; TO BE THE MAJOR CAUSE OF ACADEMIC FAILURE AMONG NEGRO YOUTH. TO COUNTERACT THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF A COMPENSATORY EDUCATION PROGRAM IN SUCH A SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT, EDUCATORS WOULD HAVE TO INSTITUTE CHANGES IN THE SCHOOL'S ORGANIZATION, LIKE DRAMATICALLY REDUCING TEACHER-PUPIL RATIOS. HOWEVER, EVEN IF IN ALL ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ACT TITLE I PROJECTS THIS RATIO WERE REDUCED TO 6 TO 1, THE COST OF INSTRUCTION WOULD INCREASE FROM $.5  BILLION TO $8.6 BILLION. AND DESPITE INCENTIVES ABLE TEACHERS ARE NOT INCLINED TO TEACH IN SEGREGATED COMPENSATORY EDUCATION PROGRAMS. SUCH PROGRAMS PERMANENTLY ESTABLISH RACIST ATTITUDES AMONG NEGRO AND WHITE STUDENTS AND PERPETRATE RACIAL SEPARATISM IN HOUSING AND OTHER LIVING PATTERNS. ONLY A POLICY OF SCHOOL INTEGRATION--ACCOMPANIED BY GENERAL SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT--CAN MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR THE NEGRO TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE SAME EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES AS WHITES. EDUCATIONAL PARKS COULD POSSIBLY SATISFY BOTH REQUIREMENT.

OF THE APPROXIMATELY 31,000 CHILDREN ENROLLED IN THE SCHOOLS, 18 PERCENT ARE NONWHITE. WHEN AFTER THREE YEARS A WELL-RUN PROGRAM OF COMPENSATORY EDUCATION FAILED TO PRODUCE ANY MEASURABLE ACADEMIC IMPROVEMENT AMONG STUDENTS AT THE THREE PREDOMINANTLY NONWHITE SCHOOLS, ADMINISTRATORS BEGAN TO BUS SMALL NUMBERS OF NEGRO PUPILS TO HIGH-ACHIEVING WHITE SCHOOLS. THE 30 PUPILS WHO WERE BUSED MADE SIGNIFICANT ACADEMIC PROGRESS AND, WHEN INTERVIEWED, IMPLIED THAT IT WAS THE ATTITUDE AND MOTIVATION OF THEIR WHITE CLASSMATES WHICH MADE THEM ACHIEVE MORE. TWO OF THE THREE NEGRO SCHOOLS WERE THEN CLOSED AND PUPILS BUSED TO INTEGRATED SCHOOLS. COMPARED WITH STUDENTS IN THE REMAINING NEGRO  SCHOOL, THE TRANSPORTED PUPILS DOUBLED THEIR ADVANCES IN READING ACHIEVEMENT. HOWEVER, WHEN IN RESPONSE TO PRESSURES FROM THE NEGRO COMMUNITY PLANS WERE FORMULATED TO CROSS-BUS WHITE PUPILS INTO THIS MAJORITY NEGRO SCHOOL, THE WHITE COMMUNITY OBJECTED. RECENTLY, A PROGRAM OF COMPULSORY REASSIGNMENT OF CERTAIN NEGRO PUPILS TO INTEGRATED SCHOOLS HAS BEEN BEGUN. ALSO PLANNED IS AN INTEGRATED &quot;EXCEL&quot; SCHOOL FOR GIFTED PUPILS. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT BY SEPTEMBER 1968, NO SYRACUSE PUBLIC SCHOOL WILL BE MORE THAN 50 PERCENT NEGRO.

SOME OF THE PROBLEMS HAVE RESULTED FROM A GROWING EXODUS OF WHITE PERSONS FROM CITY TO SUBURBAN AREAS AND A CORRESPONDING MOVEMENT OF POORLY EDUCATED RURAL SOUTHERNERS AND PUERTO RICANS INTO THE CORE OF THE CITY. ALMOST 30,000 OF HARTFORD'S 162,000 TOTAL POPULATION ARE NEGRO, 42.5 PERCENT OF THE 26,458 PUBLIC SCHOOL POPULATION (1966) ARE NEGRO, AND 9.5 PERCENT ARE PUERTO RICAN. ALMOST 15 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL POPULATION RECEIVES WELFARE PAYMENTS. AT A CONFERENCE ON METROPOLITAN COOPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT IT WAS DECIDED TO ATTACK THESE PROBLEMS ON A  REGIONAL BASIS. AFTER MEETING WITH CONSULTANT SPECIALISTS AND VARIOUS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SCHOOLS AND THE COMMUNITY, THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN 1966 ADOPTED A COMPREHENSIVE COORDINATED PROJECT TO COUNTERACT HOUSING, EMPLOYMENT, AND EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS. PART OF THE PROJECT WAS A PROGRAM TO BUS ABOUT 400 PUPILS FROM THE CITY INTO SUBURBAN SCHOOLS. EXTENSIVE EFFORTS WERE MADE AT THE TIME TO GAIN THE SUPPORT OF INFLUENTIAL SEGMENTS OF THE COMMUNITY. AFTER ONE YEAR IN OPERATION, THIS BUSING PROGRAM APPEARS TO BE SUCCESSFUL, AND PLANS ARE BEING MADE FOR ITS CONTINUATION BEYOND THE ORIGINALLY STIPULATED 2-YEAR PERIOD.

THERE IS ALMOST TOTAL RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION IN 13 OF THESE CITIES. SEVENTY PERCENT OF ALL NEGRO PUPILS IN THESE CITIES ATTEND SCHOOLS WHICH HAVE A 90 TO 100 PERCENT NEGRO SCHOOL POPULATION, AND THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT SCHOOL SEGREGATION CONTINUES TO INCREASE. IN EACH OF THE CITIES THERE ARE BETWEEN ONE AND THREE LIMITED REMEDIES IN OPERATION, INCLUDING SUCH PLANS AS FREE CHOICE TRANSFER, OPEN ENROLLMENT, AND CHANGES IN ATTENDANCE ZONES, BUT FEW COMPREHENSIVE REMEDIES ARE IN ACTUAL OPERATION. POSSIBLE COMPREHENSIVE  SOLUTIONS INCLUDE (1) MAGNET SCHOOLS, (2) EDUCATIONAL COMPLEXES OR CLUSTERS, WHICH INVOLVE A POOLING OF TEACHERS, SERVICES, AND STUDENTS WITHIN A GEOGRAPHICALLY LIMITED NUMBER OF SCHOOLS, (3) ADMINISTRATIVE DECENTRALIZATION, AND (4) A POTENTIAL REAFFIRMATION OF EXISTING NEIGHBORHOOD SEGREGATION. EDUCATIONAL PARKS OFFER A VARIETY OF BENEFITS, BUT TO BE EFFECTIVE THEY MUST INTEGRATE STUDENTS FROM URBAN AND SUBURBAN DISTRICTS AND BE FINANCED UNDER A FEDERAL URBAN REDEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. THE INTERDISTRICT, URBAN-SUBURBAN COOPERATION INTRINSIC TO SUCH A PLAN IS ONE OF THE MOST FEASIBLE METHODS OF SCHOOL DESEGREGATION. TO IMPLEMENT DESEGREGATION STRATEGIES, ADMINISTRATORS MUST STRESS THE EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS OF DESEGREGATION FOR ALL CITIZENS, AND NEW FEDERAL POLICIES MUST LEGALLY REQUIRE  COMPREHENSIVE EFFORTS.

THE FACTORS STUDIED IN THESE SCHOOLS WERE EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES, SCHOOL PRACTICES, STUDENT BODY CHARACTERISTICS, AND SCHOOL BOARD POLICIES. FINDINGS ARE BASED ON RESPONSES TO 17 QUESTIONS FROM THE GENERAL SCHOOL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE AND TWO ITEMS FROM THE GUIDANCE PROGRAM QUESTIONNAIRE. DATA ON PUPIL CHARACTERISTICS SHOW THAT THERE IS A TENDENCY FOR MEAN PROJECT TALENT TEST SCORES TO DECREASE AS THE NEGRO ENROLLMENT PERCENTAGE INCREASES. TEST MEANS ARE ABOUT AS HIGH FOR SCHOOLS ENROLLING 1-97 PERCENT NEGROES AS FOR SCHOOLS WITH NO NEGROES. MOST TEST  MEANS SHOW SMALL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SCHOOLS IN LOW- AND MEDIUM-QUALITY HOUSING AREAS. THE HIGHER THE NEGRO ENROLLMENT, THE SMALLER THE PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS ENTERING COLLEGE, BUT COLLEGE ENTRANCE IS POSITIVELY RELATED TO SIZE OF SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY AND HOUSING QUALITY REGARDLESS OF THE EXTENT OF NEGRO ENROLLMENT. DROPOUT RATES, INCIDENCE PUPILS WITH A SPANISH OR LATIN AMERICAN BACKGROUND, AND ABSENTEEISM ARE HIGHER IN SCHOOLS WITH GREATER NEGRO ENROLLMENT. THERE ARE VARIOUS RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE SCHOOL POLICY AND PRACTICE VARIABLES OF CLASS SIZE, AVERAGE ANNUAL PER PUPIL EXPENDITURE, STARTING SALARY OF MALE TEACHERS, TEACHER EXPERIENCE, LIBRARY SIZE, GUIDANCE PROGRAM AND BUDGET, AMOUNT OF HOMEWORK, ADVANCE PLACEMENT COURSES, AND AVAILABILITY OF SUMMER PROGRAMS.

BEFORE ENTERING THE PROGRAM, 1800 &quot;ACADEMIC RISK&quot; STUDENTS PARTICIPATED IN A SUMMER SESSION TO EASE THEIR TRANSITION FROM JUNIOR TO SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL. MOST OF THEM WERE ENTERING HIGH SCHOOL WITH READING SCORES AS MUCH AS TWO AND A HALF YEARS BELOW GRADE LEVEL. DURING THE SUMMER THEY WERE GIVEN A 3-HOUR DAILY SESSION OF INTENSIVE INSTRUCTION IN ENGLISH AND MATHEMATICS IN SMALL CLASSES AND WITH INDIVIDUAL HELP FROM COLLEGE STUDENT AIDES. COUNSELING SERVICES FOR STUDENTS AND THE USE OF FAMILY ASSISTANTS WERE ALSO FEATURES OF THE PROGRAM. THE RESULTS OF TESTS ADMINISTERED BEFORE AND AFTER THE SUMMER SESSION SHOWED THAT THE STUDENTS MADE A MEDIAN  READING GAIN OF FOUR MONTHS AND AN AVERAGE ARITHMETIC COMPUTATION GAIN OF ALMOST TWO YEARS. HOWEVER IT IS FELT THAT THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE PROGRAM SHOULD BE JUDGED ONLY AFTER THREE OR FOUR YEARS OF STUDENT EXPOSURE DURING THE REGULAR ACADEMIC YEAR. THE REPORT DISCUSSES THE ATTITUDES OF THE STUDENTS AND THE ROLES OF THE TEACHERS, AIDES, AND SUPERVISORS IN THE PROGRAM, AND PROVIDES DESCRIPTIONS OF THE MATHEMATICS AND ENGLISH SYLLABUSES, THE LIBRARY PROGRAM, THE GUIDANCE SERVICES, AND THE FUNCTIONS OF THE FAMILY ASSISTANTS.

THE DATA, OBTAINED THROUGH QUESTIONNAIRES, INTERVIEWS, SCHOOL RECORDS, AND INFORMAL CONVERSATIONS, INDICATED THAT SOCIAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES WERE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS OF ACHIEVEMENT.

THE TWO CONTROL SCHOOLS PROVIDED NONE OF THESE SPECIAL SERVICES AND INNOVATIONS. CHILDREN IN ALL THREE SCHOOLS WERE ADMINISTERED THE CALIFORNIA TEST SERIES AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR AND THE  RESULTS WERE STATISTICALLY ANALYZED. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE WELFARE RECIPIENT CHILDREN SCORED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER ON TEST OF MENTAL MATURITY, LANGUAGE READING, AND ARITHMETIC THAN DID THE NONWELFARE CHILDREN, BUT THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THEIR PERSONALITY TEST PERFORMANCE. THE RESULTS ALSO DID NOT REVEAL ANY PATTERN OF SUPERIORITY IN ANY OF THE THREE SCHOOLS, SUGGESTING THAT THERE IS A NEED TO PRODUCE MORE CREATIVE COMPENSATORY PROGRAMS, WHICH POSSIBLY SHOULD BEGIN AT AN EARLIER AGE LEVEL. ALSO, THE GREATER SUCCESS OF ONE GROUP OF CHILDREN WHO WERE GIVEN SMALL GROUP INSTRUCTION IN THE EXPERIMENTAL SCHOOL INDICATES THAT SUCH INSTRUCTION MAY OFFER MORE PROMISE FOR INCREASED ACHIEVEMENT THAN LARGE GROUP ENRICHED INSTRUCTION.

SINCE 1962, WITH A CHANGE OF ADMINISTRATOR ALL FIRST- AND SECOND-GRADE PUPILS HAVE RECEIVED 45 MINUTES OF READING INSTRUCTION THREE OR FOUR TIMES A WEEK, AND THOSE CHILDREN IN GRADES THREE TO SIX WHO STILL REQUIRE SUCH INSTRUCTION CONTINUED TO RECEIVE IT. THESE LESSONS ARE CONDUCTED IN SEVEN SPECIAL READING CENTERS SET UP THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL FOR THIS PURPOSE. POSTED IN THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE ARE INDIVIDUAL READING CHARTS WHICH FOLLOW THE READING PROGRAM OF EACH CHILD. TEACHERS ARE CONSIDERED ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR PUPILS' PROGRESS, AND TEACHER MORALE IS HIGH BECAUSE OF THIS ATMOSPHERE  OF CONCERN IN THE SCHOOL. ABOUT 90 PERCENT OF THE TEACHING STAFF ARE &quot;REGULARS&quot; AND TEACHER ABSENTEEISM IS INFREQUENT. CITYWIDE TESTS ADMINISTERED IN THE SCHOOL IN MAY 1966 REVEALED THAT 60 PERCENT OF THE PUPILS IN EACH GRADE WERE READING AT GRADE LEVEL, AND THAT THE SCHOOL AVERAGE FOR FOURTH GRADERS TAKING THE IOWA TEST OF EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN MATHEMATICS WAS AT THE 99 PERCENTILE. THE FACT THAT THE BOARD OF EDUCATION HAS NOT PUBLICIZED THIS SUCCESS RAISES SOME QUESTIONS. THIS ARTICLE IS PUBLISHED IN THE &quot;CONGRESS BI-WEEKLY,&quot; VOLUME 33, DECEMBER 19, 1966. (LB)",

GORDON OF &quot;EQUALITY OF EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY&quot; (KNOWN AS THE COLEMAN REPORT AFTER ITS SENIOR AUTHOR), A REPORT OF AN EXTENSIVE SURVEY OF MINORITY GROUP EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. AFTER EXAMINING SOME OF THE DATA AND FINDINGS IN THE REPORT, GORDON CONCLUDES THAT ONE CANNOT ON THE BASIS OF THE REPORT'S STATISTICS INFER THE CAUSES OF THE CONDITIONS WHICH COLEMAN DESCRIBES. HE MAINTAINS, HOWEVER, THAT ONE CAN SAFELY ACCEPT COLEMAN'S CONCLUSION THAT MOST MINORITY GROUP CHILDREN ATTEND SCHOOLS WHICH ARE ETHNICALLY AND SOCIALLY SEGREGATED. MOREOVER, AS COLEMAN SUGGESTS, MINORITY GROUP CHILDREN ARE STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY THE QUALITY OF THEIR TEACHERS, BY THE CURRICULUM, AND BY OTHER PUPILS IN THE SCHOOL. THESE SCHOOL FACTORS  ESPECIALLY INFLUENCE PUPILS' SENSE OF CONTROL OVER THEIR OWN DESTINY, WHICH IN TURN AFFECTS THEIR ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT. HOWEVER THE COLEMAN REPORT DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE IMPACT OF THE DISADVANTAGED CHILD'S EDUCATIONAL DEFICIT UPON HIS SUBSEQUENT ACHIEVEMENT, FOR IT FAILS TO CONSIDER THAT SCHOOLS SHOULD BE PROVIDING UNEQUAL, COMPENSATORY TREATMENT FOR THE DISADVANTAGED. THE STUDY ALSO DOES NOT ASSESS SUCH SUBTLE BUT IMPORTANT &quot;PROCESS VARIABLES&quot; AS CLASSROOM CLIMATE, PUPIL-TEACHER INTERACTION, OR THE NATURE AND QUALITY OF SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION. HOWEVER, ALTHOUGH THE STUDY ONLY CRUDELY IDENTIFIES AND MEASURES SCHOOL FACTORS, IT CLEARLY INDICATES THE IMPORTANCE OF SCHOOL INTEGRATION AND IMPROVED SCHOOL QUALITY, AND DOES NOT CONTRADICT THE SUGGESTION THAT THE COMMUNITY PARTICIPATE MORE IN  SCHOOL POLICY MAKING.

ALL PARTICIPANTS WHO WERE SKILLED, SEMISKILLED, AND UNSKILLED WORKERS HAD SIX COMMON CHARACTERISTICS--20-40 YEARS OLD, MARRIED WITH WIFE WORKING OUTSIDE THE HOME LESS THAN 20 HOURS PER WEEK, ETC. WAGE GROUP AT THE TIME OF STUDY DIFFERENTIATED THESE INTO TWO GROUPS--GROUP 1 CONSISTING OF MEN EMPLOYED IN THE THREE LOWEST WAGE GROUPS AND GROUP 2, MEN EMPLOYED IN THE FIVE HIGHEST WAGE GROUPS. DATA WERE ANALYZED BY DEVELOPING AND ANALYZING CASE STUDIES, COMPARING  GROUPS, AND EXAMINING INTERCORRELATES OF 116 VARIABLES WITHIN EACH GROUP AND FOR THE TOTAL OF 40 FAMILIES. ABSENTEEISM WAS SLIGHTLY HIGHER IN GROUP 2. BOTH GROUPS AVERAGED ABOUT THE SAME NUMBER OF PART-TIME JOBS IN ADDITION TO COMPANY JOBS. GROUP 2 HAD MORE SENIORITY, MORE UPWARD WAGE MOBILITY, AND MADE MORE SUGGESTIONS TO THE COMPANY. GROUP 2 FAMILIES WERE HIGHER IN SOCIAL PARTICIPATION AND MORE UPWARDLY MOBILE SOCIALLY, MENTIONED MORE HOME CHARACTERISTICS THEY BELIEVED WOULD INFLUENCE MEN ON THE JOB, AND EXHIBITED MORE HARMONY IN THE FAMILY, BETTER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, AND MORE DEMOCRATIC DECISION MAKING. ABSENTEEISM CORRELATED POSITIVELY WITH THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN, NUMBER OF MOVES BY FAMILY IN THE PAST 5 YEARS, AND NUMBER OF HOME-INFLUENCING FACTORS IDENTIFIED BY THE WIFE.

Sixteen teachers attended a workshop and outlined the content for an experimental set of masters. After experimental use of this set at a subsequent workshop, 35 vocational agriculture teachers evaluated the usefulness of the masters, recommended revisions, and suggested additional masters. The final set of experimental masters was made available to the state's teachers for use in their classes during the 1966-67 school year. Returned questionnaires indicated that 83 percent of the teachers used the masters during the school year, an additional 6 percent planned to use the masters as soon as equipment was available, and 89  percent desired access to additional material of this type. It was concluded that cooperative work on instructional materials by teachers stimulates interest in their use of such materials and broadens their concepts of instruction. Recommended uses of the masters, methods for using masters, methods for using masters to make transparencies, a prepared set of transparencies, and the questionnaire sent to the teachers are included in the document.

        "description":"THE SMITH-HUGHES ACT OF 1917, DEVELOPED FROM THE &quot;REPORT OF THE COMMISSION ON NATIONAL AID TO VOCATIONAL EDUCATION,&quot; WAS THE BASIS FOR HR4955. THE BILL'S IMMEDIATE HISTORY BEGAN IN 1960 WITH THE ENTHUSIASM OF ADVOCATES OF EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION FOR THE NOMINATION OF JOHN F. KENNEDY. THE AMERICAN VOCATIONAL ASSOCIATION (AVA) RECEIVED A PLEDGE OF SUPPORT FROM THE CANDIDATE. AT THIS TIME THE AVA SOUGHT TO ASCERTAIN THE VIEWS OF ITS MEMBERSHIP PRIOR TO A REVISION OF POLICY. IN NOVEMBER 1962 A PANEL OF CONSULTANTS, ESTABLISHED BY THE PRESIDENT, TO EVALUATE THE NATIONAL VOCATIONAL EDUCATION ACTS AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR REDIRECTING THE PROGRAM, RECOMMENDED A LARGE INCREASE IN THE FEDERAL CONTRIBUTION FOR VOCATIONAL EDUCATION, ABANDONMENT OF THE LEGISLATIVE CATEGORIES IN THE  SMITH-HUGHES AND GEORGE-BARDEN ACT, NEW LEGISLATIVE CATEGORIES, AND NEW FUNDS. IN THE FALL OF 1962, AS THE OFFICE OF EDUCATION BEGAN THE ADMINISTRATION'S VOCATIONAL EDUCATION BILL, WHICH BECAME HR 3000 AND S 580, THE AVA WROTE AN UNOFFICIAL DRAFT OF WHAT BECAME HR 4955, ALSO KNOWN AS THE PERKINS BILL. PUBLIC HEARINGS ON BOTH BILLS WERE COMPLETED IN APRIL 1963. HR 4955 WAS REPORTED ON JUNE 18, WAS BROUGHT TO THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE FOR DEBATE, AND PASSED BY A VOTE OF 377 TO 21 ON AUGUST 6. THE BILL'S PASSAGE THROUGH THE SENATE WAS MARKED BY ITS RETURN TO THE RULES COMMITTEE AND A DEADLOCK OF THE HOUSE-SENATE CONFERENCE TO CONSIDER POINTS OF DISAGREEMENT. PRESIDENT JOHNSON'S PLAN FOR ACTION BROKE THE DEADLOCK, AND THE SENATE VERSION CARRIED ON THE MAJOR POINTS WHICH CONCERNED THE WORK-STUDY  PROGRAM, RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL PROGRAM, AND ALLOTMENT FORMULA. ON DECEMBER 13, THE SENATE AGREED TO THE CONFERENCE REPORTS BY A VOTE OF 82 TO 4. ON DECEMBER 18, 1963, PRESIDENT LYNDON B. JOHNSON APPROVED THE VOCATIONAL ACT OF 1963, AND IT BECAME PUBLIC LAW 88-210. (EM)",

        "description":"THE EVALUATION OR DEVALUATION OF CURRICULUMS REQUIRES THE VALIDATION OR INVALIDATION OF THEORY AND IS NOT DETERMINED BY PHILOSOPHICAL DISPUTE. AS LONG AS A CURRICULUM IS CONSIDERED TO BE A CLOSED INFORMATIONAL SYSTEM, INTERNAL CRITERIA MAY HELP ITS SEQUENCE AND ESTABLISH ITS CONSISTENCY BUT CANNOT VALIDATE IT. TO EVALUATE A CLOSED INFORMATIONAL SYSTEM, THE RELEVANT INFORMATION WHICH PREVAILS OUTSIDE THE SYSTEM MUST BE DETERMINED AND TESTED AGAINST THAT WHICH PREVAILS INSIDE, AND ITEMS WITHIN MAY THEN BE DISPLACED OR RETAINED. THE OUTSIDE INFORMATION REPRESENTS AN EXTERNAL CRITERION OF THE INSIDE INFORMATION. OTHER CRITERION PROBLEMS SUGGEST MODIFYING THE CONCEPT THAT A CONTROL GROUP MUST BE A NAIVE PLACEBO GROUP, AND REEXAMINING STATISTICAL DECISIONS SUCH AS WHAT CONSTITUTES  ADEQUATE EVIDENCE OF THE IMPACT OF THE CURRICULUM. WITH CURRICULUMS IN VARIOUS STATES OF TRANSITION, INCLUDING CHANGING METHODOLOGY, ADOPTING NEW OBJECTIVES, AND INCORPORATING NEW INFORMATION, THE PROBLEM BECOMES ONE OF EVALUATING AN OPEN AND DYNAMIC SYSTEM. HERE, THE FIRST PROBLEM IS TO DETERMINE THE BOUNDARIES, NOT BY DEFINING CHRONOLOGICAL AGE, BUT BY CREATING SOME OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF VOCATIONAL ASPIRATIONS. LONGITUDINAL STUDIES ENTAILING BOTH THE PREDICTION AND ASSESSMENT OF CHANGE, INDEPENDENT OF EACH OTHER, ARE NECESSARY FOR SUCH CURRICULUM EVALUATION. THIS WILL PRODUCE CRITERIA FOR STABILITY AND CHANGE. RESPONSES TO THE PAPER BY RALPH E. MASON AND ROBERT M. WASSON ARE INCLUDED.

ADMINISTRATORS, TEACHERS, PUPIL PERSONNEL WORKERS, AND RANDOMLY SELECTED FACULTY IN NINE PAIRS OF MATCHED COMMUNITIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE BRITISH ISLES RANKED 22 PROBLEMS ON A CHECKLIST TO SHOW THEIR RELATIVE IMPORTANCE. IN FOLLOWUP INTERVIEWS THE RESPONDENTS DISCUSSED THE MOST FREQUENTLY CHECKED PROBLEMS. PUPILS FAILING TO WORK UP TO OR ACHIEVE NEAR THEIR CAPACITY WAS THE MOST SERIOUS PROBLEM IN BOTH COUNTRIES, BUT OTHERS OF CONCERN WERE THOSE RELATED TO PUPIL LACK OF INTEREST IN  THE SCHOOL ACADEMIC PROGRAM, PUPIL HOME ENVIRONMENT, PUPIL BEHAVIOR OUT OF SCHOOL, AND LACK OF PARENTAL COOPERATION AND UNDERSTANDING. EDUCATORS OF THE TWO COUNTRIES DIFFERED TO A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE IN THEIR CONCERN OVER PROBLEMS RELATED TO SCHOOL DROPOUTS, PUPIL FAILURE TO ACQUIRE BASIC READING, WRITING, AND REASONING SKILLS, LACK OF INTEREST IN THE SCHOOL ACTIVITY PROGRAM, AND LACK OF POST-HIGH SCHOOL VOCATIONAL-TECHNICAL EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. THE UNITED STATES EDUCATORS SAW SOME APPLICATION POTENTIAL IN ALL OF 14 SUGGESTED SOLUTIONS, AND THE BRITISH IN 10. THE SOLUTIONS CONCERNED--(1) SPECIAL CLASSES FOR POORLY MOTIVATED STUDENTS WITH ABILITY, (2) SPECIAL SCHOLARSHIP, CONTINUOUS PROCESS, JUNIOR HIGH READINESS, CULTURAL EXPERIENCE, YEAR-ROUND VOCATIONAL, CULTURALLY ENRICHED,  SUMMER MOTIVATION, WORK STUDY, SLOW LEARNER, AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS, (3) SOCIOMETRIC PLACEMENT, AND (4) GROUP COUNSELING. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THERE ARE PROBLEMS OF COMMON CONCERN TO BOTH COUNTRIES, AND SOLUTIONS FOUND IN ONE COUNTRY MAY BE APPLICABLE TO OTHER DISADVANTAGED CULTURES. IT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT A LARGE-SCALE INTERNATIONAL STUDY OF COMMON EDUCATIONAL-VOCATIONAL PROBLEMS AND RELATED SOLUTIONS BE UNDERTAKEN.

THE PERCENTAGE OF REGISTERED VOTERS AND COMMUNICATION TECHNIQUES USED WERE NOT CORRELATED WITH ELECTION OUTCOME. ECONOMIC VARIABLES DEALING WITH MILLAGE INCREASE AND TOTAL MILLAGE APPEARED MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE ISSUE IN INCREASING VOTER TURNOUT. DISTRICTS WHICH HAD PASSED A BOND ISSUE IN THE 5-YEAR PERIOD WERE  MOST LIKELY TO PASS ANOTHER PRESENTED CURING THE PERIOD, AND UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS WERE MOST LIKELY TO BE FOLLOWED BY FURTHER FAILURES. LITTLE OR NO ASSOCIATION WAS OBSERVED BETWEEN DISTRICT DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OR ECONOMIC VARIABLES AND A FAVORABLE VOTE. SUPERINTENDENTS OF SUCCESSFUL DISTRICTS EVALUATED NEWSPAPER COVERAGE AS MORE FAVORABLE AND PARENT TEACHER ASSOCIATION INVOLVEMENT AS MORE IMPORTANT THAN DID SUPERINTENDENTS OF UNSUCCESSFUL ONES. VOCATIONAL EDUCATION BOND ISSUE PROPOSALS DID NOT SEEM TO AFFECT THE ELECTION OUTCOMES. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT DATA COLLECTED BY THE PRESENT SURVEY TECHNIQUES ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF SCHOOL BOND ISSUES.

        "description":"IN 1966, THE NATION'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DROPPED BELOW 4 PERCENT, A 13-YEAR LOW. THE TOTAL PRODUCTION OF GOODS AND SERVICES WAS $58 MILLION MORE THAN IN 1965, AND THE AFTER-TAX INCOME OF AMERICAN FAMILIES INCREASED, AFTER ALLOWING FOR PRICE INCREASES, BY 3.5 PERCENT. THIS PROGRESS RESULTED FROM BUSINESS AND LABOR ACHIEVEMENTS, GRADUALLY IMPROVING EDUCATION, AND EFFORTS BY THE GOVERNMENT TO ENCOURAGE AND SUSTAIN ECONOMIC GROWTH AND TO CARRY OUT HUMANE AND POSITIVE MANPOWER PROGRAMS. THROUGH THE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY ACT (EOA) OF 1964, THE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ACT, THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT OF 1965, AND THE MANPOWER AND DEVELOPMENT TRAINING ACT (MDTA) OF 1962 WITH ITS 1965 AND 1966 AMENDMENTS, STEPS WERE TAKEN TO ASSURE OPPORTUNITY TO ALL CITIZENS. BY THE END OF THE  YEAR, ABOUT 600,000 UNEMPLOYED AND UNDEREMPLOYED WORKERS HAD ENROLLED IN TRAINING, AND NEARLY NINE OF 10 WHO COMPLETED TRAINING WERE EMPLOYED. UNDER EOA, MORE THAN 800,000 YOUNG PEOPLE HAD RECEIVED A NEW START THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOOD YOUTH CORPS, THOUSANDS HAD RECEIVED TRAINING AND JOBS THROUGH THE JOB CORPS, AND 138,000 FAMILY BREADWINNERS WERE GIVEN NEW SKILLS THROUGH THE WORK-EXPERIENCE AND TRAINING PROGRAM. TO ASSIST THE UNEMPLOYED, NEW DIRECTIONS IN MANPOWER POLICY MUST BE PURSUED BY CONCENTRATING NATIONAL EFFORTS TO CLOSE THE GAP BETWEEN EDUCATION AND WORK, MAKING THE OVERALL MANPOWER EFFORT A MORE EFFICIENT AND COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM, AND MAKING MILITARY SERVICE A PATH TO PRODUCTION CAREERS. A VIGOROUS ECONOMY AND AN EFFECTIVE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM ARE BASIC TO AN EFFECTIVE MANPOWER  POLICY. THE 18 EDUCATIONAL MEASURES PROPOSED BY THE PRESIDENT AND ENACTED BY CONGRESS ARE SYMBOLS OF THE BELIEF THAT EDUCATION IS THE MOST IMPORTANT INVESTMENT THAN CAN BE MADE IN THE NATION'S FUTURE.

A DISTINGUISHING FEATURE OF 1966 WAS THE EXTENT TO WHICH IDEAS WERE BROUGHT FROM THE PLANNING OR TESTING STAGE TO INNOVATIVE ACTION BY MANY AGENCIES OF THE GOVERNMENT. THE OVERRIDING CONCERN IN THESE ACTIONS WAS TO DEAL MORE EFFECTIVELY AND FUNDAMENTALLY WITH THE PROBLEMS OF THE DISADVANTAGED, BUT IMPORTANT STEPS WERE ALSO TAKEN TO HELP MEET SKILL SHORTAGE PROBLEMS AND TO COORDINATE MANPOWER PROGRAMS WITH OTHER RELATED STATE AND LOCAL PROGRAMS. MANY BUSINESSES AND INDUSTRIES RECRUITED, EMPLOYED, AND TRAINED DISADVANTAGED WORKERS AND COOPERATED IN EFFORTS TO MEET HOUSING, TRANSPORTATION, AND OTHER SOCIAL PROBLEMS. MANY NATIONAL  LABOR UNIONS STIMULATED UPGRADING TRAINING TO IMPROVE SKILLS AND OPEN OPPORTUNITIES FOR LARGE MEMBERS OF THE DISADVANTAGED IN ENTRY OCCUPATIONS. SPECIFIC SUBJECTS DISCUSSED ARE (1) REACHING AND SERVING THE DISADVANTAGED THROUGH THE HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM, MULTISERVICE NEIGHBORHOOD CENTERS, AND REFOCUSED MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING ACT (MDTA) PROGRAMS, (2) IMPROVING EMPLOYABILITY THROUGH MDTA TRAINING, NEIGHBORHOOD YOUTH CORPS PROJECTS, PROGRAMS FOR WELFARE CLIENTS, AND STATEWIDE PROJECTS, (3) INITIATING NEW FORMS OF JOB DEVELOPMENT THROUGH INDUSTRY COOPERATION, YOUTH OPPORTUNITY CAMPAIGNS, AND WORK-TRAINING PROGRAMS, (4) INITIATING INNOVATIONS IN OCCUPATIONAL TRAINING, (5) MEETING THE PROBLEMS OF SPECIAL GROUPS, SUCH AS OLDER WORKERS, AMERICAN INDIANS,  MEXICAN-AMERICANS, TEXAS MIGRATORY WORKERS, DISADVANTAGED SERVICEMEN AND REJECTEES, AND PRISON INMATES, AND (6) IMPLEMENTING NEW ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES, SUCH AS USE OF COORDINATING TEAMS, JOINT FUNDING, AND NATIONAL-STATE PLANNING.

        "description":"ALTHOUGH THE AVERAGE STANDARD OF LIVING OF FARM PEOPLE HAS BEEN RISING STEADILY, THEY CONTINUE TO FACE SEVERE PROBLEMS OF UNDEREMPLOYMENT AND POVERTY. THE AVERAGE PER CAPITA INCOME OF FARM RESIDENTS IS LESS THAN TWO-THIRDS THAT OF THE NONFARM POPULATION. MILLIONS HAVE MOVED TO CITIES, LEAVING STAGNATING RURAL COMMUNITIES, AND INCREASING THE CITY SLUM POPULATION. TO INCREASE FARM EMPLOYMENT, HIRING OF FOREIGN WORKERS HAS BEEN SHARPLY CURTAILED, AND MOBILE TEAMS OF STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE INITIATED RECRUITMENT PROGRAMS FOR PLACING UNEMPLOYED AND COLLEGE YOUTH, AMERICAN INDIANS, PUERTO RICANS, AND OTHERS. BOTH EMPLOYMENT TIME AND WAGE RATES HAVE INCREASED IN AREAS WHERE FOREIGN WORKERS FORMERLY WERE USED. THE VOCATIONAL TRAINING ACT OF 1963, THE MANPOWER  DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING ACT, THE AREA REDEVELOPMENT ACT OF 1961, THE RURAL AREAS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM, MANY WAR ON POVERTY PROGRAMS, NEIGHBORHOOD YOUTH CORPS PROGRAMS, AND OTHERS HELP TO ALLEVIATE THE NEEDS OF THE FARMWORKER. THERE SHOULD BE CONTINUED RURAL EDUCATION, ECONOMIC AND JOB DEVELOPMENT IN RURAL AREAS, REGULARIZATION OF EMPLOYMENT FOR FARMWORKERS, FURTHER REDUCTION OF FOREIGN LABOR, LEGISLATION PROVIDING LABOR STANDARDS AND INCOME SECURITY FOR FARMWORKERS, BETTER WORKER HOUSING, AND HELP FOR FARM TO NONFARM MIGRANTS. MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE CHARACTERISTICS AND PROBLEMS OF RURAL FARM AND NONFARM PEOPLE IN DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS TAILORED TO THEIR SPECIAL NEEDS, AND IDENTIFY ANTICIPATED TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES IN AGRICULTURE IN ADVANCE OF PLANNED MANPOWER  EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS THAT WILL AID DISPLACED WORKERS. A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF AGRICULTURE POLICIES, NEEDS, AND PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT IS EXPECTED AS A RESULT OF THE RECENT PRESIDENTIAL APPOINTMENT OF THE NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMISSION ON FOOD AND FIBER AND THE COMMISSION ON RURAL POVERTY.

MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY PROVIDES THE CENTRAL PROJECT LEADERSHIP AND NEGOTIATES AND OPERATES THE CONTRACT WITH THE U.S. OFFICE OF EDUCATION. ONE PERSON FROM EACH STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SERVES AS STATE PROJECT COORDINATOR, AND AN APPOINTED TEACHER-EDUCATOR SERVES AS STATE RESEARCH CONSULTANT. EACH PILOT SCHOOL PROVIDES A QUALIFIED TEACHER,  CALLED THE RESEARCH ASSOCIATE, WHO TEACHES THE BLOCK-TIME CLASS ACCORDING TO ONE OF FOUR PLANS--STENOGRAPHIC, MODIFIED STENOGRAPHIC, CLERICAL, OR SPECIAL CLERICAL FOR LOW ACHIEVERS. A GENERAL COURSE OUTLINE AND OTHER INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS WERE DEVELOPED BY THE PROJECT STAFF IN A NATIONAL SEMINAR AND DISTRIBUTED TO ALL PROJECT PERSONNEL. AN EVALUATION OF INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS IS TO BE MADE AT THE END OF THE 1966-67 SCHOOL YEAR. DATA ON CLASSROOM ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED BY THE RESEARCH ASSOCIATES TO MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY.

FIFTY-EIGHT PROFESSIONAL EDUCATORS PARTICIPATED IN A STRUCTURED INTERVIEW USING A DECK OF 60 TWO-SORT CARDS, EACH CONTAINING A STATEMENT DESCRIBING A DIFFERENT JOB ACTIVITY CONCERNING THE PROFESSIONAL LEADER ROLE. WEIGHTED SCORES WERE ASSIGNED BY RESPONDENTS TO EACH ITEM SORTED, AND CORRELATION AND FACTOR ANALYSES WERE USED IN ANALYZING THE DATA AS TO ACTUAL AND IDEAL ROLES. ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A LACK OF AGREEMENT AMONG RESPONDENTS AS TO RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF VARIOUS ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE LEADERSHIP ROLE, MOST RESPONDENTS SEEMED TO CORRELATE IDEAL  AND ACTUAL ROLES. RESPONDENTS VALUED THE LEADERSHIP ROLE MORE ON THE BASIS OF THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF HOW A PROFESSIONAL LEADER SHOULD BE INVOLVED THAN ON WHAT HE WAS ACTUALLY DOING. THEY SHOWED GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT MORE IMPORTANCE SHOULD BE ACCORDED THE ACTIVITIES COMPRISING PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING THE EVALUATIVE AND INSTRUCTIONAL ASPECTS. THEY DISAGREED MOST WITH THE ACTIVITIES COMPRISING THE ASPECT OF COOPERATION WITH AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT DISAGREEMENT EXISTS CONCERNING THE PATTERN OF THE PROFESSIONAL LEADER ROLE IN PARENT EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR THE DISADVANTAGED. BECAUSE THE LACK OF AGREEMENT COULD BE A POTENTIAL SOURCE OF CONFLICT, IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN RELATION TO EXISTING AND EMERGING PROGRAMS. IMPLICATIONS OF THE STUDY WERE THAT (1) THERE IS A  NEED FOR REALISTIC OBJECTIVES AND A CLEAR DEFINITION OF AUTHORITY, (2) CONSIDERING THE TREND OF USING HOME ECONOMICS TEACHERS IN PARENT-EDUCATION PROGRAMS, TEACHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS SHOULD PREPARE THEM TO COPE WITH SOCIO-ECONOMIC DIFFERENCES, AND (3) INCREASING EMPHASIS ON PROFESSIONALIZATION OF THE LEADERSHIP ROLE STRESSES THE NEED FOR CONTINUED INSERVICE TRAINING.

        "description":"TWENTY-TWO SELECTED OHIO VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE TEACHERS AND 262 JUNIOR AND SENIOR VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE STUDENTS PARTICIPATED IN A STUDY TO MEASURE THE RELATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF NEWLY DEVELOPED INSTRUCTIONAL UNITS DESIGNED TO ENHANCE STUDENT UNDERSTANDING OF PROFIT-MAXIMIZING PRINCIPLES IN FARM MANAGEMENT. FARM MANAGEMENT WAS TAUGHT IN THE TRADITIONAL MANNER IN THE CONTROL GROUP OF SIX SCHOOLS. THE NEWLY DEVELOPED INSTRUCTIONAL UNITS WERE USED IN AN UNINTERRUPTED SEQUENCE OF APPROXIMATELY 6 WEEKS IN THE SEVEN SCHOOLS SERVING AS A PILOT-BLOCK GROUP, ANDTHE SAME MATERIAL INTEGRATED WITH OTHER SUBJECT MATTER WAS USED IN NINE SCHOOLS DESIGNATED AS THE PILOT-INTEGRATED GROUP. THE PILOT-BLOCK GROUP OF STUDENTS OBTAINED THE HIGHEST SCORES ON THE POSTTEST WHICH MEASURED THE  UNDERSTANDING OF PROFIT-MAXIMIZING PRINCIPLES, FOLLOWED BY THE PILOT-INTEGRATED AND CONTROL GROUPS. OF 13 VARIABLES STUDIED, ONLY FOUR WERE SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF PROFIT-MAXIMIZING PRINCIPLES--STUDENT YEAR IN VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE, STUDENT YEARS OF FARM EXPERIENCE, STUDENT I.Q., AND NUMBER OF TEACHERS IN THE VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT. THE PILOT TEACHERS WERE STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF USING THE DEVELOPED INSTRUCTIONAL UNITS AND FOUND THEM CHALLENGING, TIME CONSUMING, AND REQUIRING EXTRA PREPARATION, BUT THE EXTRA EFFORTS REQUIRED TENDED TO RESULT IN GREATER STUDENT INTEREST AND ACHIEVEMENT. IT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT THE INSTRUCTIONAL UNITS BE REVISED, BASED ON THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY, AND USED WITH A LARGER STUDENT SAMPLE SELECTED AT RANDOM THROUGHOUT THE  STATE. THE APPENDIXES CONTAIN A BIBLIOGRAPHY AND POSTTEST SCORES FOR ALL PARTICIPATING SCHOOLS. THIS IS A DIGEST OF A PH.D. DISSERTATION. THE COMPLETE STUDY IS AVAILABLE AS VT 004 154. (WB)",

TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY-ONE PERSONS, IDENTIFIED BY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL AS THEIR MOST ABLE AND SUCCESSFUL TECHNICIANS, AND 142 IMMEDIATE AND SECOND LEVEL SUPERVISORS WERE INTERVIEWED AND ASKED TO SORT A PACK OF 99 CARDS, EACH CONTAINING DESCRIPTIVE TECHNICAL DATA CONCERNING THINGS TECHNICIANS DO IN VARIOUS SPECIALITIES. THE CARDS WERE SORTED AS DIRECTLY RELATED TO JOB, SOMEWHAT RELATED TO JOB,  AND NOT RELATED TO JOB. TECHNICIANS VIEWED THEIR JOBS IN A VERY BROAD SENSE. RESEARCH, DESIGN, OR DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING WERE THEIR MOST FREQUENTLY MENTIONED ACTIVITIES. THE TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE REQUIRED INVOLVED PRINCIPLES OF ELECTRICITY-ELECTRONICS, MATHEMATICS, AND DRAFTING AND DESIGN AND WAS GENERALLY ACQUIRED ON THE JOB. HOWEVER, TECHNICIANS GENERALLY BELIEVED THAT A 2- OR 4-YEAR FORMAL DEGREE PROGRAM WAS THE BEST PREPARATION FOR THEIR JOBS. MANAGERS AND TECHNICIANS TEND TO AGREE ON INFORMATION, SKILLS, AND KNOWLEDGE IMPORTANT TO THE WORK OF THE TECHNICIANS AND ON THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATIONAL PREPARATION.

THE SECOND PHASE AIMED TO DEVELOP TEACHERS CAPABLE OF IMPLEMENTING PILOT CLUSTER CONCEPT PROGRAMS AND A TEACHER PREPARATION CURRICULUM FOR SUCH PROGRAMS. ELEVEN TEACHERS WERE SELECTED ON THE BASIS OF STAFF EVALUATION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. DURING THE SPRING SEMESTER, IN 16 SESSIONS, THEY DEVELOPED INSTRUCTIONAL PLANS FOR IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAMS, REVIEWED AND EVALUATED INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS, AND ARRANGED THE CONTENT OF EACH CLUSTER INTO AN  INSTRUCTIONAL SEQUENCE. DURING A 6-WEEK SUMMER WORKSHOP, THEY WORKED WITH INDUSTRIES TO DEVELOP THE TECHNICAL SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE REQUIRED FOR IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAMS AND PREPARED OCCUPATIONAL INFORMATION UNITS AND DEVELOPED INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS FOR EACH CLUSTER. AS AN OUTGROWTH OF EXPERIENCES AND OBSERVATIONS OF THE WORKSHOP SESSIONS, TEACHER PREPARATION CURRICULUM WAS DEVELOPED. MAJOR DIVISIONS WERE PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCY DEVELOPMENT FOR CLUSTER CONCEPT PROGRAMS, ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION, TECHNICAL COMPETENCY DEVELOPMENT, AND INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS DEVELOPMENT. EACH DIVISION CONSISTED OF UNITS CONTAINING PURPOSE, TIME, TOPICS, PROCEDURES AND ACTIVITES, AND RESOURCES. THE CURRICULUM IS INCLUDED.

THE CURRICULUM WAS ESSENTIALLY AN ELECTRONICS TECHNICIAN CURRICULUM WITH A STRONG EMPHASIS ON MEDICAL INSTRUMENTATION. IT CONTAINED A UNIQUE COMPONENT ON BIOMEDICAL EQUIPMENT TECHNIQUES, AS WELL AS ENGLISH, PHYSICS, AND MATHEMATICS. RECOMMENDATIONS WERE--(1) TO ESTABLISH A MINIMUM OF 50 PROGRAMS IN GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS TO MEET THE DEMAND FOR 2,000 TECHNICIANS PER YEAR, (2) TO UNDERTAKE MAJOR CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT RATHER THAN TO COMBINE EXISTING COURSES, AND (3) TO CONTINUE INTENSIVE RESEARCH TO DEVELOP AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE TYPE OF CURRICULUM ADAPTABLE TO NUMEROUS POST-SECONDARY INSTITUTIONS.

THE MODEL WAS ESTABLISHED THROUGH SEARCHING LITERATURE, CONSULTING WITH EDUCATORS AND ELECTRONIC DATA PROGRAMERS, AND OBSERVING EXISTING PROGRAMS. IT WAS ESSENTIALLY A DATA COLLECTION PROCEDURE AND A DATA PROCESSING PROGRAM FOR SUBSEQUENT HANDLING AND STORAGE OF THE DATA. IT USES FEEDBACK AND ERROR CONTROL FEATURES. THE PRESCORED CARD WAS SELECTED FOR THE QUESTIONNAIRE INSTRUMENT. RESPONSE POSITIONS, PUNCHED OUT BY HAND, ARE READ DIRECTLY BY VARIOUS ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING TECHNIQUES. THE REGISTRATION FORMS, VERIFICATION OF ENROLLMENT AND ADDRESSES, AND THE IN-CLASS FOLLOWUP FORMS ARE COMPLETED BY ALL  INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS WHILE STILL IN SCHOOL. THE FOLLOWUP FORMS ARE LATER MAILED TO THE STUDENTS. STANDARDIZED FORMS WERE DEVELOPED FOR (1) STANDARDIZED REGISTRATION FOR JUNIOR COLLEGES, (2) VERIFICATION OF ENROLLMENT, (3) VERIFICATION OF ADDRESSES, (4) IN-CLASS FOLLOW-THROUGH, AND (5) OUT-OF-CLASS FOLLOW-THROUGH. THE SYSTEM, AS PLANNED, MAY STAND ALONE, OPERATE IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING PROJECTS, OR BECOME A PART OF LARGER INFORMATION STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. IT IS VERSATILE AND WILL ACCEPT NEW TYPES OF DATA AND DATA GATHERING TECHNIQUES FOR OTHER EVALUATIONS AND ASSESSMENTS OF INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION.

COMPLETED QUESTIONNAIRES WERE RETURNED BY 42 OF THE 50 STATE SUPERVISORS AND 297 OF THE 373 TEACHERS. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY WERE TO DETERMINE THE DISTRIBUTION OF MATERIALS, TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY INFLUENCED LOCAL AND STATE PROGRAMS IN EACH OF THE OCCUPATIONAL AREAS, AND TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MATERIALS USED IN THE CLASSROOM INCLUDING THE DEGREE OF ACCEPTANCE BY THE TEACHERS. SOME FINDINGS WERE--(1) VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE TEACHERS PLACED 71.6  PERCENT OF ALL ORDERS FOR THE MATERIALS, (2) THE MOST FREQUENTLY PURCHASED MATERIALS WERE THE COURSE OUTLINES AND MODULES IN THE AGRICULTURAL SUPPLY, HORTICULTURE, AND AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AREAS, (3) MOST VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE TEACHERS WHO USED THE MATERIALS INDICATED THAT THEY WERE OF HIGH VALUE IN INITIATING AND DEVELOPING OFF-FARM AGRICULTURAL OCCUPATIONS PROGRAMS, AND (4) STATE SUPERVISORS OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION INDICATED THAT THE MATERIALS WERE USED TO A GREAT EXTENT IN PLANNING STATE PROGRAMS IN OFF-FARM AGRICULTURAL OCCUPATIONS. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE MATERIALS WERE WELL DISTRIBUTED GEOGRAPHICALLY AMONG THE AGRICULTURE TEACHERS, FAVORABLY RECEIVED BY STATE SUPERVISORY PERSONNEL, AND GENERALLY WELL ACCEPTED BY THE TEACHERS INCLUDED IN THE SURVEY.

SEVEN SCHOOLS IN TOURIST, URBAN, AND SUBURBAN AREAS OF THE STATE SERVED AS SITES. FIVE OF THE SEVEN PROGRAMS WERE ORGANIZED AS PART OF THE ESTABLISHED HOME ECONOMICS PROGRAMS. EACH SCHOOL GAVE INSTRUCTION FOR TWO PERIODS DAILY IN COMMERCIAL FOODS OCCUPATIONS SUCH AS COOK'S ASSISTANT, GRILL ASSISTANT, BAKER'S HELPER, SALAD GIRL, STOCK BOY, WAITER OR WAITRESS, AND BUS BOY. STUDENTS  HAD SUPERVISED WORK EXPERIENCE IN THE SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM. THE MAJORITY OF THE 121 STUDENTS IN THE PROGRAM WERE 11TH GRADERS AND OF AVERAGE ABILITY. FIVE OF THE SEVEN PROGRAMS WERE COEDUCATIONAL. LOCAL TEACHERS SERVED AS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES ON THE PROJECT, DEVELOPING AND COLLECTING REFERENCES AND INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIAL BOTH IN THE SCHOOLS AND IN WORKSHOPS AND INSTITUTES. PUBLICATION OF THE MATERIALS WAS ANTICIPATED DURING THE 1967-68 SCHOOL YEAR. THE COOPERATIVE PHASE OF THE PROGRAM WAS EXPECTED TO BEGIN IN SEPTEMBER 1967.

TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES, THE BELIEF THAT OCCUPATIONAL EDUCATION IS THE REAL PREPARATION FOR LIFE MUST BE IMPLEMENTED BY PROVIDING THE BEST POSSIBLE VOCATIONAL EDUCATION FOR THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF PEOPLE. TO ACHIEVE THIS, THE ADMINISTRATION HAS INTRODUCED A PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THE VOCATIONAL EDUCATION ACT OF 1963 TO SET UP PILOT PROGRAMS, COSTING AN ESTIMATED $30 MILLION ANNUALLY, TO FIND WAYS TO OVERCOME THE BASIC PROBLEMS. THE AMENDMENT HAS FOUR ASPECTS--AN EXPLORATORY OCCUPATIONAL EDUCATION PROGRAM FOR ALL JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS, PROJECTS TO ASSIST THE STUDENT IN DEVELOPING TO  HIS MAXIMUM THROUGH EDUCATIONAL PART-TIME WORK EXPERIENCE, A SERVICE IN SCHOOLS FOR PLACING STUDENTS IN ENTRY JOBS, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW CURRICULA IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION TO SERVE THOSE NOW BEING IGNORED. WHETHER THIS AMENDMENT BECOMES LAW OR NOT, FEDERAL PERSONNEL ARE SAYING, \"THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE SCHOOLS FOR ITS STUDENTS CANNOT BE OVEREMPHASIZED. THE RESPONSIBILITY IS NOT JUST FOR INSTRUCTION. IT APPLIES TO THOSE WHO LEAVE AS WELL AS THOSE WHO REMAIN--TO THE DROPOUTS AS WELL AS TO THE STAYINS.\" THIS SPEECH WAS DELIVERED AT THE AMERICAN VOCATIONAL ASSOCIATION CONVENTION (CLEVELAND, OHIO, DECEMBER 6, 1967).

THE TWO GROUPS WERE EQUATED IN TERMS OF INITIAL PRODUCTION, NET STROKING, NET PERFORMANCE, RELATED INFORMATION, PSYCHOLOGICAL SCORE, AND READING COMPREHENSION. AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF EACH  SEMESTER, TESTS OF PRODUCTION ABILITY, NET STROKING SPEED, NET PERFORMANCE, AND RELATED INFORMATION WERE ADMINISTERED. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EXPERIMENT IN BOTH SEMESTERS, THE CONTROL GROUP SHOWED HIGHER PRODUCTION ABILITY THAN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP. AT THE END OF THE FIRST SEMESTER, THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP HAD A FINAL PRODUCTION-RATE MEAN OF 13.15 WORDS PER MINUTE (WPM) AND THE CONTROL GROUP A MEAN OF ONLY 7.70 WPM.

HOWEVER, EXISTING SELECTION METHODS (INCLUDING SITUATIONAL TESTING), FORMAL JOB DESCRIPTIONS, AND SURVEYS OF THE DUTIES AND THE DIMENSIONS OF THE TYPICAL EXECUTIVE DO NOT NECESSARILY PROVIDE VALID MEASURES OF EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVE BEHAVIOR.

TO DETERMINE FOREMAN MEMBERSHIP IN NON-UNION FOREMAN ORGANIZATIONS, THE PURPOSE, ORGANIZATION, FINANCIAL SUPPORT, AND PROGRAMS OF SUCH CLUBS, AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE CLUB TO THE COMPANY EMPLOYING ITS MEMBERS, A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS MAILED TO THE 1,000 LARGEST COMPANIES IN THE UNITED STATES. OF THE 765 RESPONDENTS, 396 HAD A MANAGEMENT CLUB, 204 OF THEM AFFILIATED WITH THE NATIONAL MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION OR THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT CLUBS, AND 192 INDEPENDENT. THE 77,000 MEMBERS OF THE RESPONDING CLUBS INCLUDED 54,000 FOREMEN, THE REMAINDER BEING MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL FROM PRESIDENTS TO OFFICE SUPERVISORS.  CLUB ACTIVITIES, ASSESSED THROUGH VISITS TO 22 INDEPENDENT CLUBS AND THE TWO NATIONAL HEADQUARTERS AND THROUGH A QUESTIONNAIRE SENT TO THE INDEPENDENT CLUBS, WERE PRIMARILY SOCIAL AND SUPPORTED IN PART BY THE COMPANIES. THESE CLUBS, ONCE EXCLUSIVELY FOR FOREMEN, HAVE AN INCREASING MEMBERSHIP FROM HIGHER MANAGEMENT, AND MUST REDESIGN THEIR PROGRAMS TO SUIT EMERGING MEMBERSHIP STRUCTURE, EMPHASIZING MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT AND LEADERSHIP TRAINING.

TELEVISION WAS THE MOST WIDELY USED MEDIUM, WITH MOST GENERAL SUBJECTS AIRED OVER COMMERCIAL STATIONS. WHEN DIALOGUE BETWEEN PARTICIPANT AND INSTRUCTOR WAS NEEDED, THE TWO-WAY RADIO CONFERENCE WAS USED. OF THE PRINTED MEDIA, MAGAZINES INVOLVED THE LARGEST GROUP OF PARTICIPANTS. TEACHING METHODS VARIED--INDIVIDUAL METHODS DOMINATED TELEVISION COURSES, MOST RADIO COURSES USED GROUP METHODS, AND NEWSPAPERS, MAGAZINES, AND DIRECT MAIL WERE USED IN SOME GROUP-STRUCTURED EFFORTS. GROUP INSTRUCTION WAS BEST ACCOMPLISHED WITHIN AN ESTABLISHED ORGANIZATION WHICH INCORPORATED THE COURSE INTO ITS PROGRAM. COMMUNITIES SUSTAINED ORGANIZED  TELEVISION EDUCATION ONLY WHEN CONSISTENT AND EXTENSIVE RESOURCES WERE ALLOCATED, AS IN THE ST. LOUIS METROPLEX ASSEMBLY. THE DOMINANT PURPOSE FOR CONTINUING EDUCATION VIA MASS MEDIA WAS THE ACQUISITION OF INFORMATION, PARTICULARLY THROUGH GENERAL EDUCATION COURSES OFFERED BY UNIVERSITIES. PARTICIPANTS FAVORED PROFESSIONAL OR VOCATIONAL-CENTERED COURSES. PROFESSIONAL HEALTH SCIENCE WAS ENGROSSED IN SKILL-ORIENTED COURSES, WHILE VOLUNTEER GROUPS WERE INTERESTED IN THE APPLICATION OF KNOWLEDGE. (THIS PAPER, BASED ON THE AUTHOR'S UNPUBLISHED PH.D.

IN MEMORY OR &quot;SHADOW&quot; TESTS, GROUPS OF NEGRO BOYS FROM 10 TO 14 YEARS OLD WERE HIGHLY MOTIVATED TO REPEAT EXACTLY SENTENCES GIVEN IN STANDARD AND NONSTANDARD ENGLISH. RESULTS INDICATE THAT SOME STANDARD FORMS, SUCH AS USE OF &quot;IS&quot;, WERE EASILY REMEMBERED AND REPEATED. SENTENCES WITH STANDARD ENGLISH NEGATION FORMS OR &quot;IF&quot; CLAUSES, HOWEVER, WERE UNDERSTOOD BUT WERE REPEATED IN NONSTANDARD DIALECT. REGARDING THE COMPLEX QUESTION OF THE RELATIVE SOCIAL VALUE OF THE TWO FORMS OF ENGLISH, THE AUTHOR FEELS THAT THE ADULT NEGRO COMMUNITY SHARES THE  NORMATIVE SOCIAL VALUES OF THE LARGER WHITE COMMUNITY. NEGRO TEENAGERS, HOWEVER, ASSOCIATE STANDARD ENGLISH WITH &quot;EFFEMINACY, GENTILITY, AND OVERCULTIVATION,&quot; AND LANGUAGE PROGRAMS SHOULD TAKE THIS INTO ACCOUNT. RESEARCH ALSO SHOWS THAT CHILDREN JUDGED &quot;NONVERBAL&quot; IN SCHOOL LANGUAGE TESTS ACTUALLY HAD RICH VERBAL RESOURCES WHEN STIMULATED BY SOPHISTICATED TECHNIQUES. THE AUTHOR FEELS THAT CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS CAN BE MOTIVATED TO LEARN STANDARD ENGLISH BY EMPHASIZING ITS VALUE FOR INFLUENCING AND CONTROLLING OTHER PEOPLE, SINCE THIS IS THE USE FOR WHICH VERBAL SKILLS ARE ALREADY PRIZED IN THE VERNACULAR CULTURE.

THE FIRST 11 LESSONS ARE DEVOTED TO INTENSIVE PRONUNCIATION AND PATTERN PRACTICES. IN THE FOLLOWING NINE  LESSONS GRAMMATICAL PATTERNS ARE GRADUALLY PRESENTED USING, AS FAR AS POSSIBLE, NONTECHNICAL LINGUISTIC TERMINOLOGY. A TYPICAL ADVANCED LESSON CONTAINS A DIALOG, CULTURAL NOTES, THE ENGLISH TRANSLATION FOR THE DIALOG, GRAMMAR NOTES, PATTERN PRACTICES, AND AN ENGLISH TO PANJABI TRANSLATION EXERCISE.

IN TASK 2, SS WERE REQUIRED TO READ AND RANK EACH STATEMENT ON A SCALE RUNNING FROM ONE (COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE) TO FIVE (COMPLETELY ACCEPTABLE). A DIFFERENT ORDER OF STIMULUS PRESENTATION WAS EMPLOYED ON EACH EXPERIMENTAL DAY--14 SS WERE ASSIGNED TO ONE ORDER ON DAY 1, AND RECEIVED THE OTHER ORDER ON DAY 2. RESULTS SHOW THAT SS TEND TO PREFER THE SAME STATEMENT OVER ORDERS, AND THAT RANK AND PREFERENCE ARE  HIGHLY CORRELATED. THERE ARE CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCES IN PREFERENCE AMONG THE 50 PAIRS OF STIMULUS ITEMS. PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF THE DATA SUGGESTS THAT THIS TASK MAY YIELD INFORMATION RELEVANT TO THE LINGUISTIC AND IN PARTICULAR THE SURFACE SYNTACTIC COMPETENCE OF SS WHEN APPLIED TO AGRAMMATICAL STATEMENTS. SS APPEAR TO BE TRYING TO COPE WITH THE STATEMENTS BY COMPARING THEM TO ACCEPTABLE SEMANTICAL SYNTACTIC PATTERNS.

A MINIATURE LINGUISTIC SYSTEM (MLS) IS A LIMITED, ARTIFICIAL LANGUAGE MADE UP OF NONSENSE SYLLABLES AND NONSENSE FIGURE REFERENTS ARRANGED IN RELATIONS ANALOGOUS TO THOSE IN NATURAL LANGUAGES. A TOTAL OF 210 ADULTS WERE ASKED TO LEARN THE NAMES OF THE REFERENTS WITHOUT BEING TOLD THERE WAS A LINGUISTIC SYSTEM UNDERLYING THE NAMES. THE CORE EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS EXPLORED THE LEARNING OF MLSS WHERE GRAMMATICAL STRUCTURE WAS HELD CONSTANT, AND THE REFERENT DIMENSIONS WERE PAIRED WITH  STRUCTURAL UNITS IN ALL OF THE POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS ALLOWED BY THE SET OF DIMENSIONS AND UNITS USED. THE LEARNING OF THESE SYSTEMS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY BOTH GRAMMARS &quot;AS A WHOLE&quot; AND MORPHEME TYPES, AND THESE TWO VARIABLES INTERACTED SIGNIFICANTLY. THE RESULTS WERE DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF A MILLER AND CHOMSKY PERFORMANCE MODEL. THE MAJOR DETERMINANT APPEARED TO BE THE NATURE OF STRUCTURAL UNITS, WITH LESSER EFFECTS DUE TO REFERENT DIMENSIONS.

        "description":"IN ORDER TO TEST THE EFFICACY OF METHODS USED BY VARIOUS RESEARCHERS FOR GENERATING SPONTANEOUS SPEECH FROM UNDERPRIVILEGED CHILDREN, 20 THREE- TO FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRLS WERE SELECTED AT RANDOM FROM A HEADSTART-TYPE PROGRAM AT HOWARD UNIVERSITY FOR TESTING. ALL WERE NEGROES AND FROM A TARGET AREA FOR POVERTY PROGRAMS. THE CHILDREN WERE TESTED INDIVIDUALLY OR TWO AT A TIME BY TWO FEMALE EXAMINERS, ONE WHITE AND ONE NEGRO. TEST SESSIONS WERE SHORT AND CHILDREN UNWILLING TO PARTICIPATE OR SUSPICIOUS OF THE TEST WERE EXCLUDED. TECHNIQUES FOR GENERATING SPONTANEOUS SPEECH INCLUDED USE OF A DOLL AND CRIB, TOYS, COLORING BOOKS, A MALE PUPPET, AND A TELEPHONE. PLATES FROM THE AMMONS FULL RANGE PICTURE VOCABULARY TEST WERE ALSO USED. IT WAS FOUND THAT MOST OF THE CHILDREN GAVE LITTLE MORE  THAN ONE WORD RESPONSES. LONGER RESPONSES WERE USUALLY ELICITED RATHER THAN SPONTANEOUS. THEREFORE, MANY OF THE METHODS USED TRADITIONALLY TO GENERATE SPONTANEOUS SPEECH IN THE UNDERPRIVILEGED CHILD WERE JUDGED UNSUCCESSFUL OR OF QUESTIONABLE VALUE.

        "description":"RECENT LINGUISTIC RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE SPEECH PATTERNS OF SOUTHERN NEGROES CONSTITUTE A LEGITIMATE DIALECT OF ENGLISH WITH PHONOLOGICAL AND GRAMMATICAL RULES SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM GENERAL AMERICAN ENGLISH (GAE). AN EXPERIMENT WAS DESIGNED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THOSE ASPECTS OF THE NEGRO DIALECT WHICH SET IT APART FROM OTHER ENGLISH DIALECTS LEAD TO DIFFERENCES IN SPEECH PERCEPTION, AS WELL AS TO THE DIFFERENCES NOTED IN SPEECH PRODUCTION. PHONETICALLY-BALANCED WORD LISTS AND SENTENCES WERE TAPE-RECORDED BY TWO NATIVE SPEAKERS OF GENERAL AMERICAN ENGLISH AND PLAYED TO 25 NEGRO AND 16 CAUCASIAN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN ALABAMA. EACH STUDENT WAS ASKED EITHER TO REPEAT OR WRITE DOWN WHAT HE HEARD FROM THE TAPE RECORDINGS. THE MEAN SCORE FOR THE NEGRO STUDENTS WAS CONSISTENTLY LOWER  THAN FOR THE CAUCASIAN STUDENTS UNDER ALL TEST CONDITIONS AND BOTH GROUPS PERFORMED LESS WELL THAN LISTENERS WHO WERE NATIVE SPEAKERS OF GAE. THUS, IT APPEARS THAT SPEAKERS OF THE SOUTHERN NEGRO DIALECT COMMIT MORE ERRORS WHEN ATTEMPTING TO CORRECTLY PERCEIVE GAE THAN DO CAUCASIAN STUDENTS FROM THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC AREA AND OF THE SAME SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC LEVEL.

THE 11 THIRD-GRADE BOYS REFERRED BY TEACHERS BECAUSE OF THEIR SHY, WITHDRAWN BEHAVIOR WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO THREE PLAY GROUPS. GROUP XA, COMPOSED OF FOUR BOYS, WAS TREATED BY THE THERAPIST (T), RECEIVING TANGIBLE REINFORCEMENTS IN THE FORM OF TOKENS FOR ASSERTIVE AND SOCIAL APPROACH BEHAVIORS. GROUP XB, COMPOSED OF FOUR BOYS, WAS SIMILARLY TREATED, EXCEPT THAT NO REINFORCEMENTS WERE GIVEN. GROUP CA, WITH THREE BOYS, SERVED AS THE CONTROL. RESULTS INDICATED THAT ALL GROUPS FAILED TO EXHIBIT CHANGE IN  PRODUCTIVITY AS MEASURED BY TEACHERS'S GRADES, ANXIETY, GENERAL PSYCHOLOGICAL ADJUSTMENT, AS REPORTED BY MOTHERS. IN THE TWO REMAINING DEPENDENT VARIABLES, XA IMPROVED MORE THAN XB, AND XB IMPROVED MORE THAN CA. XA EXHIBITED INCREASED SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT AS MEASURED BY RESEARCH ASSISTANTS DURING THE THERAPY SESSIONS, AND DECREASED PROBLEM BEHAVIOR AS REPORTED BY THE MOTHERS.

THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO SOCIAL CLASSES BEFORE OR AFTER TRAINING. A SECOND EXPERIMENT WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE IF THE LACK OF EXPECTED SOCIAL CLASS DIFFERENCES WAS DUE TO THE METHOD OF SUBJECT SELECTION WHICH EXCLUDED CHILDREN WITH VERY HIGH OR LOW INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENTS OR TO THE FACT THAT TASK INSTRUCTION WAS ESPECIALLY EXPLICIT. DATA  ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT BOTH INSTRUCTIONS AND SOCIAL CLASS CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE TOTAL VARIANCE. SINCE TRANSFER EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH PRETRAINING WERE OF EQUAL MAGNITUDE FOR BOTH GROUPS, THE IDEA THAT CULTURALLY DEPRIVED CHILDREN ARE DEFICIENT IN THE CAPACITY FOR SELF-INSTRUCTION IS DISMISSED. STILLER'S FINDINGS THAT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE EXTREME ABILITY SUBJECTS ACCOUNTS FOR SOCIAL CLASS DIFFERENCES IN PERFORMANCE ARE SUPPORTED.

VARIOUS COPING STYLES SHOULD BE FRACTIONATED INTO MORE DISCRETE AND IDENTIFIABLE MENTAL OPERATIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE INDIVIDUAL. THE STUDENT'S ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY COORDINATE AND DEPLOY THE DIVERSE COGNITIVE STRATEGIES ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS COPING STYLES CAN THEN BE TESTED.

THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO EMPLOY SYSTEMS ANALYSIS TO IMPROVE THE PLANNING AND OPERATION OF THE HEALTH SCIENCES FACULTIES. THE HEALTH SCIENCES FACULTIES, AS A SYSTEM, IS DISCUSSED. MAJOR DECISION AREAS ARE REVIEWED. A MODEL WHICH QUANTITATIVELY ASSESSES THE RESOURCE IMPLICATIONS OF ALTERNATIVE PLANS FOR EXPANDING AND IMPROVING HEALTH SCIENCE PROGRAMS WAS  DEVELOPED. CALLED THE JCL3W MODEL, IT ACCEPTS TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTIONS OF THE SYSTEM AND OUTPUT LEVELS. IT PROCEEDS TO COMPUTE THE QUANTITIES OF INPUTS REQUIRED TO PRODUCE THE OUTPUTS. THE MODEL IS USEFUL FOR INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS OF HEALTH SCIENCE EDUCATION BY STRUCTURED CURRICULA. THE DIFFICULTIES OF UNIVERSITY DECISION-MAKING CALL FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF SYSTEMS ANALYSIS IN THIS SETTING.

THE THREE RESPONSE CLASSES CONSTITUTED DEPENDENT VARIABLES FOR THE STUDY (SS' USE OF EFFECTIVE STUDY HABITS, ATTITUDES TO STUDY AND COLLEGE SUCCESS, AND PERFORMANCE IN COURSES), WITH REINFORCEMENT COUNSELING THE PRIMARY INDEPENDENT VARIABLE. A PRETEST-POSTTEST CONTROL GROUP DESIGN WITH ACTIVE AND INACTIVE CONTROLS AND SS ASSIGNED RANDOMLY TO TREATMENT CONDITIONS WAS USED. THE FOUR TREATMENT CONDITIONS WERE SPECIFIC CUE-REINFORCEMENT (CR), GENERAL CUE-REINFORCEMENT (R), PLACEBO GROUPS (P), AND INACTIVE CONTROLS (C).  PREDICTIONS THAT SS IN REINFORCEMENT COUNSELING GROUPS WOULD HAVE HIGHER SCORES ON CRITERION TESTS THAN CONTROL SS WERE CONFIRMED. SIGNIFICANT TREATMENT EFFECTS WERE NOT QUALIFIED BY DIFFERENCES IN SEX AND MAJOR FIELD OF SS, OR COUNSELOR DIFFERENCES, ATTITUDES TO COUNSELING TECHNIQUE OR COUNSELING PRACTICE. THE PREDICTION THAT MODIFICATION IN STUDY BEHAVIOR AS A FUNCTION OF REINFORCEMENT TREATMENT WOULD GENERALIZE OVER TIME WAS CONFIRMED BY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TREATMENT CONDITIONS IN A SIX-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. THE PREDICTION THAT SS UNDER REINFORCEMENT COUNSELING WOULD DEVELOP MORE FAVORABLE ATTITUDES TO STUDY THAN CONTROL SS WAS NOT CONFIRMED. (AUTHOR)",

THE STUDY SOUGHT TO DETERMINE WHICH OF TWO TYPES OF MODEL PRESENTATIONS (FILM OR AUDIOTAPE) WOULD BEST PROMOTE SUBJECT RECALL OF THOSE BEHAVIORS AND SUGGESTIONS WHICH THE SOCIAL MODEL SOUGHT TO PROMOTE. A 16MM SOUND FILM OF A COUNSELING INTERVIEW BETWEEN A BEHAVIORAL COUNSELOR AND A SHY TEN-YEAR-OLD MALE STUDENT WAS SCRIPTED, FILMED, AND EDITED. A TAPE RECORDING OF THE FILM'S SOUND TRACK WAS THE AUDIO MODEL. AFTER INTRODUCING AND PLAYING THE FILM OR AUDIO TAPE, THE COUNSELOR ASKED A TOTAL OF 548 FOURTH, FIFTH, AND SIXTH GRADE CHILDREN TO  RESPOND TO A QUESTIONNAIRE. CONTENT RECALL FOR THE FILM, AS COMPARED WITH THE TAPE, WAS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER FOR GIRLS ONLY. THE PRESENTATION TYPE DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE DEGREE TO WHICH SUBJECTS INDICATED THEY WOULD USE THE MODEL'S SUGGESTIONS FOR SUCH A PROBLEM, OR SUBJECT PERCEPTION OF THE MODEL COUNSELING AS REAL RATHER THAN STAGED. A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF FEMALES IDENTIFIED WITH THE MODEL'S PROBLEM IN THE FILM PRESENTATION.

SCHOOL REDISTRICTING MUST OCCUR ALONG WITH THIS CONVERSION. THERE ARE THREE MAJOR FORCES WHICH WILL PRECIPITATE A REVISION OF SCHOOL DISTRICTING PATTERNS--(1) THE IMPATIENT LAYMAN WHO REFUSES TO FINANCE SMALL SECONDARY AND GRADE SCHOOLS, (2) FEDERAL PROGRAMS WHICH OFFER VARIOUS INCENTIVE PACKAGES, AND (3) TEACHERS AND SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS WHO DESIRE MORE MANAGEABLE JOBS AND MORE HUMANE WORKING CONDITIONS. REDISTRICTING INTO SCHOOL DISTRICTS SERVING 50,000 STUDENTS WOULD RESULT IN A DECREASE  IN THE NUMBER OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN NEW ENGLAND FROM 1,609 TO 48. SOURCES OF SUPPORT FOR REORGANIZATION WILL COME FROM (1) CULTURAL CHANGES, (2) ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY AND THE LEVEL OF CIVILIZATION REQUIRING AN UPDATING OF OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM, AND (3) THE RECOGNITION THAT THE VERY EXISTENCE OF THESE STATES IS IN JEOPARDY.

UNPRODUCTIVE RESEARCHER-ADMINISTRATOR RELATIONSHIPS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY POOR COMMUNICATION, NEGATIVE STEREOTYPES OF ONE ANOTHER HELD BY RESEARCHER AND ADMINISTRATOR, AND DISTRUST AND SUSPICION SUPPORTED BY THE INCONSISTENT NORMS OF EACH ONE'S REFERENCE GROUP. PSYCHOLOGICAL PROCESSES CONTRIBUTING TO THESE DIFFICULTIES IN INTERPERSONAL  RELATIONS INCLUDE SELECTIVE PERCEPTION OF EACH OTHER'S BEHAVIOR, DISTORTIONS OF MEMORY, A TENDENCY TO PLACE LOW VALUE ON EACH OTHER'S WORK, AND THE POSSIBILITY OF COLLABORATION THREATENING THE SELF-CONCEPTS OF BOTH RESEARCHER AND ADMINISTRATOR.

ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ELEVENTH-GRADE STUDENTS COMPLETED A 660-FRAME LINEAR PROGRAM, WORKING EITHER INDIVIDUALLY OR IN A GROUP OF FOUR CLASSMATES HOMOGENEOUS OR HETEROGENEOUS IN ABILITY. GROUPS OF EACH TYPE WORKED UNDER ONE OF THREE CONDITIONS THAT PROVIDED FOR INCREASING DEGREES OF SOCIAL INTERACTION--(1) GROUP PACING, (2) GROUP PACING AND PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE OF RESULTS, AND (3) GROUP PACING,  PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE OF RESULTS, AND GROUP DISCUSSION. DEPENDENT MEASURES INCLUDED ERROR RATE, COMPLETION TIME, IMMEDIATE AND DELAYED CRITERION-TEST SCORES, AND STUDENT ATTITUDE TOWARD THE CONTENT AND METHOD OF INSTRUCTION. THE ONLY OBSERVED DIFFERENTIAL EFFECT OF SOCIAL INTERACTION WAS IN PROGRAM COMPLETION TIME WHICH TENDED TO INCREASE AS THE DEGREE OF INTERACTION INCREASED. LEARNING EFFICIENCY WAS GREATEST FOR STUDENTS WHO WORKED AS INDIVIDUALS. HOMOGENEOUS AND HETEROGENEOUS GROUPS DID NOT DIFFER FROM EACH OTHER ON ANY DEPENDENT MEASURE.

THE STUDY ATTEMPTED TO DESCRIBE (1) PERSONS WHO TALK ABOUT SCHOOLS, (2) THE KINDS OF PERSONS WHO ENGAGE IN DIFFERENT AMOUNTS AND KINDS OF CONVERSATION, (3) RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FLOWS OF INFORMATION AND INFLUENCE, (4) THE DIFFERENT WAYS PEOPLE CARRY ON CONVERSATIONS, AND (5) NETWORKS OF INFORMAL COMMUNICATION THAT EXIST IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS. EACH RESPONDENT WAS SCORED FOR CONVERSATION SCOPE, INITIATIVE, DIRECTION, INFLUENCE, CONDUCT, AND CONTENT. TWO RESPONDENT INTEREST ORIENTATIONS, AS PARENT AND AS CITIZEN, ACCOUNTED FOR  MUCH OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COMMUNICATORS AND NONCOMMUNICATORS. CORRELATED WITH THESE ORIENTATIONS WERE DEMOGRAPHIC, PARTICIPATORY, AND ATTITUDINAL CHARACTERISTICS FOR EACH RESPONDENT. TWO-THIRDS OF THE INFORMAL COMMUNICATORS WERE FOUND TO BE SCHOOL PARENTS, ONE-SIXTH SCHOOL PEOPLE, AND ONE-SIXTH OTHERS (PRESCHOOL PARENTS, PRIVATE SCHOOL PARENTS, POSTSCHOOL PARENTS, AND NONPARENTS). BOTH INFORMATION AND INFLUENCE FLOWS APPEARED TO BE THE SUM OF NUMEROUS INFORMAL SOCIAL ENCOUNTERS, WITH NO COHERENT STRUCTURE OF COMMUNICATION CHANNELS.

PRIMARY CONTENT OF THE COMMUNICATION PROCESS STUDIED WAS FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR SCHOOLS. FOR PURPOSES OF CORRELATIONAL ANALYSIS, RESPONDENTS WERE RELATED POSITIONALLY TO THREE ROLE SETS WITHIN A CONTEXT OF CONSUMER ROLES--(1) PARENTAL STATUS (PRESCHOOL PARENTS, PUBLIC SCHOOL PARENTS, PRIVATE SCHOOL PARENTS, POSTSCHOOL PARENTS, AND NONPARENTS), (2) UTILITY (OPINION OF EDUCATIONAL VALUE RECEIVED IN RETURN FOR TAXES PAID), AND (3) ADULT'S OWN EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE. SIX OUT OF SEVEN CITIZENS INTERVIEWED THOUGHT CHILDREN WERE NOT GETTING ALL THEY SHOULD OUT OF EDUCATION, EITHER FOR  EVENTUAL ECONOMIC BENEFITS OR FOR SOCIAL AND INTELLECTUAL COMPETENCIES. COMMUNICATION BY MEDIATING AGENCIES WAS FOUND TO BE RELATIVELY INEFFECTIVE. NEWSPAPERS WERE MOST SUCCESSFUL, FOLLOWED BY TELEVISION, RADIO, SCHOOL BOARD, PARENT ORGANIZATION, AND CITIZENS' COMMITTEE. WHILE PUBLIC SCHOOL PARENTS PARTICIPATED IN SCHOOL AFFAIRS MORE THAN OTHER PARENTAL STATUS GROUPS, OVERALL CITIZEN PARTICIPATION WAS LOW, THREE OUT OF FOUR RESPONDENTS SAYING NOTHING COULD INCREASE THEIR INTEREST IN SCHOOL MATTERS. ELEVEN SUGGESTIONS ARE MADE FOR INCREASING COMMUNICATION EFFECTIVENESS IN SECURING PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION, WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON FORMALITY, CONTENT, AND TIMING.

TEN PERSONS HOLDING KEY ROLES WERE QUESTIONED IN EACH DISTRICT--SUPERINTENDENT, BOARD PRESIDENT, FOUR OTHER BOARD MEMBERS, TEACHER REPRESENTATIVE, PARENT REPRESENTATIVE, MASS MEDIA REPRESENTATIVE, AND AN INTERESTED CITIZEN. FACTOR ANALYSES OF QUESTIONNAIRE RESPONSES, CENSUS DATA (1940, 1950, AND 1960), AND SCHOOL RECORDS IDENTIFIED 256 VARIABLES AS SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO ONE OR MORE OF THE FOUR CRITERION VARIABLES.

PART I ANALYZES A WIDE RANGE OF FISCAL AND NON-FISCAL VARIABLES ASSOCIATED WITH FISCAL STATUS OF CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. IT COVERS THE 2,788 CITY SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE UNITED STATES WITH ENROLLMENTS OVER 3,000. COMPLEX INTERRELATIONSHIPS SURROUNDING FISCAL STATUS IN COMMUNITY AND GOVERNMENTAL RELATIONSHIPS ARE IDENTIFIED. THE STUDY ALSO IDENTIFIES APPROPRIATE COMBINATIONS OF POLITICAL AND FISCAL CONTROLS FOR DISTRICTS OF VARYING SIZE. THE COMBINATION OF FISCAL INDEPENDENCE, PUBLIC VOTE, AND SCHOOL BOARD ELECTIONS IS FOUND TO BE FAVORABLE FOR ADEQUATE FINANCING. PART II PROBES INTENSIVELY INTO THE FISCAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE OPERATIONS OF SIX LARGE CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS (BALTIMORE, CHICAGO, DETROIT, NEW  YORK, PHILADELPHIA, AND ST. LOUIS) TO IDENTIFY THE CONDITIONING ROLE OF FISCAL STATUS AND TO DEVELOP A DESIGN FOR FURTHER RESEARCH. IT ALSO MEASURES THE OUTPUTS OF INNOVATION AND FLEXIBILITY AS REFLECTIVE OF THE ABILITY OF A SCHOOL SYSTEM TO RESPOND TO CHANGING NEEDS. SERIOUS DOUBTS OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF FISCAL STATUS AS A DETERMINATIVE FACTOR FOR LARGE SYSTEMS ARISE FROM THIS STUDY, AND SUGGESTIONS ARE MADE FOR AN APPROACH TO FURTHER RESEARCH USING INNOVATION AS AN OUTPUT IN A MODEL WITH ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGE, COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION, AND FISCAL RESOURCES AS INPUTS.

ITEMS WERE GROUPED INTO 10 SCALES--PERSUASIVE, CLERICAL, MECHANICAL, SCIENTIFIC, OUTDOOR, LITERARY, COMPUTATIONAL, ARTISTIC, SOCIAL SERVICE, AND DRAMATIC. SUBJECTS WERE DEAF MALES AGED 16 OR OVER AND WITH IQ SCORES ABOVE 85 DRAWN FROM RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS FOR THE DEAF, BUREAUS OF VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION, PUBLIC SCHOOLS, GALLAUDET COLLEGE, AND THE EMPLOYED DEAF. AFTER 3 1/2 MONTHS, TESTS WERE READMINISTERED TO 1659 OF THE ORIGINAL 2590 SUBJECTS. RAW SCORES WERE CONVERTED TO STANDARD SCORES. INSPECTION SHOWED STABILITY OF MEANS ACROSS THE RANGE OF AGES INVOLVED. TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY COEFFICIENTS FOR FOUR OF THE  SUBJECT GROUPS (EXCEPTING THE EMPLOYED) FOR EACH OF THE 10 SCALES WERE MADE. MEDIAN RELIABILITY COEFFICIENTS WERE .571 FOR RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS, .602 FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS, .649 FOR BUREAUS OF VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION, AND .733 FOR GALLAUDET COLLEGE. TO DETERMINE VALIDITY, SCALE SCORES OF THE GALLAUDET SAMPLE WERE CORRELATED WITH CORRESPONDING SCALES OF KUDER PREFERENCE RECORD. THE PRODUCT MOMENT COEFFICIENTS RANGED FROM .259 TO .612 WITH A MEDIAN OF .417. AS ANOTHER MEASURE OF VALIDITY, THE TEST WAS ADMINISTERED TO A SAMPLE OF EMPLOYED DEAF IN 22 OCCUPATIONS. MEANS AND STANDARD DEVIATIONS ON EACH SCALE FOR THE 22 OCCUPATIONS WERE DERIVED. ALTHOUGH THE SCALES DID TEND TO DISCRIMINATE AMONG THE OCCUPATIONAL GROUPS, SOME SCALES DID NOT DISCRIMINATE IN THE EXPECTED DIRECTION. INTERCORRELATIONS  WERE COMPUTED AMONG THE 10 SCALES ON THE SAMPLE GROUPS. A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF OVERLAP IN WHAT IS MEASURED BY EACH SCALE WAS NOTED. RELIABILITY OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SEPARATE SCALES YIELDS A RANGE OF .00 TO .79 WITH AN AVERAGE OF .56. NORMS IN T SCORE TERMS ARE GIVEN FOR ALL GRADES IN THE RESIDENTIAL AND PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND FOR 15 OCCUPATIONAL GROUPS. TO DETERMINE THE CORRECTNESS OF PLACING ITEMS IN SCALES, A BISERIAL CORRELATION BETWEEN EACH ITEM ALTERNATIVE AND EACH OF THE 10 SCALE SCORES WAS COMPUTED. NECESSARY STEPS TO MAKE THE TEST READY FOR OPERATIONAL USE ARE DESCRIBED. (FL)",

THEY WERE IN THEIR MIDDLE FIFTIES AT THE TIME OF THIS STUDY. EACH SUBJECT WAS INTERVIEWED OR RESPONDED TO A LIFE HISTORY QUESTIONNAIRE. SOCIAL STATUS WAS EVALUATED. A SAMPLE WERE GIVEN INTELLIGENCE TESTS. RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE MENTALLY RETARDED GROUP HAD A HIGHER DEATH RATE THAN THE OTHER TWO GROUPS. THE MENTALLY RETARDED GROUP MEMBERS WERE MORE LIKELY TO LIVE ALONE AND ALSO HAD A HIGHER DIVORCE RATE. ALTHOUGH THE MENTALLY RETARDED GROUP HAD SHOWN STEADY IMPROVEMENT IN SELF  SUPPORT OVER THE YEARS, THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WAS STILL ABOVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. ALL GROUPS WERE GENERALLY LAW ABIDING. THOSE SUBJECTS IN THE MENTALLY RETARDED GROUP TENDED NOT TO PARTICIPATE AS MUCH SOCIALLY AS SUBJECTS IN THE OTHER TWO GROUPS. NO SIGNIFICANT GAINS IN INTELLIGENCE HAD BEEN MADE BY ANY GROUP.

THE PROJECTS IN BALTIMORE AND SAN DIEGO PROVIDED INSERVICE SEMINARS FOR MUSIC TEACHERS ALONG WITH PILOT CLASSES IN DIFFERENT TYPES OF SCHOOLS. OBJECTIVES OF THESE TWO PROJECTS WERE PRESENTATION OF CONTEMPORARY MUSIC TO CHILDREN THROUGH SUITABLE APPROACHES, EXPERIMENTATION WITH CREATIVE MUSIC EXPERIENCES FOR CHILDREN, IDENTIFICATION OF CONTEMPORARY MUSIC APPROPRIATE AT SEVERAL GRADE LEVELS, PROVISION THROUGH CONTEMPORARY MUSIC OF NEW MEANS OF CREATIVE EXPERIENCING, AND INSERVICE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS. THE PILOT PROJECT IN FARMINGDALE WAS DESIGNED TO DEMONSTRATE TWO TYPES OF CREATIVE TEACHING--EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES IN MUSIC  COMPOSITION USING 20TH CENTURY IDIOMS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF MUSICAL RESOURCES THROUGH RHYTHMICS, SINGING, IMPROVISATION, AND COMPOSITION. THE INTEREST AND MOTIVATION WHICH RESULTED ON THE PART OF TEACHERS AND PUPILS WERE VIEWED AS SUPPORTING THE PREMISE THAT CHILDREN ARE RECEPTIVE TO CONTEMPORARY MUSIC AND ARE CAPABLE OF EMPLOYING CONTEMPORARY TECHNIQUES IN CREATIVE ACTIVITIES.

A TOTAL OF 4,227 STUDENTS FROM KINDERGARTEN THROUGH GRADE 12 WERE SCREENED IN THE FALL OF 1966. PERCENTAGES REFERRED BY EACH OF THE METHODS RESPECTIVELY WERE 7.2 PERCENT, 6.7 PERCENT, 8.5 PERCENT, AND 11.2 PERCENT. A SERIES OF TABLES INDICATES NUMBERS OF REFERRALS BY GRADE LEVELS. OF THE REFERRALS WHO WERE SEEN BY EYE SPECIALISTS THE OVER-REFERRALS (FALSE POSITIVE) RESPECITVELY WERE 4 PERCENT, 6.7 PERCENT, 3.8 PERCENT, AND  2.2 PERCENT. AMONG THE CONCLUSIONS WERE THE FOLLOWING--(1) NO METHOD IS CLEARLY SUPERIOR TO THE OTHERS, (2) EACH METHOD APPEARS CONSERVATIVE IN DISCLOSING NUMBERS IN NEED OF EYE CARE, (3) THE MAJORITY OF REFERRALS WERE BETWEEN THRID GRADE AND NINTH GRADE, (4) HIGH PERCENTAGES OF REFERRALS RECEIVE PROFESSIONAL EXAMINATION INDICATIVE OF A GOOD FOLLOWUP PROGRAMS, (5) THE SNELLEN CHART, A PART OF EVERY SCREENING METHOD USED, REFERRED A MAJORITY OF STUDENTS RECEIVING REFERRALS.

A CONTROL GROUP WAS OBTAINED FROM THE INDIANA SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF MATCHING FACTORS SUCH AS AGE, SEX, ACHIEVEMENT, AND IQ WITH AN EXPERIMENTAL GROUP FROM THE ILLINOIS SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF. THE K-12 SEX EDUCATION CURRICULUM WAS PRESENTED TO THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP. FILMS AND EXISTING MATERIALS WERE ADAPTED FOR USE WITH THE DEAF WHENEVER POSSIBLE. CLASSES WERE MIXED RATHER THAN SEPARATED BY SEX. THE CLASS ON THE ELEMENTARY LEVEL (AGES 6-11) FOCUSED ON FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS AND GROWTH PATTERNS, THE ADOLESCENT CLASS (AGES 12 TO 15) DEALT WITH THE  CONCEPTS OF ENTERING ADOLESCENCE AND BECOMING ADULT, AND THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL (AGES 16 TO 18) FOCUSED ON PREPARATION FOR AND ACCEPTANCE INTO ADULT SOCIETY. A PRETEST AND A POST-TEST WERE GIVEN. THE ADOLESCENT AND HIGH SCHOOL TEST WAS DESIGNED TO MEASURE INFORMATION AND ATTITUDES COVERED IN THE MATERIALS DEVELOPED IN THE SOCIAL AND PERSONAL HYGIENE CURRICULUM GUIDES. THE TEST FOR THE ELEMENTARY GROUPS WAS DESIGNED AS A NONVERBAL PICTORIAL TEST. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP OF ADOLESCENTS AND THE EXPERIMENTAL HIGH SCHOOL AGE GROUP SOCRED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER (.01 LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE) ON THE POST-TEST THAN THE CONTROL GROUP. TESTING MATERIAL MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE LACK OF SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE ON THE ELEMENTARY LEVEL. THE MATERIALS AND CURRICULUM WERE EVALUATED AND REVISED FOR GENERAL  DISTRIBUTION BY A STUDY GROUP AFTER THE EXPERIMENT. THE RESULTS OF THE EXPERIMENT WERE ALSO DISSEMINATED IN A SERIES OF WORKSHOPS.

INDIAN ARRESTS FOR ALCOHOL-CONNECTED CRIMES WERE NEARLY THIRTY-SEVEN TIMES AS GREAT AS WHITES, AND NEARLY FIFTEEN TIMES GREATER THAN COMPARABLE RATES FOR NEGROES. THE AUTHOR QUESTIONS WHETHER GROSS STATISTICS GIVE AN ACCURATE PICTURE OF THE AMOUNT OF INDIAN CRIMINALITY AND SUGGESTS AN INTENSIVE ANALYSIS OF LOCAL CONDITIONS WHICH MIGHT IDENTIFY FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO INDIAN DELINQUENCY. THE LAWS, AND THEIR RECENT CHANGES, CONCERNING ALCOHOL AND INDIANS ARE DISCUSSED. INCLUDED ARE CHARTS COMPARING ARREST STATISTICS TO AGE, TRIBE, SEX, TYPES OF CRIMES, RACES, AND ETHNIC GROUPS. (JH)",

THE EXTENDED PATRIARCHAL FAMILY WAS THE PRIMARY SOCIAL SYSTEM AMONG THE SPANISH AMERICANS, OFTEN CONSISTING OF MEMBERS OF THREE OR FOUR GENERATIONS HEADED BY THE GRANDFATHER. THIS FAMILY COOPERATED AS A SINGLE, TIGHTLY KNIT, POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL UNIT. DOMINANCE AND AUTHORITY WERE RELATED TO SEX AND AGE -THE MALES WERE DOMINANT OVER FEMALES AND THE OLDER MEMBERS HAD AUTHORITY OVER THE YOUNGER FAMILY MEMBERS. THE PRESSURES OF URBANIZATION, INDUSTRIALIZATION, AND LAND LOSSES HAVE BROKEN THIS TRADITIONAL FAMILY PATTERN IN ALL BUT THE MOST REMOTE VILLAGES. THE ADJUSTMENT OF THE LOWER-CLASS SPANISH AMERICAN FAMILY TO URBAN  LIVING DEPENDS UPON THE HUSBAND'S SALARY. IF IT IS NOT ADEQUATE, THE WIFE MUST SEEK EMPLOYMENT, THUS STRENGTHENING HER ROLE AND DIMINISHING THE HUSBAND'S ROLE. THE MORE EDUCATED AND ACCULTURATED SPANISH AMERICAN FAMILIES TEND TO EMULATE THE NUCLEAR FAMILY MODEL OF THE ANGLO AMERICAN. (SF)",

ABOUT 150 MIGRANT PARENTS WERE INTERVIEWED TO OBTAIN A SAMPLING OF THEIR CONCERNS FOR THE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS OF THEIR CHILDREN. TABLES ARE INCLUDED WHICH SHOW  THE NUMBER OF MIGRANT CHILDREN IN EACH DISTRICT, THE NUMBER OF MIGRANTS EARNING LESS AND MORE THAN $3,000 PER YEAR, AND AN AGE BREAKDOWN OF MIGRANTS. SEVERAL GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC AGENCIES ARE OFFERING ASSISTANCE TO MIGRANTS IN THE COUNTY. RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDED--(1) PRE-SCHOOL PROGRAMS SHOULD BE EXPANDED, (2) ENGLISH AND SPANISH LANGUAGE PROGRAMS SHOULD BE CONTINUED FOR MIGRANTS, (3) A PRACTICAL VOCATIONAL CORE PROGRAM FOR MIGRANTS, (4) COUNSELING SERVICES SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR MIGRANT STUDENTS, AND (5) SOME PROVISIONS SHOULD BE MADE FOR MEDICAL, DENTAL AND NUTRITIONAL NEEDS OF MIGRANT YOUNGSTERS.

THE FOLLOWING TESTS WERE ADMINISTERED DURING THE 3-YEAR PERIOD--THE CALIFORNIA TEST OF MENTAL MATURITY, THE CALIFORNIA TEST OF PERSONALITY, THE BOTEL WORD RECOGNITION INVENTORY, THE STANFORD  ACHIEVEMENT TEST, THE PINTNER-CUNNINGHAM PRIMARY TEST, AND THE DURRELL-MURPHY DIAGNOSTIC READING READINESS TEST.

        "description":"A READING AND STUDY SKILLS PROGRAM INITIATED IN SEPTEMBER, 1959, IN THE CENTINELA VALLEY UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT IN SOUTHWEST LOS ANGELES IS DESCRIBED. THE DISTRICT IS COMPOSED OF FOUR HIGH SCHOOLS WITH A TOTAL ENROLLMENT OF APPROXIMATELY 6,000 STUDENTS. PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM IS REQUIRED AND IS CONCENTRATED IN THE FRESHMAN ENGLISH CLASSES. THE PROGRAM BEGINS WITH A PERIOD OF MOTIVATION AND ORIENTATION WHICH INCLUDES A PHYSICAL CHECKUP BY THE SCHOOL NURSE. IT CONTINUES WITH AN 8-WEEK PROGRAM OF CONCENTRATED SKILL BUILDING IN THE READING LABORATORY AND CONCLUDES WITH A FOLLOWUP PHASE IN WHICH STUDENTS CONTINUE TO USE AND DEVELOP THEIR SKILLS. FOR THE UPPER GRADES, EACH SCHOOL HAS ITS OWN PROGRAM WHICH REINFORCES THE FRESHMAN COURSE AND MEETS SPECIFIC STUDENT NEEDS. SIX  SPECIALISTS WERE HIRED TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM--FOUR READING LABORATORY TEACHERS AND TWO READING COORDINATORS WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SETTING UP THE READING PROGRAM, DEVELOPING THE COURSE OF STUDY, SELECTING AND ORDERING THE MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT, SETTING UP THE LABORATORIES, AND TRAINING NEW TEACHERS. THE PHYSICAL EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS USED IN THE READING LABORATORIES ARE DESCRIBED. THE NELSON SILENT READING TEST WAS USED IN A TEST-RETEST DESIGN TO MEASURE PROGRESS, AND STUDENTS SHOWED APPRECIABLE IMPROVEMENT IN READING AND SELF-CONFIDENCE.

THE FUNCTIONS OF THE UNITED STATES OFFICE OF EDUCATION, RELATIVE TO ALCOHOL EDUCATION, AND THE POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE 1965 ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ACT TO INNOVATIVE HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAMS ARE DISCUSSED. CHANGES IN THE SOCIAL STRUCTURE OF THE UNITED STATES, PREVAILING ATTITUDES AND BELIEFS CONCERNING ALCOHOL, AND THE CORRESPONDING DEVELOPMENT OF ALCOHOL EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN THE SCHOOLS ARE REVIEWED. DATA OBTAINED FROM STUDIES INVOLVING (1) 8,000 MALE AND FEMALE JUNIOR AND SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS, (2) 20,000 INHABITANTS OF AN EASTERN UNITED STATES COMMUNITY, AND (3) PREVIOUS RESEARCH ON ALCOHOL EDUCATION ARE REVIEWED. IMPLICATIONS FOR EXISTING APPROACHES TO HEALTH EDUCATION ARE  IDENTIFIED. SUGGESTIONS FOR (1) THE APPLICATION OF ESTABLISHED THEORIES OF LEARNING TO PROGRAMS FOR ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND (2) THE MODIFICATION OF TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS TO INCLUDE PREPARATION FOR THE TEACHING OF ALCOHOL EDUCATION ARE MADE. IN A SERIES OF PAPERS FROM A PANEL DISCUSSION THE PROBLEM OF ALCOHOL EDUCATION IS CONSIDERED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE TEACHER, THE ADMINISTRATOR, AND THE HEALTH EDUCATOR.

THE NATIONAL SCHOLARSHIP SERVICE AND FUND FOR NEGRO STUDENTS (NSSFNS), IN A SHORT-TERM APPROACH TO THIS PROBLEM, ADVISES HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS ABOUT ADMISSION AND SCHOLARSHIP OPPORTUNITIES IN INTEGRATED COLLEGES. WITHIN A 14-YEAR PERIOD, NSSFNS HAS HELPED 8500 STUDENTS ENROLL IN 350 ACCREDITED 4-YEAR COLLEGES, WITH OVER $3,700,000 IN SCHOLARSHIPS. DESPITE RELATIVELY LOW NATIONAL APTITUDE AND ACHIEVEMENT TEST SCORES, THESE STUDENTS HAD SUCCESSFUL COLLEGE CAREERS, AND ACHIEVED CONSISTENTLY BEYOND THE LEVEL PREDICTED FOR THEM. THE LONG-TERM APPROACH INITIATED BY  NSSFNS ENCOURAGES SCHOOL PERSONNEL TO IDENTIFY AND MOTIVATE TALENTED DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS EARLIER THAN THE 12TH GRADE. IN THIS CONNECTION, THE NEW YORK CITY BOARD OF EDUCATION SUCCESSFULLY ESTABLISHED A 6-YEAR DEMONSTRATION GUIDANCE PROJECT IN JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL 43 AND GEORGE WASHINGTON HIGH SCHOOL. MORE STUDENTS IN THE PROJECT ENROLLED IN COLLEGE THAN NON-PROJECT STUDENTS FROM THE SAME SCHOOL, AND MOST OF THE EARLY PROJECT GRADUATES CONTINUED THEIR EDUCATION BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL IN SOME FORM. OTHER PROJECTS HAVE GROWN OUT OF THE ORIGINAL DEMONSTRATION PROJECT, BUT THEIR EFFECTIVENESS DEPENDS ON THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS, THE SCHOOL'S INITIAL SUCCESS IN IDENTIFYING THE ABLE STUDENT, AND ON INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP GUIDANCE TO CHANGE BOTH THE STUDENT'S NEGATIVE SELF-IMAGE AND THE PARENT'S  ATTITUDES.

CURRICULUMS WERE CREATED FOR EACH STUDENT ON THE BASIS OF HIS SCORE ON A PRETEST. TO RECEIVE THE EXTRINSIC REINFORCEMENTS (GOODS OR SOCIAL REINFORCERS), WHICH WERE AVAILABLE ONLY THROUGH POINTS EARNED BY ACADEMIC SUCCESS, EACH STUDENT WAS REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE A 90 PERCENT CORRECT GRADE ON AN INSTRUCTIONAL UNIT. THESE POINTS WERE CONVERTIBLE INTO MERCHANDISE, ADMISSION TO THE LOUNGE, AND PRIVATE STUDENT OFFICES. EACH STUDENT'S EDUCATIONAL BEHAVIOR WAS CONTINUALLY MEASURED TO EVALUATE THE  EFFICACY OF THE PROGRAM'S PROCEDURES AND TO INDICATE TO THE STUDENT HIS OWN PROGRESS. FROM THIS INFORMATION LEARNING CAN BE TRANSLATED INTO THE DISCRETE BEHAVIORS WHICH CONSTITUTE IT, AND PROCEDURES CAN BE DEVELOPED TO ELICIT A CERTAIN BEHAVIOR TO INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT OTHER SIMILAR BEHAVIORS WILL OCCUR AND THAT LEARNING IN GENERAL WILL BE MAINTAINED.

IN GENERAL WITHIN THE PAST TWO DECADES THERE HAS BEEN A CONSISTENT SHIFT IN BOTH THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH TOWARD AN ACCEPTANCE OF EQUAL RIGHTS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE OPINION RESEARCH DATA SHOW A REVOLUTIONARY ATTITUDE CHANGE IN FEELINGS ABOUT SCHOOL INTEGRATION, THE BASIC AND RIGHTS ISSUE. FURTHERMORE, IN THOSE SOUTHERN AREAS WHERE THERE IS SCHOOL INTEGRATION, MORE WHITES ACCEPT IT, AND EVEN IN THE &quot;HARD-CORE&quot; AREAS WHITE APPROVAL HAS RISEN FROM 4 TO 28  PERCENT. WHILE MOST WHITES DO NOT SEEM TO &quot;EAGERLY&quot; ACCEPT INTEGRATION, AND WOULD PREFER THAT DESEGREGATION PROCEED MORE GRADUALLY, THEY DO RECOGNIZE THAT RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IS AMORAL AND THAT THE NEGRO PROTEST IS LEGITIMATE. THE PROTEST MOVEMENT HAS NOT HAD A BACKLASH EFFECT (BASED ON THE EVIDENCE THAT PRESIDENT JOHNSON CARRIED THE SOUTH IN 1964 DESPITE HIS CLEARLY STATED POSITION ON CIVIL RIGHTS), NOR HAS IT INTENSIFIED SEGREGATIONIST ATTITUDES.

ADVOCATES OF THE \"NORMALIZING\" PERSPECTIVE MAINTAIN THAT THE POOR, GIVEN A CHANCE, ARE LIKE \"ORDINARY\" PEOPLE, AND STRESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE POOR RATHER THAN ALTERATIONS IN THE DOMINANT SOCIAL STRUCTURE. BECAUSE THESE DIAGONSES OF POVERTY CAN AFFECT SOCIAL AND POLITICAL POLICIES THEY SHOULD BE MORE PHENOMENOLOGICALLY VALID BEFORE THEY ARE ACTED UPON. (LB)",

OTHER MEASURES OF COGNITION ALSO WERE USED. TOLERANCE FOR DELAY OF GRATIFICATION WAS MEASURED BY THE CHILD'S DECISION TO RECEIVE A PACK OF CANDY AND A TOY ON THE DAY OF TESTING OR TO RECEIVE TWICE THE NUMBER OF ITEMS ON THE FOLLOWING DAY. THE SUBJECTS IN THE FIRST EXPERIMENT, KINDERGARTEN AND FIRST-GRADE BOYS, WERE DIVIDED INTO THREE SUBGROUPS--WHITE MIDDLE-CLASS, DISADVANTAGED NEGRO, AND JEWISH PAROCHIAL SCHOOL BOYS. THE SUBJECTS IN THE SECOND EXPERIMENT WERE A MORE CULTURALLY HOMOGENEOUS GROUP OF FIRST-GRADE PUBLIC SCHOOL BOYS. ANALYSIS OF THE DATA SHOWED THE CORRELATION BETWEEN TOLERANCE FOR DELAY AND VARIOUS MEASURES  OF COGNITIVE FUNCTIONING TO BE POSITIVE BUT LOW, WITH THE MOST CONSISTENT RELATIONSHIP EXISTING BETWEEN CONSERVATION OF NUMBERS AND PICTURES AMONG THE FIRST-GRADE BOYS. THE CORRELATION BETWEEN TOLERANCE FOR DELAY AND CONSERVATION WAS GREATER THAN THAT FOR OTHER FORMS OF COGNITION PERFORMANCE. THIS SUGGESTS A MORE FUNCTIONALLY RELATED BOND BETWEEN THIS RELATIONSHIP THAN COULD BE ATTRIBUTED MERELY TO MATURATION. COMPOSITE TOLERANCE FOR DELAY SCORES VARIED SHARPLY WITH GROUP MEMBERSHIP. FIFTY PERCENT OF THE JEWISH BOYS CHOSE TO DELAY RECEIVING THE PRIZE, WHEREAS ONLY 20 PERCENT OF THE DISADVANTAGED NEGRO BOYS MADE THE SAME CHOICE. ALTHOUGH A BOY'S EARLY MODES OF IMPULSE CONTROL, AND CONTINGENCIES ASSOCIATED WITH HAVING TO SHARE A PRIZE WITH A SIBLING ARE FACTORS WHICH COULD EXPLAIN HIS  TOLERANCE FOR DELAY, HIS TRUST IN THOSE PROMISING HIM THE PRIZE ALSO MUST BE CONSIDERED IN HIS DECISION TO DELAY GRATIFICATION AS IT IS A DETERMINANT IN THE RELATIONSHIP OF DELAY BEHAVIOR TO COGNITIVE FUNCTIONING.

THE RESULTS OF 11 FACTOR ANALYSES INDICATED THAT BOTH OF THESE REQUIREMENTS WERE MET, AND THEREFORE THE NUMBERS OF THE FIRST FACTOR OF THE TOTAL GROUP COULD BE EMPLOYED AS &quot;WEIGHTS&quot; TO MULTIPLY EACH INDIVIDUAL'S SCORE ON EACH OF THE FIVE MEASURES FROM THE COLEMAN STUDY SO THAT THEY MIGHT BE COMBINED (ADDED) TO FORM ONE INDEX OF ACHIEVEMENT SCORE.

THE HEALTH FACTORS WHICH THESE STUDIES FOUND TO RELATE SPECIFICALLY TO INTELLECTUAL AND EDUCATIONAL DEFICITS ARE PREMATURITY, OBSTETRICAL AND PERINATAL COMPLICATIONS, BIRTH WEIGHT, MATERNAL PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND NUTRITION, AND PRENATAL CARE. THEY ALSO SHOW THAT, A SYSTEMATIC RELATIONSHIP EXISTS AFTER BIRTH BETWEEN A CHILD'S NUTRITIONAL INADEQUACY AND BOTH NEUROLOGICAL MATURATION AND LEARNING COMPETENCY. ALTHOUGH SEVERE MALNUTRITION IN THE UNITED STATES IS RARE, SUBCLINICAL MALNUTRITION AMONG LOW-INCOME GROUPS (PARTICULARLY IRON DEFICIENCY) MAY BE A FACTOR  IN THEIR HIGHER CHILDHOOD MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY RATES, AS WELL AS IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN NEGROES AND WHITES. MALNUTRITION AND MALDEVELOPMENT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE DISADVANTAGED CHILD'S NERVOUS SYSTEM AND, THEREFORE, HIS LEARNING POTENTIAL. SUCH IMPAIRMENT IS A PRIMARY HANDICAP WHICH CAN BE ONLY PARTLY REMEDIATED BECAUSE THE EFFECTS OF A BIOSOCIAL PATHOLOGY CAUSE DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN TO SUFFER FROM LOST LEARNING TIME, NUTRITIONAL DEFICIT DURING CRITICAL LEARNING PERIODS, AND ADVERSE MOTIVATION AND PERSONALITY CHANGES.

THE NEW MODELS OF UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION ARE SEEKING TO CREATE, EVEN ON THE LARGEST CAMPUSES, RELATIVELY SMALL PRIMARY GROUPS CONSISTING OF FACULTY MEMBERS AND STUDENTS WHO DEVELOP CLOSE TIES AND WHO CARE ABOUT ONE ANOTHER. THE NEW MODELS HAVE LIBERATED THEMSELVES FROM THE BREADTH-DEPTH CONTROVERSY BY DISCOVERING NEW PRINCIPLES OF UNITY IN UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS. THE NEW MODELS ARE TRYING TO BREAK DOWN THE CLASSROOM WALLS AND UNITE BOOKS WITH DIRECT EXPERIENCE TO BUILD A NEW KIND OF CURRICULAR STRUCTURE. THE NEW MODELS ARE  ATTEMPTING TO REDEFINE TEACHING AND LEARNING. THEY ASK THE PROFESSOR TO BE, AND ACT LIKE, A LEARNER, ARGUING THAT THIS IS A WAY OF BECOMING A BETTER TEACHER. ALSO THEY ASK THE LEARNER TO PARTICIPATE IN TEACHING, ARGUING THAT THIS IS A WAY OF BECOMING A BETTER STUDENT. THE NEW CURRICULAR MODELS ARE DISSATISFIED WITH THE OLD GRADE AND CREDIT STRUCTURE IN ALL OF ITS ASPECTS. THE AUTHOR STATES THAT AFTER THE NEW MODELS HAVE PASSED THROUGH THEIR INITIAL STAGE OF USE, THEIR FORMULATORS AND USERS WILL FIND THE TASK OF REFINING AND CORRECTING THEM DIFFICULT AND PERHAPS IMPOSSIBLE.

AMONG THE STUDENTS SAMPLED THERE WAS A GENERALLY LOW ACHIEVEMENT ON LISTENING AND SPEAKING  SKILLS. THERE WAS EVIDENCE THAT TIME SPENT ABROAD HAS A POTENT EFFECT ON A STUDENT'S LANGUAGE SKILLS, THAT STUDENTS OF SPANISH OR FRENCH WHO STARTED THE LANGUAGE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND CONTINUED IT TENDED TO HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OVER OTHER MAJORS, THAT THOSE FROM HOMES WHERE FOREIGN LANGUAGE WAS SPOKEN ATTAINED GREATER COMPETENCE, AND THAT MANY LOW-APTITUDE STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO COMPENSATE BY DILIGENT STUDY AND PRACTICE OR BECAUSE OF SPECIAL OPPORTUNITIES SUCH AS STUDY ABROAD.

        "description":"THE LITERATURE ON HIGHER EDUCATION WAS SURVEYED TO EVALUATE (1) THE ACCESS OF DISADVANTAGED YOUTH TO HIGHER EDUCATION, AND (2) THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN MEETING THE NEEDS OF DISADVANTAGED YOUTH. THE FINDINGS FROM THE LITERATURE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED UNDER FIVE HEADINGS--(1) CIVIL RIGHTS AND ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION, (2) PROGRAMS AND PRACTICES IN HIGHER EDUCATION FOR THE DISADVANTAGED, (3) CHARACTERISTICS OF DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS IN HIGHER EDUCATION, (4) SPECIAL ADMISSIONS AND GUIDANCE PROCEDURES, AND (5) THE NEGRO COLLEGE. AN ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY DIVIDED UNDER THE SAME HEADINGS IS INCLUDED. IN A SUMMARY, THE AUTHOR POINTS OUT THAT CONCERN FOR COMPENSATORY EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS HAS GROWN IN THE PAST 2 OR 3 YEARS, BUT ONLY A SMALL PROPORTION OF COLLEGES AND  UNIVERSITIES HAVE STARTED DEVELOPMENT OF COMPENSATORY PROGRAMS. THOSE PROGRAMS THAT EXIST ARE PRINCIPALLY FOR NEGROES, SERVE VERY SMALL NUMBERS OF DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS, AND HAVE SCARCELY TOUCHED THE RURAL WHITE YOUTH. SEVERAL FOUNDATIONS HAVE MADE IMPRESSIVE FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS, BUT EFFORTS TO ATTRACT THE DISADVANTAGED TO COLLEGE COLLIDE WITH TRENDS TOWARD HIGHER ADMISSION STANDARDS. PRECOLLEGE PREPARATORY PROGRAMS WERE JUDGED TO BE AN IMPORTANT, ALTERNATE APPROACH THAT SHOULD BE EXTENDED. ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT TREND IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROGRAMS AT THE JUNIOR COLLEGE LEVEL. THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THAT (1) SYSTEMATIC ATTENTION MUST BE GIVEN TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF MEANS FOR MODIFYING THE ATTITUDES AND LEARNING PATTERNS OF THOSE WHO ARE INEFFICIENT LEARNERS AND (2) SOME ALTERNATIVE FOR  REMEDIAL READING IS NEEDED TO AID THESE STUDENTS IN LEARNING TO ACQUIRE AND PROCESS INFORMATION.

INTERDISCIPLINARY CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT WAS SEEN AS CAUSING SEPARATE DISCIPLINES TO VANISH AND AS CAUSING A SHIFT FROM LECTURE  TEACHING TO INDIVIDUAL STUDY WHICH, IN TURN, HAS INDUCED A SEQUENCE OF CHANGE IN THE ROLES OF BOTH TEACHERS AND LIBRARIES. THE AUTHOR REPORTED EXPERIMENTS THAT WOULD MAKE LIBRARIES THE CENTER OF THE COLLEGE, CAUSE THE LIBRARIES TO ASSUME THE ROLES OF BOTH LIBRARIAN AND PROFESSORS, AND SEND THE TEACHERS BACK FROM RESEARCH TO INDIVIDUALIZED TEACHING.

THE AUTHOR SUGGESTS A DEFINITION OF ACTIVISM IN TERMS OF THE ATTITUDES OF THE STUDENTS WHO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE MOVEMENT. THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ACTIVISTS WERE EASILY IDENTIFIED FROM RESEARCH CONDUCTED BY SOCIOLOGISTS WHO WERE PRESENT AT BERKELEY AS THE EVENTS WERE HAPPENING. THESE STUDENTS WERE FOUND TO HAVE HIGH ACADEMIC APTITUDE, WERE GOOD ACADEMIC PERFORMERS, AND INTELLECTUALLY WERE HIGHLY MOTIVATED. THE CAUSES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE  MOVEMENT WERE MORE DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY. THE AUTHOR SUGGESTS THAT THE INTELLECTUAL POVERTY IN THEIR PROSPEROUS HOMES PROVIDED MATERIAL FOR PROTEST IN ADDITION TO THE CHALLENGES PRESENTED BY THE SCHOOLS. SOME STUDENTS HAD RECEIVED TRAINING IN ORGANIZATION AND COLLECTIVE ACTION IN THE DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. THEY FOUND CAUSE FOR ACTION IN STEADILY INCREASED DEMANDS FOR HIGHER ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE, LACK OF MEANING IN CURRICULAR CONTENT, DISSATISFACTION WITH THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CLIMATE, DISSATISFACTION WITH THE RESTRICTIONS ON STUDENT LIVING ARRANGEMENTS, AND A NEED FOR BETTER LEGAL DEFINITION OF STUDENT RELATIONSHIP TO THE UNIVERSITY. SOME OTHER FORCES THAT APPEARED TO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO ACTIVE PROTEST WERE ALSO DISCUSSED.

EDUCATION FOR INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT WAS DESCRIBED AS A PROGRAM CONSCIOUSLY UNDERTAKEN TO PROMOTE AN IDENTITY BASED ON SUCH QUALITIES AS FLEXIBILITY, CREATIVENESS, OPENNESS TO EXPERIENCE, AND RESPONSIBILITY. EARLIER CONCEPTS OF THE PROPER ROLE OF EDUCATION WERE CITED FROM LITERATURE TO SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT THE PURPOSE OF EDUCATION SHOULD BE THE MOLDING OF MEN RATHER THAN THE PRODUCTION OF KNOWLEDGE OR THE COMPLETION OF UNITS. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT THE PLANNING OF A TOTAL EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT MUST BE GUIDED BY A THEORY OF THE TOTAL PERSONALITY AS WELL AS BY SOCIAL THEORY. PERSONALITY  THEORY WAS SEEN AS A MEANS OF CONNECTING WHAT HAPPENS IN STUDENT ACTIVITIES WITH WHAT HAPPENS IN THE CLASSROOM. IT WAS EXPECTED TO INDICATE WHAT ASPECTS OF A PERSON INFLUENCE OTHER PARTS, AND HOW THESE ASPECTS ARE AFFECTED BY FORCES FROM THE ENVIRONMENT. THE TEACHER'S ROLE WAS SAID TO BE, IN PART, TO TURN THE STUDENTS' SCRUTINY INWARD UPON HIMSELF IN SEARCH OF THE SOURCE OF HIS BELIEFS TO PRODUCE THE SELF-KNOWLEDGE THAT IS PREREQUISITE TO DEVELOPMENT. THE APPLICATIONS OF THIS THEORY TO THE COLLEGE ENVIRONMENT ARE DISCUSSED IN RELATION TO CURRICULUM, INSTITUTIONAL BUREAUCRACY, TEACHING AND RESEARCH, INSTITUTIONAL PURPOSE, COLLEGE SIZE, AND EXPERIMENTS IN BETTER TEACHING.

THE COST TO BUSINESS OF LABOR TURNOVER IS NOT PRECISELY EVALUATED BUT IT IS A SOURCE OF  ANXIETY. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THE NEED FOR SELF-ACTUALIZATION, RATHER THAN ANY LOWER-LEVEL NEED SUCH AS HIGHER PAY, IS A CONTROLLING REASON FOR TURNOVER. IT MAY BE THAT A COMPANY MAY SPEND AT LEAST AS MUCH ON UNNECESSARY TURNOVER AS IT MIGHT SPEND ON A PROGRAM OF EMPLOYEE EDUCATION TENDING TO PREVENT TURNOVER, WITH ITS ATTENDANT RECRUITMENT COSTS.

THE CHARACTERISTIC FEATURE OF HIS ROLE IS ITS DIFFUSIVENESS, WHICH LEADS TO CONTRADICTORY LOYALTIES AND GOALS. WHEN THERE IS A CONFLICT BETWEEN STUDENT AND ADMINISTRATION, THE PSYCHIATRIST MUST DECIDE WHICH SIDE TO TAKE. IMPLICIT IN THIS DECISION IS HIS PERCEPTION OF THE PROBLEM OF CONFIDENTIALITY. EXCEPTION IS TAKEN TO FARNSWORTH'S ADVOCACY OF SUSPENDING THE USUAL RULES OF CONFIDENTIALITY IN A VARIETY OF SITUATIONS. THE RULE OF LAW IS RENDERED INOPERATIVE WHEN AUTHORITIES EXHIBIT  BENEVOLENT DISCRETION IN ENFORCEMENT. IN PSYCHIATRIC BUREAUCRACIES SUCH AS COLLEGE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES, SUCH RULES ARE SACRIFICED BECAUSE OF UNLIMITED DISCRETIONARY POWER.

EACH CHILD WHO RECEIVED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE AT SOME POINT DURING HIS SCHOOL CAREER WAS EVALUATED FOR ADJUSTMENT DURING FIVE SEGMENTS OF HIS SCHOOL CAREER. DATA FROM MENTAL HEALTH RECORDS FOR BOTH GROUPS WERE THEN SEPARATELY EVALUATED BY THREE RATERS TO ASSESS EACH CHILD'S ADJUSTMENT DURING THESE PERIODS. DURING THE 1940'S, MIDDLE CLASS, PROFESSIONALLY ORIENTED FAMILIES WITH NURSERY SCHOOL CHILDREN IN A COMMUNITY WITH ADEQUATE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES DID USE THESE SERVICES. IN OVER HALF OF THE CASES, MEDICAL HEALTH SERVICE WAS INSTITUTED PRIOR TO THE FOURTH GRADE. MOST CHILDREN SHOWING EVIDENCE OF MALADJUSTMENT, OR USING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES, HAD  LOW NURSERY SCHOOL ADJUSTMENT RATINGS. MORE CHILDREN SHOWING MALADJUSTMENT AND RECEIVING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE SHOWED IMPROVEMENT IN HIGH SCHOOL THAN MALADJUSTED CHILDREN WHO RECEIVED NO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE. THE NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AT THE EARLY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL LEVEL IS SUPPORTED BY THE STUDY.

THE PURPOSE OF THE CONFERENCE WAS TO IDENTIFY CHANGES NEEDED FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF EDUCATION IN THE RESPECTIVE STATES, TO DETERMINE APPROPRIATE GOALS, AND TO EXAMINE THE PLANNING AND CHANGE PROCESSES NEEDED TO ACCOMPLISH THESE OBJECTIVES. INDIVIDUAL STATE PARTICIPATION IN THE LONG RANGE PROJECT INCLUDED APPOINTMENT OF A PROJECT COORDINATOR, AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE, AND STUDY COMMITTEES TO CARRY OUT RELATED ACTIVITIES OF THE STATE AND TO ASSURE EFFECTIVE PLANNING AND CONDUCTING OF THE PROJECT. IN CONSIDERING EDUCATIONAL NEEDS  THROUGH 1980, PARTICULAR ATTENTION WAS GIVEN TO DEFINING THE COMPONENTS OF THE PLANNING PROCESS AND TO FORMULATING PROCEDURES FOR EFFECTING THE DESIRED CHANGE. OTHER ASPECTS OF EDUCATIONAL IMPROVEMENT CONSIDERED INCLUDED RESEARCH UTILIZATION, POLITICAL PROBLEMS AND POWERS INVOLVED IN ACCOMPLISHING EDUCATIONAL CHANGE, EDUCATIONAL CHANGE WITH RESPECT TO INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS AND TO LOCAL SYSTEMS, EDUCATIONAL CHANGE IN URBAN AREAS, THE ROLES OF VARIOUS PARTICIPANTS (SUPERINTENDENTS, BOARD MEMBERS, AND NONEDUCATORS) IN ACHIEVING EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES, THE STATE AGENCY FOR EDUCATION, AND STATE PLANNING IN PUBLIC EDUCATION.

THE TYPES OF QUESTIONS WHICH SOCIAL SCIENTISTS USUALLY ASK ABOUT ORGANIZATIONS AND AGENCIES IN INDUSTRY, BUSINESS, AND OTHER SETTINGS ARE RAISED ABOUT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. STUDENT AND ADMINISTRATOR PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE DIVERSITY AND POTENTIAL STUDENT CHOICE OF INSTITUTIONS ARE DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS, CHURCH-RELATED INSTITUTIONS, COLLEGES VERSUS UNIVERSITIES, AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. ORGANIZATIONAL PROBLEMS ARE BETTER ANALYZED WITH CONCEPTS OF &quot;MEANING&quot; AND &quot;PURPOSE&quot; RATHER THAN IN TERMS OF THE STANDARD &quot;OPERATIONAL&quot; QUESTION. THE SOCIAL SCIENCES CAN BE STUDIED IN TERMS OF EDUCATIONAL DEMAND, HIGHER EDUCATION AS AN INVESTMENT, HIGHER  EDUCATION AS A BUSINESS ENTERPRISE, HIGHER EDUCATION AS A POLITICAL SCIENCE, AND EDUCATIONAL BUREAUCRACY, PSYCHOLOGY, SOCIOLOGY, AND HISTORY. EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY ON SUCH FACTORS AS DECISIONMAKING, INTERPRETATION, AND ARTFULNESS IS IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING THE SUCCESS OF ADMINISTRATORS. TWO ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS FACING ADMINISTRATORS ARE THE CRISIS PROBLEM AND THE CONTINUING PROBLEM. THE CRISIS PROBLEM ENTAILS THE UPSURGE OF STUDENT ENROLLMENT, THE EXPANSION OF RESEARCH, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND DEMANDING PROGRAMS OF PUBLIC SERVICE. THE CONTINUING PROBLEMS INVOLVE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PURPOSES AND PROCESSES OF EDUCATION AND THE APPRAISAL OF THE RESULTS.

        "description":"FROM AN ANTHROPOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW, THE SUCCESS OF AN ADVOCATE TO ACHIEVE DIRECTED CHANGE IN A FORMAL ORGANIZATION DEPENDS PRIMARILY UPON FOUR VARIABLES--(1) THE WAY THE ADVOCATE PLAYS HIS ROLE, (2) THE TARGET SYSTEM'S DEPENDENCE UPON AUTHORITY, (3) THE EXPECTATION OF CHANGE SHARED BY MEMBERS OF THE TARGET SYSTEM, AND (4) THE EXTENT OF THE TARGET SYSTEM'S FELT NEED FOR CHANGE. NETWORKS OF INFORMAL RELATIONS AND UNOFFICIAL NORMS MAY IMPEDE ACCEPTANCE OF INNOVATION. THE FORMAL ORGANIZATION'S SIGNIFICANCE FOR CHANGE IS DERIVED FROM THE BOUNDARIES FOR WHICH THE ORGANIZATION'S AUTHORITY IS LEGITIMATED, GOALS ARE DEFINED, AND DECISIONS ARE MADE. SUCCESSFUL INNOVATION IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM AS A FORMAL ORGANIZATION, THEREFORE, REQUIRES KNOWLEDGE OF BOTH THE FORMAL AND INFORMAL ASPECTS  OF THE SYSTEM. THE POSSIBLE NECESSITY OF DERIVING INNOVATIONS FROM LARGER REGIONAL OR NATION-STATE SYSTEMS TO SOLVE PROBLEMS WITHIN THE LOCAL CLIENT-SERVING SCHOOL SYSTEM CONSTITUTES A MAJOR PROBLEM AREA FOR EDUCATIONAL INNOVATORS. BECAUSE THE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR OCCUPIES A BALANCING ROLE, MAINTAINING A WORKING EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN COMPONENT ELEMENTS OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM, A NEW AND SPECIFICALLY INNOVATIVE ACTIVITY IS SUGGESTED, TO WHICH PERSONNEL WOULD BE ASSIGNED AS ADVOCATES FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF MANAGING EDUCATIONAL CHANGE.

STUDIES SELECTED MET THE CONCEPT OF ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT AND PROVIDED SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO INDICATE CASE OUTCOME. AFTER SELECTING THE STUDIES, THE STRATEGY AND ISSUES OF EACH WERE IDENTIFIED, AND COMPARISONS WERE MADE OF CASES CLASSED AS SUCCESSFUL AND UNSUCCESSFUL (OBJECTIVES NOT FULLY REALIZED). THIS PROCESS ALLOWED EVALUATION OF THE CRUCIAL ISSUES &quot;WHICH MADE A DIFFERENCE&quot; IN THE PROCESS OF ORGANIZATIONAL DEVELOPMENT. WHEN COMPARING THE SUCCESSFUL AND UNSUCCESSFUL CASES, THE MOST CONSPICUOUS ISSUE WAS THAT OF LINKAGE BETWEEN THE TARGET SYSTEM AND THE LARGER (EXTERNAL) SYSTEM. IN TWO OF THREE UNSUCCESSFUL CASES, CHANGES WERE INITIATED AND PROGRESS WAS  BEING MADE, ONLYTO BE HALTED BECAUSE OF MANAGEMENT ACTION ABOVE AND OUTSIDE THE TARGET SYSTEM. IN BOTH CASES, CHANGE WOULD HAVE BEEN FAVORABLY EVENTUATED IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE LINKAGE BREAKDOWN BETWEEN THE EXTERNAL MANAGEMENT AND THE CHANGE AGENT. ANOTHER IMPORTANT ISSUE DELINEATED THROUGH SUCCESSFUL AND UNSUCCESSFUL CASE COMPARISON WAS THAT OF LINKAGE WITH PERSONS, ISSUES, AND/OR PARTS WITHIN THE TARGET SYSTEM. THE CASES USED A VARIETY OF WAYS TO COPE WITH MANY SIMILAR ISSUES. OF THE 33 ISSUES, THREE ISSUES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS HAVING CENTRAL IMPORTANCE IN ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT--(1) INTRODUCING A NEW MODEL OF OPERATION WHICH THE ORGANIZATION MEMBERS CAN CONSIDER AS A BASIS FOR FORMULATING IMPROVEMENT, (2) SEQUENCING OBJECTIVES AND ACTION STEPS IN SUCH A WAY THAT LINKAGE IS  ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE INITIAL POINT OF CHANGE AND THE EXTERNAL SYSTEM WITH WHICH THE TARGET SYSTEM HAS IMPORTANT INTERDEPENDENCY, AND (3) SEQUENCING STEPS TO ESTABLISH LINKAGE BETWEEN THE INITIAL POINT OF CHANGE AND THE OPERATION INTERNAL TO THE TARGET SYSTEM.

THE NEED FOR CHANGES IN STRUCTURE, ORGANIZATION, AND GOALS OF HIGHER EDUCATION IS BASED UPON THREE ASSUMPTIONS--(1) HIGHER EDUCATION IS LARGELY IRRELEVANT UNLESS IT FULFILLS ITS FUNCTION AS AN INSTRUMENT OF CONTINUOUS, CONSTRUCTIVE SOCIAL CRITICISM, (2) HIGHER EDUCATION SHOULD HELP STUDENTS TO GAIN A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK OF VALUES, IDEAS, AND SCIENTIFIC HABITS OF THOUGHT AND ACTION SO THAT THEY MAY BETTER UNDERSTAND, CONTROL, AND IMPROVE THEIR NATURAL-SOCIAL ENVIRONMENTS, AND (3) SCHOOLS WILL FULFILL NEITHER OF THESE UNTIL THEY BECOME INTEGRATIVE RATHER THAN FRAGMENTIVE. OUR SOCIETY NEEDS BROAD SPECIALISTS WHO SEE THE DATA AND THEORY OF THEIR DISCIPLINES WITHIN THE BROADER CONTEXT OF OUR  NATURAL-SOCIAL REALITIES. THE FUTURE INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION MUST LEARN THAT THE BEST TEACHING AND THE BEST LEARNING OCCUR IN THE COURSE OF RESEARCH INVOLVEMENT WHICH IS A METHOD OF CHANGE, NOT MERELY A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT IS. ADVANTAGES TO BE GAINED BY THIS APPROACH INCLUDE THE DESTRUCTION OF BARRIERS BETWEEN TEACHING AND RESEARCH, BROADENING OF FACULTY SCOPE, DEVELOPMENT OF A SENSE OF COMMUNITY, AND STUDENT COMMITMENT TO SOCIAL GOALS.

ANALYSIS OF THESE FORMS REVEALED INFORMATION ABOUT THE INITIAL MANNER OF EVALUATION AND THE PROBABLE USE OF THESE EVALUATIONS. FORMS WHICH THE TEACHERS SAW AND SIGNED HAD CLEAR DESCRIPTIVE STATEMENTS ABOUT THE TEACHERS, AND FORMS WHICH CONTAINED NO PROVISION FOR TEACHER'S SIGNATURE HAD A LIST OF SINGLE WORDS OR PHRASES WHICH TENDED TO CREATE A \"HALO EFFECT.\" PRINCIPALS FELT THEIR  TEACHERS WERE AWARE OF SCHOOL DISTRICT PROCEDURES AND STANDARDS OF SUPERVISION AND EVALUATION.

MEASURES OF INNOVATIVENESS INCLUDED (1) NUMBER OF EDUCATIONAL INNOVATIONS ADOPTED, (2) RELATIVE EARLINESS OF SUCH ADOPTIONS, AND (3) RATE OF SPREAD OF THE INNOVATIONS WITHIN THE DISTRICT.

INTERVIEWS TO DETERMINE INNOVATIVENESS WERE HELD JOINTLY WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS AND ANOTHER  ADMINISTRATOR.

THE STUDY CONCLUDES THAT A SCHOOL DISTRICT'S INNOVATIVENESS IS POSITIVELY RELATED TO THE AMOUNT OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN CITIZENS AND TEACHERS REGARDING THEIR EXPECTATIONS FOR THE SCHOOL BOARD ROLE.

A HYPOTHETICAL AID FORMULA WAS USED AS A STANDARD AGAINST WHICH TO MEASURE THE PRESENT EQUALIZATION SCHEMA IN EACH OF THE THREE STATES. KENTUCKY WAS FOUND TO DO A BETTER JOB OF DISTRIBUTING FUNDS TO EQUALIZE FOR DIFFERENCES IN ABILITY TO PAY THAN WERE MISSOURI OR TENNESSEE. THE BASIC REASONS FOR THE DIFFERENCES IN THE THREE PROGRAMS LIE IN THE PROPORTION OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM WHICH MUST BE FINANCED LOCALLY AND THE SHARE OF STATE AID WHICH MUST BE DISTRIBUTED WITHOUT REGARD TO ECONOMIC ABILITY. STATE AID WAS FOUND TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST URBAN AREAS IN ALL THREE STATES. THIS  WAS EXPECTED BECAUSE OF THE GREATER RELUCTANCE OF RURAL AREAS EXPERIENCING OUTMIGRATION TO FINANCE THE EDUCATION OF STUDENTS WHO WILL NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE COMMUNITY. (HW)",

TEACHER CONTRACTS ARE DISTINGUISHED BY LESS RELIANCE ON SENIORITY, FEWER EMPLOYER PENALTIES, AND FEWER FRINGE BENEFITS, PRIMARILY BECAUSE TEACHER BARGAINING IS STILL IN ITS INFANCY. TEACHER BARGAINING MOVES BEYOND INDUSTRIAL COLLECTIVE BARGAINING TO THE EXTENT THAT TEACHERS REGARD THEMSELVES AS PROFESSIONALS, BARGAINING NOT ONLY ON CONDITIONS OF WORK BUT ON MATTERS OF EDUCATIONAL POLICY, INCLUDING CURRICULUM DETERMINATION, TEXTBOOK SELECTION, TEACHING HOURS, AND SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS. THE NEW YORK CITY MORE EFFECTIVE SCHOOLS PLAN IS AN ILLUSTRATION OF  TEACHER BARGAINING GAINS FOR BOTH SCHOOLS AND CHILDREN.

        "description":"THE BEHAVIOR OF PRESCHOOL BLIND AND PRESCHOOL SIGHTED CHILDREN AND THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE BEHAVIOR OF MOTHERS AND CHILDREN WERE STUDIED. SUBJECTS WERE 10 BLIND AND 12 SIGHTED CHILDREN FROM THREE TO SIX YEARS OF AGE AND FROM NONIMMIGRANT, UNBROKEN CAUCASIAN FAMILIES OF AVERAGE SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS AND CHRISTIAN BACKGROUND. A SYSTEMATIC BEHAVIOR OBSERVATION TECHNIQUE WAS USED TO OBSERVE EACH CHILD IN HIS HOME ENVIRONMENT. RESULTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER INTERACTION WITH ADULTS BY BLIND CHILDREN THAN BY SIGHTED CHILDREN, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE AMOUNT OF SELF-INSTIGATED BEHAVIOR BETWEEN GROUPS, AND MORE SELF-INSTIGATED BEHAVIOR AIMED AT THE MOTHER BY BLIND CHILDREN THAN BY SIGHTED CHILDREN. BLIND CHILDREN'S SELF-INSTIGATED BEHAVIOR AIMED AT THE MOTHER WAS  CATEGORIZED AS 51 PERCENT SUCCORANT, 30 PERCENT SOCIABILITY, AND 14 PERCENT DOMINANCE. NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND AMONG THESE THREE TYPES OF ACTS FOR THE SIGHTED CHILDREN. IN RELATION TO THEIR MOTHERS, BLIND CHILDREN TENDED TOWARD SUCCORANCE AND SOCIABILITY, AND SIGHTED CHILDREN TENDED TOWARD DOMINANCE AND NURTURANCE. THE BEHAVIOR OF BLIND CHILDREN WAS NOT AS VARIABLE AS THAT OF SIGHTED CHILDREN. SUCCORANCE WAS THE CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MOST CLEARLY DISTINGUISHED THE BEHAVIOR OF BLIND AND SIGHTED CHILDREN. MOTHERS OF BLIND CHILDREN WERE COMPLIANT TO ABOUT HALF OF CHILDREN'S SUCCORANT BEHAVIOR. MOTHERS OF SIGHTED CHILDREN EITHER COMPLIED VERY MUCH OR VERY LITTLE TO SUCH BEHAVIOR. MOTHERS OF BLIND CHILDREN USED REFUSAL AND IGNORING AS WAYS OF NOT COMPLYING, WHILE MOTHERS OF  SIGHTED CHILDREN RELIED ALMOST TOTALLY ON REFUSAL. A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIPS WERE FOUND BETWEEN THE BEHAVIOR OF BLIND CHILDREN AND THEIR MOTHERS. THE AUTHOR CONCLUDED THAT THE DEGREE OF SELF RELIANCE IN A CHILD IS BETTER PREDICTED FROM THE MOTHER'S COMPLIANT BEHAVIOR THAN FROM THE EXISTENCE OF BLINDNESS IN THE CHILD.

        "description":"THE BASIC VIEWPOINT OF THIS CONFERENCE IS THAT CHILDREN WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES MUST BE EVALUATED INDIVIDUALLY ACCORDING TO THEIR SPECIFIC DYSFUNCTIONS AND PLACED IN EDUCATIONAL SETTINGS ACCORDING TO THEIR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS. IN THE FEATURED ADDRESS, &quot;NEW APPROACHES IN EDUCATION FOR THE CHILD WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES,&quot; BARBARA BATEMAN DESCRIBED THREE MAJOR TYPES OF PROBLEMS OF CHILDREN WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES--VISUAL-MOTOR, AUDITORY-VOCAL, AND READING. IN THESE AREAS, SPECIAL EDUCATION MUST TEACH SKILLS NORMALLY LEARNED AUTOMATICALLY. IDEALLY, THESE CHILDREN SHOULD BE IDENTIFIED AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE TO PREVENT SCHOOL FAILURE AND OTHER NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES. EARLY DETECTION WOULD ENABLE TEACHERS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CRITICAL LEARNING PERIODS WHEN CERTAIN SKILLS ARE MORE  EFFICIENTLY TAUGHT THAN AT ANY OTHER TIME. WHILE SOME CHILDREN WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES NEED RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES, MANY DO NOT. INDIVIDUAL NEEDS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. DIAGNOSTIC TEACHING IS THE RECOMMENDED METHOD WITH BRAIN-INJURED CHILDREN. THIS INVOLVES LOCATING THE LEARNING DIFFICULTY AND DESCRIBING THE PROBLEM BEHAVIORALLY. MODIFICATION OF THIS BEHAVIOR THEN TAKES PLACE. THE ILLINOIS TEST OF PSYCHOLINGUISTIC ABILITIES IS A GOOD DIAGNOSTIC TOOL. SEVERAL TRENDS IN THE EDUCATION OF CHILDREN WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES ARE--(1) THE CREATION OF GROUP SCREENING TESTS, (2) INCREASED FOCUS ON PREVENTIVE TEACHING, (3) MORE COOPERATION AND COMMUNICATION AMONG VARIOUS DISCIPLINES (ALTHOUGH COMMUNICATION BETWEEN TEACHERS AND RESEARCHERS IS LACKING), (4) RAPID ADOPTION OF FADS, AND (5) RESEARCH  ON BETTER QUESTIONS AS MORE ATTENTION IS PAID TO INDIVIDUAL NEEDS.

MULTIPLY HANDICAPPED RETARDED CHILDREN RECEIVE SPECIAL CLINICAL PROGRAM FUNDS. THE CHILD WELFARE SERVICES PROGRAM AUTHORIZES FUNDS FOR PARENT COUNSELING, HOMEMAKER SERVICES, FOSTER FAMILY CARE, ADOPTIVE SERVICES, AND OTHERS. A STAFF DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING PROGRAM PROVIDES TUITION AND MAINTENANCE GRANTS FOR EDUCATIONAL LEAVE FOR CHILD WELFARE PERSONNEL.  STATE AND LOCAL EFFORTS TO EXPAND AND IMPROVE THEIR SERVICES TO THE MENTALLY HANDICAPPED ARE STIMULATED AND ASSISTED BY THE BUREAU IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF GUIDES AND PROGRAM MATERIALS, CURRICULUM PLANNING, COORDINATION OF SERVICES, AND OTHER CONSULTATIVE SERVICES. GRANTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR RESEARCH AND DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS OF REGIONAL OR NATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE OR WITH NEW METHODS AND FACILITIES. STUDIES THAT SHOW PROMISE OF MAKING A SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF HEALTH PROGRAMS FOR MOTHERS AND CHILDREN ARE ALSO SUPPORTED. FUTURE PLANS INCLUDE SUPPORT FOR THE PREVENTION OF RETARDATION, EXPANSION OF COMMUNITY PROGRAMS, CLINICAL CENTERS, GENETIC AND BIOCHEMICAL LABORATORY SERVICES, AND ADDITIONAL TRAINING PROJECTS FOR PROFESSIONAL AND SUBPROFESSIONAL WORKERS.

FOLLOWING A REVIEW OF DELACATO'S THEORY OF NEUROLOGICAL ORGANIZATION, EACH OF THE STUDIES IS PRESENTED WITH ALTERNATIVE INTERPRETATIONS OF THE DATA AND WITH IMPLICATIONS NOT ACKNOWLEDGED OR CONTRARY TO THOSE DRAWN BY THE ORIGINAL AUTHORS. EACH STUDY IS ANALYZED IN DETAIL AS TO THE MANNER OF SELECTION OF SUBJECTS (THE SUBJECTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN ALMOST ALL OF THE EXPERIMENTS REPORTED IN THIS PAPER COULD NOT BE CHARACTERIZED AS SERIOUSLY NEUROLOGICALLY DISORGANIZED), THE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF DATA, EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT, AND THE IMPLICATIONS DRAWN FROM THE REPORTED RESULTS. THE AUTHOR IS GENERALLY CRITICAL OF THE STUDIES FOR THEIR LACK  OF ADHERENCE TO ACCEPTABLE STANDARDS FOR EMPIRICAL EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN. HIS CONCLUSION IS THAT ALL THE EMPIRICAL RESEARCH REPORTED THUS FAR HAS FAILED TO PRODUCE COGENT EVIDENCE THAT D.H. DELACATO'S THERAPY HAS AN EFFECT ON THE READING OF NORMAL SUBJECTS. IN REVIEWING STUDIES WHICH CONTAIN INFORMATION ON THE CORRELATION OF NEUROLOGICAL ORGANIZATION AND CERTAIN VARIABLES, THE AUTHOR FINDS THAT MEASURES OF NEUROLOGICAL ORGANIZATION ARE MORE HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH MEASURES OF NONVERBAL INTELLIGENCE THAN THEY ARE WITH MEASURES OF READING ACHIEVEMENT. THE FIFTEEN STUDIES ARE ALL TAKEN FROM EXPERIMENTS REPORTED IN THREE VOLUMES WRITTEN BY DECACATO AND LISTED IN THE 35-ITEM BIBLIOGRAPHY. (TM)",

DIFFICULT FOILS AND ERROR CORRECTION RESULTED IN SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE ON THE IMMEDIATE COMPLETION TEST, BUT NO FACTORS RESULTED IN DIFFERENTAL PERFORMANCE ON THE DELAYED COMPLETION TEST. THE LINEAR PROGRAM  WAS MORE EFFECTIVE FOR ALL CONDITIONS EXCEPT DIFFICULT FOILS AND CORRECTION PROCEDURE. DIFFICULT ITEMS AFFECTED PERFORMANCE ONLY ON THE DELAYED MULTIPLE CHOICE TEST. EASY ITEMS AND THE LINEAR PROGRAM PROMOTED IDENTICAL RESPONSE ERROR REPETITIONS FROM THE IMMEDIATE TO THE DELAYED TEST.

FORGETTING WAS DEFINED AS A CORRECT RESPONSE ON THE FIRST TEST BUT NOT ON THE SECOND, WHILE REMINISCENCE WAS DEFINED AS THE CONVERSE. RETENTION WAS DEFINED AS A CORRECT RESPONSE BOTH TIMES. ANXIETY AROUSAL DURING FILM PRESENTATION WAS MEASURED VIA GALVANIC SKIN RESPONSE AND PLOTTED THROUGH SUCCESSIVE MINUTES OF THE FILM. THE PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS THAT FORGETTING, RETENTION, AND REMINISCENCE WOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH SMALLER, MEDIUM, AND LARGER INCREASES IN AROUSAL NEAR THE MOMENT OF PRESENTATION WAS SUPPORTED. THIS FINDING RUNS COUNTER TO A BELIEF OFTEN EXPRESSED IN THE LITERATURE (BUT, AS POINTED OUT IN A  LENGTHY REVIEW IN THIS REPORT, NOT SUPPORTED BY EVIDENCE) THAT COMMUNICATION EFFECTIVENESS DEPENDS ON A LOW LEVEL OF ANXIETY AROUSAL OR AN AROUSAL REDUCTION. THESE RESULTS IMPLY THAT TRAFFIC SAFETY FILMS (FOR INSTANCE) MAY BE MORE EFFECTIVE IF ANXIETY OR FEAR IS AROUSED. A COROLLARY CONCLUSION IS THAT AN EFFECTIVE FILM SHOULD ALTERNATE SEQUENCES THAT AROUSE AND REDUCE ANXIETY, WITH INFORMATION PRESENTED AT MOMENTS OF ANXIETY AROUSAL ONLY. CONTENT OF ANXIETY-AROUSING SEQUENCES NEED NOT BE PERTINENT TO INFORMATION TO BE RETAINED.

THE FIRST ASPECT TO BE CONVERTED SHOULD BE THE BASIC INSTRUCTIONAL UNIT OF THE INSTITUTION--THE DEPARTMENT. THE DEPARTMENT OF LANGUAGES AND LINGUISTICS OF FLORIDA ATLANTIC UNIVERSITY UTILIZES AN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM IN TEACHING TERMINAL BEHAVIOR AT THE FIRST LEVELS OF LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION. WITH  INFORMATION-STIMULUS AND RESPONSE-REINFORCEMENT PROGRAMING FRAMES, THE PROGRAM ASPIRES TO SHAPE VERBAL BEHAVIOR IN A SERIES OF CONTROLLED STUDENT ACTIVITIES WITH CONTINUED CONFIRMATION AND CORRECTION. BY THIS METHOD, THE STUDENT SELECTS HIS LEARNING SCHEDULE AND PACE IN A PROGRAM DEVELOPED EXCLUSIVELY FOR HIS NEEDS BY EXTENSIVE RESEARCH AND EXPERIMENTATION. THIS TECHNIQUE DEMANDS A GREAT DEAL FROM THE ENTIRE TEACHING PROFESSION.

EVEN THE CONTROVERSIAL TECHNIQUES OF MIMICRY AND MEMORIZATION AND PATTERN DRILLS CAN CONTINUE TO BE IMPORTANT IF THEIR LIMITATIONS ARE REALIZED.

AT THE INTERMEDIATE AND ADVANCED LEVELS, THE ACTIVE SKILLS MAY CONTINUE TO BE PRACTICED AND PERFECTED ALONG WITH THE STUDENT'S LEARNING OF CULTURE AND LITERATURE, BUT FEW STUDENTS WILL ACQUIRE ACTIVE LANGUAGE KNOWLEDGE IN THE CLASSROOM AT THESE LEVELS IF THEIR INITIAL EXPOSURE HAS BEEN ONLY TO THE PASSIVE SKILLS.

THIS INNOVATIVE PRACTICE HELPED TRAIN THE INTERPRETERS TO INCREASE CONCENTRATION ABILITY AND REACTION SPEED AND TO RETAIN INCREASINGLY LARGER NUMBERS OF WORDS AND VASTER CONCEPTS. THE MEMBERS OF THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP, TEACHERS BORN AND SCHOOLED IN GERMANY BUT WHO HAD LIVED MOST OF THEIR ADULT LIVES IN THE U.S., WERE ENCOURAGED TO INCREASE THE SPEED OF THEIR INDIVIDUALLY CONTROLLED FILMSTRIP CONTAINING LISTS OF KEY WORDS AND EXPRESSIONS, BEFORE TAPING THEIR TRANSLATIONS. AS A RESULT OF USING THIS  AUTOINSTRUCTIONAL TECHNIQUE, THERE WAS AN AVERAGE 25 PERCENT INCREASE IN TRANSLATION SPEED WITH ALMOST NO LOSS IN ACCURACY.

EVIDENCE OF DISAGREEMENT AS TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE ROLES IN NONCREDIT PROGRAMS AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION INDICATED THE POSSIBILITY OF FUTURE CONFLICT. THE AUTHOR RECOMMENDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF (1) CLEAR GUIDELINES FOR ARTICULATION AND (2) PROCEDURAL ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN THE TWO TYPES OF INSTITUTION. HE CONCLUDES THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES SHOULD BE COMPREHENSIVE, BUT SHOULD NOT OFFER COURSES ABOVE THE LOWER DIVISION LEVEL. (WO)",

THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT WRITTEN IN 1935 ORIGINALLY HAD PROVISIONS FOR AGRICULTURAL LABORERS, BUT IT WAS DELETED BEFORE FINAL PASSAGE. EARLY ORGANIZING ATTEMPTS OCCURRED IN THE LATE YEARS OF THE 19TH CENTURY WHEN CHINESE IMMIGRANTS ORGANIZED PROTECTIVE ASSOCIATIONS KNOWN AS TONGS. THE WOBBLIES WERE ORGANIZED IN 1905 AS A RESULT OF A MERGER OF MINERS AND LABOR UNIONS. FARM LABOR ORGANIZING DURING THE DEPRESSION YEARS WAS VIRTUALLY NON-EXISTENT, UNTIL 1934, WHEN THE SOUTHERN TENANT FARMERS UNION WAS ORGANIZED IN ARKANSAS, AND ITS ACTIVITIES PROVIDED GREAT IMPETUS TO ALL UNION ORGANIZATION. IN 1946, THE AFL GRANTED A CHARTER TO THE NATIONAL FARM UNION AND THIS UNION IN TURN BECAME THE NATIONAL  AGRICULTURAL WORKERS UNION. THE MISSISSIPPI FREEDOM LABOR UNION WAS ORGANIZED IN 1964 AND PROVIDED A BREAKTHROUGH FOR OTHER LABOR UNIONS SUCH AS THE NATIONAL FARM WORKERS ASSOCIATION, UNITED FARM WORKERS ORGANIZING COMMITTEE, AND AGRICULTURAL WORKERS. ORGANIZATIONAL ACTIVITIES ARE TAKING PLACE IN CALIFORNIA, LOUISIANA, TEXAS, WISCONSIN, MICHIGAN, FLORIDA, NEW JERSEY, AND NEW YORK. THE AFL-CIO HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN PROVIDING GUIDANCE AND INITIATIVE TO THESE ORGANIZATIONAL ACTIVITIES. (JS)",

IN THE SOUTHWEST, THE COMBINATION OF A LACK OF ACCULTURATION AND A CHEAP LABOR SUPPLY FROM MEXICO HAS CREATED ECONOMIC DISADVANTAGEMENT FOR THE SPANISH AMERICANS, WHILE THE INDIAN HAS ALSO EXPERIENCED EXPLOITATION AND DISCRIMINATION IN RELATION TO EDUCATION AND JOBS.

THE GROUPS ARE NOT CONSIDERED HOMOGENEOUS, HOWEVER, AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES MUST STILL BE RECOGNIZED. SOME ADVANTAGES ARE THAT PUPILS ARE PLACED AT READING LEVELS WHERE SUCCESS IS POSSIBLE, THAT READING INSTRUCTION ACQUIRES NEW IMPORTANCE, THAT TEACHERS APPARENTLY ARE STIMULATED TO BETTER PERFORMANCE, THAT  READING ACHIEVEMENT AS MEASURED BY STANDARDIZED TESTS MAY BE INCREASED, AND THAT PARENTS APPROVE WHEN THE PLAN IS CAREFULLY EXPLAINED. SOME LIMITATIONS ARE THAT SOCIAL PRESSURE MAY RESULT WHEN FOURTH- AND SIXTH-GRADE PUPILS ARE IN THE SAME READING CLASS, THAT POOR ACADEMIC INTEGRATION MAY RESULT IF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE READING TEACHER AND THE HOMEROOM TEACHER IS INSUFFICIENT, AND THAT THE PLAN MAY BE INEFFECTIVE IF NO PROVISION IS MADE FOR INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES WITHIN THE READING GROUP.

THESE PUPILS WERE ASSIGNED TO A CLASS CALLED READING 1 AND WERE TO CONTINUE TO READING 2, 3, OR 4 FOR A TOTAL OF FOUR SEMESTERS OR UNTIL THEY HAD REACHED A SEVENTH-GRADE INSTRUCTIONAL LEVEL. MOST OF THE TEACHERS HAD A READING SPECIALIST LICENSE, AND MOST CLASSES WERE TAUGHT IN A SPECIALLY EQUIPPED DEVELOPMENTAL READING ROOM. ON THE BASIS OF TEST SCORES ACHIEVED ON THE GATES READING SURVEY, THE LORGE-THORNDIKE NON-VERBAL INTELLIGENCE TEST, THE STANFORD-BINET INTELLIGENCE TEST, THE BOTEL READING INVENTORY, AND ON THE PEABODY PICTURE VOCABULARY TEST AS NEEDED, CLASSES WERE DIVIDED INTO THREE GROUPS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN A READING 1 CLASS OF 15  STUDENTS, GROUP 1 HAD SIX PUPILS WITH A FIFTH-GRADE INSTRUCTIONAL LEVEL, GROUP 2 HAD SIX PUPILS AT THE FOURTH-GRADE LEVEL, AND GROUP 3 HAD THREE PUPILS AT THE SECOND- OR THIRD-GRADE LEVEL. DURING THE READING PERIOD, ONE OF THE GROUPS WAS GIVEN INSTRUCTION WHILE THE OTHERS WORKED ON A BASIC ASSIGNMENT. A VARIETY OF MATERIALS AND TECHNIQUES SUSTAINED INTEREST. A WEEK'S PROGRAM IN READING 1 IS DESCRIBED. THE MATERIALS USED IN THE PLAN ARE LISTED IN THE BIBLIOGRAPHY.

FOURTEEN CHILDREN, 15 TO 38 MONTHS OLD, WERE ASKED TO SCRIBBLE IN A PLAY SITUATION WITH A NON-TRACING TOOL AND A REGULAR PENCIL. ALL THE CHILDREN SCRIBBLED LESS WHEN USING THE NON-TRACING TOOL.

A STATISTICAL COMPARISON OF SCORES ON EACH TEST SECTION WAS MADE. THIS WAS THE SECOND STEP IN A LONGITUDINAL INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFECTS OF I/T/A. THE FIRST COMPARISON WAS MADE AT THE END OF GRADE ONE. AFTER FIRST GRADE, THE I/T/A GROUP DID SIGNIFICANTLY  BETTER ONLY IN SPELLING WHEN EITHER I/T/A OR T/O ANSWERS WERE ACCEPTABLE. AT THE END OF GRADE TWO, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE THREE AREAS. THE I/T/A METHOD APPEARED TO BE BEST SUITED FOR ABOVE AVERAGE CHILDREN. ALTHOUGH STAFF OPINION WAS NOT UNANIMOUS, IT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT THE PROGRAM BE DISCONTINUED. TWELVE REASONS FOR THIS RECOMMENDATION ARE GIVEN. STATISTICS ARE SUMMARIZED IN FOUR TABLES. (RH)",

AS A TEST, THE SYSTEM WAS USED TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT AN EDUCATIONAL ORIENTATION COURSE AT OSU. EVALUATION OF THE COURSE WAS LIMITED BUT GENERALLY FAVORABLE, AND IS BEING CONTINUED. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE SYSTEM IS WORTHWHILE IN THAT IT (A)  ENCOURAGES A MORE ANALYTICAL EXAMINATION OF INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS IN TERMS OF THEIR NEEDS AND EFFECTIVENESS, (B) EMPLOYS THE TEAM APPROACH IN THE CURRICULUM DESIGN, (C) REQUIRES DEFINITIVE STATEMENTS OF LEARNER GOALS, ENVIRONMENT DESIGN AND EVALUATION, (D) MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR THE TEACHER TO STUDY AND DESIGN HIS INSTRUCTION WITHIN A MINIMUM TIME, (E) REDUCES FAILURE IN INSTRUCTIONAL INNOVATION AND (F) INCREASES THE DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION DEALING WITH EDUCATIONAL CHANGE.

WITH THIS BACKGROUND, THE STUDENT MOVES ON TO THREE RELATED UNITS--&quot;THE EPIC HERO,&quot;&quot;THE JOURNEY NOVEL HERO,&quot; AND &quot;THE HISTORICAL NOVEL HERO&quot;--EACH FOCUSING ON CHARACTERISTICS AND VARIETIES OF HEROES IN THESE GENRES. THE FINAL LITERATURE UNIT, &quot;THE HERITAGE OF THE FRONTIER,&quot; INVESTIGATES THAT LOCALE WHICH  FREQUENTLY GIVES BIRTH TO HEROES AND HEROIC ACTIONS IN AMERICAN LITERATURE. IN THE LANGUAGE UNITS, STUDENTS ARE INTRODUCED TO THE HISTORY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND THE STUDY OF SENTENCE SYNTAX AND SEMANTICS--AREAS WHICH FOLLOW NATURALLY FROM THE STUDY OF FORM CLASSES AND LEXICOGRAPHY IN THE SEVENTH GRADE AND ANTICIPATE THE UNITS ON SYNTAX AND THE USES OF LANGUAGE IN THE NINTH GRADE.

THE TRAINING PROGRAMS IN CREATIVE DRAMATICS, WHICH SERVED A TOTAL OF 1,941 TEACHERS AND THEATER DIRECTORS, INVOLVED WORKSHOPS OF ELEMENTARY TEACHERS, A COURSE IN THEATER FOR CHILDREN OFFERED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND PLAY DIRECTION WORKSHOPS FOR HIGH SCHOOL DRAMA COACHES AND LOCAL THEATER DIRECTORS.

DESPITE THE ACADEMIC WORLD'S FEAR OF A STATUS DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE UNDERGRADUATE TEACHER AND THE GRADUATE TEACHER, CHANGES IN REQUIREMENTS ARE NECESSARY AND TWO DIFFERENT DEGREES SHOULD BE AWARDED IN ORDER TO SUPPLY AND ACCREDIT ENOUGH UNDERGRADUATE TEACHERS AND TO PREVENT THE PRESENT RESEARCH-ORIENTED PH.D. FROM BECOMING A TEACHING DEGREE ONLY. THE DOCTOR OF LIBERAL ARTS (D.L.A.) DEGREE, WITH A PROGRAM SIMILAR IN EARLY STAGES TO THE PH.D. BUT REQUIRING LESS TIME AND MUCH LESS EMPHASIS ON THE DISSERTATION, WOULD SUPPLY ENOUGH UNDERGRADUATE  TEACHERS. THE PH.D., HOWEVER, SHOULD BE REQUIRED FOR UNIVERSITY TEACHERS AND SCHOLARS. A STREAMLINING OF THE PRESENT PH.D. DEGREE, ESPECIALLY THE LENGTH AND SCOPE OF THE DISSERTATION, IS NEEDED, BUT REGARDLESS OF THE SHORTAGE OF DEGREE HOLDERS, THE PH.D.

THE TENDENCY IN THESE STUDIES HAS BEEN TO STRESS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PUPILS IN SUCH CLASSES RATHER THAN THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CLASS AS A WHOLE. IN A STUDY OF 181 CLASSES (4,705 PUPILS) HOMOGENEITY WAS MEASURED BY THE STANDARD DEVIATION OF CLASS PERFORMANCE ON THE FIRST TWO METROPOLITAN READING TESTS GIVEN IN TWO SUCCESSIVE YEARS. GROWTH WAS THEN DETERMINED BY THE DIFFERENCES IN CLASS MEANS ON THE TWO TESTS. THE SAME SUBJECTS WERE TESTED IN GRADE THREE AND FOUR, AND WERE DIVIDED INTO HIGH, AVERAGE, AND LOW LEVELS OF ACHIEVEMENT AND DEGREE OF HOMOGENEITY. (A STANDARD DEVIATION OF 6.0 THROUGH 8.9 MONTHS CHARACTERIZED &quot;AVERAGE  HOMOGENEITY.&quot;) FINDINGS SHOW AN INCONSISTENT GROWTH PATTERN--(1) ON THE WORD KNOWLEDGE SUBTEST, MEAN GROWTH WAS PRACTICALLY IDENTICAL FOR THE AVERAGE AND LOW HOMOGENEITY CLASSES, AND (2) ON THE READING SUBTEST, THE LOW HOMOGENEITY CLASSES SHOWED GREATER GROWTH THAN THE AVERAGE OR HIGH CLASSES. EVIDENCE OF INCONSISTENCY WAS ALSO EVIDENT WHEN VARIOUS COMBINATIONS OF INITIAL ACHIEVEMENT LEVEL AND CLASS HOMOGENEITY WERE ANALYZED.

IN SEVERAL OF NEW YORK CITY'S SCHOOL DISTRICTS LOCAL BOARDS HAVE TAKEN THE INITIATIVE TO HEIGHTEN THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AND POWERS, BUT THEY AND OTHERS DISAGREE ABOUT DEFINITION OF DECENTRALIZATION AND WAYS TO IMPLEMENT IT. AN EFFECTIVE PLAN MUST CLARIFY (1) SELECTION PROCEDURES FOR LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS, (2) WAYS TO APPOINT THE LOCAL SUPERINTENDENT, (3) BUDGET QUESTIONS, (4) DEPLOYMENT OF PERSONNEL, AND (5) SCHOOL DISTRICT BOUNDARIES. WIDESPREAD COMMUNITY REPRESENTATION ON LOCAL BOARDS IS ONE WAY TO HAVE LOCAL LOYALTY AND PROBLEMS BETTER REFLECTED IN THE SCHOOLS. A TYPICAL 11-MEMBER GROUP MIGHT INCLUDE FIVE PARENTS, TWO TEACHERS, THREE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION  REPRESENTATIVES, AND ONE ELECTED LOCAL OFFICIAL. THE DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENT SHOULD BE CHOSEN BY THE CRITERIA OF LOCAL SELECTION, FOCUS OF HIS LOYALTIES, ACCOUNTABILITY AND ABILITY TO DEVELOP COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT. LUMP SUM APPROPRIATIONS WOULD AID LOCAL PLANNING FOR BUDGET ALLOCATIONS AND LOCAL CONTROL OVER THE DEVELOPMENT OF STAFF. SUCH BUDGET CONTROL IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT WAY TO RESPOND TO COMMUNITY INTEREST AND TO ENCOURAGE INNOVATION AND PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY. PRACTICAL DECENTRALIZED BOUNDARIES MIGHT BE DERIVED FROM EDUCATIONAL PARKS, STRENGTHENING THE PRESENT 31 SCHOOL DISTRICTS OR REORGANIZING THEM INTO 15 NEW AREAS, OR FROM CREATING FIVE NEW BOROUGH-WIDE DIVISIONS.

MONOLINGUAL AND BILINGUAL NONPROFESSIONALS EITHER TUTORED THE CHILD IN THE HOME WITH THE PARENT OBSERVING AND SUPPLEMENTING THE INSTRUCTION OR TAUGHT THE PARENT DIRECTLY AND HAD NO CONTACT WITH THE CHILD. THE LESSONS IN READING READINESS WERE ORGANIZED AROUND CODE BREAKING, FORMAL LANGUAGE, AND VISUAL-PERCEPTUAL EXERCISES. THE STAR PROGRAM WAS EVALUATED AFTER SIX MONTHS ON THE BASIS OF THE SCORES ON NINE TESTS OF 19 STAR CHILDREN, 12 STAR DROPOUTS, 90 READING CLINIC CHILDREN WHO  RECEIVED DIRECT HELP FROM READING SPECIALISTS, AND 23 CONTROLS. THE PREPROGRAM FUNCTIONING LEVEL OF THE STAR CHILDREN WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR COMPARISON. THE RESULTS GENERALLY INDICATED THAT THE STAR CHILDREN HAD HIGHER MEAN SCORES ON ALL NINE TESTS THAN THE OTHER GROUPS. HOWEVER, IN COMPARISON WITH THE NATIONAL NORMS OF THE METROPOLITAN READINESS TESTS, THE STAR CHILDREN WERE FUNCTIONING ONLY AT AN \"AVERAGE READINESS STATUS,\" DESPITE THE SPECIAL INTERVENTION EFFORTS. THE POSSIBLE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN STAR PUPILS WHO RECEIVED DIRECT TUTORING FROM THE NONPROFESSIONAL AIDES AND THOSE WHO RECEIVED HELP FROM THE PARENT TRAINED BY THE AIDE WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT.

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SHORTCOMING OF THE LOCAL PROJECTS WAS THEIR LACK OF INVOLVEMENT AT THE PRESCHOOL AND EARLY ELEMENTARY LEVELS. DURING THE FIRST YEAR READING REMEDIATION WAS THE PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVE OF MOST OF THE LOCAL PROJECTS, BUT IT IS HOPED THAT IN THE SECOND YEAR THEY WILL PURSUE A GREATER VARIETY OF PROGRAMS. THE 60 PROJECTS WHICH STATED CURRICULUM CHANGE AS A MAJOR GOAL AVERAGED 6.06 CHANGES. THE SALARIES PAID TO PROJECT ADMINISTRATORS AND TEACHERS WERE SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THOSE PAID TO THEIR  NONPROJECT COUNTERPARTS. AS COMPARED WITH A SAMPLE OF NONPROJECT PUPILS, TITLE I PUPILS HAD A LOWER LEVEL OF ACHIEVEMENT, LOWER ASPIRATIONS AND EXPECTATIONS, AND POORER SCHOOL ATTENDANCE. THE CHIEF INSTRUMENTS USED TO COMPARE THESE TWO GROUPS WERE THE IOWA TESTS OF EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, THE IOWA TESTS OF BASIC SKILLS, AND THE IOWA PUPIL INVENTORY. AN ATTEMPT WAS ALSO MADE TO ANALYZE THE INTERACTIONS OF PUPILS, TEACHERS, AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS IN TERMS OF ACHIEVEMENT, ATTENDANCE, AND CHANGE IN ASPIRATION, TO FIND SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS TO EVALUATE TITLE I PROJECTS.

THE OBJECTIVES IN THE TARGET ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS WERE TO RAISE EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT LEVELS (ESPECIALLY COMMUNICATION SKILLS), IMPROVE TEACHER SKILLS IN WORKING WITH DISADVANTAGED PUPILS, FOSTER EQUAL EDUCATION AND DEMOCRATIC ATTITUDES THROUGH SCHOOL INTEGRATION, AND ENCOURAGE POSITIVE PARENT AND STUDENT ATTITUDES TOWARD SCHOOL. METHODS USED TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS INCLUDED SMALLER CLASSES, ADDITION OF ANCILLARY PERSONNEL, GUIDANCE AND COUNSELING SERVICES, ENRICHMENT, AND INSERVICE PROGRAMS FOR TEACHERS. A NONGRADED  PROGRAM WAS USED IN ONE TARGET SCHOOL, AND 230 CHILDREN WERE BUSED TO SEVERAL WHITE MIDDLE-CLASS SCHOOLS. EVALUATION WAS BASED ON ACHIEVEMENT TESTING AND ON ATTITUDE AND OPINION DATA OBTAINED FROM MOTHERS, TEACHERS, AND CHILDREN. HOWEVER, FINDINGS WERE INCONCLUSIVE BECAUSE THE PROJECT WAS IN OPERATION FOR ONLY FOUR MONTHS. IT IS FELT THAT DATA ON FUTURE CHANGES WOULD BE MORE MEANINGFUL IF ACHIEVEMENT TEST BASELINES WERE ESTABLISHED IN TARGET, NONTARGET, AND RECEIVING SCHOOLS. ATTITUDES OF MOTHERS AND TEACHERS WERE GENERALLY FAVORABLE TO THE PROGRAMS, AND THE GUIDANCE FEATURES WERE WELL-RECEIVED. FINDINGS ON THE SUCCESS OF THE ACHIEVEMENT TRACKS IN THE READING PROGRAMS IN THE HIGH SCHOOLS, WHICH ARE ONLY BRIEFLY DESCRIBED, WERE INCONCLUSIVE. (NH)",

PROGRAMS AT THE SECONDARY LEVEL ARE QUESTIONED BECAUSE OF THE TIME AND CONCENTRATED EFFORT REQUIRED FOR GENERAL EDUCATION AND THE NEED FOR A CONCENTRATION OF RESOURCES AND STAFF TO PROVIDE THE HIGH LEVEL OF TRAINING REQUIRED BY MODERN INDUSTRY. THE POST-SECONDARY SCHOOL IS IN A BETTER POSITION TO DO THIS. GENERAL EDUCATION MUST LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR ALL HIGH-GRADE APPLICATIONS OF KNOWLEDGE BY PROVIDING RELIABLE REPLICATION OF CERTAIN SYMBOLIC SKILLS AND KEY FACTS, RELIABLE HABITS OF ACQUIRING AND USING KNOWLEDGE INTERPRETIVELY, AND A MASS OF LEARNINGS THAT WILL BE USED ASSOCIATIVELY TO ENRICH LIVES AND GIVE THEM INDIVIDUALITY TO SAFELY AND PRODUCTIVELY UTILIZE THE BENEFITS OF A  LARGE-SCALE MACHINE INDUSTRY. NOT ONLY A HIGH ORDER OF VOCATIONAL SKILL IS NEEDED, BUT ALSO A HIGHER ORDER OF CITIZENSHIP AND PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT. AUTOMATION CAN PROVIDE THE ADDED PRODUCTIVITY TO MAINTAIN AND EXPLOIT A TECHNOLOGICALLY SOPHISTICATED CULTURE FOR FURTHER BENEFITS. VOCATIONAL EDUCATION HAS TO BECOME FORMAL AND MORE CONSCIOUSLY AND EXTENSIVELY BASED ON THEORY. VOCATIONAL STATESMEN SHOULD SIT ON THE BOARDS OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN EVERY MAJOR FIRM AND GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY TO SHAPE THE EDUCATIONAL STRATEGY. THERE SHOULD NOT BE A LAG OF 15 TO 20 YEARS BETWEEN THE MANPOWER NEEDS OF THE NATION AND EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES FOR MEETING THEM, BUT A LEAD TIME OF A DECADE. REBUTTALS BY STEPHENIE G.

OF THE 167 GIRLS WHO LEFT SCHOOL IN BURLINGTON, VERMONT, DURING THE JUNIOR OR SENIOR YEAR FROM JANUARY 1960 TO JUNE 1963, 20 OF THE 40 WHO MARRIED WERE INTERVIEWED. QUESTIONS COVERED PERSONAL DATA, PRESENT MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND EVALUATION OF EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES. SCHOOL RECORDS PROVIDED FACTS ON INTELLIGENCE AND ACHIEVEMENT. THE AVERAGE AGE OF THE WIVES AT MARRIAGE WAS 17.1 YEARS, THAT OF THE HUSBANDS 19.5 YEARS. FIFTY PERCENT WERE PREMARITALLY PREGNANT. THE MEDIAN GRADE LEVEL ACHIEVED BY BOTH HUSBANDS AND WIVES WAS LESS THAN GRADE 9. MOST OF THE COUPLES WERE NOT  DOING WELL FINANCIALLY. THE EXTENSION PROGRAM HAD BEEN INEFFECTIVE WITH THIS GROUP. IMPLICATIONS ARE -- (1) THE POTENTIAL DROPOUT CAN BE IDENTIFIED AND SHOULD BE PLACED IN A PROGRAM TO FIT HER NEEDS, (2) EXTENSION HOME ECONOMICS PROGRAMS SHOULD MAKE PROVISIONS FOR THIS GROUP, AND (3) PROFESSIONAL HOME ECONOMICS TRAINING SHOULD PROVIDE UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE LOWER SOCIOECONOMIC GROUPS.

APPROXIMATELY 1,500 TEST ITEMS WERE PREPARED FOR EACH TRADE AREA. THESE WERE  SCREENED, EVALUATED, AND DIVIDED INTO 3 FORMS FOR EACH TRADE AREA. EACH FORM CONTAINED ABOUT 300 ITEMS. THE COMMITTEES WHICH EVALUATED THE WRITTEN EXAMS ALSO MADE RECOMMENDATIONS CONCERNING PERFORMANCE TEST CONTENT, AND DEVELOPED A LIST OF EXPERIENCES. IT WAS CONCLUDED -- (1) WELL DESIGNED EXAMINATIONS HAVE VALUE IN TEACHER CERTIFICATION, (2) PHASE II WILL DECIDE THEIR USEFULNESS AND VALIDITY, (3) EXAMINATIONS CAN BE EFFECTIVE IN DETERMINING TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE, INCREASING THE NUMBER OF TEACHERS, INDICATING WEAKNESSES IN THOSE PERSONS WHO FAIL, AND IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF TEACHERS.

THE MATERIAL WAS DEVELOPED BY AN INDIVIDUAL AUTHOR FOR USE IN TRADE SCHOOL PREPARATORY AND EXTENSION CLASSES FOR MALE ADULTS WHO PLAN TO OPERATE BOATS. IT IS MAINLY CONCERNED WITH CHARTS, COMPASSES, AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS OF NAVIGATION AND THEIR USE IN FINDING A VESSEL'S POSITION. THE OPERATIONAL ILLUSTRATIONS USED WERE TAKEN FROM SITUATIONS WHICH OCCUR IN SMALL CRAFT OPERATION IN THE GULF OF MEXICO. THE AREAS OF INSTRUCTION ARE RULES AND REGULATIONS, AIDS TO NAVIGATION, AND THE MARINE COMPASS AND PILOTING. EACH AREA IS DIVIDED INTO LESSONS WHICH CONTAIN TECHNICAL INFORMATION, LINE-DRAWING ILLUSTRATIONS, AND PROBLEM  SOLVING EXERCISES. THIS MATERIAL WAS DESIGNED FOR PERSONS WITH SOME SEA EXPERIENCE AS WELL AS FOR THOSE JUST STARTING THE STUDY OF NAVIGATION. THE TEACHER MUST BE SKILLED IN THE OPERATION AND NAVIGATION OF BOATS. THE APPENDIXES ARE COMMON NAUTICAL TERMS, EQUIPMENT REQUIRED ON MOTOR BOATS, HOW SAFE A SKIPPER ARE YOU, AND INTRODUCTION TO FIRST AID. THIS DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE IN SINGLE COPY ONLY FOR $2.00 FROM VOCATIONAL CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT AND RESEARCH CENTER, P.O. BOX 657, NATCHITOCHES, LOUISIANA 71457.

INDUSTRIAL PRAXIOLOGY IS THE APPROPRIATE CONCERN OF INDUSTRIAL ARTS. IT WAS ASSUMED THAT (1) INDUSTRIAL ARTS IS A STUDY OF INDUSTRY, (2) MAN HAS  BEEN AND REMAINS CURIOUS ABOUT INDUSTRY, AND (3) INDUSTRY IS SO VAST A SOCIETAL INSTITUTION THAT, FOR INSTRUCTIONAL PURPOSES, EMPHASIS MUST BE PLACED ON A SYSTEM OF BASIC PRINCIPLES, CONCEPTS, AND UNIFYING THEMES. OTHER INDUSTRIAL ARTS CURRICULUM PROPOSALS AND SYSTEMS OF INDUSTRIAL CLASSIFICATION ARE EXAMINED IN AN EFFORT TO FIND A SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE FOR INDUSTRIAL ARTS.

THE PURPOSE OF THE CONFERENCE WAS THE DEVELOPMENT OF GUIDELINES FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF RESEARCH IN MUSIC EDUCATION. THE PROBLEMS DISCUSSED INCLUDED THE NATURE OF RESEARCH PECULIAR TO MUSIC EDUCATION, AS DIFFERENTIATED FROM OTHER FIELDS OF RESEARCH, SUCH AS MUSIC HISTORY, MUSIC THEORY, MUSIC PERFORMANCE, EDUCATION, PSYCHOLOGY, AND SOCIOLOGY. PRIORITY AREAS FOR RESEARCH WERE IDENTIFIED, MOST OF THEM BEING UNINVESTIGATED BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS IN THE TEACHING AND LEARNING OF MUSIC IN THE SCHOOLS. THE NEED TO REDESIGN  GRADUATE EDUCATION IN ORDER TO DEVELOP A VARIETY OF VERSATILE RESEARCHERS WHO CAN IDENTIFY AND EXAMINE CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS IN MUSIC EDUCATION WAS AGREED UPON. THE ORGANIZATIONAL FORMS FOR FACILITATING RESEARCH WERE DISCUSSED AND RECOMMENDATIONS MADE. METHODS FOR THE MORE EFFICIENT USE OF RESEARCH WERE DISCUSSED AND SUGGESTIONS PROJECTED. THESE DELIBERATIONS WERE INCLUDED IN FIVE COMMITTEE REPORTS UNDER THE GENERAL HEADING &quot;PROJECTIONS FOR CHANGE IN RESEARCH IN MUSIC EDUCATION.&quot; THE CONFERENCE PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED SEVENTEEN MUSIC EDUCATORS WHO WERE SELECTED ON SEVERAL BASES--(1) RECOGNIZED RESEARCHERS IN MUSIC EDUCATION, (2) MEMBERS OF THE MUSIC EDUCATORS RESEARCH COUNCIL, AND (3) INDIVIDUALS IMPORTANT TO MUSIC EDUCATION RESEARCH.

THE AUTHOR STATES THAT THERE ARE TWO IMPORTANT GENERALIZATIONS TO BE MADE IN THE EVALUATION OF INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS--GENERALIZING THE PROGRAM RESULTS AND THE SKILLS OF THE PARTICIPATING STUDENT. BOTH GENERALIZATIONS REQUIRE A SYSTEMATIC DESCRIPTION OR TAXONOMY OF TASKS. THE DESCRIPTION MUST IDENTIFY GENERAL CATEGORIES OF SKILLS, AS WELL AS TASK DIMENSIONS WHICH MAY AFFECT THE QUALITY OF TASK PERFORMANCE. TO IDENTIFY TASK DIMENSIONS, THE EVALUATOR MUST CLASSIFY THE BASIC COGNITIVE SKILLS PERTINENT TO HIS RESEARCH. SOME EXISTING CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS ARE BASED ON TASK ANALYSIS, EMPHASIZE TASK CHARACTERISTICS, AND ARE  USED TO IDENTIFY PSYCHOLOGICAL AND/OR EDUCATIONAL PROCESSES.

THE AUTHOR SUGGESTS THAT SUCH SYSTEMS SHOULD BE AS COMPREHENSIVE AS POSSIBLE SO ANY NUMBER OF COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS COULD BE FIT INTO THE SYSTEM FOR CONSIDERATION. COMPREHENSIVENESS WOULD ALLOW ALL TASKS TO BE CLASSIFIED UNAMBIGUOUSLY IN TERMS WHICH ARE PSYCHOLOGICALLY MEANINGFUL. THE AUTHOR ALSO SUGGESTS THAT GUILFORD'S MODEL IS PROBABLY THE MOST SYSTEMATIC AND INCLUSIVE OF CURRENT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS AND USES IT AS A FOCUS FOR COMPARING OTHER ANALYSES OF COGNITIVE PROCESSES. FOLLOWING THE ANALYSES OF POSSIBLE TYPES OF COGNITIVE PROCESSES, A  DISCUSSION WAS PRESENTED OF THE STEPS NECESSARY TO CONSTRUCT A SCALE WHICH (1) WILL MEASURE PROCESS GENERALIZATION OVER DIFFERENT CONTENTS OR WITH DIFFERENT TASKS AND (2) WILL BE A SCALE ALONG WHICH EMPIRICAL RESULTS CAN BE GENERALIZED.

THE EXPERIMENTS WERE DESIGNED TO TEST THE QUITE DIFFERENT IMPLICATIONS OF TWO THEORIES OF LEARNING--INCREMENTAL AND ALL-OR-NONE. FOUR CONDITIONS ON THE LENGTH OF THE POST-IF INTERVAL WERE USED--(1) SUB-OPTIMAL LENGTH ON ALL TRIALS, (2) SUB-OPTIMAL AFTER CORRECT RESPONSES, BUT NEAR OPTIMAL AFTER INCORRECT RESPONSES, (3) NEAR OPTIMAL AFTER CORRECT RESPONSES, BUT SUB-OPTIMAL AFTER INCORRECT RESPONSES, AND (4) NEAR OPTIMAL LENGTH ON ALL TRIALS. EXPERIMENT 1 CONSISTED OF 60  COLLEGE SUBJECTS WHO WERE SHOWN GEOMETRIC FIGURES THAT WERE VARIED IN SIX CHARACTERISTICS. EACH SUBJECT WAS TO CATEGORIZE THE FIGURES BY USING FOUR RESPONSE KEYS. ANALYSES OF TRIALS AND ERRORS SUPPORTED THE ASSUMPTION THAT LEARNING OCCURS ON ALL TRIALS AS SUGGESTED BY THE THEORIES BASED ON THE INCREMENTAL, ASSOCIATIVE PRINCIPLES. EXPERIMENT 2 USED 144 SUBJECTS WITH TWO RESPONSE KEYS, AND FOUND THAT THE RESULTS WERE SIMILAR BUT LESS CONSISTENT REGARDING EVERY-TRIAL LEARNING.

COMPETENCE IS USED TO REFER TO AN ORGANISM'S CAPACITY TO INTERACT EFFECTIVELY WITH ITS ENVIRONMENT. WHITE CONTENDS THAT COMPETENCE IS THE RESULT OF GRADUAL LEARNING BY ORGANISM-ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION. COMPETENCE MOTIVATION, CALLED \"EFFECTANCE\" BY WHITE, IS DESCRIBED AS DIRECTED, SELECTIVE, AND PERSISTENT BECAUSE IT SATISFIES AN INTRINSIC NEED TO COPE WITH THE ENVIRONMENT. THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE MOTIVATION THEORIES OF HULL, SPENCE, PAVLOV, AND BERLYNE ARE  ALSO REVIEWED BRIEFLY IN RELATION TO WHITE'S THEORY. THE AUTHORS CONCLUDE THAT WHITE'S THEORY OF COMPETENCE AND COMPETENCE MOTIVATION IS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLIGENT BEHAVIOR.

TEACHING DONE BY PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS WAS SCRUTINIZED BY CAMERA, TAPE RECORDER, AND TRAINED OBSERVERS TO DISCOVER HOW THESE TEACHERS INTERACTED WITH CHILDREN, WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE THEY WERE, AND HOW THE CHILDREN RESPONDED TO THEM. THE AUTHORS REPORT FINDINGS ON (1) THE TEACHERS' CONCERNS ABOUT THEMSELVES AND THEIR TASKS AS TEACHERS, (2) INDIVIDUAL TEACHING STYLES, (3) METHODS OF \"SOLVING\" THE PROBLEM CHILD, (4) METHODS OF GATHERING INFORMATION RELEVANT TO THE STUDENTS AND TEACHING PROBLEMS, (5) FORMULATING HELPFUL HYPOTHESES, (6) TESTING HYPOTHESES, (7) THE USE OF CLASSROOM RESOURCES, AND (8) HOW ADMINISTRATORS CAN HELP.

DEVELOPMENT OF A TRANSFORMATION OF THE EDUCATIONAL ENCOUNTERS IN \"PRE- AND EARLY-ADOLESCENT EDUCATION\" WAS SUGGESTED AS A WAY OF AWAKENING KNOWLEDGE-SEEKING BEHAVIOR IN BOYS AND GIRLS DURING THAT PERIOD OF THEIR LIVES.

THE FIRST TWO LEVELS MAKE UP THE SOCIETY'S CULTURAL SYSTEM, AND THE OTHERS ARE ALL PART OF THE SOCIAL SYSTEM. THE LEVELS ALL POINT TO THE PATTERNING THAT CAN BE FOUND IN HUMAN SOCIETIES.

IT DEALS WITH THE ROLE OF VALUES IN THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM. THE TOPIC IS APPROACHED IN FOUR PROBLEM AREAS, TWO IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION AND TWO IN ITS METHODOLOGY. THE FOUR AREAS ARE--(1) CAN ONE JUSTIFY TRYING TO CHANGE STUDENT VALUES AT ALL, (2) CAN ONE JUSTIFY ONE PARTICULAR SET OF VALUES TOWARDS WHICH ONE SHOULD DIRECT ONE'S STUDENTS, (3) CAN ONE EVER DEMONSTRATE THE OCCURRENCE OF CHANGES IN STUDENT VALUES DUE TO THE EDUCATIONAL FACTOR, AND (4) CAN ONE MEASURE STUDENT VALUES IN ANY IMPORTANT SENSE. THESE PROBLEM AREAS ARE DISCUSSED UNDER SEVEN GENERAL HEADINGS--(1) VALUE-FREE AND VALUE-INVOLVED POSITIONS, (2) VALUE VALIDATION  PROCEDURE, (3) PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES FOR EDUCATION, (4) STUDENT VALUES, (5) MORAL ISSUES, (6) TEACHING VALUES, AND (7) PROBLEMS OF TESTING. IN CONCLUDING, THE AUTHOR SUGGESTS THAT MUCH OF THE EMPIRICAL WORK RAISES DEEP AND IMPORTANT QUESTIONS.

THERE WAS A 94.4 PERCENT RETURN. ALL DOCTORAL PROGRAMS WERE AFFILIATED WITH A UNIVERSITY, 11.8 PERCENT IN SEPARATE DEPARTMENTS, 17.6 PERCENT CONJOINED WITH OTHER AREAS OF EDUCATION, AND 41.2 PERCENT OPERATING WITHIN DEPARTMENTS OF EDUCATION. RESPONDENTS INDICATED THAT FEW ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES WERE PLANNED WITHIN THE NEXT THREE YEARS. OFFICIAL TITLES OF PROGRAMS WERE TOO VARIED TO PROVIDE A CLUSTER FOR ANALYSIS. THERE AVERAGED THREE AND ONE-HALF FACULTY MEMBERS  PER PROGRAM WITH 18 ADVISEES (11 DOCTORAL CANDIDATES AND SEVEN MASTER'S) FOR EACH. FACULTY MEMBERS DEVOTED 52 PERCENT OF THEIR TIME TO TEACHING, 21 PERCENT TO ADMINISTRATION, AND 27 PERCENT TO RESEARCH.

PARENT EDUCATION IS DESIGNED TO IMPROVE HOUSEKEEPING, STRENGTHEN INTERFAMILY RELATIONSHIPS, REINFORCE FAMILY-SCHOOL UNDERSTANDING, AND IMPROVE PERSONAL SKILLS. PRACTITIONERS RECOMMEND A BOLD AND ASSERTIVE STYLE OF LEADERSHIP AND THE MAINTENANCE OF FRANKNESS AND TRUST. AS A RESULT OF THE SURVEY AND REPORTS OF PROGRAMS, IT WAS FOUND THAT SOME PROGRAMS HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL, INCLUDING DISCUSSION GROUPS, RECREATIONAL, SOCIAL, AND WORKSHOP TYPE ACTIVITIES. ACTIVITY PROGRAMS SEEMED TO BE MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN DISCUSSION. WORKERS REPORTED DIFFICULTIES IN ORGANIZING AND SUSTAINING PROGRAMS. THE ABSENCE OF OBJECTIVE METHODS OF  EVALUATION MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO REPORT ON THE OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PARENT EDUCATION PROGRAMS. SUCCESS WAS FREQUENTLY GAUGED NOT ACCORDING TO ANNOUNCED PRACTICAL GOALS BUT ACCORDING TO CERTAIN INFERRED THERAPEUTIC SIDE-EFFECTS OF PARTICIPATION, SUCH AS SELF-CONFIDENCE. A FEW DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS OFFERED SLIGHT OR NO EVIDENCE THAT PARENT EDUCATION IS EFFECTIVE IN ALTERING ATTITUDES OR BEHAVIOR OF LOW-INCOME FAMILIES.

IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS (BOTH REPEATING THE SAME SWEDISH SENTENCES), A SPECTROGRAM SEGMENTATION METHOD WAS USED, ANALYZING THE MANNER OF PRODUCTION AND CORRESPONDING ACOUSTIC CORRELATES OF THE SOURCE FEATURES AND RESONATOR FEATURES. SPECTROGRAMS REVEALED THAT THE DEAF BOYS' SPEECH DEVIATED FROM NORMAL PATTERNS IN VARIOUS WAYS, PARTICULARLY IN AN ERRATIC TRANSITION IN SOME PARTS OF THE VOWEL. IN ADDITION, THE ARTICULATION WAS NOT ALWAYS UNDER CONTROL, AND THE DEAF BOYS HAD DIFFICULTY WITH FRICATIVE ASPIRATION.  THE SECOND PART OF THIS TWO-PART STUDY DESCRIBES A SPECTROGRAM SEGMENTATION TECHNIQUE IN WHICH SEGMENT BOUNDARIES COINCIDE WITH A CHANGE IN THE FEATURE COMPOSITION. AN EARLIER MODEL WAS LIMITED BY THE FACT THAT SLIGHT SHIFTS IN THE TIMING OF FEATURES CAUSED NEW SEGMENTS TO ARISE. ALSO, TIME DURATION OF SEGMENTS WAS NOT INDICATED. THE REPRESENTATION OF FEATURES AS A FUNCTION OF TIME WAS CONSIDERED MORE ADVANTAGEOUS, AND THEREFORE, A COMPARISON OF THE DURATION OF PHONEMES BETWEEN NORMAL HEARING AND DEAF SUBJECTS WAS CARRIED OUT. THE RESULTS SHOW A MUCH LOWER RATE OF SPEAKING FOR DEAF SUBJECTS.

PROBLEMS OF STUDENTS FROM DEPRESSED AREAS, AND PREVENTATIVE COUNSELING WERE POINTS OF EMPHASIS. THE  STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM WAS--TWO WEEKS WERE SPENT STUDYING VOCATIONAL MATERIAL, TWO WEEKS EMPHASIZED COUNSELING INTERVIEWS HELD BY THE TRAINEES WITH CLIENTS FROM A VOCATIONAL-TECHNICAL SCHOOL, AND ONE WEEK WAS DEVOTED TO A JOINT SESSION OF TRAINEES AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM THEIR ADMINISTRATIONS.

THERE WAS MODERATE STABILITY OF INDIVIDUAL CHOICES BETWEEN THE FALL AND SPRING TESTING. WHEN THE COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY ENVIRONMENT SCALE (CUES) SCORES FOR EACH COLLEGE WERE CORRELATED WITH THE PERCENT OF STUDENTS FOR EACH RO, THE RESULTING COEFFICIENTS SHOWED PATTERNS CONSISTENT WITH EXPECTATION.

NORMAL AND ABNORMAL BEHAVIOR DIFFER ONLY IN THE TERMS OF THE EVALUATIVE CRITERIA USED. THE BEHAVIOR THERAPY TRAINEE MUST LEARN A NEW VIEW OF PEOPLE. HE MUST VIEW THE TARGET BEHAVIOR AS A NORMAL, APPROPRIATE, AND REASONABLE OUTCOME OF PAST AND CONTINUING EXPERIENCE. THE TRAINEE MUST EXAMINE PEOPLE AND THEIR ACTIONS, THE CONDITIONS ELICITING THEIR BEHAVIORS, AND ALTERNATIVE BEHAVIORS. SINCE THE TARGET BEHAVIOR IS CONSIDERED A RESULT OF LEARNING, IT MUST BE DEALT WITH IN A SITUATION AS CLOSE AS  POSSIBLE TO THE TARGET. THIS MAY REQUIRE PARENTS, TEACHERS, OR PEERS AS REINFORCERS. THE WIDE VARIETY OF PEOPLE INVOLVED IN BEHAVIOR THERAPY HAS TWO MAJOR IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PSYCHOLOGIST. HE MUST TEACH PRINCIPLES AND PROGRAM AN ENVIRONMENT.

SIX GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF INNOVATORS ARE LISTED--(1) THEY ARE GENERALLY YOUNG, (2) THEY HAVE RELATIVELY HIGH SOCIAL STATUS IN TERMS OF AMOUNT OF EDUCATION, PRESTIGE RATINGS, AND INCOME, (3) IMPERSONAL AND INFORMED SOURCES OF INFORMATION ARE IMPORTANT TO THEM, (4) THEY ARE COSMOPOLITE, (5) THEY EXERT OPINION LEADERSHIP, AND (6) THEY ARE LIKELY TO BE VIEWED AS DEVIANTS BY THEIR PEERS AND BY THEMSELVES. FOUR IMPLICATIONS FOR SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS ARE SUGGESTED--(1) THERE IS A HIGH DEGREE OF RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES OF A SCHOOL SYSTEM AND ITS INNOVATIVENESS, (2) THE SOCIAL  CHARACTERISTICS, SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND COMMUNICATION BEHAVIOR OF THE MEMBERS OF THE SCHOOL STAFF ARE RELATED TO THE INNOVATIVENESS OF THEIR SCHOOL SYSTEM, (3) SCHOOL SYSTEM POLICIES MAY AFFECT THE INNOVATIVENESS OF THE TEACHER, AND (4) THE ABSENCE OF AGENTS THAT PROMOTE CHANGE MAY BE A FACTOR IN THE RELATIVE SLOWNESS WITH WHICH SCHOOLS ADOPT INNOVATIONS.

FEW TEACHERS UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF RESEARCH OR ITS RELATION TO SOUND EDUCATIONAL PLANNING, AND THE VALUE OF THEORY IS FREQUENTLY CONFUSED WITH MERE SPECULATION.

FOR TEACHERS, THE MEASURE CONTAINED STATEMENTS EXPRESSING THEIR VIEWS REGARDING FOUR TEACHER ROLES (TEACHER ACTION TOWARD PUPILS, COLLEAGUES, PARENTS, AND COMMUNITY) AND WHAT THEY BELIEVED TO BE THE VIEWS OF EACH OF THE OTHER POPULATIONS IN THE STUDY. MEMBERS OF THE NONTEACHING POPULATIONS WERE ASKED TO RESPOND TO EACH ROLE NORM STATEMENT BY INDICATING HOW THEY  THOUGHT TEACHERS SHOULD ACT. FINDINGS INDICATED THAT ROLE CONSENSUS IS LESS THAN 50 PERCENT AMONG TEACHERS AND BETWEEN TEACHERS AND OTHERS. CONSENSUS OF THE NONTEACHING POPULATIONS REGARDING TEACHER BEHAVIOR EXPECTATIONS IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO ROLE MEMBERSHIP. BECAUSE THERE IS LITTLE AGREEMENT AMONG OTHER POPULATIONS ABOUT TEACHER ROLE EXPECTATIONS, TEACHERS DO NOT REGARD THEIR NORMATIVE STRUCTURE AS MANDATORY. THE AUTHOR CONCLUDED THAT (1) ROLE NORM AGREEMENT, EVEN AMONG PROFESSIONALS, MAY RANGE FROM NEAR ZERO TO NEAR 100 PERCENT, (2) ROLE NORMS FOR ALL POPULATIONS THROUGHOUT THE CULTURE SEEM TO BE AMBIGUOUS, (3) THE NORMATIVE STRUCTURE IS FAIRLY PERMISSIVE, AND (4) TEACHERS CONSEQUENTLY HAVE DIFFICULTY IN ACCURATELY PERCEIVING THE NORMATIVE EXPECTATIONS OF OTHER POPULATIONS REGARDING  TEACHER BEHAVIOR.

TREATMENTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO GROUPS OF FIVE SUBJECTS. THE 80 SUBJECTS WERE MOSTLY COLLEGE STUDENTS. THE VISUAL PORTION OF A 12-MINUTE FILM WAS USED FOR THE &quot;MOVEMENT&quot; TREATMENT. THE NON-MOVEMENT OR &quot;FILMOGRAPH&quot; TREATMENT REPLACED EACH SHOT IN THE ORIGINAL WITH  A SINGLE FRAME SHOWN FOR THE DURATION OF THE SHOT. FACTUAL NARRATION WAS ADDED TO BOTH VERSIONS SO LEARNING COULD BE MEASURED. FACTOR ANALYZED SEMANTIC DIFFERENTIAL RATINGS WERE USED TO MEASURE ATTITUDES. TREATMENT GROUPS WERE COMPARED BY ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE. THE MOVEMENT GROUPS SCORED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ON ATTITUDE EVALUATION OF THE FILM BUT NOT ON EMOTIONAL RESPONSE TO THE FILM AS MEASURED BY GSR. A RISE IN GSR RATINGS INDICATES GSR MAY BE A USEFUL MEASURE OF AUDIENCE RESPONSE.

THE IMPACT OF PHILOGICAL AND LINGUISTIC STUDIES OF \"EXOTIC LANGUAGES\" ON TRADITIONAL GRAMMATICAL CONCEPTS AND TERMINOLOGY IS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE PRESENTATION. SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OBTAINING EXCELLENCE IN CLASSROOM LANGUAGE LEARNING INCLUDE (1) CHOOSING MODERN TEXTBOOKS CONSTRUCTED ON AUDIO-LINGUISTIC PRINCIPLES, (2) DELAYING THE TEACHING OF WRITING AT LEAST A YEAR (LONGER, IF POSSIBLE) AFTER THE BEGINNING OF STUDY, (3) TEACHING PUPILS TO SPEAK BY LETTING THEM SPEAK A LOT, ABOUT PRACTICAL MATTERS, (4) ELABORATING ON PUPILS' WORK USING METHODS OF AUDIO-LINGUAL REINFORCEMENT,  (5) LETTING INITIATION TO WRITING BE PRECEDED BY SEVERAL YEARS OF READING, AND (6) MAKING WRITING CONSIST OF TAKING DICTATION, DOING TRANSFORMATION EXERCISES, AND RESPONDING IN FRENCH TO QUESTIONS ASKED IN FRENCH. A RECENT CALCULATION HAS ESTIMATED THAT IT TAKES 1,200 HOURS TO LEARN TO SPEAK FRENCH WELL. THIS MEANS 8 ACADEMIC YEARS OF 5 ONE-HOUR CLASSES PER WEEK, PLUS ONE FULL HOUR'S HOMEWORK PER CLASS.

THE THIRD AND MAJOR CONCERN IS  THE STUDENTS, AND CHAPTERS IX AND X DISCUSS SUCH RELATED ISSUES AS (1) TO WHAT EXTENT SEVENTH-, EIGHTH-, AND NINTH-GRADERS ARE CAPABLE OF MAKING INFERENCES, (2) WHETHER THEY CAN ADJUST RATIONALLY TO PROBABILISTIC INFORMATION AND TO CONTRADICTORY CUES, AND (3) WHETHER THIS WILL ENHANCE THEIR FOREIGN LANGUAGE ACHIEVEMENT.

ALSO, THE CHARGE OF SUBJECTIVITY CAN BE DISMISSED IF TEACHERS WILL CHOOSE AND ASSESS PASSAGES FOR TRANSLATION CAREFULLY, DETERMINE A SCALE OF MARKS AND AN INDEX OF DIFFICULTY FOR DIFFERENT STAGES IN THE COURSE, AND GRADE THE PASSAGES BY A  RATIONAL MARKING SCHEME AND A SET OF RULINGS ON VARIANTS.

ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE A HIGH REGARD FOR THE WORK OF THE JUNIOR COLLEGE, THEY FEAR THAT COURSE CONTENT MAY DIMINISH BECAUSE OF THE GREAT DEMANDS ON THE JUNIOR INSTITUTIONS. THEY HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE UNIVERSITY-WIDE OFFICE OF RELATIONS WITH SCHOOLS, WHICH SUBMITS PROPOSED COURSES TO THE UNIVERSITY'S DIRECTOR OF ADMISSIONS TO DECIDE IF THEY ARE UNIVERSITY-EQUIVALENT OR OTHERWISE APPROPRIATE FOR A DEGREE. THIS PROCESS, WHILE SLOW, DOES WORK AND TRANSFER PROBLEMS HAVE NOT BEEN GREAT. UNDER THE TRIPARTITE SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION, HOWEVER, THE JUNIOR COLLEGE FEELS IT SHOULD HAVE MORE VOICE, ESPECIALLY INSOFAR AS THE PRESENT SYSTEM CURTAILS INNOVATION  AND EXPERIMENT.

        "description":"TO DETERMINE THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF JUNIOR COLLEGE INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH, 336 RESPONSES TO A QUESTIONNAIRE WERE ANALYZED, AND SIX INSTITUTIONS WITH RESEARCH PROGRAMS WERE STUDIED IN DEPTH. IN GENERAL, THE COLLEGES WERE CHARACTERIZED BY LACK OF FORMAL INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH PROGRAMS, SPECIFIC POLICY OR BUDGET PROVISIONS FOR RESEARCH, ADEQUATE RESEARCH STAFF, AND PROVISION FOR EVALUATION OF RESEARCH. THE MOST COMMON USES OF RESEARCH WERE DECISION MAKING, CURRICULUM PLANNING, ESTABLISHMENT OF GOALS, PREPARATION FOR ACCREDITATION, AND PLANNING FOR FUTURE NEEDS. FINDINGS INDICATED THAT THERE WAS NEED IN EACH JUNIOR COLLEGE FOR (1) A BASIC PHILOSOPHY OF INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH, (2) ADEQUATE FINANCIAL SUPPORT, (3) DESIGNATED RESPONSIBILITY FOR RESEARCH, (4) INVOLVEMENT OF STAFF  MEMBERS, (5) ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING FOR RESEARCH WORKERS, AND (6) EFFECTIVE USE AND DISSEMINATION OF RESEARCH FINDINGS.

IN ADDITION TO LEARNING ABOUT THE REQUIREMENTS OF AN OCCUPATION, THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING NEEDED FOR ENTRY, EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, WORKING CONDITIONS, AND SALARIES, THE STUDENTS HAD OPPORTUNITIES FOR SELF-APPRAISAL AND COUNSELING, THUS ACQUIRING A BASIS FOR MAKING VALID CAREER DECISIONS. THE COUNSELORS' WORKSHOP WAS INTENDED TO HELP PARTICIPANTS TO GROW IN COUNSELING SKILLS AND TO INCREASE THEIR UNDERSTANDING  OF THE RANGE AND DEPTH OF THE COLLEGE'S OCCUPATIONAL PROGRAMS. COUNSELORS VISITED THE ORIENTATION CLASSES, WORKED WITH THE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS UNDER SUPERVISION OF THE COLLEGE COUNSELORS ASSIGNED TO THE PROJECT, WENT ON FIELD TRIPS TO OBSERVE WORKERS AND LEARN ABOUT TECHNICAL OCCUPATIONS, AND PARTICIPATED IN SEMINARS. BOTH STUDENTS AND FACULTY REACTED FAVORABLY TO THE PROGRAM. (WO)",

FORTY-SEVEN INSTITUTIONS SENT DATA ON 76 LCCC STUDENTS. SOME REPORTED BOTH CREDITS TRANSFERRED AND GPA, OTHERS REPORTED ONLY THE TRANSFER CREDITS. TABLES SHOW THE VARIOUS FINDINGS, IN PERCENTAGES AND IN ABSOLUTE FIGURES. THE CONCLUSIONS ARE THAT LCCC STUDENTS CAN TRANSFER SUCCESSFULLY TO BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COLLEGES IN OHIO AND ELSEWHERE IN THE NATION. OF THEIR ELIGIBLE WORK, 99.35 PERCENT WAS ACCEPTED.

FOR EACH COLLEGE, A POSSIBLE MAXIMUM COMMUTING DISTANCE OF 50 OR 60 MILES (1 1/4 HOURS) WAS SELECTED, DEPENDING ON HIGHWAY FACILITIES.  AFTER POPULATION, GEOGRAPHICAL FACTORS, AND EXISTING COLLEGES WERE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT, IT WAS DECIDED THAT 54 DISTRICTS WOULD GIVE THE RESIDENTS OF ALL 254 COUNTIES REASONABLE ACCESS TO A JUNIOR COLLEGE. SOME OF THE LARGER, MORE THINLY POPULATED DISTRICTS MAY NEED TWO CAMPUSES TO MEET THE PROXIMITY REQUIREMENT. THE ACADEMIC CURRICULUMS ARE EXPECTED TO BE FAIRLY COMPLETE, AND MOST CAMPUSES WILL OFFER THREE OR MORE 1-YEAR VOCATIONAL COURSES AND/OR 2-YEAR TECHNICAL PROGRAMS AS WELL AS NON-CREDIT OR COMMUNITY-SERVICE COURSES.

THE PROGRAM RECRUITS, SELECTS, AND TESTS TEACHER CANDIDATES, AND PROVIDES COUNSELING AND PLACEMENT SERVICES. REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PROGRAM WORK DIRECTLY WITH JUNIOR COLLEGE FACULTY MEMBERS AND ADMINISTRATORS TO IMPROVE EVALUATION PROCEDURES, RECRUITING PRACTICES, AND RESEARCH APPROACHES. THE PREPARATION PROGRAM WISHES TO FOCUS THE JUNIOR COLLEGE ON ITS PRIME PURPOSE OF CAUSING LEARNING. THE EIGHT UNITS OF THE JUNIOR COLLEGE CURRICULUM COURSE  COVER (1) COMPREHENSION OF THE FUNCTIONS, FACILITIES, AND STUDENTS OF THE JUNIOR COLLEGE, (2) THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CURRICULUM, (3) LEARNING (PRINCIPLES OF CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION), (4) CRITERIA AND CLASSIFICATION OF GOALS AND OBJECTIVES, (5) TESTS AND ASSESSMENTS (EFFECT OF A CURRICULUM ON EACH PUPIL), (6) INSTRUCTIONAL MEDIA (AND THEIR APPROPRIATE USE), (7) BUILDING A JUNIOR COLLEGE COURSE, AND (8) PERIODIC ASSESSMENT OF CURRICULUM AND INSTRUCTION (TO MEET CHANGING NEEDS AND MAINTAIN RELEVANCE).

ALTHOUGH THE ADMINISTRATOR CANNOT BE AS CREATIVE AS THE LITERATURE OF THE PROFESSION INFERS, HE CAN INITIATE PROGRAMS AND INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS TO FACILITATE THEM, LARGELY THROUGH BARGAINING WITH BOARD MEMBERS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. INTERPERSONAL TASKS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN TECHNICAL ONES, AND MOST ARE WITH LAY PERSONS OUTSIDE THE LIBRARY STAFF. THE PROFESSION HAS YET TO EVOLVE USEFUL NORMS THAT WILL REDUCE THE STRESSES OF THE EXECUTIVE ROLE AND ENHANCE GOAL ATTAINMENT. THE INTERVIEW SCHEDULE USED FOR THE STUDY IS APPENDED. (AUTHOR)",

        "description":"THE ROLE OF KINDERGARTEN IN THE FUTURE EDUCATIONAL STRUCTURE IS PRESENTLY UNDERGOING REEVALUATION, ESPECIALLY IN THE PENN-TRAFFORD SCHOOL DISTRICT OF HARRISON CITY, PENNSYLVANIA. THE POSSIBILITY OF EXTENDING KINDERGARTEN FROM A HALF-DAY TO A FULL-DAY PROGRAM IS A PRIME AREA OF DEBATE. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT MODERN SOCIETY WILL SOON, IF NOT IMMEDIATELY, DEMAND A KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES A MORE CREATIVE, MORE SUBSTANTIAL CURRICULUM, WITH IMPROVED FACILITIES AND A TEACHER-ATTITUDE FOCUSING MORE ON INSTRUCTION THAN ON BABY-SITTING. A SAMPLE SCHEDULE FOR A FULL-DAY KINDERGARTEN AND A DELINEATION OF ITS GOALS IS PRESENTED IN THIS DOCUMENT. THESE ITEMS ARE BASED ON A PLAN DEVISED BY THE FORT MYER ELEMENTARY SCHOOL OF ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA. THE ESTIMATED COSTS OF IMPLEMENTING SUCH  A PROGRAM IN THE PENN-TRAFFORD SCHOOL DISTRICT ARE DISCUSSED. A STUDY DONE IN HAWAII, WHERE FULL-DAY KINDERGARTENS ARE THE RULE, COMPARES THE VALUE OF HALF-DAY SESSIONS TO FULL-DAY SESSIONS AND IS REPRODUCED IN THIS BROCHURE BECAUSE IT DISCUSSES MANY OF THE PROS AND CONS OF THE 2 TYPES OF KINDERGARTEN SESSIONS OF INTEREST TO THE PENN-TRAFFORD EDUCATORS.

A COMBINATION OF THE POOLED JUDGMENT OF ADULTS, HELP FROM RESEARCH ON CHILDREN, AND HELP FROM THE CHILDREN THEMSELVES IN PLANNING THE USE OF THE SCHOOL DAY TOGETHER WITH AN OPEN CURRICULUM DESIGN WILL FOSTER CONTINUITY IN LEARNING.

AS HE GROWS, HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS GIVE MEANING AND DIRECTION TO THE EXPRESSION OF FEELINGS. AGGRESSION AND ANGER ARE EXPRESSION OF FEELINGS THAT ARE RELATED BUT NOT IDENTICAL. AGGRESSION MAY BE ROOTED IN ANGER, BUT IT POSITIVE SENSE, IT ENABLES THE CHILD TO USE HIS ENVIRONMENT FOR SATISFACTION OF ESSENTIAL NEEDS. THE CHILD DEVELOPS A CAPACITY FOR CONSTRUCTIVE OR DESTRUCTIVE AGGRESSIVE ACTION AND FEELINGS FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF INTERACTING WITH OTHERS. THIS INTERACTION WITH OTHERS IS ALWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH SOME DEGREE OF FRUSTRATION. FRUSTRATION IS A CONTROL IMPOSED ON AN INDIVIDUAL THAT BLOCKS SATISFACTION OF A PHYSICAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL NEED. UNLESS THIS FRUSTRATION IS  OVERLY SEVERE, IT BECOMES A CONSTRUCTIVE FACTOR, TEACHING THE CHILD TO ASSERT HIMSELF. A CHILD'S CAPACITY TO TOLERATE FRUSTRATION CAN BE GREATLY REDUCED BY HUNGER, INSECURITY, PHYSICAL ILLNESS OR FEAR. ANGER CAN BE AGGRESSIVE, BUT IT CAN ALSO BE PASSIVE. A CHILD STRIKING ANOTHER CHILD MAY BE NOT MORE ANGRY THAN A CHILD REFUSING TO LEARN HIS LESSON. IT MAY TAKE ALL A TEACHER'S TOLERANCE AND UNDERSTANDING TO WORK WITH AN ANGRY CHILD.

        "description":"HETEROGENEOUS MIXTURES OF CHILDREN OCCUR NATURALLY IN PLAY AND IN MANY SCHOOL ACTIVITIES, FOR EXAMPLE, STUDENT COUNCIL MEETINGS, CLUBS, AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS. THESE ACTIVITIES DEMAND THE VARIETY OF AGES, TALENTS, INTERESTS, AND EXPERIENCES REPRESENTED BY THE WHOLE RANGE OF STUDENTS IN A SCHOOL. IT IS QUESTIONED WHETHER ACADEMIC ACTIVITIES WOULD NOT ALSO BE GREATLY ENHANCED BY THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF, AND COOPERATION AMONG, A HETEROGENEOUS GROUP OF STUDENTS LEARNING TOGETHER. THE AMERICAN SCHOOL SYSTEM AT PRESENT GENERALLY ORGANIZES STUDENTS INTO CLASSES ACCORDING TO AGE. BECAUSE OF THE ABUNDANT RESEARCH DEMONSTRATING THE VAST DIFFERENCES IN ABILITY AND RATE OF DEVELOPMENT WITHIN ANY ONE AGE GROUP, IT IS ARGUED IN THIS PAMPHLET THAT IT IS PERHAPS HIGHLY ARTIFICIAL TO ORGANIZE CLASSROOMS  BY AGE ALONE. THE STUDY COMMITTEE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONTENT OF THIS PAMPHLET INVESTIGATED BOTH THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF MULTI-AGE GROUPING. IN MULTI-AGE GROUPING, CHILDREN ARE GROUPED RANDOMLY WITH NO PARTICULAR CONSIDERATION OF AGE OR ABILITY, ALTHOUGH IT IS RECOGNIZED THAT NOT ALL AREAS OF STUDY ARE AMENABLE TO SUCH GROUPING. BUT FOR THOSE SUBJECTS LIKE ART, CREATIVE WRITING, AND DISCUSSION PERIODS, IN WHICH VARIED LEVELS OF MATURITY, PERSPECTIVE, AND EXPERIENCE CAN CONTRIBUTE MORE TO THE LEARNING PROCESS, THE LEARNING PROCESS WILL BE MORE LIKELY ENRICHED BY A GREATER HETEROGENEITY OF PUPILS. HETEROGENEOUS INTERACTION OF AGE GROUPS CONTRIBUTES TO SOCIAL GROWTH AND UNDERSTANDING AS WELL AS TO ACADEMIC GROWTH.

THE PROGRAM IS NORMALLY USED WITH PRESCHOOL CHILDREN TO DEVELOP THE BEGINNINGS OF INTELLECTUAL SKILLS WHICH WILL BE OF FUTURE VALUE. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, THIS PROGRAM WAS USED WITH 24 5-YEAR-OLDS IN AN EXPERIMENTAL KINDERGARTEN. AN ORTHODOX KINDERGARTEN CLASS OF 39 CHILDREN WAS THE CONTROL GROUP. ALTHOUGH BOTH KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS BEGAN IN SEPTEMBER, 1966, A PRETEST WAS NOT ADMINISTERED TO THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP UNTIL JANUARY, 1967. THE POSTTEST FOR THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS GIVEN IN MAY, 1967. THE CONTROL  GROUP WAS ADMINISTERED ONLY 1 TEST, THE MAY POSTTEST. THE JANUARY AND MAY TESTS CONSISTED OF (1) TORRANCE TESTS OF CREATIVE THINKING, (2) MOTHER GOOSE PROBLEMS TESTS, AND (3) THE STARKWEATHER TEST OF ORIGINALITY. THE RESULTS WERE FIRST ANALYZED TO COMPARE THE SCORES OF THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP ALONE ON THEIR PRE- AND POSTTESTS. THE CHILDREN IMPROVED ON ALL 9 TESTS, WITH SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT ON 6 OF THEM. A COMPARISON OF THE MAY SCORES OF BOTH THE EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUPS SHOWED THAT THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP SIGNIFICANTLY OUT-PERFORMED THE CONTROLS ON 6 OF THE 8 TESTS ADMINISTERED TO BOTH GROUPS, AND SCORED HIGHER ON THE REMAINING 2 TESTS. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE KINDERGARTEN EXPERIENCE OR THE REACHING OF 5 YEARS OF AGE NEED NOT RESULTS IN SERIOUS DIMINUTION OF A CHILD'S  CREATIVITY. (WD)",

SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL AID WAS PROVIDED TO RETAIN THE DESIRED TEACHER-PUPIL RATIO DURING PERIODS OF PEAK ENROLLMENT.

THESE TWO PROBLEMS CALL FOR OUR CONCENTRATED EFFORTS WITH THE SOLUTION POSSIBLY BEING THE REVERSAL OF THIS MASS MIGRATION.

BASIC OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY INVOLVED COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS BETWEEN REDISTRICTED AND NON-REDISTRICTED SCHOOL SYSTEMS. COMPARISONS WERE MADE TO--(1) DETERMINE THE DIFFERENCE IN OPPORTUNITIES PROVIDED MALE AND FEMALE STUDENTS, (2) ANALYZE DIFFERENCES IN ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE LEVEL OF STUDENTS, (3) DETERMINE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AND EXPENDITURES FOR EDUCATION, AND (4) DETERMINE EFFECTS ON FARMERS' SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONTACTS. FIVE REDISTRICTED COMMUNITIES WERE MATCHED WITH FIVE TRADIONALLY-ORGANIZED SCHOOL DISTRICTS, AND STARTING WITH GRADE 1, STUDENTS WERE COMPARED FOR 12 YEARS.  MATCHING CRITERIA INCLUDED DISTRICT ENROLLMENT, PHYSICAL FACILITIES, SIZE OF COMMUNITY TAX BASE, BUS TRANSPORTATION, AND COMMON INTERESTS. STUDENTS WERE TESTED IN GRADES 1,6,9, AND 12. IT WAS FOUND THAT--(1) OPPORTUNITIES PROVIDED FOR THE EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF STUDENTS WERE GREATER IN REDISTRICTED SCHOOLS, (2) BOTH MALES AND FEMALES FROM REDISTRICTED SCHOOLS PERFORMED BETTER IN ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT, AND (3) ONLY MINOR VARIATIONS IN SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONTACTS EXISTED BETWEEN REDISTRICTED AND NON-REDISTRICTED SCHOOL COMMUNITIES.

CENTRAL TO PROGRAMMING IS THE QUESTION OF WHETHER NEEDS AND CONTENT ARE TO BE IDENTIFIED AND DETERMINED ON THE BASIS OF ANGLO OR MEXICAN AMERICAN CRITERIA. TWO MAJOR STANCES ON THIS ISSUE HAVE DEVELOPED WHICH ARE--(1) THAT THE MEXICAN AMERICAN NEEDS TO LEARN ANGLO BEHAVIORS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND (2) THAT THE MEXICAN AMERICAN SHOULD AND HAS THE RIGHT TO RETAIN HIS OWN CULTURE. THIS PAPER INCLUDES FIVE AREAS OF AN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL IF THE MEXICAN AMERICAN IS TO EXPERIENCE A GOOD EDUCATION. FIRST, THE LANGUAGE NEEDS OF MEXICAN AMERICANS NECESSITATE THE USE OF ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE THROUGH THE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS. SECONDLY, A GREAT DEAL OF EMPHASIS  IS NEEDED IN THE AREA OF COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT. THE THIRD AREA IS THAT OF PROPER AFFECTIVE DEVELOPMENT, WHICH, IF LEFT UNATTENDED, MAY BRING ABOUT GRAVE PSYCHOLOGICAL COSTS. FOURTH, THERE IS A NEED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROGRAMS WHICH WILL FOSTER BETTER INTER-GROUP RELATIONS. THE LAST AREA IS THE NEED FOR GOOD OCCUPATIONAL EDUCATION AT THE SECONDARY LEVEL. (ES)",

IN THIS FIRST PHASE OF THE PROJECT, AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO IDENTIFY UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS OF MEXICAN AMERICAN FAMILIES THAT MAY AFFECT THE EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT OF THEIR CHILDREN. DATA WERE COLLECTED AND ANALYZED FOR 263 HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS (GRADES 7-12) IN A SOUTHWESTERN COMMUNITY. THE STUDENT QUESTIONNAIRE REVEALED 9 INDEPENDENT FACTORS CHARACTERIZING THE EMPHASIS THAT PARENTS PLACE ON EDUCATION, THE LANGUAGE USED IN THE HOME, AND THE CHILD'S SELF-IMAGE AND ACADEMIC MOTIVATION. THE RESULTS OF A PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS SUGGEST THAT MEXICAN AMERICAN CHILDREN MAY NOT HAVE AS MUCH CONFIDENCE IN THEIR ABILITY TO SUCCEED IN SCHOOL AS THEIR CLASSMATES.  FOR EXAMPLE, ACHIEVEMENT IN BOTH ENGLISH AND MATHEMATICS APPEARS TO BE HIGHLY AFFECTED BY THE CHILD'S CONFIDENCE IN HIS ABILITY TO SUCCEED IN SCHOOL AND BY THE EMPHASIS THE PARENTS PLACE ON EDUCATION, WHILE HIS MASTERY OF ENGLISH APPEARS TO BE INFLUENCED BY THE LANGUAGE SPOKEN IN THE HOME AND BY THE FATHER'S EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND. IN CONTRAST, ACHIEVEMENT IN MATHEMATICS APPEARS TO BE RELATED IN THE STUDENT'S DESIRE TO ACHIEVE IN SCHOOL. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO IMPROVE THE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OF MANY MEXICAN AMERICAN CHILDREN BY PROPER DESIGN OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS. (ES)",

THE THREE EXPERIMENTAL READING TREATMENTS WERE (1) THE INITIAL TEACHING ALPHABET (ITA) USED PHONETICALLY, (2) THE WORDS IN COLOR (WIC) PROGRAM, AND (3) A SUPPLEMENTED CONVENTIONAL READING PROGRAM (SCRP) USING A BASIC READER PLUS ADDITIONAL PHONICS MATERIAL. IN ADDITION TO THE READING TREATMENTS, SOME OF THE EXPERIMENTAL CLASSES RECEIVED AN ORAL STIMULATION PROGRAM IN THE FIRST YEAR UTILIZING LEVEL 1 OF THE PEABODY LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT KITS (PLDK). NINE  EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT GROUPS AND ONE CONTROL GROUP WERE ESTABLISHED. PRETESTS AND POST-TESTS WERE ADMINISTERED. ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE, ORTHOGONAL COMPARISONS, AND T TESTS WERE USED TO ANALYZE THE DATA. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE PLDK PROGRAM ENHANCED PERFORMANCE OF DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN IN INTELLECTUAL GROWTH AND IN ORAL LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT, BUT NOT IN SCHOOL ACHIEVEMENT. THE COMBINATION OF ITA AND PLDK WAS LESS EFFECTIVE THAN THE OTHER TREATMENTS. THE SCRP EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT WAS SUPERIOR AT THE .90 LEVEL TO THE WIC AND ITA TREATMENTS, WITH GIRLS SUPERIOR TO BOYS IN ALL CASES. A BIBLIOGRAPHY AND APPENDIXES ARE INCLUDED. (BK)",

TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF FAMILY-HOME VARIABLES ON READING ACHIEVEMENT, THE PEABODY CULTURAL OPPORTUNITY SCALE WAS GIVEN TO DISADVANTAGED FIRST GRADERS IN 12 ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS SERVING THE LOW SOCIOECONOMIC AREAS OF THE COMMUNITY. OBJECTIVE DATA WERE GATHERED ON ROLE MODELS IN THE HOUSEHOLD, THE EDUCATIONAL LEVEL OF HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS, AND ECONOMIC DEPRIVATION. INTELLIGENCE WAS CONTROLLED IN THE ANALYSIS BY USING REGRESSION EQUATION PROCEDURES IN OBTAINING EACH INDIVIDUAL'S STANDARDIZED ACHIEVEMENT SCORE AND BY DIVIDING THE POPULATION INTO INTELLIGENCE CATEGORIES. CHI SQUARE WAS USED TO MEASURE THE EFFECT OF THE THREE FAMILY-HOME VARIABLES ON READING ACHIEVEMENT. RESULTS SHOWED THAT WHILE  VARIATIONS IN THE ROLE MODEL ASSOCIATED WITH THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CHILD'S DEVELOPMENT DID NOT AFFECT READING ACHIEVEMENT, EDUCATIONAL LEVEL SEEMED TO HAVE THE GREATEST EFFECT. READING ACHIEVEMENT WAS HIGHEST WHEN THE EDUCATIONAL LEVEL OF A SISTER WAS HIGHEST, FOLLOWED BY THE FATHER, THEN THE MOTHER. THE SOURCE OF INCOME RATHER THAN THE AMOUNT SEEMED TO BE MORE IMPORTANT.

RESULTS SUPPORT EARLIER FINDINGS THAT  POST-QUESTIONING PRODUCES HIGHER LEARNING, PARTICULARLY WHEN THE PACING OF QUESTIONS IS INCREASED. THE HIGHER THE PACING OF QUESTIONS, THE LARGER THE DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN RELEVANT AND INCIDENTAL RECALL. TOO MUCH EXPOSURE TO THE QUESTIONS DECREASED INCIDENTAL RECALL.

THE  IMMEDIATE REPLAY OF THE VIDEO TAPES HAD A DISTINCT EFFECT ON THEIR BODY IMAGES WHICH MADE THE VIDEO TAPING PROCESS THE DECIDING FACTOR. THE VIDEO TAPES AND REPLAYS WHICH FOLLOWED EACH TAPING SESSION ENABLED THE BOYS TO SEE RESULTS AS THEY OCCURRED. THEY SAW THEMSELVES READING AND HEARD SPEECH ERRORS AND OBSERVED HYPERKINETIC MOVEMENTS OF WHICH THEY WEREN'T AWARE. THE VIDEO TAPES ALSO ENABLED OBSERVATION OF THE DYNAMICS BETWEEN TEACHER AND STUDENTS.

UNSTRUCTURED QUESTIONNAIRES REQUIRING WRITTEN EXPLANATIONS OF WHAT WAS FUNNIEST ABOUT THE STORY AND STRUCTURED QUESTIONNAIRES REQUIRING RESPONSES TO MULTIPLE-CHOICE AND TRUE-FALSE ITEMS WERE DISTRIBUTED RANDOMLY TO THE CLASSES. RESULTS INDICATED THAT CHILDREN OF DIFFERENT SEXES, SOCIOECONOMIC LEVELS, INTELLIGENCE, AND READING ABILITIES RESPONDED DIFFERENTLY TO VARIOUS FORMS OF QUESTIONING ABOUT HUMOR IN LITERATURE. CHILDREN OF HIGH INTELLIGENCE MORE OFTEN JUDGED SELECTIONS  HUMOROUS, AND CHILDREN OF HIGH SOCIOECONOMIC LEVELS AND THOSE OF HIGH READING ABILITIES MADE SIMILAR CHOICES OF TYPES OF HUMOR. SELECTIONS WERE MORE FREQUENTLY JUDGED HUMOROUS IN STRUCTURED QUESTIONNAIRES THAN IN UNSTRUCTURED FORMS BY MORE BOYS THAN GIRLS, BY CHILDREN OF LOW SOCIOECONOMIC LEVELS, AND BY CHILDREN OF LOW AND AVERAGE READING ABILITIES.

EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUPS WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED FROM 119 FIRST-YEAR MEDICAL AND DENTAL STUDENTS IN AN HISTOLOGY CLASS. BOTH GROUPS ATTENDED THE SAME ONE-HOUR LECTURE. FOLLOWING THE LECTURE THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS TWICE SHOWN A FIVE-MINUTE ANIMATED SERIAL FILM THAT HAD BEEN CONSTRUCTED FROM APPROXIMATELY 400 SECTIONS OF HUMAN ORAL TISSUE. THE SECTIONS WERE TAKEN IN AN ORDERLY SEQUENCE FROM THE TISSUE, AND ALTHOUGH TWO-DIMENSIONAL, PRODUCED THE ILLUSION OF THREE-DIMENSIONALITY WHEN SHOWN AS A MOTION PICTURE FILM. THE CONTROL GROUP WAS TWICE SHOWN A SERIES OF FORTY 2 X 2 SLIDES THAT HAD BEEN DEVELOPED FROM KEY SECTIONS  INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL 400. THE SAME NARRATION WAS USED FOR BOTH PRESENTATIONS. AFTER STUDENTS IN BOTH GROUPS HAD BEEN TESTED FOR ACHIEVEMENT, THEY WERE EXPOSED TO THE PRESENTATION THAT THEY HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY SEEN. FOLLOWING THIS VIEWING, STUDENT REACTIONS TO THE TWO APPROACHES WERE SURVEYED. WHEN ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE WAS APPLIED TO ACHIEVEMENT TEST SCORES, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN ACHIEVEMENT WAS DETECTED BETWEEN GROUPS OR BETWEEN MEDICAL AND DENTAL STUDENTS. CHI-SQUARE ANALYSIS OF NON-COGNITIVE, ATTITUDINAL ITEMS REVEALED THAT BOTH THE MEDICAL AND DENTAL STUDENTS PREFERRED THE FILM TO SLIDES AS A MEANS FOR (1) STUDYING, AND (2) CONVEYING THREE-DIMENSIONAL CONCEPTS.

        "description":"THIS STUDY RELATED TO DISCOVERY METHODS OF TEACHING AND LEARNING WAS CONCERNED WITH TWO MAJOR QUESTIONS. FIRST, CAN &quot;WHAT IS LEARNED&quot; THROUGH MATHEMATICAL DISCOVERY BE IDENTIFIED AND TAUGHT BY EXPOSITION WITH EQUIVALENT RESULTS. SECOND, HOW DOES &quot;WHAT IS LEARNED&quot; DEPEND ON PRIOR LEARNING AND ON THE NATURE OF THE DISCOVERY TREATMENT ITSELF. IN A PREVIOUS STUDY, GAGNE AND BROWN FOUND THAT DISCOVERY GROUPS WERE BETTER ABLE TO DERIVE NEW FORMULAS THAN WERE RULE-GIVEN GROUPS. IN THE PRESENT STUDY IT WAS HYPOTHESIZED THAT (1) WHAT WAS LEARNED BY GUIDED DISCOVERY IN THE GAGNE AND BROWN STUDY CAN BE PRESENTED BY EXPOSITION WITH EQUIVALENT RESULTS, (2) PRESENTATION ORDER IS CRITICAL WHEN THE HINTS PROVIDED DURING DISCOVERY ARE SPECIFIC TO THE RESPECTIVE FORMULAS SOUGHT RATHER THAN  RELEVANT TO A GENERAL STRATEGY, AND (3) PRESENTATION ORDER IS NOT CRITICAL WHEN THE PROGRAM EFFECTIVELY FORCES THE STUDENT TO LEARN THE GENERAL STRATEGY IRRESPECTIVE OF THE EXPOSITION OR DISCOVERY LEARNING METHOD. ONE OR TWO OF FOUR PROGRAMS--RULE GIVEN (R), DISCOVERY (D), GUIDED DISCOVERY (G), AND HIGHER-ORDER EXPOSITION (E)--WERE ADMINISTERED TO SEVEN GROUPS--R, RD, DR, RG, GR, RE, AND ER. ALL STUDENTS WERE REQUIRED TO DERIVE NEW RULES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE IDENTIFIED HIGHER-ORDER RULE. AS HYPOTHESIZED, GROUPS R AND RD PERFORMED AT ONE LEVEL WHICH WAS RELIABLY BELOW THE COMMON LEVEL OF THE OTHER FIVE GROUPS. TWO POINTS OF EMPHASIS IN THE CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS WERE (1) &quot;WHAT IS LEARNED&quot; DURING GUIDED DISCOVERY CAN AT LEAST BE IDENTIFIED AND TAUGHT BY EXPOSITION WITH EQUIVALENT  RESULTS, AND (2) IF A PERSON ALREADY KNOWS THE DESIRED RESPONSES, HE IS NOT LIKELY TO DISCOVER A HIGHER ORDER RULE BY WHICH SUCH RESPONSES MAY BE DERIVED.

SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES WERE (1) TO DEVELOP A METHOD FOR STUDYING THE SCIENCE INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENTISTS, (2) TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF USING THE METHOD AS A RESEARCH TOOL TO DETECT CHANGES IN THE BEHAVIOR OF USER SCIENTISTS AS A FUNCTION OF MODIFICATION IN CLEARINGHOUSE PERFORMANCE, AND (3) TO GENERATE TENTATIVE PRESCRIPTIONS FOR SYSTEMS DESIGN. THE PILOT INFORMATION CLEARINGHOUSE WAS LOCATED AT THE FEDERATION OF AMERICAN SOCIETIES FOR EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY. THE RESULTS SHOWED (1) THAT MEANINGFUL DATA COULD BE OBTAINED CONCERNING THE REQUESTING BEHAVIOR OF SCIENTISTS, AND (2) THAT THERE  WERE CHANGES IN THE BEHAVIOR OF SCIENTISTS AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS IN THE CLEARINGHOUSE PROGRAM. TWO SUPPORTING STUDIES WERE CONDUCTED. THE FIRST WAS DESIGNED TO DETERMINE THE POSSIBILITY OF INCREASING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PILOT INFORMATION CLEARINGHOUSE BY USING EXISTING INFORMATION SYSTEMS. THE SECOND STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT ADDITIONAL SERVICES BIOLOGICAL SCIENTISTS MIGHT FIND USEFUL. THE RESULTS OF ALL THE STUDIES INDICATED (1) THAT IT WOULD NOT BE PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE TO USE EXISTING INFORMATION SYSTEMS TO FACILITATE THE OPERATION OF THE PILOT INFORMATION CLEARINGHOUSE, AND (2) THAT A DESIRABLE SERVICE WOULD BE TO PROVIDE SCIENTISTS WITH &quot;CURRENT AWARENESS&quot; INFORMATION.

MOREOVER, THE COMMON ASSUMPTION BY TEACHERS THAT CHILDREN CAN AND SHOULD WRITE ABOUT PERSONAL INTERESTS OUGHT TO BE TEMPERED BY THE IDEA THAT MANY INTERESTS ARE BETTER SERVED BY ACTIVITIES OTHER THAN WRITING. FOR EXAMPLE, FREQUENT OPPORTUNITIES SHOULD BE PROVIDED FOR YOUNG CHILDREN TO DICTATE ORIGINAL COMPOSITIONS, INASMUCH AS DICTATED COMPOSITIONS YIELD A MORE EXTENDED DELINEATION OF IDEAS AND A GREATER VARIETY AND NUMBER OF WORDS THAN DO SELF-WRITTEN COMPOSITIONS OF ELEMENTARY-GRADE CHILDREN. WHEN THE CHILD DOES ATTEMPT SELF-WRITTEN COMPOSITION, HIS INTELLECTUAL CREATIVITY AND SPONTANEITY  SHOULD NOT BE FRUSTRATED BY THE REQUIREMENT THAT HE USE ONLY THOSE WORDS HE CAN SPELL. PROBABLY THE MOST THOROUGH AND DEPENDABLE EVALUATION OF A SCHOOL'S WRITING PROGRAM CAN BE OBTAINED BY COMBINING STANDARDIZED TESTING, AN EVALUATION (EITHER OF THE DETAILED ANALYSIS OR FIRST-IMPRESSION TYPE) OF THE WRITING OF ALL STUDENTS IN THE SCHOOL, AND A SAMPLING OF SELECTED INDIVIDUAL CASE RECORDS.

        "description":"THE ENGLISH CURRICULUM CAN BE MADE MORE EFFECTIVE BY CONSIDERING THE SIGNIFICANT PART PLAYED BY THE COMPONENT OF GRAMMAR. THE NATIVE SPEAKER OF ENGLISH POSSESSES AN INTUITIVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE RULES OF GRAMMAR AND YET CANNOT EXPLAIN WHAT HIS INTUITION KNOWS. THEREFORE, A PRECISE, ECONOMICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE LANGUAGE MECHANISM AND HOW IT FUNCTIONS IS NEEDED. THIS DESCRIPTION OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE--MORE SPECIFICALLY, OF THE SENTENCE--IS ATTEMPTED BY THREE APPROACHES TO GRAMMAR. THE TRADITIONAL APPROACH, CRITICIZED FOR BEING PRESCRIPTIVE RATHER THAN DESCRIPTIVE, CONCENTRATES MORE ON SURFACE DEVIATIONS AND FLAT DIAGRAMING THAN ON THE ESSENCE OF GRAMMAR. THE STRUCTURAL APPROACH, AIMED AT BEING DESCRIPTIVE RATHER THAN PRESCRIPTIVE, ANALYZES THE STATE OF LANGUAGE--NOT ITS LEVELS OF  OPERATION--BY POINTING OUT STRUCTURAL SIGNALS WHICH INDICATE SENTENCE PATTERNS AND PARTS OF SPEECH. THE GENERATIVE-TRANSFORMATIONAL APPROACH IS CONCERNED WITH DESCRIBING THE DEEP AND SURFACE STRUCTURES OF SENTENCES AND EXPLAINING THEIR RELATIONSHIPS, THUS PROVIDING A CLEARLY DEFINED NORM OF THE LANGUAGE PROCESS.

THE ESSENTIAL IDEA OF MICROTEACHING IS TO VIDEOTAPE A SPECIFIC MINIATURE TEACHING SITUATION, THUS PERMITTING CLOSE REVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF THE PLAYBACK. FOR THIS, THE TEACHER TYPICALLY WORKS WITH A SMALL CLASS (4-10 PUPILS), TEACHES A SHORT LESSON (5-15 MINUTES), AND FOCUSES ON ONE SMALL, SPECIFIC PART OF TEACHING BEHAVIOR. THE ADVANTAGES OF MICROTEACHING INCLUDE--(1) EMPHASIS ON THE ACQUISITION AND PERFORMANCE  OF SPECIFIC SKILLS, (2) IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK, (3) REINFORCEMENT OF AN EMERGING SKILL, AND (4) CONSTRUCTION OF COMPLEX SKILLS FROM SPECIFIC COMPONENTS LEARNED SINGLY.

STUDENTS CAN LEARN ABOUT LANGUAGE, LITERATURE, AND COMPOSITION IN A COHERENT FASHION BY WRITING PLAYS, SHORT STORIES, AND POEMS, OR BY ACTING, INTERPRETING, AND CREATING DRAMA. THE SEQUENCE OF SUCH EXPERIENCES SHOULD BE RELATED TO THE STUDENTS' MATURITY AND TO THE LITERATURE PROGRAM. DISCOURSE SHOULD BE ARRANGED ALONG A CONTINUUM EXTENDING FROM THE PERSON AS AN INNER-SPEAKER (SOLILOQUY) TO THE PERSON AS A SPEAKER-ABOUT-THINGS (ESSAY). THE CONCEPTION OF COMMUNICATION AS DISCOURSE PROVIDES AN EFFECTVE RATIONALE FOR TEACHING THE STUDENT TO COMPOSE AND TO RELATE HIS OWN EXPERIENCES TO THOSE OF THE AUTHORS WHOSE LITERATURE HE  READS. THREE WAYS IN WHICH THIS MAY BE DONE ARE (1) BY COMPARING THE GENERATION AND TRANSFORMATION OF SENTENCES WITH AN AUTHOR'S EFFORT TO SPECIFY AND RELATE HIS THOUGHTS, (2) BY INDICATING THE CONTINUITY BETWEEN DRAMATIS PERSONAE AND AUTHORS (THE PALER PERSONAE OF WRITTEN MONOLOGUES), AND (3) BY EMPHASIZING THAT RHETORIC IS THE ESSENCE OF DRAMA--PEOPLE ACTING UPON EACH OTHER.

        "description":"TEACHER-PARTICIPANTS IN A WORKSHOP OF THE 1965 NDEA ENGLISH INSTITUTE AT CENTRAL MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY RECOGNIZED COMPOSITION AS THE MOST PROBLEMATIC AREA OF ENGLISH TEACHING. THEY IDENTIFIED LACK OF THOROUGH PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION IN TEACHING COMPOSITION AS THE PRIMARY REASON FOR ITS RELATIVE NEGLECT BY TEACHERS. HIGH STUDENT-TEACHER RATIO, MULTIPLE-CLASS PREPARATIONS, AND INSUFFICIENT RELEASED TIME WERE CONSIDERED TO BE GOOD AND VALID, BUT SECONDARY, REASONS FOR THE NEGLECT OF COMPOSITION. A SERIES OF INSERVICE TRAINING PROGRAMS WAS PROPOSED AS A MAJOR SOLUTION FOR TEACHER PREPARATION DEFICIENCIES, AND DISCUSSION QUESTIONS WERE DEVELOPED FOR FOUR SUCH PROGRAMS--SEQUENTIAL COMPOSITION, THEME EVALUATION, THEME ASSIGNMENT, AND THE VALUE OF HIGH SCHOOL COMPOSITION INSTRUCTION AS  INTERPRETED BY FORMER STUDENTS. ENGLISH DEPARTMENT CHAIRMEN WERE URGED TO TRY TO ELIMINATE TEACHING CONDITIONS WHICH INTERFERE WITH EFFECTIVE COMPOSITION INSTRUCTION. MEANWHILE, THE PROPOSAL SUGGESTED, INDIVIDUAL TEACHERS MIGHT TRY SUCH TECHNIQUES AS MULTIPLE-STUDENT-CRITIQUING OF THEMES, RECORDING COMMENTS ON TAPE RATHER THAN WRITING THEM ON THE PAPERS, AND CRITICIZING ONLY ONE WRITING ASPECT PER SET OF THEMES.

        "description":"THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE SENTENCE-COMBINING TECHNIQUES OF PUPILS USING THE INITIAL TEACHING ALPHABET (I.T.A.) WITH THE TECHNIQUES OF PUPILS USING TRADITIONAL ORTHOGRAPHY (T.O.). THE INVESTIGATION CONSIDERED--(1) WHETHER I.T.A. PROVIDES A LINGUISTIC ADVANTAGE IN THE WAY PUPILS ADD GRAMMATICALLY TO THEIR SENTENCES, (2) WHETHER THERE IS EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT HOW THE BASIC TEXTS READ BY PUPILS MAY INFLUENCE THEIR CORRECT USE OF GRAMMATICAL STRUCTURES, (3) WHAT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ORAL AND WRITTEN RESPONSES SUGGEST ABOUT PUPILS' ACQUISITION OF SYNTACTIC CONTROL, AND (4) WHETHER BOYS' AND GIRLS' RESPONSES DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY. ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-SIX FIRST-GRADE, WHITE STUDENTS OF ABOVE-AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE, ACHIEVEMENT, AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS WERE SUBJECTS IN  THE STUDY. APPROXIMATELY 300 WORDS WERE COLLECTED FROM THE WRITING OF EACH PUPIL, AND AN APPROXIMATELY EQUAL NUMBER OF WORDS WAS COLLECTED FROM THE ORAL RESPONSES OF 60 RANDOMLY-SELECTED STUDENTS AMONG THESE SUBJECTS. TRANSFORMATIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE ORAL RESPONSES INDICATED NO SIGNIFICANT VARIATION BETWEEN THE I.T.A. AND T.O. GROUPS IN THE USE OF SENTENCE-COMBINING TRANSFORMATIONS. HOWEVER, ANALYSIS OF THE I.T.A. GROUP'S WRITTEN RESPONSES REVEALED ADVANTAGES IN SENTENCE COMBINING--(1) FEWER SENTENCES CONJOINED AND \"AND,\" (2) SLIGHTLY MORE EMBEDDINGS OF TRANSFORMS WITH DELETIONS, AND (3) SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER FAILURES PER 100 SENTENCE-COMBINING TRANSFORMATIONS. THE GREATER GRAMMATICAL DENSITY OF CLAUSES IN THE TEXTS USED BY THE I.T.A. GROUP PROBABLY AIDED BY PUPILS IN ACQUIRING THE LATTER  TWO ADVANTAGES. MODIFIERS, PREDICATES, T-UNITS CONNECTED BY \"AND,\" GENITIVES AND COORDINATES OF NOUNS WERE USED MOST FREQUENTLY IN BOTH THE SPEECH AND WRITING RESPONSES OF BOTH GROUPS, INDICATING EARLY ACQUISITION AND MASTERY OF THESE FORMS. NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN SENTENCE-COMBINING TECHNIQUES WERE FOUND BETWEEN THE BOYS' AND THE GIRLS' RESPONSES. (RD)",

THE USE OF LITERATURE CAN STIMULATE DISCUSSIONS AND EFFECTIVE WRITING AMONG STUDENTS OF VARIOUS GRADE AND ABILITY LEVELS. INTEREST IS GENERATED BY KEEPING THE CLASSWORK RELEVANT TO THE LIVES OF THE STUDENTS, AND THINKING IS MOTIVATED BY FREQUENTLY ASKING THEM PROVOCATIVE QUESTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, STUDENTS CAN EXAMINE THE PROPOSITION, \"IF YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH TO FIGHT, YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH TO VOTE,\" IN RELATION TO THE CHARACTERIZATION IN \"THE SEAFARER.\" THEY CAN CONSIDER WHICH THREE OF BEOWULF'S CHARACTERISTICS ARE MOST IMPORTANT FOR A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TO POSSESS, AND THEY CAN COMPARE AND CONTRAST THE DEVICES USED TO DELINEATE GUILT IN \"MARKHEIM\" AND \"MACBETH.\"  THE EMPHASIS IN POSING SUCH DISCUSSION AND COMPOSITION TOPICS IS NOT WHAT STUDENTS BELIEVE THE AUTHOR SAYS, BUT RATHER WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT WHAT THE AUTHOR SAYS. GRAMMAR RULES AND LINGUISTICS ARE REPLACED BY A RULE OF THUMB--USE THE EXPRESSION WHICH COMMUNICATES THE DESIRED IMPRESSION. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS \"LITERARY\" APPROACH IS VERIFIED BY HONORS STUDENTS WHO PASS ADVANCED PLACEMENT TESTS, BY COLLEGE PREPARATORY STUDENTS WHO DO WELL AT HIGHLY COMPETITIVE UNIVERSITIES, AND BY GENERAL ENGLISH STUDENTS WHOSE ATTITUDES TOWARD WRITING, LITERATURE, AND THEMSELVES HAVE CHANGED IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION.

FOR SLOW LEARNERS, THIS MAY LEAD TO FAILURE, FRUSTRATION, AND BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS. IF THE TEACHER IS TO HELP SLOW LEARNERS, HE MUST BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THEM, KNOW WHAT THEY EXPECT FROM EDUCATION, AND PERCEIVE WHAT THEY HOPE TO BECOME. ONLY DAY-TO-DAY CONTACT IN ONE-TO-ONE RELATIONSHIPS WILL PERMIT THEIR TRUE ABILITIES TO BE RECOGNIZED. THE TEACHER MUST UNDERSTAND THE ATTITUDES AND PREJUDICES OF EACH PUPIL IN REGARD TO HIMSELF, HIS CLASSMATES, AND THE SCHOOL IN GENERAL. THE FACTOR CONTROLLING THE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OF THE SLOW LEARNER, HOWEVER, IS THE TEACHER'S ATTITUDE TOWARD THE STUDENT. AS THE TEACHER BECOMES MORE THE HELPER  AND THE FRIEND, THE STUDENT BECOMES MORE CONFIDENT AND REVEALS MORE POTENTIAL, THUS INCREASING THE TEACHER'S ENTHUSIASM AND INSIGHT. FOR THE LANGUAGE ARTS TEACHER, THE BASIC SKILLS OF COMMUNICATION ARE ONLY PART OF HER CONCERN. SHE MUST ALSO IMPART ATTITUDES AND DISPOSITIONS. AS SLOW LEARNERS PREPARE THEMSELVES FOR THEIR PLACES IN ADULT SOCIETY, THE BEST FOUNDATION IS A COURSE IN LANGUAGE ARTS GEARED TO THE NEEDS OF EACH SPECIFIC GROUP AND DEVELOPED IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF TRUST AND UNDERSTANDING.

THE PROPER ROLE OF INTEGRATION IN PUBLIC EDUCATION IS TO CREATE A DEEPER UNDERSTANDINING OF AMERICAN SOCIETY, TO CREATE A WHOLESOME COMMUNITY ATTITUDE AMONG ALL MEN, FREE OF STEREOTYPES AND TENSIONS, AND  TO CREATE EQUALITY OF EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY. IN 1963, THE NEW YORK CITY BOARD OF EDUCATION DECLARED THAT IT WAS COMMITTED TO DESEGREGATION OF THE CLASSROOM, PREPARATION OF STUDENTS FOR A CONSTRUCTIVE LIFE IN A PLURALISTIC SOCIETY, AND COMPENSATION FOR THOSE STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN DISCRIMINATED AGAINST.

        "description":"A LOOK AT THE CONCENTRATION AND DISPERSION OF NEGROES IN THE CENSUS TRACTS OF NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CITIES REVEALS THAT NEGRO RESIDENTIAL CONCENTRATION IS MORE THAN TWICE AS HEAVY IN THE NORTH. MORE THAN HALF OF THE NEGROES LIVING NORTH OF THE MASON-DIXON LINE ARE CROWDED INTO ONE-TWENTIETH OF THE CENSUS TRACTS, WHILE IN THE SOUTH LESS THAN HALF LIVE IN OVER ONE-TENTH OF THE CITIES' TRACTS. THE &quot;BREAKING POINT&quot;--THE ALLOWABLE MINIMUM OF AN UNDESIRABLE GROUP--FOR MOST NORTHERN NEIGHBORHOODS COMES WHEN 10 PERCENT OF THE FAMILIES LIVING THERE ARE NEGRO. SOUTHERN CITIES ARE MORE RACIALLY MIXED, BUT STREET FRONTAGE IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS IS USUALLY WHITE-OWNED. FAR FEWER THAN ONE OUT OF FIVE NORTHERN SCHOOLS ARE REALLY INTEGRATED. A GREAT DEAL OF SCHOOL TRANSFERRING WOULD BE NECESSARY  TO INTEGRATE THE OTHERS, AND FEW CITIES HAVE ATTEMPTED THIS. THE SOUTH, BECAUSE OF MORE INTEGRATED NEIGHBORHOODS, FACES THE DIFFICULT SHORT TERM PROBLEM OF BRIDGING THE SCHOLASTIC GAP BETWEEN THE RACES.

TO TEST THE PREDICTIVE VALIDITY OF ONE OF THESE TESTS, A STUDY COMPARED THE CORRELATIONS OF THE SCHOLASTIC APTITUDE TEST (SAT)-VERBAL AND SAT-MATHEMATICAL SCORES WITH THE FRESHMAN GRADE POINT AVERAGES OF NEGRO AND WHITE GROUPS. THE NEGRO POPULATION WAS SELECTED FROM THREE SOUTHERN NEGRO STATE COLLEGES, AND THE WHITE POPULATION WAS SELECTED FROM THREE NON-NEGRO COLLEGES WHO HAD THE LOWEST AVERAGE SCORES ON BOTH FORMS OF THE SAT. ONLY THREE ANALYSES  WERE MADE. IT WAS FOUND THAT THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN PREDICTIVE VALIDITIES ASSOCIATED WITH RACE, SUBTEST, AND YEAR. HOWEVER THE INTERACTION OF SEX WITH RACE DID SHOW SOME DIFFERENCES. THE FRESHMAN GRADE POINT AVERAGE WAS FOUND TO BE MOST PREDICTABLE AMONG WHITE WOMEN, AND THE WHITE MEN WERE FOUND TO BE THE LEAST PREDICTABLE GROUP.

A 1-YEAR COUNSELING PROGRAM WAS DEVELOPED TO COUNTERACT THE NEGATIVE PARENTAL INFLUENCE THROUGH THE POSITIVE INFLUENCE OF SCHOOL GUIDANCE COUNSELORS. TWENTY-FIVE LOW-ACHIEVING STUDENTS WERE CHOSEN AS THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WHILE 25 WERE DESIGNATED AS CONTROLS. VARIOUS QUESTIONNAIRES WERE ADMINISTERED TO DETERMINE PROBLEM AREAS. THE INDIVIDUAL COUNSELING STRATEGY WAS TO MAKE CLEAR TO THE STUDENT WHY HE WAS BEING COUNSELED AND TO ESTABLISH CONFIDENCE IN THE COUNSELOR'S ABILITY TO BE HELPFUL. THE COUNSELORS ALTERNATELY ADVISED, LISTENED, AND  ATTEMPTED TO MAKE THE STUDENT REFLECT ON HIS OWN PROBLEMS. COUNSELING SESSIONS OCCURRED ONCE EVERY 10 DAYS AND LASTED UP TO AN HOUR. SMALL GROUP SESSIONS WERE CONDUCTED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR. IT WAS FOUND THAT DESPITE COUNSELING THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP HAD LOWER SELF-CONCEPTS THAN THE CONTROL GROUP, HAD LOWER GRADES, CONSIDERED GRADES LESS IMPORTANT, AND FELT THAT TEACHERS THOUGHT LESS OF THEM. THIS OUTCOME SUGGESTED THAT THE COUNSELING MERELY PLACED MORE PRESSURE ON THE STUDENT TO ACHIEVE, AND THUS UNWITTINGLY ADDED TO THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS OF PARENTAL DISAPPROVAL. (DK)",

THE INTERVIEW CONSISTED OF 123 FIXED RESPONSE QUESTIONS. TO ESTIMATE THE VALIDITY OF THE MOTHERS' RESPONSES, A MODIFIED QUESTIONNAIRE WAS ADMINISTERED TO THE CHILDREN. THE STUDY FOUND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE MOTHERS OF HIGH ACHIEVEMENT AND LOW ACHIEVEMENT CHILDREN ON 17 ITEMS. DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND ON (1) SUCH ITEMS AS HELPING CHILDREN SAVE MONEY AND STAMPS, PLAYING SPORTS, ATTENDING CHURCH, TALKING ABOUT THE NEWS, TALKING ABOUT THE FAMILY, AND GOING TO A PARADE, (2) SCHOOL ITEMS LIKE TALKING ABOUT SCHOOL AND EXTRACURRICULAR  ACTIVITIES, ATTEMPTING TO FIND OUT WHY CHILDREN DO POORLY AND CORRECTING THEIR WORK, DESIRING CHILDREN TO GO TO COLLEGE, AND REQUIRING THAT CHILDREN DO WELL IN SCHOOL, (3) ITEMS RELATED TO READING (READING ALOUD AT HOME, PARENTS READING MAGAZINES, AND MOTHERS' READING), AND (4) ITEMS HAVING TO DO WITH MOTHERS' INITIATIVE IN CONFERRING WITH SCHOOL OFFICIALS. THE FINDINGS OF THE STUDY INDICATE THAT THERE IS AN APPARENT POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CHILDREN'S SCHOLASTIC ACHIEVEMENT AND THESE FACTORS OF PARENTAL ATTITUDE AND BEHAVIOR.

THE MIDDLE GROUP ON THE STABLE-UNSTABLE CONTINUUM OFFERS THE GREATEST POTENTIAL FOR SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS, PROVIDED THAT THEY HAVE A QUALITY EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE. CURRENT COMPENSATORY EDUCATION PROGRAMS WHICH DO NOT PROVIDE A LONG TERM CONTINUITY OF SERVICE FROM BIRTH TO MATURITY ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE ANTIPOVERTY EFFORTS. EDUCATIONAL PLANNERS SHOULD SEARCH FOR WAYS TO SHIFT INNER CITY SCHOOLS FROM RIGID BUREAUCRACIES TO FLEXIBLE, ACCEPTING  INSTITUTIONS. PUPIL-TEACHER RATIO MUST BE LOWERED, PERHAPS BY USING NONPROFESSIONALS IN THE CLASSROOMS. CHANGES IN THE CLIMATE AND STRUCTURE OF SLUM SCHOOLS, HOWEVER, MAY BE VIEWED BY PROFESSIONALS AS THREATENING AND MAY REQUIRE HONEST CONFRONTATIONS OF INGRAINED PREJUDICES.

TO COUNTERACT THIS EFFECT, THE PROJECT HAS BUSED OVER 250 INNER CITY MINORITY GROUP CHILDREN, FROM KINDERGARTEN THROUGH FIFTH GRADE, TO FIVE MIDDLE CLASS SUBURBAN SCHOOL SYSTEMS ON THE PERIPHERY OF HARTFORD. ONE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (E-GROUP) OF 213 CHILDREN RECEIVES SUPPORTIVE SERVICES INVOLVING REMEDIAL ASSISTANCE, SCHOOL-HOME LIAISON, AND POSITIVE ADULT IDENTIFICATION FIGURES. THE REMAINING 42 PUPILS, THE OTHER E-GROUP, ARE BEING EXPOSED TO A SUBURBAN SCHOOL PLACEMENT WITHOUT SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. DATA WILL BE COLLECTED ON CRITERION VARIABLES RELATED TO SCHOOL PERFORMANCE AND ON SUCH OTHER  DIMENSIONS AS PUPIL ATTITUDE AND MOTIVATION, FAMILY PARTICIPATION, AND CLASSROOM CLIMATE. THE TWO E-GROUPS WILL BE COMPARED WITH GROUPS OF INNER CITY SCHOOL CHILDREN WHO HAVE OR HAVE NOT RECEIVED SUPPORTIVE ASSISTANCE. IT IS FELT THAT THE TREND TOWARD CUMULATIVE DEFICIT SHOWN BY DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN MIGHT BE REVERSED BY CREATING A &quot;DISSONANCE&quot; WITHIN THE STUDENT'S SELF-PERCEPTIONS WHICH WOULD PERMIT THE REINFORCEMENT OF POSITIVE BEHAVIORS AND ATTITUDES. THE SUBURBAN PEER GROUP WILL PRESENT AN EMULATIVE MODEL, WHICH, ALONG WITH THE SUPPORT OF AN INDIGENOUS ADULT IDENTIFICATION FIGURE, WILL HELP TO BRING ABOUT A POSITIVE CHANGE IN THE SELF-PERCEPTIONS OF THE DISADVANTAGED PUPILS. THE URBAN-SUBURBAN COOPERATION THAT THIS PROJECT REQUIRED IS FINANCIALLY AND OTHERWISE FEASIBLE FOR CITIES  FRINGED BY MIDDLE CLASS SUBURBS.

THE NEUROLOGICAL FACTORS WHICH DIFFERENTIATED EH FROM SA CHILDREN WERE--TAPPED PATTERNS, RIGHT-LEFT DISCRIMINATION, DOUBLE SIMULTANEOUS TOUCH, AND FAST ALTERNATING FINGER AND HAND MOVEMENTS. THE TESTS WHICH SHOWED NO DIFFERENCES WERE--MEASURES OF HAND, FOOT, AND EYE PREFERENCE, AND ADVENTITIOUS OVERFLOW MOVEMENT, THE ARM EXTENSION TEST, AND THE WALKING ON BALANCE BEAM TEST. MEDICAL HISTORIES THROUGH PARENT-PHYSICIAN  INTERVIEWS WERE ALSO OBTAINED. BASED ON THESE DATA, DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND BETWEEN THE EH AND SA CHILDREN IN THESE AREAS--IRRITABILITY DURING INFANCY, COLIC, DECREASED SOUND PRODUCTION DURING PRELINGUAL DEVELOPMENT, POOR LISTENING SKILLS AFTER AGE TWO, EASE OF MOTHER-CHILD COMMUNICATION, AND TEMPER TANTRUMS. THIS PAPER WAS PREPARED FOR PRESENTATION AT THE SRCD MEETING IN NEW YORK, MARCH 31, 1967. (DK)",

THE PROPOSAL OFFERING THE GREATEST POSSIBILITY FOR COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION WAS ONE WHICH SUGGESTED THE CREATION OF TWO EXPERIMENTAL UNITS COMPOSED OF A MIDDLE SCHOOL AND ITS FEEDERS. ONE UNIT WAS TO BE ORGANIZED AROUND A JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL ON THE WEST SIDE OF MANHATTAN, AND THE OTHER UNIT WAS TO CONSIST OF I.S. 201 AND ITS THREE FEEDER SCHOOLS. BOTH PLANS COLLAPSED. OF THE SIX OTHER PROPOSALS, ONE FOR BROWNSVILLE IN BROOKLYN COULD NOT GAIN COMMUNITY SUPPORT, AND THE OTHERS WERE EITHER POSTPONED INDEFINITELY OR THE BOARD DID NOT DEVELOP A SPECIFIC PLAN TO  IMPLEMENT THEM. FINALLY, A NEW DECENTRALIZATION SCHEME INVOLVING THREE NEW EXPERIMENTAL UNITS WAS ANNOUNCED FOR WHICH THE FORD FOUNDATION WOULD PROVIDE PLANNING GRANTS TO ENABLE EACH UNIT TO DEVELOP ITS OWN PROPOSALS FOR A GOVERNING BOARD. HOWEVER, IN THIS PLAN THE BOARD OF EDUCATION WOULD HAVE VETO POWER OVER THE PROPOSED LOCAL GOVERNING BOARD, ITS PROJECTED PROGRAMS, AND ADMINISTRATORS AND SUPERVISORS. THE TEACHERS UNION AND THE COUNCIL OF SUPERVISORY ASSOCIATIONS HAVE EXPRESSED SOME RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ELECTED LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS.

BEFORE THE SCHOOLS OPENED IN SEPTEMBER  1964, PTA GROUPS SENT LETTERS TO PARENTS AND PUPILS WELCOMING THEM TO THEIR NEW SCHOOLS, AND MEETINGS WERE HELD WITH PARENTS, TEACHERS, AND ADMINISTRATORS. COMMUNITY SUPPORT WAS ACTIVELY DEMONSTRATED WHEN THE BOARD PRESIDENT WHO HAD SUPPORTED THE PLAN WAS RE-ELECTED BY A WIDE MAJORITY OVER AN &quot;ANTI-PLAN&quot; CANDIDATE. A 1957-64 CHRONOLOGY OF BACKGROUND EVENTS AND A TABULAR ANALYSIS OF PUPIL REGISTRATION BY SCHOOL FROM 1963 TO 1967 ARE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT. (LB)",

THE CHIEF PURPOSE OF THE PROGRAM IS TO ASSIST THESE STUDENTS TO COMPLETE THEIR EDUCATION OR TO BE MEANINGFULLY EMPLOYED. IN ADDITION TO RECEIVING INSTRUCTION IN READING, MATHEMATICS, VOCATIONAL, AND SOCIAL SKILLS, STUDENTS WILL BE PROVIDED WITH AN OPPORTUNITY FOR RELEVANT PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT. SCHEDULING, SUBJECT SELECTION, AND TEACHING TECHNIQUES WILL BE FLEXIBLE IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE THE INDIVIDUAL STUDENT. THOSE STUDENTS DEFICIENT IN ONLY CERTAIN CURRICULAR AREAS MAY RECEIVE REMEDIAL INSTRUCTION AT THE JOB CORPS CENTER WHERE THE PROGRAM WILL BE CONDUCTED WHILE CONTINUING TO ATTEND THEIR REGULAR PUBLIC SCHOOL. IN ALL PHASES OF THE  PROGRAM COMPLETE EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY AND TREATMENT WILL BE ENFORCED. ON-THE-JOB TRAINING OF JOB CORPS GRADUATES AS EDUCATIONAL PARAPROFESSIONALS AND INSERVICE TRAINING OF TEACHERS ARE OTHER PROPOSED FEATURES OF THE PROGRAM. PROVISIONS WILL BE MADE FOR AN EXCHANGE OF SERVICES, IDEAS, AND EVALUATIVE RESEARCH BETWEEN THE SEATTLE SCHOOL DISTRICT, THE NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION, AND THE OFFICE OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY.

THE TWO MAIN APPLICATIONS OF OCCUPATIONAL PROJECTIONS ARE TO GUIDE EDUCATIONAL PLANNERS AND TO ADVISE ENTRANTS AND POTENTIAL ENTRANTS INTO THE LABOR MARKET.

ALL JOURNEYMAN ELECTRICIANS WHO WERE MEMBERS OF LOCAL 617, INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS, IN SAN MATEO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, WERE SURVEYED BY MAILED QUESTIONNAIRES TO DETERMINE THEIR ATTITUDES TOWARD TRAINING AND THEIR TRAINING NEEDS. THE EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN CONSISTED OF TEACHING THE COURSE &quot;INTRODUCTION TO INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS&quot; TO A GROUP OF 96 JOURNEYMEN INSIDE WIREMEN BY THREE MODES OF INSTRUCTION. THE INSTRUCTIONAL MODES WERE (1) SELF-PACED  INDIVIDUALIZED INSTRUCTION USING A BRANCHING TYPE ELECTRICALLY OPERATED TEACHING MACHINE WITH A HIGHLY QUALIFIED JOURNEYMAN ELECTRICIAN WHO HAD NO PREVIOUS TEACHING EXPERIENCE AS A MONITOR, (2) SELF-PACED INDIVIDUALIZED INSTRUCTION WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS PREVIOUS MATERIAL AND OUTSIDE READINGS WITH AN EXPERIENCED INSTRUCTOR, AND (3) THE CONVENTIONAL CLASSROOM ARRANGEMENT. EACH MODE WAS MADE UP OF TWO CLASSES WHICH MET FOR 3 HOURS ONCE A WEEK FOR 9 WEEKS. THE MODES WERE DESIGNED TO FOLLOW THE SAME SEQUENCE OF INSTRUCTIONAL INFORMATION TO CONTRAST INSTRUCTIONAL PROCEDURES, NOT CONTENT. PRE- AND POST-ACHIEVEMENT TESTS WERE USED TO MEASURE THE DEGREE OF LEARNING. SOME CONCLUSIONS BASED ON DATA ANALYSIS WERE (1) AUTO-INSTRUCTION WORKED AS WELL AS CONVENTIONAL INSTRUCTION, (2)  AUTO-INSTRUCTION WITH LIVE INSTRUCTION YIELDED HIGHER STUDENT SATISFACTION, AND (3) THE UNIQUE PROBLEMS OF ADULT EDUCATION REQUIRE INSTRUCTORS FAMILIAR WITH AND CAPABLE OF TEACHING ADULTS. &quot;TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND THE JOURNEYMAN ELECTRICIAN--AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY IN CONTINUING EDUCATION, VOLUME II,&quot; (VT 002 912) PRESENTS INSTRUCTIONAL METHODS USED IN THE PROJECT.

IN AUGUST 1966, QUESTIONNAIRES RETURNED BY 90 SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS IDENTIFIED FIVE BROAD AREAS OF IMPORTANT STUDENT NEEDS. THE TWO MOST OFTEN MENTIONED, CURRICULUM METHODS AND CURRICULUM CONTENT, WERE STUDIED. STUDENT BEHAVIORAL OBJECTIVES FOR THE 11 LEVELS INDICATED IN THE &quot;TAXONOMY OF EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES, HANDBOOKS I AND II&quot; WERE DETERMINED FOR EACH OF 20 COMMON SUBJECT AREAS. A 117-ITEM QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGNED TO ALLOW COMPARISON OF RESPONDENT PERCEPTIONS OF CURRENT EDUCATIONAL PRACTICES WITH THEIR EXPECTATIONS WAS COMPLETED BY A 5 PERCENT SAMPLE OF INTACT CLASSROOMS IN GRADES 6, 9, AND 12, PARENTS OF THESE STUDENTS, TEACHERS, AND  ADMINISTRATORS. FROM THESE 2,220 USABLE QUESTIONNAIRES, FINDINGS INDICATED (1) VOCATIONAL EDUCATION, SOCIAL STUDIES, AND HOME ECONOMICS WERE THE MOST KEENLY FELT CURRICULAR NEEDS OF STUDENTS, (2) PHYSICAL EDUCATION, FOREIGN LANGUAGE, AND MUSIC WERE THE MOST SATISFACTORILY ACHIEVED LEARNING GOALS, (3) EMOTIONAL COMPONENTS OF LEARNING IN ALL SUBJECTS WERE NEEDED MORE THAN ADDITIONAL STRESS ON PURELY INTELLECTUAL LEARNING, (4) AS STUDENTS PROGRESSED THROUGH SCHOOL, THEIR OPINIONS REGARDING A NEED FOR VOCATIONAL EDUCATION, SOCIAL STUDIES, AND HOME ECONOMICS INCREASED IN STRENGTH, (5) THE ABILITY TO MAKE AND REVISE JUDGMENTS ON THE BASIS OF A CONSISTENT PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE WAS VIEWED AS IMPORTANT IN ALL SUBJECT AREAS, AND (6) THE NEED FOR INCREASED EMPHASIS ON SYNTHESIZING AND EVALUATING  KNOWLEDGE INCREASED WITH GRADE LEVEL.

INSTRUMENTS WERE DEVELOPED FOR ASSESSING THE ATTRIBUTES AND EXTENT OF JOB SATISFACTION OF VOCATIONAL TEACHERS, THE ACTIVITY COGNITIONS (WHAT THE TEACHER SAYS HE DOES AND WHAT THE EVALUATORS PERCEIVE HE ACTUALLY DOES) AND NORMATIVE EXPECTATIONS (WHAT THE TEACHER AND EVALUATORS PERCEIVE HE SHOULD DO) OF THE TEACHER AND THE ASCRIPTION OF LEGITIMACY BY THE TEACHERS TO GROUPS WHICH THEY FEEL HAVE A RIGHT TO HOLD EXPECTATIONS CONCERNING WHAT  VOCATIONAL TEACHERS DO. MATERIAL SECURED BY GROUP INTERVIEW SESSIONS FROM OVER 1,500 RESPONDENTS, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY 250 VOCATIONAL TEACHERS, FROM A STRATIFIED RANDOM SAMPLE OF 87 SCHOOLS WAS ANALYZED. SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCES IN ATTRIBUTES BETWEEN TEACHERS IN DIFFERENT FIELDS OF VOCATIONAL EDUCATION WERE FOUND, BUT TRADE AND INDUSTRIAL TEACHERS ESPECIALLY HAD CHARACTERISTICS WHICH TENDED TO SET THEM APART. JOB SATISFACTION APPEARED TO BE HIGHEST FOR DISTRIBUTIVE EDUCATION AND LOWEST FOR TECHNICAL EDUCATION TEACHERS. SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES EXISTED BETWEEN THE FOUR TYPES OF VOCATIONAL TEACHERS, VOCATIONAL AND NONVOCATIONAL STUDENTS, PARENTS, COUNSELORS, NONVOCATIONAL TEACHERS, AND ADMINISTRATORS ON EXPECTATIONS AS TO WHAT THE TEACHERS DO AND SHOULD DO IN RELATION TO 70 SPECIFIED  ACTIVITIES. ROLE CONFLICT APPEARED TO BE SUBSTANTIAL BUT NOT EXCESSIVE. THE TEACHERS USUALLY ASCRIBED THE RIGHT TO HOLD EXPECTATIONS OF THEIR ACTIVITIES TO LOCAL ADMINISTRATORS AND STATE BOARD PERSONNEL ONLY.

        "description":"The objectives of this project were to develop and evaluate special instructional materials covering abstract reasoning, mechanical comprehension, and spatial visualization as related to basic vocational talents for eighth and ninth grade students who had a high probability of entering vocational education. The materials: paper and pencil aptitude practice exercises, basic reading texts, and laboratory and demonstration equipment were used in 30 class sessions for the eighth grade and 60 class sessions for the ninth grade in schools in eight systems selected from a national population. Results were based on test-retest changes on a battery of tests from project talent for 1,203 boys and 262 girls for whom complete data were available. Conclusions based on statistical analysis of  data included: (1) basic vocational talents can be taught directly in schools using the new curriculum and materials; (2) no &quot;general test taking skill&quot; was found; (3) girls tended to gain more on tests than boys; (4) ninth graders who used the laboratory materials showed more gain than eighth graders who did not; (5) nonverbal test skills seemed to be as easily modifiable as were verbal test skills; (6) mechanical talent or aptitude appears to be a skill largely learned through a variety of our-of-school experiences; and, (7) culturally disadvantaged students can be trained to do substantially better on vocational aptitude tests. Descriptions of the talent exercises, basic readers, laboratory exercises, and the test battery are included. These are available as VT 004 455 through VT 004  471. (EM)",

HOWEVER, AS A GROUP THEY WOULD PREFER TO REDUCE GREATLY THE AMOUNT OF TIME SPENT IN ROUTINE PROCESSING TASKS. AFTER THE SURVEY, AN EXPERIMENTAL FIELD SITE, A LARGE SCHOOL COMPLEX IN THE LOS ANGELES SCHOOL DISTRICT, WAS SELECTED AS THE FOCUS OF THE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND EXPERIMENTATION. A DETAILED SYSTEM ANALYSIS OF ALL THE SCHOOL'S COUNSELING PROCEDURES WAS MADE, AND WORKSHOPS ON  INFORMATION PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY FOR THE COUNSELOR WERE CONDUCTED. TWO DESIGN TEAMS, ONE OF RESEARCHERS AND HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELORS AND ONE OF RESEARCHERS AND JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELORS, WERE FORMED TO SPECIFY MODEL I OF THE MAN-MACHINE SYSTEM. MODEL I WILL BE PROGRAMED TO SERVE AS (1) AN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM FOR STUDENT INFORMATION, (2) A TEACHING AND MONITORING SYSTEM WHICH WILL AUTOMATICALLY ALERT THE COUNSELOR WHEN CRITICAL SITUATIONS OCCUR, (3) AN AUTOMATED REPORT GENERATOR, (4) A PREDICTOR, (5) AN AUTOMATIC REMINDER, (6) A COLLECTOR OF FOLLOWUP DATA, AND (7) A DISSEMINATOR OF PROGRAMED INTERVIEWS.

AMONG THE 11,055 DIFFERENT WORDS IN THE REANALYZED LIST, 109 OCCUR AT LEAST ONCE IN EVERY 1,000 WORDS. MEAN SYLLABIC INTENSITY (NUMBER OF SPEECH SYLLABLES PER DICTIONARY WORD) WAS FOUND TO BE 1.54. MEAN STROKE INTENSITY (NUMBER OF TYPEWRITER STROKES PER DICTIONARY WORD) WAS FOUND TO BE 6.0 (4.67 LETTERS PLUS 1.0 SPACES PLUS .3 FOR THE INCIDENCE OF PUNCTUATION). THESE VALUES SUBSTANTIALLY EXCEED AND SHOULD REPLACE THE CONVENTIONAL 1.40 AND 5.0 ESTIMATES. OTHERWISE, STENOGRAPHERS AND TYPISTS WILL BE UNDERPREPARED FOR THEIR JOBS, AND THEIR PROFICIENCY WILL BE OVERESTIMATED.

WHEN THE LIST IS SHORT, THAT INDEX HAS A NEAR-ZERO CORRELATION WITH FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE IN THE LANGUAGE. FURTHER, SHORTHAND DICTATION ON THE BASIS OF THE \"STANDARD WORD\" (EVEN AT SYLLABIC INTENSITY 1.54) IS AN INSUFFICIENT EQUALIZER OF DIFFICULTY.

HIGH SCHOOL TRANSCRIPTS OF 906 ENTERING FRESHMEN, RANKED ON THE BASIS OF THE PERCENTAGE OF COLLEGE PREPARATORY COURSES INCLUDED, WERE DIVIDED AT THE FIRST AND THIRD QUARTILES. GROUP A INCLUDED 228 TRANSCRIPTS WHICH INDICATED AT LEAST 73 PERCENT COLLEGE PREPARATORY COURSES AND GROUP B INCLUDED 226 WHICH INDICATED LESS THAN 59 PERCENT OF SUCH COURSES. COLLEGE GRADE POINT AVERAGES WERE ANALYZED FOR COMBINED AND FOR SEPARATED MALE AND FEMALE SAMPLES FOR EIGHT CONSECUTIVE SEMESTERS OF COLLEGE WITH THE AMERICAN COLLEGE TEST COMPOSITE SCORE AS THE STATISTICAL CONTROL OF ABILITY. ON THE BASIS OF THIS SCORE,  GROUP A EXCELLED GROUP B, BUT WHEN SCORES WERE ADJUSTED TO A COMMON MEAN, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE EXISTED FOR ACHIEVEMENT, THE COLLEGE ENTERED, OR SEX. AN ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE OF COLLEGE GRADE POINT AVERAGE ON MALE AND FEMALE SUBSAMPLES SHOWED THAT SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES OF ABILITY EXISTED BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS BUT ACHIEVEMENT WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FOR THE LAST SIX SEMESTERS.

They concern: (1) identification of the objectives and goals of occupational education; (2) structuring of alternative programs to achieve them; (3) cost-benefit analysis; and, (4) projections of manpower supply and demand. With the survey findings and the position papers as background, an interdisciplinary conference was held at Airlie with 38 participants including economists, vocational educators, university and research personnel, administrators, systems analysis, and planners to determine the problems associated with planning and programing vocational education. Part I of the report includes: &quot;Major Recommendations and  Conclusions,&quot; by Arnold Kotz. Part II is concerned with how objectives and goals are determined by States and communities. Objectives identified in the diagnostic survey are discussed. Position papers are: (1) &quot;Objectives and Goals of Occupational Education,&quot; by Grant Venn; (2) &quot;Evaluating Vocational Education-Problems and Priorities,&quot; by Garth Mangum; and (3) &quot;Problems of Application of the Program Planning and Budgeting System to Education,&quot; by Charles Hitch. Part III, concerning alternative programs to achieve occupational education objectives, includes the papers.--(1) An Educational System for the Seventies,&quot; by David Bushnell and Robert Morgan; (2) &quot;An Industrial Approach to Occupational Training,&quot; by Wilbur Landis; and (3) &quot;Improved Planning for Vocational and Technical  Education--A State Directors Perspective,&quot; by Robert Worthington; transcripts of discussions following some speeches.

THE FIRST STEP IN BUILDING SUCH A STUDENT-CENTERED, ORGANIC CURRICULUM WOULD BE TO DETERMINE SPECIFIC AND MEASURABLE BEHAVIORAL ATTAINMENTS NEEDED FOR ENTRY INTO A VARIETY OF POST-HIGH SCHOOL ACTIVITIES AND TO DESCRIBE LEARNING EXPERIENCES WHICH WOULD LEAD TO THE DESIRED BEHAVIORAL OUTCOMES. THE PROGRAM WOULD INCLUDE ACADEMIC AND OCCUPATIONAL TRAINING, PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT,  REAL WORK EXPERIENCE, PERSONAL AND VOCATIONAL COUNSELING, AND SOCIAL AND RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES.

THERE IS A NEED FOR A CLEARER DEFINITION OF GOALS AND AN OVERHAUL OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS. ALTHOUGH A LACK OF WELL-DEFINED OBJECTIVES AND INADEQUATE MEASURING PROCEDURES HAVE PREVENTED ITS EFFECTIVE USE, THE SYSTEMS ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY USED BY BUSINESS CAN BE APPLIED TO THE PROBLEMS OF EDUCATION. A PROPOSED SYSTEM, THE \"ORGANIC CURRICULUM,\" WILL MAKE POSSIBLE THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE OBJECTIVES OF PREPARING STUDENTS WITH ENTRY-LEVEL JOB SKILLS, BASIC LEARNING SKILLS, CROSS-TRAINING IN A CLUSTER OF OCCUPATIONS, TRAINING FOR THE ROLES OF CITIZENS AND ADULTS, AND PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT SKILLS SUCH AS COMMUNICATION, INQUIRY, AND PROBLEM SOLVING. A STUDENT WHO GRADUATES FROM HIGH SCHOOL  SHOULD HAVE THE NECESSARY QUALIFICATIONS FOR MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY IN POST-HIGH SCHOOL OPTIONS. THE INTEGRATION AND INTERACTION OF VITAL COMPONENTS WHICH WILL RESULT FROM A SYSTEMS DESIGN WILL INSURE THE MOST EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE LEARNING FOR THE INDIVIDUAL STUDENT THROUGH INDIVIDUALLY PRESCRIBED PROGRAMS LEADING LOGICALLY TO ACHIEVEMENT OF ADULT BEHAVIORAL GOALS. STEPS FOR IMPLEMENTING THE SYSTEMATIC APPROACH INCLUDE STATING THE PROGRAM OUTPUT SPECIFICATIONS IN TERMS OF BEHAVIORAL OBJECTIVES, SYNTHESIZING THE OBJECTIVES AMONG THE VARIOUS DISCIPLINES, DEVELOPING APPROPRIATE MATERIALS AND MEASUREMENT INSTRUMENTS, AND SELECTING MEDIA. SEVENTEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN SELECTED TO PREPARE FOR THE NEW \"ORGANIC CURRICULUM\" WHILE THE BEHAVIORAL OBJECTIVES ARE BEING DEVELOPED. THE PLAN CALLS  FOR AN INVESTMENT OF $30,000,000 OVER THE NEXT 5 YEARS.

METHODOLOGICALLY, RELATIONAL ANALYSIS IN WHICH THE UNIT OF ANALYSIS IS A TWO-PERSON INTERACTING PAIR, A MULTIPLE PERSON COMMUNICATION CHAIN, OR CLIQUES OR SUBSYSTEMS IS NEEDED IN PLACE OF INVESTIGATION IN WHICH THE UNIT OF ANALYSIS IS THE INDIVIDUAL. RELATIONAL ANALYSIS IS ESPECIALLY ADVANTAGEOUS IN DETERMINING THE DEGREE TO WHICH TWO INDIVIDUALS WHO INTERACT ARE SIMILAR. PROCEDURALLY, THE STUDY OF STRUCTURAL EFFECTS AS SYSTEM VARIABLES IN THE DIFFUSION OF INNOVATIONS WITHIN EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS IS NEEDED. STRUCTURAL EFFECTS ARE THE CONSEQUENCES ON ONE'S BEHAVIOR OF THE SOCIAL STRUCTURE OF THE SYSTEM  IN WHICH ONE IS A MEMBER. CONCEPTUALLY THE STUDY OF FOUR INTERRELATED CATEGORIES OF VARIABLES IS NEEDED--DIFFUSION EFFECTS VARIABLES, COMMUNICATION VARIABLES, SOCIAL SYSTEM VARIABLES, AND CONSEQUENCES VARIABLES. ENLARGING THE MODEL OF DIFFUSION REASEARCH TO INCLUDE A CLASS OF MORE ULTIMATE DEPENDENT VARIABLES DEALING WITH INNOVATION CONSEQUENCES AND MORE SOCIAL STRUCTURAL VARIABLES, AND UTILIZING SUCH METHODOLOGICAL ADVANCES AS RELATIONAL ANALYSIS AND THE STUDY OF STRUCTURAL EFFECTS IN DIFFUSION INVESTIGATION, WILL RESULT IN A BETTER INSIGHT INTO HUMAN BEHAVIORAL CHANGE IN ORGANIZATIONAL SETTING, AS WELL AS IMPLICATIONS FOR MORE RAPID EDUCATIONAL DIFFUSION.

TO PROMOTE THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMPLETE DIFFUSION PROCESS OF EDUCATIONAL CHANGE, RESEARCH SHOULD CONSIDER THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS, THE PROCESS OF GATEKEEPING, OR THE ROLE OF THE INTERMEDIATE DISSEMINATORS, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN INNOVATION AFTER IT HAS BEEN ADOPTED, AND THE EFFECTS OF INNOVATION UPON EDUCATION. RESEARCH METHODS WHICH OFFER PROMISE IN SOLVING SOME OF THE PROBLEMS OF STUDYING EDUCATIONAL CHANGE ARE FIELD EXPERIMENT, COMPUTER SIMULATION, AND STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS, THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE VARIOUS PROPERTIES OF GROUP STRUCTURE AND INNOVATION  DIFFUSION INDEXES. A STUDY OF INNOVATION DIFFUSION AMONG TEACHERS IN THREE MICHIGAN HIGH SCHOOLS DEMONSTRATED HOW GROUP STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES CAN BE ANALYZED IN A WAY THAT IS MEANINGFUL AND THAT SHEDS LIGHT ON THE DIFFUSION PROCESS. IT DEMONSTRATED THAT THE DIFFUSION PHENOMENA WITHIN ORGANIZATIONS MAY BE EXPLAINED AND PREDICTED FROM CERTAIN STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES. FOR EXAMPLE, THOSE WHO PLAY LIAISON ROLES AND WHO ENJOY HIGH PRESTIGE AMONG FELLOW MEMBERS SHOULD BE STUDIED BECAUSE THEY ARE RELEVANT TO THE INTRODUCTION OF AND RECEPTIVITY TO THE INNOVATION IN THE SOCIAL SYSTEM. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS HAS POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS FOR EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS OR POLICY MAKERS ATTEMPTING TO INNOVATE BECAUSE IT CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE OPTIMAL PROCESS FOR DISSEMINATING NEW IDEAS AND PRACTICES  AND ABOUT THE COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN THE FORMAL AND INFORMAL STRUCTURES WITHIN A SYSTEM, AND IT MAY BE USED TO IMPROVE THE STRUCTURE FOR INNOVATION ASSIMILATION.

THE PROGRAMS INCLUDE SUCH ACTIVITIES AS--(1) FINANCIAL ENCOURAGEMENT OF INDUSTRY TO PARTICIPATE IN TRAINING THE OLDER ADULT, (2) RETRAINING TO MEET SPECIFIC SHORTAGES IN THE WORK FORCE, (3) TRAINING FOR FUTURE INDUSTRIAL NEEDS, AND (4) PROVISION OF TRAINING ALLOWANCES. SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH DONE IN ENGLAND HAS PROVIDED EVIDENCE THAT IT IS SOUND PUBLIC POLICY TO INVEST IN TRAINING OF OLDER PERSONS, AND SPECIALLY-DESIGNED TRAINING FOR THEM IS VERY EFFECTIVE. THE RESULTS OF TWO STUDIES DEMONSTRATE AN ACTIVITY METHOD OF LEARNING IS SUPERIOR TO MEMORIZATION, AND WHEN INFERENCE, OR  DEDUCTION, IS INTRODUCED INTO PROGRAMED AND ACTIVITY LEARNING, SUCCESS IS GREATER THAN BY EITHER METHOD, AS WELL AS BY MEMORIZATION. A HIGH DROPOUT RATE AT COMMENCEMENT OF TRAINING AND AFTER TRANSFER TO THE WORK SITUATION, AND LOW EMPLOYMENT IN LARGER, MORE ADVANCED FIRMS WERE ALSO REVEALED BY SURVEYS. INFORMATION RESULTING FROM THESE STUDIES IS BEING APPLIED IN EXPERIMENTAL PROJECTS IN FIVE COUNTRIES. THIS PAPER WAS PRESENTED AT THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MANPOWER TRAINING AND THE OLDER WORKER, WASHINGTON, JANUARY 17-19, 1966. (PT)",

IN SOUTH BEND, INDIANA, A PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED FOR THE EDUCATIONAL REHABILITATION OF 100 HARD-CORE UNEMPLOYED WHOSE GATB SCORES DISQUALIFIED THEM FOR VOCATIONAL TRAINING. THE U.S. EMPLOYMENT SERVICE HAS UNDERTAKEN A PROGRAM OF RESEARCH ON THE APPLICABILITY OF APTITUDE TESTS FOR OLDER WORKERS, DEVELOPMENT OF APPROPRIATE TESTING TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES FOR EDUCATIONALLY DEFICIENT PERSONS, AND OF ACHIEVEMENT TESTS OF BASIC LITERACY SKILLS. IN WILLIAMSPORT, PENNSYLVANIA, A VOCATIONAL DIAGNOSIS PROGRAM TOOK INTO ACCOUNT PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS OF THE TRAINEES AND PROVIDED A JOB TRIAL SITUATION BEFORE A DECISION WAS MADE ON THE OCCUPATION TO BE SELECTED. IN  THE UTAH EXPERIENCE, EFFORT HAS BEEN CONCENTRATED ON IDENTIFYING POTENTIALLY OBSOLETE WORKERS AND UPGRADING THEIR SKILLS BEFORE THEY BECOME UNEMPLOYED. AFTER DISCUSSION, AGREEMENT WAS REACHED THAT (1) TESTS SHOULD NOT BE DISCONTINUED, (2) THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF VALIDITY OF TESTS SHOULD BE ASSURED, (3) THE TRAINING PERIOD MAY BE A BETTER PREDICTOR OF SUCCESS ON THE JOB, (4) JOBS SHOULD BE PROVIDED AT DIFFERENT LEVELS, AND (5) THERE SHOULD BE MORE RESEARCH ON CULTURE-FREE TESTS.

THE INTELLECTUAL AND EMOTIONAL DIFFICULTIES OF OLDER PERSONS IN RETRAINING WERE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN PLANNING THE RETRAINING. THE PROGRAM COVERS 11 WEEKS--THREE WEEKS OF STUDY OF DIRECT AND ALTERNATING CURRENT, FIVE WEEKS ON THE CONTROL INSTRUMENTS, DRIVING AND RUNNING REPAIRS, AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING ELECTRIC TRACTION, AND THREE WEEKS OF DRIVING. TO INCREASE THE CONFIDENCE OF TRAINEES, DRIVING AND REPAIR MANUALS HAVE BEEN DRAWN UP, YOUNGER AND OLDER WORKERS ARE RETRAINED TOGETHER, INSTRUCTORS ARE CAREFULLY SELECTED AND WELL  TRAINED, AND FELLOW-WORKERS WHO HAVE ALREADY EXPERIENCED TRAINING ARE CALLED BACK TO ACT AS MONITORS DURING THE DRIVING TRAINING. THE PROGRAM HAS PROVED VERY EFFECTIVE IN THAT THE NUMBER OF BREAKDOWNS DUE TO IGNORANCE ON THE PART OF RETRAINED DRIVERS IS VERY SMALL AND THE NUMBER OF DRIVING LICENSES FOR DIESEL AND DIESEL-ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES REFUSED TO EX-STEAMDRIVERS WAS NEGLIGIBLE.

MYTHS ABOUT BLUE-COLLAR WORKERS WHICH STAND IN THEIR WAY INCLUDE--LOWER CLASS APATHY, INCAPABILITY OF SUSTAINED INTELLECTUAL EFFORT, AND LACK OF APPRECIATION OF THE VALUE OF EDUCATION. OBSTACLES INHERING IN SOCIAL CONDITIONS WERE REVEALED IN A STUDY MADE BY THE AUTHORS IN OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA, AND INCLUDED--LOWER CLASS FEELINGS OF BEING TOO OLD OR TIRED, FEAR OF FAILURE, NEGATIVE PRESSURES FROM PEERS, AND AN UNAWARENESS OF EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND ORGANIZATIONS SPONSORING ACTIVITIES. THESE STEREOTYPES AND THE INABILITY OF ADULT EDUCATORS TO UNDERSTAND LOWER CLASS LIFE SITUATION HAVE FORESTALLED IMAGINATIVE PROGRAMING. IT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT TO  IMPROVE PROGRAMS, ALSO, BECAUSE OF LITTLE FEEDBACK FROM THE LESS ARTICULATE BLUE-COLLAR WORKER. LOW SKILLED WORKERS TENDED TO PARTICIPATE IN ADULT EDUCATION IN ORDER TO GET A NEW JOB BUT MANY WHO WANT A NEW JOB WERE NOT PARTICIPATING. THE LABOR MARKET CONDITION AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR EMPLOYMENT MAY HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT FACTORS. IT MAY ALSO BE THAT ADULT EDUCATION COURSES WERE NOT MESHED WITH OPENINGS IN THE LABOR MARKET.

THE LOCAL POPULATION WAS FOUND TO RELY HEAVILY ON THE MASS MEDIA AND  VARIOUS KINDS OF READING MATTER FOR ALL TOPIC AREAS AND ON INSTITUTIONAL SOURCES AND OFFICIALS IN CERTAIN CASES. YOUNG ADULTS RELIED ALSO ON FRIENDS AND RELATIVES AND EXHIBITED THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF NEED FOR NEW INFORMATION.

PRESENT PRACTICE IS NOT OBJECTIVE, BUT COULD BE SO, AS SHOWN BY THE EXAMPLE HERE PRESENTED. DATA COME FROM THE RESPONSES OF 976 LAW STUDENTS TO 48 READING COMPREHENSION ITEMS ON THE LAW SCHOOL ADMISSIONS TEST. THE POSSIBILITY OF PERSON FREE TEST CALIBRATION IS DEMONSTRATED BY SHOWING THAT A CALIBRATION BASED ON THE RESPONSES OF A DUMB GROUP OF STUDENTS CAN BE NEARLY IDENTICAL WITH ONE BASED ON A SMART GROUP. THE POSSIBILITY OF ITEM FREE PERSON MEASUREMENT IS DEMONSTRATED BY SHOWING THAT ABILITY ESTIMATES MADE FROM SCORES ON AN EASY TEST CAN BE STATISTICALLY EQUIVALENT TO  THOSE MADE FROM A HARD TEST. THE MEASUREMENT MODEL WHICH MAKES THIS OBJECTIVITY POSSIBLE WAS DEVELOPED BY GEORG RASCH. IN THIS MODEL THE ODDS OF SUCCESS ON A TEST ITEM ARE HYPOTHESIZED TO BE GIVEN BY THE PRODUCT OF THE PERSON'S ABILITY AND THE ITEM'S EASINESS. IN ORDER TO FIT THIS MODEL ITEMS MUST BE CHOSEN OR CONSTRUCTED TO HAVE SIMILAR DISCRIMINATION.

IT POINTS OUT SUCH TRENDS AS REHABILITATING DISADVANTAGED WORKERS IN INNER-CITY AREAS, EXPANSION OF ON-THE-JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS, ACTIVE ENCOURAGEMENT OF BUSINESS INVOLVEMENT IN PUBLIC TRAINING PROGRAMS, AND REORIENTATION TOWARD CLIENT-CENTERED SERVICES INVOLVING SUCH NEW CONCEPTS AS OUTREACH, JOB DEVELOPMENT, AND INTERAGENCY PROGRAMING. AMONG THE PROBLEMS OUTLINED ARE THE UNRESPONSIVENESS OF COMMUNITY INSTITUTIONS AND THE \"CRASH\" NATURE OF  PROGRAMS DUE TO FUNDING PRACTICES.

THE EFFECT OF PHONETIC DIFFERENCES WAS SIGNIFICANT FOR THE WHITE MIDDLE-CLASS GROUP BUT NOT FOR THE NEGRO LOWER SOCIAL CLASS GROUP, WHILE THE EFFECTS OF SOURCE DIFFERENCES WERE NOT CLEARLY OBSERVABLE IN THE DATA.

COMPLETE AND CONTINUOUS RECORDINGS OF ALL THE VOCALIZATIONS OF TWO INFANTS DURING THE FIRST FIVE MONTHS OF LIFE WERE COLLECTED AND SYSTEMATICALLY SAMPLED FOR ANALYSIS. COMPOSITE STATISTICS, DESCRIBING THE THREE PROSODIC FEATURES OF THE VOCALIZING IN EACH SAMPLE (FUNDAMENTAL FREQUENCY, RELATIVE AMPLITUDE, AND DURATION), WERE PLOTTED SEPARATELY AS A FUNCTION OF AGE AT THE TIME OF SAMPLE. PARAMETER VALUES AND TRENDS IN THE PROSODIC FEATURES OF INFANT VOCALIZATION ARE REPORTED. IN EXPERIMENT 2, CONTROL OF INFANT VOCAL AND MOTOR OPERANT BEHAVIOR WAS STUDIED DURING AN EXPERIMENT CONDUCTED IN THE INFANT'S HOME. DAILY EXPERIMENTAL SESSIONS WERE HELD  FROM THE TIME THE SUBJECT WAS 10 DAYS OLD UNTIL HE WAS THREE MONTHS OLD. VOCALIZATION AND LEG KICK WERE STUDIED UNDER A NUMBER OF CONDITIONS. FOUR REINFORCERS WERE EMPLOYED--A RECORDING OF THE MOTHER'S HEARTBEAT, A VIBRATOR TAPED TO THE INFANT'S PALM, TWO FLASHING LIGHTS, AND A RECORDING OF THE MOTHER'S VOICE. SCHEDULE CONTROL OVER RESPONDING AND DIFFERENTIAL RESPONDING UNDER DISCRIMINATIVE CONTROL FOR BOTH VOCAL AND MOTOR OPERANTS IN AN INFANT LESS THAN THREE MONTHS OF AGE WAS ACHIEVED.

BECAUSE THE SEMANTIC STRUCTURE OF CEBUANO FOLLOWS QUITE DIFFERENT LINES FROM EUROPEAN LANGUAGES, IT IS NECESSARY TO DEVELOP A DICTIONARY BASED SOLELY ON CEBUANO TEXTS. FURTHER, EXISTING DICTIONARIES COULD NOT BE USED AS A STARTING POINT AS THEY ARE INSUFFICIENT IN SCOPE AND TOO CLOSELY TIED TO ENGLISH OR SPANISH TO ALLOW FOR ACCURATE DEFINITIONS. THIS CARD  FILE HAS BEEN PREPARED BY MAKING AN EXHAUSTIVE CONCORDANCE OF EXTENSIVE TEXTS AND THEN READING FURTHER TEXTS AND CHECKING AGAINST THE CONCORDANCE, LISTING ALL NEW ENTRIES OR NEW MEANINGS FOR OLD ENTRIES.

THE TIME INTERVALS BETWEEN SUCCESSIVE MAJOR STRESSES ARE HYPOTHESIZED TO REMAIN ROUGHLY EQUAL IN ENGLISH SPEECH, I.E., ENGLISH IS SAID TO BE A STRESS-TIMED LANGUAGE. IN ORDER TO MEASURE THESE TIME INTERVALS, HOWEVER, THEIR END POINTS, THE RHYTHMIC BEATS, MUST FIRST BE FOUND. NATIVE SPEAKERS OF ENGLISH FEEL THE RHYTHM OF THEIR SPEECH INTUITIVELY AND CAN REACT CONSISTENTLY TO THE BEAT OF A STRESSED OR RHYTHMIC SYLLABLE. THE PRESENT WORK DETERMINED THE VALIDITY OF THIS RHYTHMIC INTUITION AND USED IT TO LOCATE THE SYLLABLE BEAT. OF THE TWO MEANS OF LOCATING THE SYLLABLE BEAT, (TAPPING TO THE BEAT WITH A FINGER,  AND BY PLACING AN AUDIBLE CLICK ON THE BEAT), TAPPING SEEMED TO BE A MORE VALID RESPONSE. FROM THE FINDING OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN RHYTHMICALNESS-STRESS AND TAPPING BEHAVIOR, IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT RHYTHM EXISTS IN CONVERSATIONAL ENGLISH, INSOFAR AS THE STIMULUS UTTERANCES USED IN THIS EXPERIMENT ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF CONVERSATIONAL ENGLISH.

THE ABSENCE OF STABLE INVARIANTS IN SPEECH PRODUCTION IMPLIES THAT A COMPUTER MUST BE SELF-ADAPTIVE IN ORDER TO RECOGNIZE THE PHONETIC EVENTS OF DIFFERENT SPEECH PRODUCTIONS. SELF-ADAPTATION, HOWEVER, REQUIRES THAT PHONEME SEPARATION AND CLASSIFICATION BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THE USE OF SIMPLE BOUNDARIES AND SIMPLE CHANGES IN THESE BOUNDARIES, WHILE MAINTAINING THE REQUISITE ACCURACY. THIS EXPERIMENT PRESENTS DATA THAT INDICATE THAT VOWELS MAY BE CLASSIFIED BY USING SIMPLE BOUNDARIES IN THE F1-F2 PLANE IF SUFFICIENT CONTROL OVER THE SPEECH PRODUCTION HAS BEEN EXERCISED. FORMANT LOCATIONS OF 176 PRODUCTIONS OF EIGHT VOWELS FOR NINE SPEAKERS ARE PRESENTED IN WHICH  IT IS SHOWN THAT SUITABLE ACCURACY OF CLASSIFICATION IS OBTAINED BY A BOUNDARY OF CONSTANT F1 AND A BOUNDARY OF CONSTANT F2.

THE CONTEXTS OF THE VARIOUS PASSAGES WERE IDENTICAL. THE TASK WAS TO LEARN THE PASSAGE. AFTER A SINGLE STUDY TRIAL, ALL SUBJECTS WERE GIVEN A TEST OF RECOGNITION MEMORY FOR THE CRITICAL WORDS. THE CRITICAL WORDS WERE TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT AND RANDOMIZED WITHIN A SERIES OF FILLER ITEMS. THUS, THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CONSTRUCTION THAT IS LIKELY TO OCCUR DURING RECALL OF CONNECTED DISCOURSE WAS  REDUCED.

THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER NORMAL SUBJECTS (SS) SHOW GENERAL AGREEMENT IN THEIR PREFERENCE OF MEMBERS OF A PAIR OF NON-GRAMMATICAL STATEMENTS AND HOW SUCH STATEMENTS WOULD BE RANKED WITH RESPECT TO THEIR APPROXIMATION TO \"GOOD ENGLISH.\" TWENTY-EIGHT SS WERE PRESENTED WITH COMPUTER GENERATED NON-GRAMMATICAL STATEMENTS, AND ASKED TO CARRY OUT TWO TASKS ON EACH OF TWO EXPERIMENTAL DAYS. TASK 1 WAS A FORCED-CHOICE EXPERIMENT IN WHICH 50 PAIRS OF STATEMENTS WERE  PRESENTED AURALLY TO EACH S, AND HE HAD TO SELECT THAT MEMBER OF THE PAIR WHICH HE FELT WAS THE BEST APPROXIMATION TO A GOOD ENGLISH SENTENCE. IN TASK 2, SS WERE REQUIRED TO READ AND RANK EACH STATEMENT ON A SCALE RUNNING FROM 1 (COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE) TO 5 (COMPLETELY ACCEPTABLE). A DIFFERENT ORDER OF STIMULUS PRESENTATION WAS EMPLOYED ON EACH EXPERIMENTAL DAY. FOURTEEN SS WERE ASSIGNED TO ONE ORDER ON THE FIRST DAY, AND RECEIVED THE OTHER ORDER ON THE SECOND DAY. RESULTS SHOW THAT SS TEND TO PREFER THE SAME STATEMENT OVER ORDERS, AND THAT RANK AND PREFERENCE ARE HIGHLY CORRELATED. THERE WERE CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCES IN PREFERENCE AMONG THE 50 PAIRS OF STIMULUS ITEMS. PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF THE DATA SUGGESTS THAT THIS TASK YIELDS INFORMATION RELEVANT TO THE LINGUISTIC AND IN  PARTICULAR THE SYNTACTIC COMPETENCE OF SS WHEN APPLIED TO NON-GRAMMATICAL STATEMENTS. SS APPEAR TO BE TRYING TO COPE WITH THE STATEMENTS BY COMPARING THEM TO AN ACCEPTABLE SYNTACTIC PATTERN.

AS STEPS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS THEORY, MODELS FOR TWO SETS OF SIGNALS ARE PROPOSED AND TESTED. THE FIRST MODEL IS FOR A SET COMPRISED OF ALL SIGNALS OF THE INTERNATIONAL MORSE CODE (IMC) IN ADDITION TO SOME SIMILAR DOT AND DASH PATTERNS. THE SECOND MODEL IS FOR A SET COMPRISED OF 32 MORSE-LIKE RHYTHMIC PATTERNS IN WHICH THE SILENT INTERVALS BETWEEN THE DOTS AND DASHES CAN BE EITHER SHORT OR LONG. AN EXPERIMENT BY ROTHKOPF SUPPLIES THE DATA USED TO TEST THE FIRST MODEL. AN EXPERIMENT CARRIED OUT BY THE PRESENT INVESTIGATOR PROVIDED THE DATA USED TO TEST THE SECOND MODEL. IN ROTHKOPF'S STUDY 598 AIRMEN  (WHO HAD HAD NO PREVIOUS MORSE CODE TRAINING) AWAITING BASIC TRAINING WERE PRESENTED PAIRS OF IMC SIGNALS AND WERE INSTRUCTED TO RESPOND &quot;SAME&quot; OR &quot;DIFFERENT&quot; ON AN IBM ANSWER SHEET TO EACH OF THESE PAIRS ACCORDING TO WHETHER THEY PERCEIVED THE TWO SIGNALS OF THE PAIR TO BE THE SAME OR DIFFERENT. IN THE PRESENT INVESTIGATOR'S EXPERIMENT, 324 FEMALE UNDERGRADUATES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN ENROLLED IN INTRODUCTORY PSYCHOLOGY COURSES WERE PRESENTED PAIRS OF THE MORSE-LIKE RHYTHMIC PATTERNS, RATHER THAN PAIRS OF IMC SIGNALS, AND WERE INSTRUCTED TO INDICATE WHETHER THEY PERCEIVED THE SIGNALS OF EACH OF THESE PAIRS AS SAME OR DIFFERENT. IN TESTING BOTH MODELS THE PERCENTAGE OF &quot;SAME&quot; RESPONSES TO EACH ORDERED PAIR OF SIGNALS IS USED AS A MEASURE OF THE CONFUSABILITY OF THE SIGNALS OF THE  ORDERED PAIR. USING THIS CONFUSABILITY MEASURE, THE FIRST AND SECOND MODELS ARE SHOWN TO BE OVERWHELMINGLY SUPPORTED BY THE DATA. OTHER PATTERNS OF SIGNAL CONFUSION IN THE TWO EXPERIMENTS ARE ALSO DESCRIBED.

THE CHAPTER IS CONCERNED WITH TWO KINDS OF INTERACTIONS--(1) THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE ACQUISITION OF LANGUAGE AND THE GROWTH OF INTELLECT, AND (2) THE CONNECTION BETWEEN BOTH OF THESE AND THE PROCESS OF MATURATION. THIS INTERACTION PROVIDES CONSIDERABLE INSIGHT INTO THE PROCESS WHEREBY A CHILD GROWS TO BECOME AN ADULT. WAYS OF THINKING ABOUT LANGUAGE (SAUSSURE'S \"PAROLE\" AND \"LANGUE\" AND CHOMSKY'S \"PERFORMANCE\" AND \"COMPETENCE\") ARE  GENERALLY DEFINED AND FOLLOWED BY DISCUSSIONS OF FINITE-STATE GRAMMARS, RECURSIVENESS AND LINGUISTIC ABSTRACTION, AND PHRASE-STRUCTURE RULES.

FIFTY MIDDLE CLASS AND 50 LOWER CLASS NEGRO KINDERGARTEN BOYS WERE INDIVIDUALLY ADMINISTERED EXTENSIVE TESTS DESIGNED TO ASSESS SPECIFIC INFORMATION PROCESSING ABILITIES. THE EIGHT INSTRUMENTS USED INCLUDED THREE STANDARDIZED TESTS (ILLINOIS TEST OF PSYCHOLINGUISTIC ABILITIES, THE BEERY-BUKTENICA DEVELOPMENTAL FORM SEQUENCE, AND THE WEPMAN AUDITORY DISCRIMINATION TEST), AND FIVE UNSTANDARIZED INSTRUMENTS. A COMPONENT ANALYSIS OF 19 VARIABLES PRODUCED FIVE REASONABLY MEANINGFUL COMPONENTS. THE EVIDENCE FROM THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT THE MAJOR DIFFERENTIATING CHARACTERISTIC BETWEEN THE MIDDLE AND LOWER CLASS IS GENERAL LANGUAGE ABILITY. THIS  COMPONENT ACCOUNTED FOR THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF THE VARIANCE, PRODUCED THE LARGEST MEAN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GROUPS, AND HAD THE HIGHEST CORRELATION WITH SOCIAL CLASS. THE FINDINGS NOTED IN THE STUDY APPEAR TO SUPPORT STRONGLY THE POSITION THAT CULTURAL DEPRIVATION IS ESSENTIALLY LANGUAGE DEPRIVATION, ESPECIALLY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES. USING A DEFINITION BASED ON LANGUAGE VARIABLES, RATHER THAN SOCIOECONOMIC VARIABLES, APPEARS TO BE ADVANTAGEOUS IN TERMS OF BOTH IDENTIFICATION AND REMEDIAL OR COMPENSATORY EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMING.

AFTER THREE YEARS, AN EXTENSIVE EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAM WAS MADE IN THREE AREAS--(1) STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT (ESPECIALLY IN SCIENCE AND SPANISH), (2) PERSONAL AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT (INCLUDING BILINGUAL DOMINANCE AND CULTURAL ATTITUDES), AND (3) THE REACTIONS OF THE PROFESSIONAL STAFF TO THE PROGRAM. EXPERIMENTAL GROUP ACHIEVEMENT WAS FOUND TO BE SUPERIOR IN SCIENCE AND SPANISH, BUT WAS NOT  AFFECTED IN SOCIAL STUDIES OR MATHEMATICS. IN THE AREA OF CLASSROOM ENGLISH ACHIEVEMENT, THE EXPERIMENTALS DID AS WELL AS THE CONTROLS, WHILE IN ENGLISH READING ABILITY THEY DID MUCH BETTER.

THE DATA IS PRESENTED IN 11 TABLES. THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME BROAD CONCLUSIONS FORMULATED BY THE WRITER AS A RESULT OF DIGESTING THE FINDINGS. LEADERSHIP FOR THE S.A. FUNCTION IS GENERALLY PROVIDED BY PERSONS IN GENERALIST POSITIONS. THE DEVELOPMENT OF S.A. SPECIALISTS OCCURRED  PRIMARILY IN THE PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. S.A. STAFF HAVE VARIED FUNCTIONS AND ARE INFLUENTIAL IN THE CREATION OF CAMPUS CLIMATE. A MINORITY OF S.A. STAFF SEE RESEARCH AS A MAJOR RESPONSIBILITY. FURTHER UPGRADING OF THE PRIORITY GIVEN TO THE FUNCTION IS NEEDED. STUDENTS ARE ASSUMING MORE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR ACTIVITIES, CASTING THE STAFF MORE IN THE ROLE OF CONSULTANTS RATHER THAN SUPERVISORS. APPROACHES CITED BY STAFF MEMBERS TO KEEP ABREAST OF TRENDS ON THE CAMPUS ARE PRESENTED. (AUTHOR/IM)",

THIS PROBABILITY IS SUPPORTED BY THE RESULTS OF A FOUR-YEAR PROJECT DESIGNED TO IMPROVE A JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL SOCIAL STUDIES PROGRAM THROUGH THE USE OF TEAM TEACHING TECHNIQUES AND A FLEXIBLE GROUPING ARRANGEMENT. THE EFFECTS OF THE PROGRAM WERE STUDIED USING THE TRADITIONAL CRITERIA OF STANDARDIZED ACHIEVEMENT TEST SCORES AND TEACHER OPINIONS. IN ADDITION, THE INVESTIGATORS USED A MOTIVATION INVENTORY DEVELOPED BY FRYMIER (1962) AND A SEVEN-SCORE ATTITUDE INVENTORY DEVELOPED BY ZWEIBELSON (1965). ACHIEVEMENT TEST SCORES SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE HETEROGENEOUS EXPERIMENTAL GROUP OF TEAM TAUGHT STUDENTS AND THE HOMOGENEOUS CONTROL GROUP OF TRADITIONALLY  TAUGHT STUDENTS. STUDENTS GROUPED IN HIGH ABILITY TRACKS TENDED TO HAVE MORE NEGATIVE ATTITUDES TOWARD THE SCHOOL AND LEARNING AND TO EXPRESS LOWER MOTIVATION THAN LOW ABILITY GROUPS. SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER ATTITUDES WERE DEVELOPED BY TEAM TAUGHT STUDENTS. THE INVESTIGATORS' RESULTS SUGGEST THAT TEAM TEACHING AND FLEXIBLE GROUPING HELP TO IMPROVE ATTITUDES WITH NO ADVERSE EFFECT OF ACHIEVEMENT.

THE THREE AREAS MEASURED WERE PERCEPTUAL-MOTOR, SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL, AND INTELLECTUAL-ACADEMIC. EACH AREA WAS MEASURED BY AT LEAST TWO CAREFULLY SELECTED INSTRUMENTS ON SEVEN CONSECUTIVE DAYS, 120 STUDENTS WERE ADMINISTERED THE TESTS. FROM THIS SAMPLE, 25 STUDENTS WERE CHOSEN FOR IN-DEPTH TESTING. RESULTS INDICATE THAT MEXICAN-AMERICAN STUDENTS TEND TO FALL  PROGRESSIVELY BEHIND THE NORMATIVE POPULATION IN PERCEPTUAL-MOTOR DEVELOPMENT. THEIR SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT WAS CHARACTERIZED BY FEELING OF INADEQUACY AND LOW SELF-ESTEEM. HOWEVER, IN SPITE OF THEIR LOW SELF-CONCEPT, THEIR SOCIAL MATURITY WAS HIGHER THAN THAT OF THE NORMATIVE POPULATION.

SOME 106 HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS COMPLETED THE ACHIEVEMENT ANXIETY TEST. THEY WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO ONE OF TWO TREATMENT GROUPS TWO WEEKS LATER. SUBJECTS IN ONE GROUP WERE ADMINISTERED A STANDARDIZED MATHEMATICS ACHIEVEMENT TEST WITH THE ITEMS ORDERED FROM EASY TO DIFFICULT. SUBJECTS IN THE SECOND GROUP TOOK THE SAME WITH THE ORDER OF ITEMS REVERSED. A PHYSIOLOGICAL INDICANT OF STRESS, HEART-RATE, WAS MEASURED THREE TIMES DURING THE TEST USING A PULSEMETER. RESULTS CONFIRMED THE FINDING OF OTHER RESEARCHERS THAT THE MEAN NUMBER OF CORRECT ANSWERS FOR TEST QUESTIONS ARRANGED IN  THE DIFFICULT-TO-EASY ORDER WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE MEAN NUMBER OF TEST QUESTIONS ARRANGED IN THE REVERSE ORDER. THIS STUDY GENERALIZES THE RESULT TO THE CONTENT DOMAIN OF MATHEMATICS. THIS STUDY PROVIDES TENTATIVE SUPPORT FOR THE HYPOTHESIS THAT ITEM ORDER HAS AN EFFECT ON THE STRESS GENERATED DURING A TEST. THIS POINT DESERVES TO BE RESEARCHED ADDITIONALLY TO ACHIEVE MORE CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THAN WAS OBTAINED IN THIS STUDY.

THE TECHNIQUE USED TO ALTER THE RATE OF PRESENTATION OF TAPE-RECORDED SPEECH IS AN INNOVATION WHICH PERMITS THE SPEED OF SPEECH TO BE ALTERED INDEPENDENTLY OF PITCH. COLLEGE STUDENTS WERE TESTED IN A NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTS USING NOVELS AS PRACTICE LISTENING MATERIAL AND HISTORICAL PASSAGES AS TEST MATERIAL, WITH LESS COMPLETE EXAMINATION OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND GEOLOGICAL MATERIALS. VARIABLES WERE GROUPED INTO THREE AREAS--(1) STIMULUS VARIABLES (AMOUNT, DURATION, RATE, CONTENT, AND CONTINUITY OF EXPOSURE  TO PRACTICE AND TEST LISTENING MATERIALS), (2) SITUATIONAL VARIABLES (LISTENING AIDS BEFORE AND DURING MATERIAL PRESENTATION, SELF-DETERMINATION OF RATE, MEASUREMENT OF RETENTION, AND USE OF COMPRESSED SPEECH AS A METHOD OF REVIEW), AND (3) LISTENER VARIABLES (INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN SEX, INTERCORRELATIONS BETWEEN LISTENING AND READING SCORES, AND GENERAL LANGUAGE ABILITY). THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT STUDENTS CAN LEARN TO COMPREHEND COLLEGE LEVEL MATERIAL AT BETTER THAN TWICE THE NORMAL RATE.

COST IS A RELATIVELY MINOR CONSIDERATION IN PREVENTING BRIGHT YOUNGSTERS FROM ATTENDING COLLEGE. ONCE THE DECISION HAS BEEN MADE TO GO TO COLLEGE, HOWEVER, THE PRICE IS IMPORTANT IN ENCOURAGING APPLICATION TO A PARTICULAR INSTITUTION. AT THE INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL, HIGH QUALITY, HIGH PRICE INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT DRIVEN OUT BY POOR QUALITY OR LOW COST COLLEGES. FURTHERMORE, THE QUALITY OF PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS IN ALMOST EVERY STATE HAS BEEN RISING. FOUR CONCLUSIONS EMERGE CONCERNING THE PRICING PROBLEM FACING PRIVATE COLLEGES AND  UNIVERSITIES--(1) PRIVATE INSTITUTIONAL COSTS HAVE RISEN FASTER THAN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONAL COSTS, PARTICULARLY OVER THE LAST SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS, (2) PRIVATE INSTITUTIONAL COSTS HAVE RISEN LITTLE IN RELATION TO FAMILY INCOMES, (3) THE NUMBER OF COLLEGE STUDENTS FROM RELATIVELY AFFLUENT FAMILIES HAS RISEN TWICE AS FAST AS THE NUMBER OF PLACES IN PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS, AND (4) GREATER ECONOMIC SELECTIVITY OF STUDENTS IS OCCURRING AT A TIME WHEN MOST INSTITUTIONS WOULD PREFER TO BROADEN THE BASE FROM WHICH THEY DRAW ABLE STUDENTS.

BANKS HAVE TWO INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES RELATIVE TO STUDENT LOANS--THEIR OWN PLANS AND PARTICIPATION IN GUARANTEED LOAN PLANS. THESE  PLANS AS WELL AS OTHER ASPECTS OF EDUCATIONAL FINANCE ARE DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF THE AVAILABILITY OF MONEY AS DICTATED BY FEDERAL RESERVE POLICY. THIS PAPER WAS PRESENTED AT THE COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIP SERVICE COLLOQUIUM ON FINANCIAL AID (3D, FONTANA, WISCONSIN, MAY 22-25, 1966) AND THE COMPLETE DOCUMENT, OF WHICH THIS IS ONE PAPER, &quot;THE ECONOMICS OF HIGHER EDUCATION,&quot; IS AVAILABLE FOR $2.00 FROM THE COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAMINATION BOARD, PUBLICATIONS ORDER OFFICE, BOX 592, PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY 08540.

        "description":"THIS PAPER DEVELOPS AN ECONOMIC THEORY OF INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION (IHE) FROM WHICH IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO EXTRACT A THEORY OF ENROLLMENT SUPPLY. SUCH A THEORY MUST DIFFER RADICALLY FROM THE THEORY OF THE BUSINESS FIRM BECAUSE OF TWO KEY ASSUMPTIONS WHICH CANNOT BE MADE ABOUT THE IHE--PROFIT MAXIMIZATION AND A PRODUCTION FUNCTION WHICH FORCES UPON THE FIRM A CONDITION OF RISING MARGINAL COST. THEREFORE, AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO DESCRIBE THE &quot;MODUS OPERANDI&quot; FOR THE IHE IS DEVELOPED. TWO APPROACHES ARE TRIED USING A RULE-OF-THUMB BEHAVIOR ASSUMPTION AND AN OUTLAY MAXIMIZATION ASSUMPTION, BUT NEITHER PRODUCES SATISFACTORY RESULTS. COMBINATION OF THE TWO PRODUCES SATISFACTORY RESULTS. THIS COMPROMISE IS EMBODIED IN THE UTILITY FUNCTION--U = V(OUTLAYS, ENROLLMENT). FROM  THIS UTILITY FUNCTION, A SUPPLY FUNCTION FOR THE IHE IS DERIVED. USING THIS SUPPLY FUNCTION AND A LINEAR DEMAND FUNCTION, NONPRICE RATIONING, THE ECONOMICS OF SCHOLARSHIPS, AND IMPLICATIONS OF PRICE CONTROL ARE DISCUSSED.

INCREASING INSTITUTIONAL SPECIALIZATION MEANS THAT COOPERATION AND COORDINATION WITHIN A GROUP OF GEOGRAPHICALLY RELATED COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES, PRIVATE AS WELL AS PUBLIC, ARE NECESSARY IF THE OBJECTIVES OF A TOP QUALITY COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM OF HIGHER EDUCATION ARE TO BE REALIZED. WITHIN A STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM HAVING A CENTRALIZED ADMINISTRATION FOR ALL MEMBER INSTITUTIONS, INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS CAN MAKE THEIR GREATEST CONTRIBUTION BY BEING GRANTED THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE DEGREE OF LOCAL AUTONOMY TO DEVELOP THEIR ACADEMIC SPECIALITIES AND CAMPUS  LIFE PROGRAMS FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL CONCERNED. OPERATIONS THAT SHOULD BE LEFT PRIMARILY TO THE AUTONOMOUS DECISION OF INDIVIDUAL INSTITUTIONS INCLUDE EXPENDITURE OF BUDGETED FUNDS, CAMPUS ORGANIZATION, FACULTY RECRUITMENT, DETERMINATION OF CAMPUS OBJECTIVES, AND PHYSICAL FACILITIES PLANNING. PROBLEMS INCLUDE THE INCLINATION OF LOCAL ADMINISTRATORS TO ASCRIBE PROBLEMS TO CENTRAL OFFICE EDICTS RATHER THAN TO LOCAL ACTION OR INACTION, AND THE FAILURE OF LOCAL ADMINISTRATORS TO DELEGATE AUTHORITY TO SUBORDINATES IN THEIR OWN ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE.

TWENTY SCHOOL DISTRICTS PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY. THESE DISTRICTS WERE DIVIDED INTO CATEGORIES OF CENTRAL CITY (GREATER THAN 50,000 INHABITANTS), URBAN (2,500-50,000 INHABITANTS), AND RURAL (LESS THAN 2,500 INHABITANTS). TWENTY SUPERINTENDENTS, 20 BOARD MEMBERS, AND 40 TEACHERS IN THESE DISTRICTS WERE ASKED TO SORT A 60-STATEMENT DECK OF Q-SORT ITEMS. EACH RESPONDENT WAS ASKED TO PLACE, IN RANK ORDER, HIS RESPONSES TO THE 60 STATEMENTS RELATING THE SUPERINTENDENT TO HIS ROLE IN COLLECTIVE NEGOTIATIONS AND TO THE SCOPE AND STRUCTURE  OF THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS. TWO GROUPS WERE IDENTIFIED--FACTOR A, THOSE FROM URBAN AND RURAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS, AND FACTOR B, THOSE FROM CENTRAL CITY SCHOOL DISTRICTS. FACTOR A WAS RELUCTANT TO ACCEPT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR DEVELOPING A QUALITY EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM AND UNDECIDED ABOUT THE TEACHERS' ORGANIZATION BEING A MECHANISM TO ACCOMPLISH IMPROVEMENTS IN WORKING CONDITIONS. THE FACTOR B GROUP INDICATED A GREATER PERCEPTION AND UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE MORE CRUCIAL ISSUES AND COLLECTIVE NEGOTIATION PROCESS, AND WAS WILLING TO TAKE A STAND ON IMPORTANT ASPECTS IN THE COLLECTIVE NEGOTIATION PROCESS.

SUBJECTS SELECTED WERE PLACED EITHER IN CLASS TYPE \"T\" (TRACTIBLE OR TRANQUIL) OR IN TYPE \"H\" (HYPERKINETIC). EXPERIMENTAL CONTROLS EXERCISED INCLUDED EVALUATION OF ALL CHILDREN BEFORE ENROLLMENT IN SPECIAL CLASSES, UNBIASED SELECTION, AND ASSIGNMENT OF SOME OF THE SUITABLE CHILDREN TO REGULAR CLASSES. A 3-YEAR EVALUATION WAS MADE. CURRICULUM FOCUSED ON BASIC SCHOOL  SKILLS, AND TEACHERS TOOK ACCOUNT OF THE CHARACTERISTIC VARIABILITY OF PERCEPTUALLY HANDICAPPED CHILDREN. CLASSROOMS WERE ADAPTED TO ELIMINATE DISTRACTION, AND CLASSES WERE KEPT SMALL. MOTOR ACTIVITY AND REPETITION WERE STRUCTURED INTO CLASSROOM ACTIVITIES. SPECIAL TRAINING WAS REQUIRED OF THE TEACHERS. THE FIRST YEAR THE 14 EXPERIMENTAL SUBJECTS IMPROVED OVER THE 10 CONTROLS WITH AN AVERAGE GRADE LEVEL DIFFERENCE OF .13 IN READING, 1.01 IN SPELLING, AND .92 IN ARITHMETIC. THE SECOND YEAR THE 31 SUBJECTS IMPROVED AN AVERAGE OF 1.3 IN READING, .9 IN SPELLING, AND .9 IN ARITHMETIC. BEHAVIORAL CHANGES WERE ALSO NOTED. THE BENDER-GESTALT TESTS WERE ADMINISTERED TO MEASURE PERCEPTUAL GROWTH.

SERVICES STUDIED WERE THOSE FOR THE DEAF, THE SPEECH HANDICAPPED, THE EDUCABLE MENTALLY HANDICAPPED, AND THOSE OF A DIRECTOR OF SPECIAL EDUCATION. THE PROPORTIONS RECEIVING EACH SERVICE WERE DETERMINED, AND 21 ECONOMIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS WERE REDUCED BY FACTOR ANALYSIS TO SIX CLUSTERS OF VARIABLES. THE URBAN FACTOR ACCOUNTED FOR 44 PERCENT OF THE VARIANCE, EDUCATION FOR 13 PERCENT, SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS FOR 8 PERCENT, RURAL OCCUPATIONS FOR 6 PERCENT, FINANCIAL ABILITY FOR 5 PERCENT, AND  POPULATION GROWTH FOR 4 PERCENT. A SINGLE INDEX SCORE WAS OBTAINED FROM THE FACTOR SCORES AND USED TO RANK THE COUNTIES. PROVIDING SERVICES FOR DEAF CHILDREN WERE NINE OF 12 HIGH EXPECTANCY COUNTIES, FOR THE SPEECH HANDICAPPED 62 OF 67, FOR THE EDUCABLE MENTALLY HANDICAPPED IN ELEMENTARY PROGRAMS 59 OF 63, AND FOR THE EDUCABLE MENTALLY HANDICAPPED IN SECONDARY PROGRAMS FIVE OF NINE. OF 24 HIGH EXPECTANCY COUNTIES, 17 HAD THE SERVICES OF A DIRECTOR OF SPECIAL EDUCATION. THE STUDY, THEREFORE, IMPLIED THAT LEGISLATIVE OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS SHOULD BE BASED ON THOSE FACTORS RELATED TO THE SUPPORT OF SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES AND DEVELOPED AN EXPECTANCY INDEX TO SERVE AS THE MEANS OF STUDYING COUNTIES IN TERMS OF THOSE FACTORS.

ADDITIONAL PURPOSES WERE TO ESTIMATE PREVALENCE AND TO ASSESS ADMINISTRATIVE ATTITUDES TOWARD INSTRUCTIONAL ORGANIZATION. THE INFORMATION WAS DRAWN FROM ADMINISTRATORS AT 64 OF THE 80 RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS FOR THE DEAF IN THE UNITED STATES AND FROM 150 TEACHERS IN 40 SCHOOLS. RESULTS CONCERNING MRD CHILDREN INDICATED THAT A PRIMARY DISABILITY OF DEAFNESS WAS THE MAJOR ADMISSION CRITERION. RESULTS ALSO REVEALED DISSATISFACTION WITH PSYCHOMETRIC INSTRUMENTS, UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE OBJECTIVES AND METHODS OF TEACHING, AND  CONCERN AND CONFUSION ABOUT TEACHER TRAINING. NEEDS INDICATED WERE THOSE FOR (1) DEVELOPMENT OF TEACHING OBJECTIVES, METHODS, AND MATERIALS. (2) MORE PRECISE NOMENCLATURE AND AN EDUCATIONALLY CONCEIVED CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM, (3) STUDIES OF INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE, (4) STUDIES OF EDUCATIONAL NEEDS, ALTERNATIVES, AND POTENTIAL, AND (5) AMELIORATION OF NEGATIVE ATTITUDES AMONG ADMINISTRATORS. THE STUDY CONCLUDED THAT A RELATIVELY LARGE NUMBER OF MRD CHILDREN ARE ENROLLED IN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS FOR THE DEAF AND THAT WITHOUT EXTENSIVE CHANGES IN THE PRESENT CHARACTER OF EDUCATION SERVICES MANY OF THOSE CHILDREN WILL NOT ACHIEVE SOCIAL COMPETENCE.

THE SPECIAL PROGRAM FOCUSED ON PRENATAL MEDICAL CARE, ARRANGEMENT FOR CHILD CARE, ATTITUDES TOWARD LOVE AND SEXUAL BEHAVIOR, AND WEIGHT CONTROL AND NUTRITION. IN THE FIRST YEAR OF OPERATION 142 GIRLS ATTENDED OUT OF 541 REFERRALS. ALMOST ALL WERE NEGRO, AGED 13 THROUGH 18, AND THE MAJORITY WERE NOT MARRIED AT THE TIME OF THE BABY'S BIRTH. DATA INDICATED THAT GIRLS IN THE SPECIAL PROGRAM WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY (P IS LESS THAN .001) TO CONTINUE WITH REGULAR SCHOOL  THAN WERE PREGNANT GIRLS NOT IN THE PROGRAM. MOST OF THE GIRLS WHO ATTENDED THE SPECIAL PROGRAM RETURNED TO REGULAR SCHOOL AFTER THE BABY'S BIRTH AND, IF THEY DROPPED OUT, DID SO SOMETIME AFTERWARD, WHEREAS THIS WAS THE CASE WITH ONLY A LITTLE OVER A FOURTH OF THE NONSPECIAL PROGRAM GROUP (P IS LESS THAN .001). THE MORE SUPPORT A GIRL HAD (SELF, FRIENDS, FAMILY), THE MORE LIKELY SHE WAS TO REMAIN IN SCHOOL (P IS LESS THAN .01 FOR SPECIAL PROGRAM GIRLS, P IS LESS THAN .05 FOR NONSPECIAL PROGRAM GIRLS). GIRLS IN THE SPECIAL PROGRAM WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS LIKELY (P IS LESS THAN .001) TO HAVE HAD ANOTHER BABY OR TO BE PREGNANT AGAIN BY THE TIME THEY WERE INTERVIEWED. IN REDUCING ADDITONAL PREGNANCIES, THE SPECIAL PROGRAM HAD A GREATER EFFECT UPON JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS, THE GROUP FROM  WHICH THE MAJORITY OF NEW CHILDREN CAME, THAN UPON HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS (P IS LESS THAN .05 FOR HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS AND LESS THAN .01 FOR JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS).

THE SPEECH CHANGING AND ELECTROMECHANICAL SAMPLING METHODS AND THE NECESSARY APPARATUS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED SUFFICIENTLY FOR ADEQUATE EVALUATION. TWO GENERAL APPROACHES TO EVALUATION OF TIME COMPRESSED SPEECH ARE TESTS OF ABILITY TO REPEAT MESSAGES ACCURATELY AND TESTS OF COMPREHENSION OF LISTENING SELECTIONS. FACTORS SHOWN TO AFFECT INTELLIGIBILITY AND COMPREHENSION INCLUDE STIMULUS VARIABLES (THE CONTEXT IN WHICH THE SPEECH SIGNAL IS PRESENTED AS WELL AS THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SIGNAL ITSELF) AND ORGANISMIC VARIABLES (THE  LISTENER'S AGE, SEX, EDUCATION, INTELLIGENCE, AND PRIOR RELEVANT EXPERIENCE). RESULTS OF SEVERAL STUDIES, WHEN CONSIDERED COLLECTIVELY, INDICATE THAT WORK INTELLIGIBILITY IS HAMPERED WHEN WORDS ARE COMPRESSED BY THE SPEECH CHANGING METHOD. WHEN THE SAMPLING METHOD IS USED, A COMPRESSION OF CONSIDERABLE MAGNITUDE IS REQUIRED BEFORE WORK INTELLIGIBILITY IS SUBSTANTIALLY IMPAIRED. PERCEPTUAL AND COGNITIVE PROBLEMS CONFRONTING THE LISTENER OF COMPRESSED SPEECH ARE DISCUSSED.

THE TWO INFORMATION PARAMETERS, COMPLEXITY AND REDUNDANCY OF THE DOTS, WERE ASSESSED USING PUNCTIFORM METRIC FIGURES RESEMBLING HISTOGRAMS AND SIMILAR IN SIZE AND SPACING TO STANDARD BRAILLE DOTS. THE TASK WAS TO DECIDE WHICH, IF EITHER, OF THE TWO COMPARISON STIMULI WAS IDENTICAL TO THE STANDARD STIMULUS. A 4 X 2 X 2 FACTORIAL DESIGN WAS EMPLOYED. STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RESULTS WERE FOUND BETWEEN THE VISUAL STATUS GROUPS, BETWEEN LEVELS OF COMPLEXITY, AND BETWEEN RANDOM AND REDUNDANT FIGURES (P IS LESS THAN .01 IN EACH CASE). ALSO, THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN GROUPS AND COMPLEXITY, GROUPS AND TYPE OF  FIGURES, AND COMPLEXITY AND TYPE OF FIGURES WERE FOUND TO BE STATISTICALLY RELIABLE (P IS LESS THAN .01 IN EACH CASE). FINDINGS INDICATED THAT EFFICIENCY OF PERFORMANCE TENDS TO DECLINE WITH INCREMENTS IN STIMULUS COMPLEXITY. THE OVERALL TREND TOWARD GREATER EFFICIENCY OF PERFORMANCE WITH RANDOM THAN WITH REDUNDANT FIGURES WAS FOUND TO ACCORD WITH PREVIOUS FINDINGS REGARDING THE VARIABLES OF THE INFORMATION PARAMETERS USING VISUAL STIMULI. THE CONCLUSION WAS THAT THE INFORMATION HANDLING APPROACH TAPS A SINGLE PROCESS OF FORM PERCEPTION IN MAN. THE STUDY ALSO SUGGESTS REVISION OF THE PRESENT BRAILLE CODE TO EXPAND ITS 2 X 3 BRAILLE MATRIX TO A 4 X 4 SIZE FOR INCREASED BRAILLE READING RATE AND ACCOMMODATION OF TECHNICAL SYMBOLS IN VARIOUS SCIENCES.

CHAPTER TWO DESCRIBES THE HISTORY AND SETTING OF INSTITUTIONAL HOUSING AT BERKELEY. CHAPTER THREE DISCUSSES THE ANALYSIS USED AND FINDINGS DEVELOPED REGARDING STUDENT LIFE IN THE HIGH-RISE DORM ENVIRONMENT. THIS MATERIAL COMES PRIMARILY FROM THE STUDIES OF THE BERKELEY DORMITORIES AND FROM A SURVEY OF OTHER INSTITUTIONS. THE CHAPTER PRESENTS A SERIES OF DESIGN ISSUES DEVELOPED FROM THE RESEARCH. EACH ISSUE SUMS UP AN AREA OF CONFLICT BETWEEN WHAT STUDENT LIVING SEEMS TO REQUIRE OF THE  PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT AND WHAT THAT ENVIRONMENT ACTUALLY PROVIDES. CHAPTER FOUR PRESENTS SOME CONCEPTUAL SOLUTIONS TO THE ISSUES DISCUSSED IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER. CHAPTER FIVE DISCUSSES METHODS FOR ANALYZING HOW A PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT IS USED. THE SETTING, TECHNIQUES, AND THE PROBLEMS AND LIMITATIONS ARE DEALT WITH.

ESTIMATES OF AMOUNTS OF ELEVEN ITEMS OF EQUIPMENT AND FIVE MATERIALS WERE MADE. LIKEWISE, ESTIMATES OF NEEDS WERE MADE. THE SECOND PHASE OF THE PROJECT INCLUDED THE DISTRIBUTION OF AUDIOVISUAL RESOURCES, TEACHER USE OF THESE RESOURCES, AND THE CLIMATE OF STAFF OPINION. FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF THESE RESOURCES INCLUDED THE PROPORTION OF TEACHERS WHO USE AUDIOVISUAL MATERIAL AT ALL, THE PROPORTION WHO USE ANY ONE MATERIAL FREQUENTLY, OR THE PROPORTION WHO USE A VARIETY OF MEDIA. THE CLIMATE OF  OPINION WAS ANALYZED IN TERMS OF THE CENTRALITY OF AUDIOVISUAL TECHNOLOGY IN THE TEACHING PROCESS, THE PROBLEMS WHICH HINDER EFFECTIVE USE OF AUDIOVISUAL MEDIA, AND THE PLANS FOR FUTURE USE OF VARIOUS MATERIALS. THE EXAMINATION OF CHANGE IN THIS TECHNOLOGY INCLUDED THE EXTENT AND DIRECTION OF CHANGE AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF VARIOUS SCHOOL DISTRICT CHARACTERISTICS.

IT POINTS OUT THE GREAT SCOPE FOR DEVELOPMENT IN THE THEORY OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE LEARNING, CITING FAVORABLY THE WORK OF MATHEMATICAL LEARNING THEORISTS WHO HAVE DEVISED EXACT EQUATIONS FOR THE RATE AT WHICH MATERIAL IS LEARNED OR FORGOTTEN. THE NEED OF FORMING AN ACCURATE THEORETICAL COMPARISON BETWEEN THE \"AUDIO-LINGUAL HABIT\" AND \"COGNITIVE CODE-LEARNING\" THEORIES IS DISCUSSED,  SUCH EXPERIMENTS BEING DIFFICULT TO CONTROL SINCE IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE EXACT TECHNIQUES A STUDENT WILL EMPLOY, AND SINCE THE THEORETICAL CONTRAST HAS NOT BEEN SUFFICIENTLY WELL-CONCEIVED. NEITHER METHOD IS BASED ON MODERN THEORIES OF THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LANGUAGE LEARNING, AND THE DISCUSSION CONCLUDES WITH A CRITICAL COMPARISON OF THE TWO, RECOMMENDING A JOINING OF AUDIO-LINGUAL TECHNIQUE WITH SOME OF THE BETTER ELEMENTS OF COGNITIVE CODE-LEARNING THEORY.

THE SUBJECTS WERE ORIGINALLY TESTED USING THE EIGHT SCREENING TESTS, AND 6 MONTHS LATER 40 OF THE CHILDREN WERE RETESTED FOR CHANGES IN VISUAL ACUITY AND EYE DOMINANCE DURING THE INTERIM PERIOD. RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE RELATIVE SCREENING ABILITY OF THE PROCEDURES WAS UNDETERMINED FOR THE VISUAL FUNCTIONS OF VISUAL ACUITY, MUSCLE BALANCE, AND COLOR PREFERENCE, DUE TO NONTESTABILITY OF SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF THE SUBJECTS. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT EYE DOMINANCE COULD BE ESTABLISHED. THE CONCLUSION SUGGESTS THAT PRESCHOOL CHILDREN 30 MONTHS OF AGE AND OVER CAN BE  SCREENED, ALTHOUGH 50 PERCENT MAY BE NONSTABLE.

ONE GROUP OF 17 HAD BEEN GIVEN ABOUT 1 HOUR A WEEK OF AUDIOLINGUAL TRAINING BEGINNING IN GRADE 3. THE OTHER GROUP OF 15 BEGAN FRENCH IN GRADE 9. BOTH GROUPS WERE ADMINISTERED THE MLA COOPERATIVE FOREIGN LANGUAGE TEST (LEVEL M) WHICH SAMPLES ACHIEVEMENT IN SPEAKING, READING, WRITING, AND COMPREHENSION. THE FLES GROUP PERFORMED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER ON ALL FOUR OF THE MLA TESTS. SINCE THE FLES TRAINING EMPHASIZES SPEAKING AND LISTENING, IT WAS NOT SUPRISING THAT THE FLES GROUP WAS SUPERIOR ON THESE TESTS. IT IS SIGNIFICANT THAT THE FLES GROUP WAS ALSO SUPERIOR ON TESTS OF READING AND WRITING, ALL OF WHICH LENDS SUPPORT TO THE  VALUE OF FLES TRAINING ON LATER PERFORMANCE IN HIGH SCHOOL FRENCH. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF SUBJECTS AND BECAUSE THE MEAN IQ FOR THE FLES GROUP (141) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE MEAN IQ FOR THE REGULAR GROUP (128), GENERALIZATION FROM THESE FINDINGS IS LIMITED.
