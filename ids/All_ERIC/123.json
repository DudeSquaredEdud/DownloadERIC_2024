Data were collected by interview from 95 persons in cooperative agricultural supply stores and from 63 persons in 13 independent agricultural supply stores. The stores were purposively selected to represent all sections of the state and to get equal representation of stores with low, medium, and high number of employees. Some conclusions were: (1) There were meaningful occupational title groups of service worker,  salesman, office worker, manager, sales and office worker, and service worker (equipment), (2) Occupational advancement in agricultural supplies required additional training in agricultural and business competencies for all occupational titles studied, and (3) Mmore than three-quarters of the interviewees in both stores indicated that a farm background was most desirable for occupations in the agricultural supply stores.

The second stage of the project incorporated known principles of technical curriculum design with the findings of the field study to develop a proposed curriculum providing the unique requirements for the  electro-mechanical technician. The curriculum plan differs significantly from any known technical education program and incorporates a number of ideas which resulted directly from the suggestions made by employers. It calls for new combinations of course work, facilities, and instructional procedures that differ in many respects from those in single technology instruction programs. The curriculum is presented as a 2-year program including courses in the areas of electro-mechanics, physics, electricity-electronics, mechanics, math and general education. (HC)",

        "description":"Drawing upon information provided by a continuous sample of social security records for the 1955-59 period, this study traced year-by-year employment experience of workers who left agriculture, and described their age, race, income, and job status. Estimates of backflow to farms were also studied. The gross out-movement from farm employment was 14.2 percent, but the net reduction in farm employment was only 3.5 percent because of a large back-movement into farming. The net reduction was associated with the level of unemployment in the nonfarm economy. Off-farm mobility was higher for younger persons, multiple job holders, and those who had previous nonfarm work experience. Off-farm mobility was not related to previous income or race, and persons with the same characteristics had  about the same mobility in different areas of the country. Back-movement was related to income gains or losses experienced in nonfarm employment. The 1957-58 recession retarded out-movement from farm employment, with the greatest impact on younger persons.

        "description":"The extent and nature of multiple jobholding by persons who reported income from farm self-employment was studied by examining Social Security data for 1957, 1958, and 1959. Hypotheses were that multiple jobholding is a method used by farmers who are underemployed in agriculture to supplement earnings and that off-farm sources of employment tend to be subject to cyclical instability and diminishing employment levels. It was found that the incidence of multiple jobholding by farm operators was widespread geographically, inversely related to age, not related to income from self-employment, and not a continuous situation. The most frequent source of off-farm wage employment was some unit of government, especially among older, white farm operators with higher levels of  self-employment income. Younger farm operators were more frequently employed in manufacturing, mining, and wholesale and retail trade. Earnings from off-farm employment were lowest in the South and highest in the Northeast and Pacific regions. Multiple jobholding fell in three categories: (1) a first step in changing occupations, (2) a sporadic income supplement, and (3) a substantial income source. (JM)",

The Indian Constitution provides for universal, free, and compulsory education through 14 years of age, but full application has been hindered by inadequate facilities, attendance enforcement difficulties, and teaching standards. Secondary education is of four main types. Technical education is a state responsibility, with coordination of standards and supplemental support from the central government. Trade training for adults is provided in industrial training institutes administered by the Ministry of Labor and Employment. Institutional programs include degree courses in universities, certificate and  diploma courses at the polytechnics, trade courses in the industrial training institutes, basic training courses in junior technical schools, and special trade training in schools of industry. Technical teacher education is conducted in seven central training institutes. National apprenticeship training for 23 trades has been organized since 1961. In 1965 there were 15,000 apprentices. Industry inservice training is conducted for skilled workers, supervisors, and operatives. A staff training institute for college and institution administrators and industrial education and training officers is planned. (JM)",

The report is based upon an analysis of data regarding 91 youths who actually completed the entire JEVS program. The data were obtained from JEVS records and trainee and employer interviews. Fourteen variables related to the trainees and their work experiences were isolated, and it was hypothesized that significant differences would appear between groups of successful and unsuccessful youths when compared on each of the variables. Of the 14 hypotheses tested, only the hypothesis that successful trainees would be judged cooperative by their supervisors more frequently than would unsuccessful trainees  revealed a significant difference between successful and unsuccessful groups of trainees. Lack of relevant data regarding the agency, due to the absence of an on-going program, prevented a complete analysis of the agency. However, the employer's reactions of satisfaction with the occupational skills presented by 75 percent of the trainees and a favorable attitude toward the program indicated a successful program devoted to the recovery of youth potential. The interview schedules and tabular data to supplement the text are given in the appendixes. (HC)",

Mobility of agricultural manpower is an important facet of the problem of general mobility of the total active population in the course of economic development. On the one hand, mobility is desirable in order to reduce the degree of under-employment in agriculture and, on the other hand, the growth of non-agricultural enterprise needs to draw upon the agricultural  population for a supply of labor. To improve economic conditions the concurrent development of both the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors of the economy and agricultural policy must be closely integrated with general economic policy. The appendixes include national bibliographical references and summaries of national research on the problems of adaptation and training of rural workers in Germany, France, Italy, Norway, The Netherlands, and Sweden, and project proposals for international research on the topic.

The general objective is to assist the nurse in the hospital to improve the quality of the nursing care given to the patient placed on a closed chest drainage system. Units are Anatomy and Physiology, Rationale of Therapy, and The Apparatus. The material is to be used by the individual student, and two separate sessions totaling three to four hours are recommended for the completion of the course. An optional review is included following the section on anatomy and physiology for the use of students who, on the basis of their knowledge, desire to omit this section.

The control group consisted of 75 students enrolled in Simplified Shorthand during the years 1957-1963, and the experimental group consisted of 45 students enrolled in DJ Shorthand during the years 1963-64 and 1964-65. A statistical test of differences in I.Q., freshman and sophomore grade averages, and freshman and sophomore grade averages, and freshman and sophomore English grade averages indicated that the Simplified Shorthand group was a significantly (.05 level) more capable group than the DJ group in the three areas measured. Gregg  Awards Tests (60 words a minute for 5 minutes) were administered to each group each month from January through May. The percentage of students who qualified with an accuracy of 95 percent or better was determined. The DJ group showed a higher cumulative percentage of achievement throughout the entire testing period. However, the difference was significant at the .05 level for the month of March only. It was concluded that an inferior group using DJ Shorthand will perform as well as a superior group using Simplified Shorthand. (PS)",

Faculty members prepared 50 discussion papers which were reviewed by leaders in rural areas and businesses directly concerned with the rural economy. Factors affecting rural Michigan's environment were (1) social economic climate, (2) political climate, (3) supply and demand for rural products and services, (4) U.S. demand for food, (5) U.S. export-import prospects for food, (6) organization of agricultural markets, and (7) demand for United States timber products. Necessary agriculture and agribusiness adjustments in farms, dairy,  livestock, eggs and poultry, field crops, grain marketing, fruits and vegetables, farm labor, farm machinery and equipment, farm financing, food wholesaling and retailing, nursery industry, and floriculture were discussed. Natural resource problems were in use of land and water, recreation and tourism, timber production and industry, commercial fisheries, and fur bearing animals.

Twelve dental assistants who had had no special training beyond the Navy's 16-week Dental Technician Training Course and whose dental assisting experience ranged from less than 3 months to 23 months were trained in a 7-week course to perform several specific treatment procedures. Evaluators examined 21 restorations which had been inserted by trainees and 41 which had been done by conventional methods. Only one restoration inserted by a  trainee was considered unsatisfactory and all restorations inserted by conventional methods were scored satisfactory. It was concluded that the assistants' special training had been sufficient to justify proceeding to the next phase of the study which involved clinical tests of the restorations, which are reported in a related document (VT 007 733).

In the clinical tests the following systems were employed: (1) one officer and two assistants operating at one chair and utilizing conventional treatment procedures, (2) one dental officer and three assistants at two chairs, (3) one dental officer and four assistants at three chairs, (4) one dental officer and five  assistants at four chairs. In the latter three systems, the assistants placed restorations in cavities. Two dental officers operating in the most satisfactory three-chair system increased their productivity by more than 100 percent; a third increased in productivity by 80 percent. Short term evaluations found restorations placed by the dental teams comparable to those placed by the conventional methods, and no adverse mental or physical effects when the three-chair system was utilized for 20 weeks.

Personnel in 4,436 schools responded, including 3,983 building principals, 3,090 librarians, 2,733 trade and industrial teachers, 621 distributive education teachers, 1,182 commercial teachers, and 3,582 school counselors. It was found that, although approximately 58 percent of high school graduates enter work or a work preparatory program following high school, occupational information for this group is the poorest. Many boys and girls never seek information. There is heavy reliance on reading activities for  occupational information with the \"Occupational Outlook Handbook\" the most frequently utilized source. Information in regard to training opportunities, job clusters, psychological characteristics of workers, and occupational outlook is inadequate. Recommendations include development of multi-media approaches to information dissemination by private publishers, major data-gathering activities by the government, establishment of state or regional information centers to which all schools would have access, use of job cluster format in presenting occupational information, and use of films or filmstrips to depict elements of work.

Some findings were: (1) Industrial, occupational, regional wage rankings and wage differentials have been quite stable over relatively long periods of time, (2) Job turnover rates tend to be high where pay is low, and vice versa, and (3) Industry earnings averages appear to be related to the degree of concentration and profitability. Some implications were: (1) Wages should not be interpreted as having a causal relationship with a changing pattern of  employment, (2) A period of rising wages puts pressure on declining industries and occupations to release workers, and (3) Substantial wage raises are necessary to remedy the position of workers who are recognized as underpaid in their occupation. Changes in relative earnings may improve allocative efficiency in (1) attracting labor to remote regions, (2) reducing labor turnover, (3) preventing attrition of employees for which long training periods are required, and (4) attracting qualified people in newly emerging professional occupations.

The services sector of the economy consists of those diverse activities which are not embraced within the primary or natural resource sector nor in manufacturing. Some highlights concerning the services sector are: (1) The demand for an increasing number of services often cannot be met by the market mechanism, due to consumer unwillingness to pay  the price demanded, and increasing governmental intervention and initiative has become necessary, (2) The desire for better services for longer periods of time has resulted in the use of far more married women and part-time labor, (3) An ever-changing pattern of services implies the need for a more fluid and mobile labor force with wider and more flexible skills, and (4) The need for improved training, recruitment, and educational standards for entry workers is imperative.

On the basis of (1) the adoption of the occupational cluster concept which involves its grouping of occupations with identical or similar skill and knowledge requirements, (2) the implementation of a program of occupational exploration in grades 7 through 10, (3) the availability of adequate guidance and counseling, and (4) the provision of introductory courses at the ninth and 10th grade levels, a  pattern of occupational education for secondary schools is suggested and approaches to organization, content, scope, and sequence of 12 cluster-based occupational curriculums are presented. The roles of high school occupational programs are identified as providing specific preparation for those who drop out and those who do not continue beyond high school, and a complementary learning experience to those who continue their occupational education. The alignment of the 12 curriculums with typical community college programs is illustrated, and the development of agriculture education from grade 9 through the community college program is presented schematically.

The 30 programs are of two types: those established by statutes such as the Manpower Development and Training Act, the Economic Opportunity Act, and the Vocational Education Acts, and special programs established by administrative action in order to serve special target groups or to provide better delivery systems and improved coordination. Although some duplication and inefficiency was found in the programs coperated during the period of this study (April 1967 to March  1968), the Committee observed that these failings rarely were severe enough to vitiate the usefulness of the programs. Twenty specific recommendations for improving the administration of the training programs at the federal, state, and local levels of government are presented and elucidated. The recommendations cover facets of policy, funding, organization, procedure, and staff training. Economic cost-benefit analyses of the various programs were not conducted. (ET)",

To determine relationships between teacher innovativeness and innovation diffusion, and to isolate variables associated with failure to adopt innovative programs, a diffusion scale, innovativeness scale, and administrator attitude scale were completed by interviewing each of the 32 teachers and their administrators. Diffusion of innovative practices was found to be significantly correlated with the number of teachers in a department, the number of students in a department, teacher innovativeness, and the number of non-farm agricultural students. The number of  teachers in a department and teacher innovativeness accounted for nearly 52 of the 70 percent of the variance in the regression equation. Low correlations indicated the following factors did not seriously inhibit diffusion of cooperative agricultural occupations curricula: (1) administrator's attitude, (2) expenditure per pupil, (3) number of agricultural training stations available in the community, (4) offering of a separate agricultural mechanics class, and (5) the number of vocational education programs offered by the school.

The project design used the type of laboratory as the independent variable and an achievement test as the dependent variable. Analysis of co-variance was used with the pre-test scores held constant. The mobile laboratory was used 1 day each week at two branch schools and provided space for 16 students with equipment similar to the laboratory equipment at the parent institution. During the first operational period no significant differences were  found between the final achievement test scores of students using the permanent laboratory and those using the mobile laboratory. However, during the second operational period final achievement scores of the students using the permanent laboratory were significantly higher, and it is inferred that the permanent laboratory facility makes for better proficiency in applied electricity than does the mobile laboratory facility.

National origin, race, family size, stability, intelligence, aspirations, motivation, influences of others, first job,  migration, disruption of marriage, fertility, and child spacing were used in elaborations of the basic model, and income, subjective achievement, and occupational status were utilized as outcomes.

It was developed as part of a programed series covering 21 mathematical competencies which were identified by university researchers through task analysis of several occupational clusters. The development of a sequential content structure was also based on these mathematics competencies. After completion of this program the student should know the place value concept for decimals and be able to convert fractions whose denominations are 10, 100, or 1,000 to decimal form and write equivalent forms of integers and decimals by adding or removing zeros. The material is to be used by individual students under teacher supervision. Twenty-six other programed texts and an introductory volume are  available as VT 006 882-VT 006 909, and VT 006 975.

The objectives were to explore (1) the effectiveness of the military systems and pattern recognition approach to electronics training on high school students, (2) its impact on students with lower I.Q.'s than the military group sampled, and (3) its effectiveness in other subjects, in this case auto mechanics. The sample consisted of an electronics experimental group of 53 students and control group of 36 students, and an auto  mechanics experimental group of 9 students and control group of 14 students. Significant results were achieved in the electronics course for students who used computer assisted and program instruction. However, no significant difference was found in the auto mechanics students. Data for upper and lower I.Q. groups in the electronics experimental group revealed no significant difference. Appendixes include the four project quarterly reports, and related documents are &quot;Auto Mechanics: Methodology.

Both programs were conducted under the Manpower Development and Training Act (MDTA) for a period of 52 weeks. Trainee selection was based upon eligibility under MDTA, high school graduation, familiarity with mechanics, desire to be technicians, and performance on the General Aptitude Test Battery. Based upon their personal preference, 35 trainees chose the job-oriented program and 40 the field-oriented program. Thirty trainees completed the job-oriented program and 25 completed the field-oriented program. During the first 2 years after the  completion of training, 91 percent of the job-oriented and 63 percent of the field-oriented graduates were gainfully employed. Followup indicated no significant differences between groups as to: (1) their level of involvement with data, people, or things, (2) attitudes toward training received, (3) social class identification, (4) unemployment, and (5) employer rating. The field-oriented graduates earned higher average weekly salaries. It was recommended that shorter training periods be considered for the preparation of technicians in critical occupations and that training program flexibility be encouraged. (MM)",

This population closely matched the national percentages, and responses of 609 employees provided data for the study. Data were obtained regarding 12 categories of work performed by supervisory and non-supervisory personnel: selling, stockkeeping, checkstand operation, receiving and marking merchandise, delivery, keeping records, computing, display, advertising, buying, pricing, and merchandise control. Substantial percentages of non-supervisory personnel perform the tasks of selling, keeping and counting stock, operating the checkstand, and receiving  and checking merchandise. Substantial percentages of supervisors regularly perform all the activities of non-supervision as well as tasks associated with keeping records, planning and arranging displays, buying, pricing and controlling merchandise. Data suggest that women have limited opportunity for early employment in the supervisory category, but proportions of older women supervisors indicate opportunity is enhanced for women who persist in a retailing career. Only limited opportunity exists for non-college youth to move into supervisory positions. (MM)",

Educational objectives were classified in a 36 cell, three dimensional matrix according to Fine's functional job analysis scheme, used in the \"Dictionary of Occupational Titles.\" As a result of a pilot effort, it was found that: (1) The background and training of the raters does not affect their ability to apply the taxonomy, (2) The taxonomy is equally applicable  to any vocational course, and (3) The taxonomy provided a relatively concise framework for ordering almost 20 disparate objectives. The final phase of the research was designed to demonstrate that the taxonomy could be used profitably to describe, analyze, and compare the existing vocational-industrial education curricula of two high schools. Data collected by interview resulted in the conclusion that the taxonomy system can be of considerable value in preparing objectives and developing curriculums. Its usefulness in analyzing and evaluating current programs is limited. (DM)",

A questionnaire sought information about the following topics: (1) basic areas of programing, (2) educational levels at which courses are offered, (3) numbers of courses and schools involved in wage earning training, (4) professional qualifications for instructors, (5) needs for new course development, and (6) the types of curriculum materials used by each state. The data are categorized according to these topics. Most states had home economics wage earning programs, with food and clothing service areas predominant. The bulk of the  courses were found at the secondary and adult levels. In many states the areas of child care, institutional and home management, and health related occupations are being developed. Approximately 150 home economics wage earning courses were offered at the secondary level, post-high, and adult level during 1964-65; nearly 1,300 courses were offered in 1967-68. (FP)",

The course objective was to help rural students develop in personal and social areas which research and experience have delineated as limiting factors in decision making and adjustment to the world of work. It was hypothesized that students in the defined 1-semester vocational guidance class would make greater gains (1) in their behavior, (2) in accurately perceiving their own attitudes, and (3) in their ability to designate future vocational goals. The results of the study tended to support the stated hypotheses; however, a  discrepancy occurred when each student's behavior was rated by two of his teachers. When the students rated themselves, the results favored the experimental group. When the teachers did the rating, the results favored the control group. In neither group was the percentage of increase in positive behavior greater than the percentage of those students who remained the same or who moved in the opposite direction. Observable changes in student behavior were not visible to teachers of other classes. A follow-up study was recommended to help determine the long range effects of the course. (DM)",

        "description":"To identify variables accounting for variation in diffusion of cooperative agricultural occupations curriculums, data were collected by interviews with 32 teachers who were participants in one of the agricultural occupations institute workshops conducted at Oklahoma State University during the summers of 1965 or 1966 who were still teaching vocational agriculture in the same school in 1968, and their administrators. Regression analysis was used to compute a simple correlation matrix, partial and multiple correlation coefficients, and a multiple regression equation for use in predicting diffusion of cooperative agricultural occupations curriculums into a vocational agriculture program. Variables related significantly to diffusion were: (1) number of teachers in the department, (2)  number of students enrolled, (3) teacher innovativeness, and (4) the number of non-farm students enrolled. The multiple regression equation accounted for 70.1 percent of the variance of the predicted criteria. Some recommendations were: (1) Multiple teacher departments are needed for program expansion, (2) More innovative teachers should be used to conduct purposeful changes, and (3) Schools with large enrollments and large non-farm enrollments should be encouraged to add cooperative agricultural programs.

        "description":"To depict the current status of vocational education state leadership personnel in terms of policies, numbers, education, and experience, a five-part questionnaire was utilized in 31 states to: (1) determine the existence and content of professional personnel policies and their effects on the operation of state divisions of vocational education, (2) identify the training and the experience qualifications of present state division professional staff members, and (3) ascertain training and experience needs of state division personnel. Satisfactory written policies existed in most states for personnel selection, recruitment, dismissal, retirement, tenure, inservice training, and evaluation. More adequate policies on salary and professional leave are needed in about one-half of the  states. Strategy found to be successful in retraining capable personnel were salary increases, opportunities for further education, and promotions. Nearly all states had policies which specify experience requirements. Educational requirements for 73 percent of the 562 positions stipulated a masters' degree. A 73 percent growth in the number of professional personnel occurred between 1960 and 1965 and a 32 percent growth is anticipated from 1965 to 1970. Some recommendations were that: (1) comparative salary schedules be developed and recruitment bases be broadened, and (2) work experience requirements be discontinued for some positions. (DM)",

The effects of the counseling treatment were measured by the subject's job satisfaction scores, employee performance scores, training efficiency, and general employability. Data consisted of demographic variables and information provided by two counselors, each working with randomly assigned subjects for an average of 1.86 hours per individual client. This study revealed that counseling did not bring about a higher job satisfaction level on the part of counseled subjects when means of their test scores  were tested against those not counseled. Similarly, the employee performance mean test scores of counseled subjects were not significantly different to a magnitude which proved counseling affected this performance; however, the counseling treatment was found to significantly affect the subjects obtaining bona fide and legitimate jobs, the number of weeks it required subjects to get such jobs, and the percent of time subjects held such jobs.

Major sections are devoted to a review of research and writings pertaining to the theory and concepts of the economics of education, the methodological and conceptual problems involved in evaluating vocational-technical education programs using cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness models, results of cost benefit and cost effectiveness studies of public school vocational technical programs and manpower training programs, and the use of followup studies as a means of  evaluating vocational-technical education programs. Other sections deal with studies of costs and returns from investment in rural technical schools, investment effects of education in agriculture, and the relationship between vocational education and students' propensity to drop out of school. The author's conclusions and recommendations are included. Of the 100 sources cited, the oldest was published in 1962 and most were published since 1966. (AUTHOR/ET) -",

Communities were selected to permit comparisons with respect to size, relative isolation, growth rate, socioeconomic composition, and racial composition. Respondents included 1,392 mothers (83%) of two first grade and two fifth grade classes in each elementary school and of two 10th grade English classes in each high school, 518 students (97%) of the 10th grade English classes, principals of all 20 subject schools, and 283 teachers (99%) of all first through sixth grades and of all high school English classes. Extensive findings, primarily  in the form of percentages, are discussed in the following major sections: (1) The goals of education: preferences and perceptions of mothers, teachers, and students; (2) teaching styles: professional role definitions and the preferences and perceptions of mothers and students; (3) the extent and consequence of observability in school systems; (4) socialization, achievement, and alienation from the school; (5) mother-child consensus on educational plans; and (6) role strain, alienation, and deviant behavior among high school students.

        "description":"Although the government retraining and relocation programs for the unemployed are now an integral part of the economic way of life, there must be research evaluation of each to establish the relationship between manpower policies. A few detailed evaluations have been made of Federal programs--a 1962 interview survey of 132 employers in West Virginia who had hired trainees under the Area Redevelopment Act, a 1964 nationwide questionnaire survey of members of the American Society of Training Directors, and questionnaire mailed to 1,000 employers in Wisconsin to determine their attitudes toward the apprenticeship form of on the job training. The evaluations indicate that the programs improve the economic status of trainees. However, much more extensive and sophisticated benefit-cost  analyses will be required to determine whether the programs are a significant factor in reducing national unemployment and poverty and whether they are easing skill shortages or reducing inflationary pressures. Presumably economic benefits and costs of relocation allowances aid the individual, but the extent of their usefulness as a social investment remains to be established. Independent studies must be cumulative in their design and results. The document includes three tables, 16 references, and discussions by Melvin Rothbaum and Curtis Aller. (aj)",

A questionnaire was developed, and validated by a panel, which asked respondents to rank three solution approach alternatives for individual and group problems--individual, group or key person nature. It was mailed to 190 community leaders in northeastern Colorado who had been selected to attend meetings on social action. The Friedman two-way analysis of variance was used to determine if there were significant differences among solution approaches for both individual and group problem situations. Respondents selected the group problem solving approach for individual problems and the key person approach for group problems; both were significant at the .001 level of  confidence. Data were also analyzed for age, sex, level of education, occupation, and acquaintance with the Extension staff to determine if these variables were correlated with respondents' expectations. When individual problems were considered, personal factor variables correlated with the group approach; for group problem situations, the key person approach was ranked first. It was concluded that client system leadership does not hold the \"service\" expectation stereotype of Extension workers; rather community leaders challenge the Extension worker to use more group and key person orientation.

Study of roles of agricultural, fishing, and service cooperatives and of forest unions raises the question of participation by the membership in decision making. Comparison of population types to leadership types shows the young, dynamic, and personal types of leadership, associated respectively with sociable, informed, and socially integrated populations, as  most efficient. Traditional, unstable, and \"almost non-existent\" leadership appear inefficient. Study of family life reveals a gap between private and public life.

Phase 1 (May-September 1963) of this project was mainly a time for recruiting and training change agents and defining stragegies of change. In Phase 2, an information committee and local development committees were formed, and a participative survey and the first training sessions were held. Phase 3 (November 1964 to August 1965) was marked by transition and by creation of a second intervention mechanism. The final phase (September 1965 to March 1966) saw the emergence of new local elites and new administrative structures. Goals,  methodology, and staffing were major problem areas. The lack of precise theories of social change, of a precise model of a modern society, and of a provincial plan and specific projects forced the BAEQ animateurs to concentrate on encouraging popular participation in forming a draft plan and an experimental model of consultative participation.

Higher adult education should be liberal adult education stressing skills of decision-making and public responsibility; more attention must be paid to cultural and arts education. A major component of developing programs must be education about the city, using the resources of the city and the city itself as methods and materials. Administrators and programers must become increasingly concerned with widening their audiences so they involve not only the elite but also the man in the street.  Adult educators have it within their power to turn changes in the emerging city into the means of enlarging their horizons and stimulating their imaginations.

Discussion centered on three pre-workshop papers on the training of local leaders as teachers of functional illiterates, the development by universities of short term study programs for these teachers, and the need to reach and encourage those who do not participate in community affairs. Suggestions reflecting majority opinion emerged. Universities and institutes should be more fully used, perhaps with new university offices to coordinate the new Federal  programs with departmental and faculty resources, and with institutes planned two years ahead. Estimates of local needs should be made realistically; an information clearinghouse should be set up by the Office of Education or other group. Professors should determine if they can contribute to the program and, if so, should be given financial assistance. Long and short range goals should be clearly differentiated. (jf)",

Findings pertained mainly to basic contributions of psychology and sociology in such areas as innovation, diffusion, adoption, aging, social class, leisure, adult learning, adult characteristics,  motivation, educational methods, and educational leadership. Contributions from anthropology economics, political science, communications, public school and higher education, school administration, social work, vocational and military training, and library science were limited but potentially important.

Results indicate that professionalism is rapidly rising in American society, government at all levels leads in the employment of professionals, and administrative leadership is growing more and more professional in terms of education and experience. An increasingly direct and binding tie between professional education and careers, the relatively low prestige of government employment, notably among men, the inhibition of liberal arts in professional curriculums in favor of scientific  subjects, bias against politics and government in professional faculties and curriculums, and limited attention to the special problems of management and administration in government agencies are among the other trends suggested. Moreover, public administration still seems to lack real professional standing. Research is needed on career and educational choice, social systems in higher education, roles and performance of educational systems, professional recruitment and employment, and related topics.

Responses tended to affirm the need for adult education, the responsibility of public schools, multiple purposes for public school adult education, the high importance of elementary and secondary adult education, americanization and citizenship education, vocational education, and home and family life education, and the slightly lesser importance of community services and assorted programs (general, cultural, public affairs, agricultural, and health  and safety education) and of improving public understanding of public school education. Opinion was about evenly divided between public funds or tuition alone and financing by a variety of sources. Over half the schools had adult education programs, largely vocational or mixed.

Among important motivational and emotional factors associated with deprivation and ineffective learning are lower intelligence and educational achievement, limited problem solving approaches, inadequate social communication system, preference for immediate gratification, alienation, avoidance, withdrawal, violent aggression, fear of schools, rigid value systems, and hostility toward authority. Adult behavior can be changed; however, the longer a behavior exists, the more functional it becomes for the individual, and the more conflict there will be between the  deprived subculture and middle-class society if a change is made. A person is only likely to acquire those behaviors he or others in his social environment view as appropriate. It is necessary to develop instruments which identify and scale the features of the environment most clearly related to the development of human characteristics before economical and effective programs can be designed to change behaviors.

Participants in the homemaking classes in 1966, in contrast to nonparticipants, had a higher proportion of two parent families, were between 30 and 59 years of age, had incomes of $2,000 or more, had two full time workers or one or two  part time workers, had larger families, spent more for food but did not have higher quality diets, and knew of Medicare and educational and recreational facilities.

Some weaknesses might be overcome through introduction of adult education programs in universities, as well as off-campus inservice training and degree programs and establishment of community councils for coordinating the various aspects of adult education activities. New fast-reacting systems of leadership training can be developed and the quality of the personnel in the field improved. At present, the efforts of adult education agencies are fragmented and no one seems willing to assume a leadership role. Public agencies of adult education should have a  system for continuous and reliable data collection, and broader and more balanced programs. The relationship between non-profit and profit-making organizations needs examination to ensure that public funds are not used in the interest of the few. Relationships among national, state, and local agencies must be examined with a view to curtailing overlapping and duplication and to facilitating coordination, consolidation, and decentralization.

The following list shows the sources of influence; face-to-face (40%); mass communicated source (29%); unknown (31%). However, a total of 74% of all the respondents had face-to-face contact. The reasons for speaking include the need to obtain  specific information (38%); to obtain reassurance (32%); to get someone else (13%); and to make personal arrangements (3%). Fourteen percent cited no motivational factors. It can be concluded that people tend to seek information through face-to-face contact rather than mass communicated sources.

Police officials, judges, prosecuting attorneys, university faculty, and civic leaders were invited to participate. Total attendance was 462. In addition to participating in the prepared discussions on the announced topics, the officers had the unique advantage of the combined talent, experience, and knowledge of veteran judges and attorneys and of officers from other localities in reaching solutions to special problems. Each program dealt with cooperation of officers and prosecuting attorneys in case preparation; court procedures; officer demeanor in court; the effect  of recent court decisions on police procedures; and police-community relations. The most important by-product of the conferences was the realization by law enforcement officers that they could communicate with prosecutors and judges and that such communication could be mutually beneficial. Although attendance was disappointing in some cities, many penalists felt that the favorable impressions gained by attendees would help increase attendance at future conferences of this kind. (ly)",

RTMM has two main objectives: to increase understanding of the relationships among the attitudes, skills, and activities of clergymen, and to identify changes in these aspects after training. The first goal is discussed in this report. Results of a questionnaire with attitude scales administered to 183 clergymen, most of whom were young, white, well-educated, and Protestant, indicated two main patterns of behavior; those with little time for congregational administrative work confer frequently with government officials and important private citizens in regard to social problems and those who spend over  10% of their time on congregational administrative work and regard traditional social action or congregation-oriented activity as most important. A third group regarded denominational or interdenominational work as the most important aspect of the ministry. A clergyman's activities seem most closely related to his own ideas of Christian mission and individual secular action. (jf)",

Improved educational policies, methods, materials, financial resources, and services are required in both public and private educational institutions. Activities by the Boeing Company in the State of Washington illustrate industry's growing concern for job training and other forms of continuing education; while experiences in developing and carrying out poverty programs in urban areas (illustrated by  the Puerto Rican community in New York) highlight the need for innovative planning, greater investment in manpower development, and broader cooperation.

The Workingmen's College (1848), in taking a stage further the mechanics' institutes, athenaeums, working men's clubs, and other organizations concerned with adult education in the nineteenth century, had two outstanding aspects in their program: insistence on close companionship between tutor and student, and participation by students in the management of the college. The founders of adult education in New Zealand and Australia were products  of the British adult education movement led by the Oxford dons and Albert Mansbridge. From their programs which were supported by limited funds from the governments of New Zealand and Australia and enthusiastic students, have come several national and local leaders. Adult education will continue to appeal to the minority but will remain the monument of liberation and freedom. (nl)",

Cognitive objectives (emphasizing remembering something learned or solving intellectual problems and reordering information) and affective objectives (emphasing a feeling, tone, emotion, or degree of acceptance or rejection) relate to each other and to the instructional methods above.  Several variables affect teaching methods: style of leadership and supervision, the classroom communications network, size of the group, the clash between teaching principle or knowledge, teaching aids, and classroom climate. More research on teaching procedures is needed, yet enough guidelines exist to help teachers desiring to improve their students' learning. (jf)",

The first important fact to emerge from this study is that linguistics is no longer a very clearly definable area. It has become a tool widely used in areas not traditionally its concern and by people who are not linguists by training. This fact, plus the growing number of linguists and language researchers, complicates the problem of information flow because there is very little coordination of their efforts. The author discusses these complications, among which are: (1) at present there are no adequate central repositories for even the 400 core publications,  (2) many periodicals have serious publication lags, (3) linguistic literature is published in a variety of languages, (4) pertinent information cuts across several fields and retrieval is therefore difficult, (5) there is no central abstracts journal, (6) there are only three or four dictionaries which cover the field adequately, and (7) there are no adequate classifications of the field. Also discussed are improvements in the area of information flow: (1) at least 63 information services in the language sciences now exist around the world, (2) various bibliographies have been published by CAL, and (3) several rosters of linguists are being maintained.

(2) Can kinesics be better learned through active role  playing? (3) What is the effect of allowing adult language learners to see themselves speaking a foreign language? In answer to the first question, the author reports that the results would indicate a probable positive reply; video tape as a language teaching device could be made superior to audio tape. The second answer is an \"unqualified yes,\" and the third, that it is \"beneficial.\" Further experiments, the authors feel, are \"more than justified.\" (AMM)",

        "description":"The use of the &quot;traditional passive&quot; form of the Japanese verb indicates to a native speaker that the subject of the verb was involuntarily subjected to something unpleasant. When combined with the causative form (passive causative), it is felt that the subject of the sentence was &quot;caused to&quot; take an action and is therefore not responsible for the act nor its outcome. These meanings must be expressed in English by adding whole clauses or phrases. It was hypothesized that the availability of these constructions in Japanese would cause native speakers to interpret interpersonal events by using these passive verb forms while speakers of English would not. In a translation study, the original and the translated versions of 20 Japanese and 21 English short stories were compared. It  was found that the English-speaking translators tended to disregard the connotative meaning of the traditional passive while Japanese translators tended to read such meanings into the English original. A perception study was based on cartoons of interpersonal conflict situations to test whether Japanese subjects would tend to attribute responsibility for the negative outcome to others rather than themselves. In this test the overall difference between Japanese and Americans was significant at the .001 level in the predicted direction. In related tests, however, Americans who had studied Japanese used the traditional passive about as much as did native speakers. (JK)",

        "description":"The principal claim of this paper is that the Japanese passive consists of two different constructions, each derived from a distinct deep structure and each having associated with it a distinct set of syntactic and semantic properties. One of these constructions, the &quot;adversative passive,&quot; implies that the grammatical subject of the sentence is adversely affected by the action expressed by the verb. The other construction is as neutral in meaning as the English passive and is referred to here as the &quot;pure passive.&quot; Previous treatments of the passive (Bloch, Martin, and Jorden) are discussed briefly and it is concluded that the analysis offered in this paper comes the closest to an accurate description of the syntactic and semantic facts. It is also felt that the adversative  passive may be a traditional Japanese construction while the pure passive is a relatively new innovation in Japanese due to the influence of translation from Western language into Japanese.

While most of this research has not dealt with English as a second language, it is suggested that the observed phenomenon is as relevant to the ESL program as to any other second-language situation. The author summarizes his views as follows: (1) Attitudinal motivational characteristics of the student are important in the acquisition of a second language. (2) The nature of these characteristics suggests that the truly successful student (i.e., the one who will acquire communicational facility with the language) is motivated to become integrated with the other language community. (3) Th\"s integrative motive appears to derive from the attitudinal  characteristics in the home and must be fostered by an accepting attitude, by the parents, concerning the other language group. (4) The process of second-language acquisition involves the child both in taking on behavioral characteristics of the other language community, and in experiencing resistance from himself and pressures from his own cultural community.

        "description":"Discussed briefly by the author are some of the &quot;most immediately relevant&quot; implications for TESOL which arise from research studies in dialectology. One phenomenon, which until recently has received little attention, is that of &quot;receptive bi-dialectalism&quot; or &quot;bilingualism.&quot; One of the earliest observations of this phenomenon is a passage taken from the writing of Daniel Defoe in 1724. An individual, presented with a stimulus in one dialect and asked to repeat it, will respond by producing the form that is native to his own dialect rather than the form which he has heard (or read). The author feels that such evidence should give us pause in attempts to judge a child's linguistic competence solely or even largely on the basis of his production; rather we should begin by attempting  to assess the child's receptive competence as the basis from which to proceed in determining appropriate instructional procedures. If the child has an already well-developed receptive knowledge of a more formal or &quot;mainstream&quot; dialect of the language, much of the instructional task can be seen as guiding him toward an automatic productive control of the &quot;mainstream&quot; dialect. Implicit in this approach is the idea that only positive stimuli and motivations will be supplied to lead him to develop and practice this control, and that no negative values or stigmas will be applied to his use of his native linguistic forms.

To a certain extent, this is the aim of all teachers who are teaching English as a second language. They are teaching the culture that the language expresses at the same time that they teach the code itself. The roles which education thrusts upon the teacher and the student present severe problems when the student i s a member of a cultural group considered by the teacher's cultural group to be primitive. It is very easy to regard any cultural group which has no written language, survives on a subsistence economy, and lives in virtual isolation as primitive, and hence, childlike. It is also easy to regard  the process of learning English as the process of maturing from a childlike to an adult status. The Alaska native child within his culture is treated in a more adult fashion than children in our culture are, from a very early age. However, when he learns English from a teacher who not only regards him as a child, but regards his parents to be children as well, he cannot help but feel that the role of the child is strictly connected with the use of this language. The teacher should realize that each of his students has a unique contribution to make to the world: when each of his students come to recognize this himself, then the learning process has meaning.

        "author":["Cowan, J.L."],
        "description":"This report comprises a description of the linguistic research carried out at the University of Arizona in 1967 on the subject of language rules. The approach originally envisaged was to consider the possibility that rules of language are informed and supported by, take their existence only within, and are thus virtually inseparabl\" from, the entire way of life within which the language functions. It was proposed, in particular, to examine relevant work done by Mead and Skinner. The first task was to survey the mass of literature on the question: this resulted in a bibliography of some 2,500 titles. It was found that the prevailing drift of opinion on the part of scholars in linguistics, philosophy, psychology, and education was to the effect that criticism such as those of  Chomsky had definitively shown the inadequacy of \"behavioristic\" explanations of language such as those of Mead and Skinner. This called for a careful examination of the implications of recent work in generative and transformational grammars, subsummable under the general topic \"Mentalism in Linguistics.\" A Symposium on Thought and Language was held at the University o f Arizona in February 23-24, 1968, the proceedings of which will be published in 1969 by the University of Arizona Press under th e title \"Thought and Language: An Interdisciplinary Symposium.\" Authors will be J.L.

He states that there is and can be no such thing as \"the (only) correct grammar even of the English of some limited linguistic group at some particular time.\" Grammars should be treated as scientific theories \"since it is only with this limitation that mentalism in linguistics has any plausibility whatsoever.\" There is  nothing in linguistic practice which should lead to the belief that the internal structure and operation of a grammar is in any way identifiable with, or a duplication of, the internal structure or operation of a mind or a brain. A grammar represents, ideally, the output of the speaker-hearer-judge. This paper will appear in \"Thought and Language: An Interdisciplinary Symposium,\" to be edited by J.L.

The defects of this approach have now become a matter of urgent concern in the face of the tremendous educational problems of the urban ghettos. This paper reverses the usual focus and looks directly at non-standard English--not as an isolated object in itself, but as an integral part of the larger sociolinguistic structure of the English language. To do this, the author first presents some linguistic considerations on the nature of language itself, and then a number of sociolinguistic principles which have emerged in the research of the past ten years. The relation of non-standard dialects to education is reviewed, bearing in mind  that the fundamental role of the school is to teach the reading and writing of standard English. Finally, the author turns to the question of what research teachers and educators themselves can do in the classroom--the kind of immediate and applied research which will help them make the best use of teaching materials. The author hopes that this paper will put the teacher directly into touch with the students' language, help him to observe that language more directly and accurately, and enable him to adjust his own teaching to the actual problems that he sees. A 36-item bibliography covering all areas of the paper is included. (DO)",

The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the relationship between sociometric choice patterns and pupillary behavior. Some 18 sixth-grade subjects (Ss) completed a sociometric questionnaire in which they indicated three friendship and three nonfriendship choices. Black and white photographs of each S were made and served as the experimental stimuli. The stimuli were arranged and shown to each S according to their responses to the  sociometric questionnaire. No significant differences in pupillary dilatation patterns were found among Ss when viewing stimuli depicting friendship choices as opposed to nonfriendship choices. Pupillary dilatation to pictures of friends was, on the average, not significantly different from dilatation patterns to pictures of nonfriends. Results were discussed in terms of (1) theoretical issues relevant to sociometric choice patterns, and (2) the interpretation of pupillary response patterns and their relationship to inquiry in the social sciences.

Among the variables recoreded with reference to each play group were its size, its composition by grade and sex, ethnic or religious affiliation of the participants, length of play, incidence of quarrel, play area and surface, and the name of the game. An Encyclopedia of Games has been compiled, in which some 5,000 descriptions of games and their variants have been systematically categorized and encoded. An analysis of the extent of interaction in play between boys and girls has revealed that about one quarter of  them play in mixed groups, with considerable variability in this respect depending on age and culture. In all cases, however, more girls play with boys than vice versa. Indeed, girls have fewer games which they call entirely their own. Typical boys' games have been distinguished from typical girls' games, on such characteristics as extent of interdependence between players, outcomes of winning or losing (both more characteristic of boys' games), and precise prescription of action sequences (typical of girls' games). The data has theoretical implications related to child development and to the nature of play and games. (Author)",

Standards should be sought which are both flexible enough to attract a foreign student enrollment, and rigid enough to maintain the academic integrity of the institution and the prestige of American education abroad. Whether the institution is large with elaborate processes and specialized personnel  or small with simple procedures and limited staff, the objective is the same: to admit foreign students who have the academic, financial, and linguistic abilities to complete their educational objectives successfully, and who will benefit from what the institution has to offer.

When a sample of freshmen college students were required to respond to statements of the California Psychological Inventory (CPI) in a controlled amount of time per statement, not only were four of the 18 scores significantly different from regular scores, but two of these scores, both individually and in combination, predicted achievement better than regular CPI scores. Introducing and controlling the dimension of time seems to make personality scores account for greater amounts of variance with an achievement criterion in the form of grade point average. If time is a relevant variable when scores of the CPI  are used to predict achievement of college freshmen, it may well be a relevant variable when CPI scores are used for other purposes. The CPI is used extensively in counseling. It may be that constructs, reportedly measured by CPI scores, are altered when the dimension of time is introduced into their measurement. Construct validation of timed CPI scores should be carried out in order to determine if they are measuring the same characteristics as regular CPI scores. Suggestions for future research are given.

Research data regarding this concept were gathered through work in the Developmental Career Guidance Project. The instruments utilized were the Career Guidance Surveys. They were administered to students in grades kindergarten through 12 in 1965, 1966, 1967, and 1968. Results to date suggest that lower-class children are considerably more realistic in their view of work and occupational concepts than they have been credited with. The authors say that the educational system may be reflective of the larger society, dedicated to the production of successful middle-class Caucasians at the expense of the lower-socio-economic Negroes.  The lower socio-economic environment is seen as limiting the aspirations and perception levels of children. The school must be acutely aware of the environmental factors involved in the child's life. Although the interpretations, implications, and trends of the study do not lend themselves as yet to positive conclusions, they point to the desirability of more research in the areas of not only conceptions of occupation and aspiration, but also the role of education in the development of a complete and harmoniously functional society.

These variables were intercorrelated using a missing data correlation program to adjust for omitted responses. Separate Negro-white correlation matrices were factor analyzed, using the principal components solution with ones places in the diagonals of the matrices. Kaiser's Varimax criterion was applied to obtained orthogonal rotation solutions. Finally, Kaiser's factor comparison program was used to obtain indices of the degree of similarity between the separate factor structures. Areas of similarity were found in clusters dealing with negative affective states,  physical correlates of emotional states, aggressive impulses, social rejection, and situational and general anxiety. Although qualitative differences in the configuration of factor structures between Negro and white youth were minimal, the Negro sampling did tend to show less clarity than did the white. This finding suggests that perhaps Negro adolescents may be exposed to more stressful environmental circumstances which produce more diffused adjustmental patterns than white adolescents. (CJ)",

Some of these hypotheses are findings that need to be replicated and others are explanatory hypotheses that need to be researched. One thing is apparent: social fraternities are suspect of having a central role in many cases of disorderly conduct, intoxication, and underage consumption of alcohol. Hodinko's (1964) study of student mores also supports such a contention.

Many students have come to feel that the states induced by drugs will automatically produce a revelation of life's meaning or, at least, an experience which will be highly significant and illuminating. Despite the presence of some values which are consistent with drug use, most students have other values arguing against drug use. A type of student who is particularly prone to drug abuse, the \"disaffiliates,\" have few values militating against drug use, and strong motivations that incline them  toward drugs. Some factors predisposing these students toward drug abuse are summarized. In dealing with the drug user, we must attempt to provide him with alternate routes to attain valid goals. The students are reacting not only to the individual circumstances of their past, but to dilemmas that confront their entire generation. In counseling, it is important to acknowledge that the question of drug use is not a medical issue, but an existential, philosophical, and ethical issue. (IM)",

Not to do so will attenuate our effectiveness, though we may gain in sterile academic respectability. I have suggested three steps as a starting point in this integration.

        "description":"A major task in the present study was to develop a Morphology of Occupational Choice that would articulate the main sectors in which occupational decisions are made. These four major sectors, serving as social incentives, influence the choices youth make of their future life work: (1) the intrinsic features of the work task, (2) the extrinsic rewards of work, (3) the extra-role considerations, and (4) the perceived feasibility of the occupational goals. Each of these four sectors can, in turn be differentiated into subcomponents. In its most elaborate form, the morphology comprises 27 elements of choice. Detailed coding procedures for the morphology were developed, with parallel forms constructed for use with choice and exclusion data. Tests were made of the usefulness of the  morphology for classifying the structure of what is chosen (or rejected) in occupational decisions. A significant by-product of the present inquiry was the development of a Social Time Perspective Scale that can be used for assessing the extent to which youth adopt a long-term view of the future. A final concern was the methodological issue of the compatibility of interview and questionnaire data on occupational choice and its related factors. Despite expectations to the contrary, the findings revealed fundamentally different results are yielded by the two procedures. (Author)",

During the clinical services meetings, the other group leaders stated that their groups were often avoiding confrontations of their feelings, while we were able to state that members of our group sometimes overwhelmed us with their insights. Possibly, this was because these techniques kept the members alert and involved, showed them that we were interested and would let them do and say things that would normally have been forbidden, and let them know that we wanted to offer a chance to experience new  things. Because of this, their reactions and interactions were more spontaneous and \"off-guard.\" (Author)",

They did possess some realistic information about the amount of training necessary for specific careers. The hypothesis that the students would tend to choose future careers consonant with their personality need was confirmed.

Some 19 marginal applicants to Hope College were studied in terms of admissions data, their performance in the specially designed summer trial program, and their experience and performance during their total first year of college. The results of the study indicate that the usual academic predictors of college success (high-school grades, Scholastic Aptitude Test scores, rank in graduating class) are of no use at all in predicting the first year, cumulative grade point average of these marginal entrants. However, these predictors are useful in predicting how the students will perform  in the Summer Trial Program. In turn, the grade earned in the summer program is highly predictive of the total cumulative grade point average at the end of the freshmen year. The special program designed for the summer and the follow-up of the trial students during their first year appeared successful both in terms of the low attrition rate among the participants and in terms of personal growth and development of the individuals involved.

The first study explores the properties of a set of pictures newly developed to measure need achievement (n Ach). These pictures, separate ones for males and females, display attractive persons in up-to-date academic, vocational, and recreational situations. The results indicate that: (1) the new pictures evoke achievement imagery in amounts and ranges recommended by previous investigators; (2) n Ach scores from  these pictures relate somewhat better to grades than scores from other pictures; (3) concern about failure probably interacts with n Ach to affect academic performance; (4) concern about failure seems especially high in average IQ girls and high IQ boys from this milieu; (5) n Ach, curiosity, and sense of control are essentially uncorrelated and are likely to stem from different socialization practices.

Expected frequencies of the seven triad types in random graphs are deduced from elementary probability theory, and we suggest that a reasonable operational statement of Homans' theory is that in most groups, the seven key triads are less frequent than the random model would predict. A data pool of sociograms and sociomatrices from 427 groups was collected from diverse published and unpublished studies. Random samples of 30 school and 30 adult groups  were drawn from the pool and analysed. Significant majorities of both samples showed deviations from chance in the directions predicted. As a check, 60 simulated groups with truly random relationships were analysed and found to be close to the chance expectations and quite different from the real data samples.

Specific presentations centered about such topics as self-concept (Who am I?), mechanisms that distort reality, and healthy personality. Teachers in their evaluation of the program noted that workshop learnings had changed their teaching practices.

With the use of student aides for assistance with their activities of daily living, handicapped students experienced a nearly normal college life.

With all of this evidence, Georgia's ranking among the states had continued to decrease for several years. The school dropout is the symbol of our greatest failure in education in Georgia. In 10 years, we have increased by more than 100% in per-pupil expenditures, but this increased expenditure does not automatically guarantee improved education. The school dropout is a slow learner, and the slow learner continues to baffle educators. We need greater interest from businessmen. We need renewed efforts by educators. We need more participation by parents. We need greater cooperation among education related agencies. Our talking and  planning and surveying have greatly exceeded our acting. From previous years, we can predict a profile of this year's school dropouts. The following pages report data which we know about dropouts and indicate directions toward which we must work in the weeks and months of the 1968-69 school year. This research was funded by Title III, Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. (Author)",

        "description":"The data indicate that the influence of a brother or sister is considerably greater upon the second born than upon the first born. The magnitude of the sex of sibling effect is probably dependent upon whether a sibling is present during the first few years of life, a period during which many enduring response patterns are being acquired. The family environment of the first born contains no other sibling. Consequently, sex of sibling can have no influence during this early formative period. The family environment of the second born, however, contains an older sibling from the moment the younger child enters the family. Consequently, the sex of the older sibling can have a systematic influence on the second born throughout his entire course of development. The influence of the  older child's sex upon the second born may be mediated either by direct sibling-to-sibling contact or by the impact of the first-born child upon parents' mode of response to their younger child.

The purpose of the investigation was to determine if group counseling could produce changes among underachievers in motivation toward school, acceptance of self, and realism of occupational and educational aspirations. No significant difference in academic motivation scores between the counseled and noncounseled groups was found. The results of this investigation revealed that the counseled group made a significant change in mean self-acceptance score when compared to the gain made in self-acceptance by the noncounseled group. The counseled group at the termination of the program was selecting educational and occupational  goals more in accord with their potential or more realistically, while the reverse was true of the noncounseled group. It may be concluded that group counseling might well promote more positive student acceptance of self as well as greater realism in occupational and educational goal selection. (Author)",

The higher the freshman advisor was rated on the social dimension, the more satisfied was the freshman in the sense of belonging. The higher the advisor was rated on the academic help category, the more the freshman sought help from others. The advisor who was rated high on personal help in adjusting to college was one who formed a continuing relationship with her freshman. The higher the freshman rated her advisor on leadership attitudes, the higher the freshman achieved academically. The tone of college life can be greatly enhanced by effective freshman advisors with personal-academic orientations and constructive leadership attitudes.  These women represent a different level of influence than do staff members and provide another channel of communication with beginning students. Most of all, though, the freshman advisor may be that one person who cares. (Author)",

Results force a consideration of mediational variables in explaining this form of cognitive learning. A set of verbal materials analogous to a set of dimensionalized figural materials was constructed. The figural stimuli were 16 H-patterns, the combinations of values of the four binary dimensions of color (red or green), size (large or small), number (one or two), and orientation (upright or tilted). the verbal stimuli were 16 nouns, four sets of four, which had been shown to be associated with four adjectival categories: hard-white, soft-white, hard-brown, and soft-brown. Tested were two hypotheses: (1) that the difficulty  of three classifications would be an inverse function of the number of relevant dimensions composing the classifications, and (2) that figural instances would be more difficult to categorize correctly than verbal instances. The hypotheses were supported, but needed to be qualified because of significant interaction. Alternative interpretations of results are discussed. (Author)",

The discussion will deal in detail with the mechanics of group selection, and the dynamics of the group as it forms , moves forward, and separates. In the third chapter, under  the title \"Group Psychotherapy\" those techniques will be discussed which are not attempted by the school counselor because of the depth of psychological or psychiatric background needed for adequate leadership.

The laboratory analogy of this type of problem is referred to as a conditional discrimination problem. Mr. Grogg empirically demonstrates the difference between a sign-differentiated (SD) and a nonsign-differentiated (NSD) conditional discrimination problem, the former not necessarily requiring a relational rule for solution, but the latter necessarily involving true relational learning. By testing sixth graders, 10th graders and college sophomores, data is provided concerning the developing ability to solve such problems. The results indicated that at each grade level, the NSD problem was  more difficult than the SD problem. Also revealed was a monotonic developmental trend in conditional problem-solving ability. The results were interpreted in terms of a hierachy of response tendencies, and a differential cognitive requirement. (Author)",

Some 11 items judged as affect-laden by two rater groups were selected from the Squires Empathy Test. A group of counselors and a control group of graduate science students were selected by random sampling and tested individually. The affective component of empathy was assessed by obtaining four physiological measures: (1) skin conductance, finger blood volume, heart rate, and respiration rate. The cognitive component was assessed by obtaining oral response measures of the subject's interpretation of a tape-recorded dramatic  excerpt followed by a slide o f six pictures. It was found that the empathic behavior of counselors differed from that of noncounselors with respect to changes in finger blood volume, although no differentiation could be made with the other physiological measures. It was found that counselors and noncounselors do not differ in their respective abilities to perceptualize in empathetic situations. (IM)",

A matrix was constructed for each set and subset, and from each matrix hypothetical syllogisms were formed which employed other connectives to use as many of the units as possible. The three major sets of Predecessor, Inside Successor, and Outside Successor along with their subsets were selected for this work.  Two general propositions are inferred from the study: (1) The degree and level of the predecessor's participation in successor selection varies with his success as a leader and the length of his tenure, and (2) the successor's deviation from the status quo will vary with the number and intensity of the constraints placed upon him.

The nature of education, with long timelags between ultimate performance and present activity, makes the modeling most difficult. This paper reports on one of several efforts which have been made to develop quantitative models of the educational process. The model is developed for future inclusion into a school district budgeting and program-planning model. The history of the model's development and some of the problems encountered are discussed. Practical implications for further management science in educational research are also drawn. (Author/HW)",

The organizational model developed is based on Parsons' four functional imperatives of goal attainment, adaptation, integration, and pattern maintenance. Organizations are regarded as social systems distinguished by different arrangements of the same structural elements, as determined by the values of the particular organization or system. Special attention is given to the classification of organizations and to external and internal problems of organization. Applications of the model are made to organization in education and to the relationship of organization to educational innovation. (JK)",

A major portion of the document is devoted to a State-by-State analysis of the single boards and councils of higher education in 21 States. These investigations are concerned with the structure, authority, responsibility, and institutional guidelines for the approval of new programs. The need for a central State coordinating agency for the State of Utah is then determined, and an attempt is made to develop specific criteria and guidelines for the evaluation of instructional programs and administrative units. Since Utah is lagging behind a number of States in developing an integrated Statewide educational program, it is suggested that this proposed  agency should be empowered, via appropriate legislation, to review and allocate programs for Utah's institutions of higher education.

After the compilation of a list of schools meeting the survey definition of middle schools from State departments of education and other sources, a survey instrument was used to secure the following detailed data from a 10 percent random sample (110 schools) stratified by USOE regions: (1) Number, location by USOE regions, grades included, enrollment, housing, and plans for articulation with lower and upper schools, (2) establishment (dates, reasons, preparation), (3) curriculum plans, (4) instructional organization, (5) arrangements for individualizing instruction, and (6) the reactions of students, staff, parents, and the general public to the middle schools. It is concluded that there is  currently movement toward a different grade organization of the school ladder, but that the new middle school organizations in general fail to provide a program and instructional organization differing very much from those in the predecessor schools.

The Schedule of Classes is prepared several terms in advance for approximately 25,000 students in 3,500 sections of 1,500 different courses, conducted by some 2,500 faculty members in more than 500 classrooms and teaching laboratories, and covering approximately 60 majors in 10 undergraduate colleges and in a Graduate School. An updating Supplement is published immediately preceding the opening of each term. Some longrange objectives of the scheduling process include (1) satisfying the course and credit requirements for all students through an optimum distribution of academic offerings, (2) developing effective, efficient, and economic uses of  the resources of the institution (staff, physical facilities, courses, etc.), and (3) as a byproduct, compiling data for use in projecting future personnel, physical facilities, and fiscal requirements.

It was found that most preparatory programs in educational public information are not jointly sponsored by schools of education and schools of journalism. To remedy this situation and to establish public information as a field of graduate study, five recommendations are made: (1) A national conference of selected  leaders and experts in different aspects of public information should be held, (2) selected institutions should be encouraged to develop relevant pilot programs, (3) financial support of such programs should be encouraged, (4) educational public information should become a career field for specialists in various aspects of communication, and (5) programs for research should be encouraged.

A PPB system is defined and its basic operation is described. Various ways in which the broader purposes of governments may be classified in terms of their objectives are presented with emphasis on how the learning objective might fit into a program structure for government. With this background, a PPB system is applied to education as cost effectiveness analysis for learning. Cost effectiveness analysis is defined, measurement of alternative program costs and program effectiveness is described, and the relationship of the two elements is explored.

By factor analysis and statistical procedures, 17 tests were selected to compose the Laradon Occupational Success Predictive Battery. Cross validation was conducted with the group of 60 and a group of 51 with three subgroups. Analysis of predictive power indicated that in the subgroup most resembling the original 60, the predicted job success tended to correlate with the rated job success; female subjects were rated low; institutionalized retarded persons were not within the predictive  scope; and the economic life of the community influenced what kind of job exposure the retarded person could have. Methods for perceptual remediation were also developed and tested on normal children (ages 5 to 17) and mentally retarded trainees at the Laradon Center. Results indicated that the mentally retarded showed more deviation in inconsistency measures than in accuracy. The tests are appended. (JD)",

No downward linear trend occurred in academic aspirations or  expectations and no changes resulted in affective orientation to the special class, in the proportion of subjects choosing the special class, or in significant others named (except for teachers). Also noted were a high degree of correspondence between significant and academic significant others named by the subjects and by members of a regular class; an increase in the proportion of subjects naming teachers as significant others (p<.05); and, except for teachers, parents, and local adults who increased in proportion of mention (p<.05), overall high agreement in academic significant others named.

Three kinds of effect were investigated, including general effect, effect of social setting (variables being social-psychological, social-organizational, and demographic-ecological), and joint effect. Results on the nature of family crisis indicated that in families with high early marital integration, the extent of initial impact of retardation on the husband was inversely related to the current degree of integration, and in the remaining families no such relationship was found: mothers were more willing to place a retarded boy who was an oldest child than one who was an only child; retarded boys had a greater impact on fathers  initially and on mothers currently; and, especially for husbands, current impact tended to vary directly with initial impact. Results concerning the parents' willingness to institutionalize the child revealed that the higher the social status, the greater the relative willingness of the husband as compared with that of the wife; in high status families, willingness varied directly with the number of normal children in the family; and the lower the social status, the greater the relative willingness of mothers of retarded boys as compared with mothers of retarded girls.

Three first grade classes were organized as follows: one experimental with 12 deficit children using a deficit centered training curriculum; one experimental with 24 normal children using a traditional curriculum; one control with six deficit children and 12 normal children using a traditional curriculum. The children were given a battery of psychodiagnostic tests in the fall and spring of the first grade. The results clearly favored the deficit children in the experimental class with  significant differences in mean change in Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children scores (p=.05), in visual perception and language functioning (p=.01), and in perceptual motor skills (p<.05). Important changes were also noted for the same groups in auditory-visual integration and visual perception, and in language development, particularly in expressive areas. Little difference was seen in the measurement of academic achievement. Performance favored the normal experimental group but without significant differences. (Author/SN)",

Background and task materials took the form of both written and audiovisual media, featuring a communications in-basket, telephone calls, filmed observations, and role-played conferences. Instruments for evaluating the materials consisted of a test used before and after treatment to assess behavioral change, a category scoring system to assess performance during the training sessions, and a participant opinionnaire. Two experimental groups (10 in one and 21 in the other) and two control groups (10 each) were involved. The following  results were noted: performance scoring was reliable (interrater correlation coefficients were .81 to .98); differences between pre- and post-treatment were significant for experimental groups (p<.05) and were not significant for the control group; a lack of correlation between test and performance variables cast doubt on the validity of the test scales; and the materials were perceived by participants as an extremely valuable vehicle for training.

Subjects were high school males, classified into levels of cognitive style according to their performance on the Hidden Figures Test. For the first experiment, three non-overlapping groups of 30 each were required to classify figural patterns, which could vary along as many as seven bilingual dimensions, into four categories. Findings were that high analytic subjects made fewer errors than did middle analytic subjects who in turn made fewer errors than the low analytic; performance in terms of error-to-criterion was an increasing linear function of the complexity of the problem (p<.01); and the interaction of cognitive style with complexity was not significant. For the second  experiment, two groups of 40 each were selected and 10 subjects from each level of cognitive style were randomly assigned to one of four training conditions (verbal-prompt, prompt, verbal, and control). Results indicated that high analytic subjects committed fewer errors that low analytic subjects (p<.05); verbalizing the stimulus values facilitated concept identification only in the absence of prompted training; prompted training facilitated identification only in the absence of verbal training; and training procedures did not differentially influence performance of subjects with different cognitive styles.

Public School Department began a special demonstration project on the secondary school level, the Webster Girls School Program, to reduce the number of dropouts due to pregnancy and recidivism. An interagency, multidisciplinary plan was devised to provide comprehensive services to the girls. Social case work, academic and vocational education, psychological services, medical supervision, and nutritional advice were included in the program to improve the welfare of the school-age pregnant girl and restore her to the community. Of the girls enrolled the first 3 years, 75% moved forward academically. In a 1965 study, those enrolled the first year (103) were compared to a control group (123) referred but not enrolled then. Results indicated the Webster  girls dropped out of school less (p&lt;.001) and were less likely to have another child (p&lt;.001).

        "description":"Six experiments examined the problem-solving behavior of normal and mentally retarded (MR) children with a two-choice discrimination learning situation: the effects of stimulus similarity upon types of solutions utilized by MR children; the role of redundant cues in the discrimination learning of MR subjects with differing mental ages; the learning of reversal (RV), intradimensional (ID), and extradimensional (ED) shifts by kindergarten children and by MR's as a function of variation of the irrevelant shift dimension; and the hypothesis behavior in the discrimination learning situation of subjects at different developmental levels (data still being collected). Results indicated that stimulus similarity had no effect upon types of solutions adopted by MR children on discrimination  problems. For MR subjects form cues predominated over color cues in the solving of discrimination problems, color-form compound cues were used, the negative compound was stronger than the positive compound, and strengths of cues did not change with overtraining. ID shifts were learned faster than ED shifts by MR children under all shift dimensions; ID and RV shifts were learned faster than ED shifts by kindergarten children only when the irrevelant shift dimension varied between trials.

The task involved using inflectional and derivational suffixes at two levels of generality: producing inflected and derived forms of English words, and applying rules of English morphology to provide inflected and derived forms of new (nonsense) words. Results indicated that some suffixes were used with perfect accuracy by younger children, whereas other suffixes were not used accurately even by older children; however, for most suffixes accuracy of use increased with age. Some suffixes were used by all three groups with similar accuracy at earlier CA's; most were used more accurately at  the earlier CA's by the more intelligent children with the differences disappearing at later CA's; and some were used more accurately by the more intelligent children at both the earlier and later CA's: Study of the variations in generality revealed that, although some suffixes were used more accurately with English words than with new words, most suffixes were used with similar accuracy at both levels of generality. Accuracy in using suffixes differed among morphemes, with larger differences for younger, less intelligent children and smaller ones for older, more intelligent children. (Author/JD)",

A quasi-projection technique was used to test six groups of 20 boys each, including institutionalized and family-based normals (aged 6 and 12) and retardates (aged 12, with IQ's to 65 and mental ages 6 to 7). Each child analyzed one group and then synthesized another in the settings of home, play, work, and school to solve a problem. Evaluation considered whether the following group characteristics were present and how abstract they were: the identifiable unit, social structure, role behavior, reciprocal relations, normative behavior, common interests, common goals, and  continuity. Results indicated a greater incidence and degree of aprasia among retardates than normals of the same chronological age, and a greater degree among the institutionalized than those in a family setting in comparable groups (p=.001 for both); little or no difference between retardates and normals of the same mental age; more difficulty in synthesizing than in analyzing a similar situation (p=.02 to .001); and poorer scoring on comprehension of role, normative behavior, and group identification.

The 45 were considered flexible, intelligent, creative, and stimulating. Analysis of the teacher behavior scale indicated four main factors: individualized materials and instruction, art of questioning, encouragement of higher level learning, and communication-interaction. Inservice activities were pupil study (case studies) of gifted characteristics, study of classroom principles for higher level thinking, and discussion and evaluation of a teacher model;  teacher-made videotapes of classroom activities, using the principles learned, were also shown and evaluated at the inservice meetings. Interjudge reliabilities of .90 were obtained from audiotape analysis of the teachers' questions and answers at the beginning and end of the project. Significant improvement between the two tapes (p=.01) occurred in the application, generalization, and synthesis questions by the teacher (indicating growth in higher cognitive level questions), and growth in open responses by students were noted.

Summaries of the data were made by county size; population groups being compared were--under 10,000, 10,000 to 19,999, 20,000 to 49,999, and 50,000 and over. No real differences were found. Seven methods of holding elections were identified--mail-in ballot, polls, and public meetings and four variations of these, with most counties using only polls. The cost of holding elections was the usual reason for using some method other than mail. Fifty-one percent of the counties voted on the  state-wide date, seven percent used another single date, and 42 percent voted for more than one day. Council members were predominately male, over 40, had completed high school or above, and were in their first Council term. Four interest or membership groups predominated--(1) farming and homemaking, 94-100% of counties, (2) 4-H and Home Economics Club organizations, 80%, (3) business, professional and civic organizations, 45-56%, and (4) schools and other, 24%.

It was concluded that temporary changes in role perception and behavior as a result of conference attendance may enable a minister to change in his relationship with laymen from a prima donna or laisez-faire style of leadership to one of &quot;coach-player,&quot; changes varying somewhat with age and greatly with denomination. An orientation course can guide the conferee to learn certain principles and  sensitize him to his mistakes in preaching, group counseling, or administration, but for lasting learning, additional training and work with laymen outside the church are needed. Parish ministers do a great deal of attitudinal and perceptual learning in a short, intensive experience, but there is need for follow up conferences six months to a year later.

Each day's program included a staff planning period, an assembly during which such topics as finding a job, budgeting, and citizen responsibility were discussed, instructional periods in reading, mathematics, and vocational guidance-human relations, and a library and counseling period. At the end of the program, the composite grade level on the Gates Reading Survey increased from 9.2 to 10.5, the grade level in arithmetic increased from 5.8 to 8.3, and there were no significant changes in  students' responses to an experimental value scale. Thirteen students passed the GED high school equivalency test and 18 failed. Although there were no correlations with GED performance and number of school years completed, students with reading grade levels below ninth grade prior to the program were unable to pass the GED after eight weeks o&quot; instruction while those with a prior grade level of 10.0 or higher all passed. The comments, both formal and informal, of students and their counselors were highly favorable. (aj)",

The reading selections range from prewar to current times in a variety of styles and on a variety  of subject matters. Upon completion of this course the student should be able to read with the aid of a dictionary many modern types of Malay or Indonesian prose, and should also be able to understand most of the Malay or Indonesian spoken by educated native speakers.

        "description":"The author notes the problems arising from the dichotomy between literary Arabic and the spoken varieties. The thousand-year-old system of teaching literary Arabic, the archaic elements of grammar, and the writing system are discussed. The written history of the literary language is presented in three stages--(1) the pre-Islamic classical, (2) the international, medieval Eastern, and (3) the contemporary. A speaker of one of the five main dialects (Abrabian, Syrian, Iraqi, Egyptian, or Maghribi) can, with difficulty, understand a conversation in another dialect becuase of the similarity in vocabulary and basic grammar. The almost complete elimination of the literary language from the area of oral communication, however, and the almost unlimited domination of this area by the  dialects has provoked a natural desire to find some way for a unification of these two language forms, sometimes considered antagonistic in their \"bilingualism.\" A general opinion is that the solution depends on time and that the rift between written and spoken forms will narrow with the disappearance of illiteracy.

        "description":"The purpose of this study is to describe the speech of Negro high school students in Memphis, Tennessee. The study deals with the phonology and grammar of the students' speech. The phonological analysis is limited to a description of the segmental phonemes, their allophones, and their incidence. The grammatical analysis is limited to a description of the parts of speech, the function words, the major sentence patterns, and the major patterns of modification and coordination. The structure of the speech of the students is compared with that of standard English, particularly that of the Southern area. Eighteen students from three large high schools in predominantly Negro neighborhoods were interviewed. Thirteen group discussions, all taking place in the students' classrooms, were  also taped. The selection of students and groups was kept as close to random selection as possible. Results show that the phonological system of their speech is that which is found in the Southern area. Most of the grammatical patterns which they use are found in standard or substandard Southern English. Two, which occur with some frequency, a noun possessive that is identical with the base form of the noun and &quot;they&quot; used as a possessive form, are not. A sentence pattern with a zero copula which some students use may occur in the Southern Mountain area. (Author/DO)",

Because the orthography-sound association skill cannot be separated from the sound-meaning skill, reading pedagogy must concentrate on the fundamental &quot;see-say-think&quot; sequence of association. There should be close controls over the sound and grammar patterns and the cultural context of the beginning and intermediate reading texts for overseas English classrooms. In adapting traditional, &quot;Direct Method&quot; texts for use in a linguistically-oriented approach, the teacher should (1) decide upon the phonological targets, based on a  contrastive analysis, (2) select the grammatical problems contained in the narrative or dialog (that are not treated as structure points for study in the text), (3) select vocabulary to work on choosing those items of phonological or cultural difficulty, and (4) examine the drills, which may have too much emphasis on the content of the dialog or narrative. The steps in composing controlled reading texts, also discussed by the author, are illustrated with excerpts from an elementary reading lesson for Hawaiian schools, based on a contrastive analysis of Standard English and Hawaii Islands Dialect.

The purpose was to make available to highly educated refugees from Soviet-dominated countries and their families community services which would facilitate adjustment to life in the United States. In the fall of 1954, the funds were depleted and the Welfare and Health Council asked the Junior League of the City of New York to take over this teaching, using selected volunteer League members. The author points out that less educated immigrants knowing little or no English can usually find jobs if their skills or crafts are not dependent on a knowledge of the language, whereas the more  highly educated immigrants often experience great difficulty finding work in their professional fields without a fluent knowledge of English. The program described here provides such highly educated foreign-born adults with \"concentrated, high-level instruction in English, enabling them to improve their economic and social well-being and to obtain employment more nearly commensurate with that in their countries of origin.\" The author discusses some of the problems involved in setting up programs for volunteer teachers.

The bulk of the chapter is a survey of language acquisition itself. It is organized under three major headings, one for each of the three main components of a grammar: syntax, phonology, and semantics. A description of the methods typically used in studying the development of each component is given. The  emergence of the components themselves is traced (insofar as it is known), and a discussion of various theoretical issues in the light of the empirical findings is presented. Wherever possible, mention is made of children exposed to languages other than English, with the chief contrast languages being Russian and Japanese. (See related document ED 017 921.) (DO)",

A tendency to conflate the two processes is found in articles on speech communication, automatic speech recognition, foreign language learning, and child language. Once this scattered literature is assembled and organized, it becomes clear that the present emphasis is on conflation whereas the evidence in each of the four areas favors a more balanced view. Properties of phoneme perception, for example, are often explained in terms of phoneme production, whereas these properties seem to recur in other kinds of perception, unrelated to articulation. At the suprasegmental level, the view that the listener refers what  he hears to how he would say it is opposed by the different dynamic characteristics of speaking and listening, which are evident whenever a speaker adjusts his level to match a numerical or acoustic criterion, or to compensate for changes in sidetone, or to maintain intelligibility despite increasing noise. When the relations between speaking and listening are altered by pathology, case studies find further evidence for their relative independence in the normal individual. (Author/JD)",

An aphasic individual might be expected to perform differently from a normal individual when asked for judgments of \"normality\" in putative sentences in his native language. A group of normal subjects and a group of aphasic subjects were asked to: (1) select the one which more closely approximates normal English from a pair of strings of randomly distributed English sentence formatives; (2) rank a given string of randomly  distributed formatives on a 1-to-5 scale as to its acceptability as normal English. Results show that both normal and aphasic subjects tend to prefer a given string, regardless of its order in the task, and that rank and preference are highly correlated.

Association and grammatical structure interacted significantly, indicating that the effect of associative strength was greater for G than  for U strings. On a measure of total word recall without regard for serial constraint, recall of HA words was superior to recall of LA words; recall of words from G strings was superior to recall of words from U strings; but the main effect of Instructions was not significant. There was significant interaction between grammatical structure and learning-recall instructions (grammatical structure facilitated O recall more than F recall ).

The study was concerned with whether the observed superiority in the recall of content context words (CCWs) from HA passages is a storage or a retrieval phenomenon. Since it has been observed that HA words are recalled better than LA words, it was necessary in the present study to equate the groups on the number of prompt words available during recall. Significantly more CCWs and  significantly more prompt words appeared on the recall sheets of the HA subjects.

The test word correlated with one of the ten accelerated words in one of the following ways: (1) correct--actually a word from the list, (2) semantic--high semantic relatedness, (3) phonetic--rhyming with one of the accelerated words,  (4) wrong--not related in any ascertainable manner. Each subject received 24 separate trials. There were five different conditions for the accelerated items, ranging from normal (two words per second) to double compressed (four words per second). GSR was used as a measure of arousal and was recorded throughout the session. Two major effects were observed: (1) the measure of certainty varied consistently across all conditions with subjects most certain in the correct condition and least certain in the wrong condition, and (2) GSR deflections increased as the delay interval increased.

        "description":"Twenty-four four-year-old children were given a perceptual task (color matching), a memory task (color recognition), and a verbal task (color naming). The relation between the children's performance on the nonverbal and verbal tasks was demonstrated by the fact that nearly all the matching and recognition responses, even when incorrect, were from the same naming class as the stimulus color. Contrary to expectations, this tendency was stronger on the matching task than on the recognition task. Only those children who spontaneously named the colors as they were presented showed this effect on the recognition task. As a result of this experiment, a model is proposed in which perception of colors leads to two distinct encodings: one representational and one symbolic. The two can have  different internal histories, but if the symbolic encoding is present at the time of response selection, it will influence the output. However, the symbolic encoding is very short-lived for these young children, and it will be forgotten unless rehearsed overtly. This model is considered in terms of mediation; and it is argued that the non-namers in the recognition task do not suffer from production deficiency, but rather from mediational deficiency, resulting from a lack of memory for the mediator. These conclusions differ from the weak form of the Whorf hypothesis in that two distinct, concurrent encodings are assumed. (DO)",

Three groups of subjects (Ss) were matched on socio-economic status and race--a group of EMR boys, a group of normal boys matched with the EMR Ss on chronological age (CA normal group), and a group of normal boys matched with the EMR Ss on mental age (MA normal group). Each group was subdivided into two age groups. The older subgroups received three grouping tasks--objects, pictures, and words. The younger subgroups received two grouping tasks--objects and pictures. The responses of the Ss were coded into grouping strategy categories--superordinate, complexive, or thematic. As hypothesized, the results  revealed that EMR Ss used fewer superordinate strategies than either equal CA normal Ss or equal MA normal Ss. No differences were found in the effects of age on performance of EMR and equal CA normal Ss. Neither were differential effects of stimulus materials evidenced in the results. Differences found in the performance of normal and EMR Ss were related to findings of other studies of cognitive abilities among EMR Ss. Partial support was found for the hypothesis that increasing numbers of stimuli decrease the use of efficient grouping strategies among EMR subjects. (AMM)",

More factors tended to appear as chronological age increased. Although there was little consistency of factor structure between age groups, analyses of three groups at the same age level produced a reasonable amount of consistency. Analyses of the three major dimensions of the ITPA (channel, level, and process) revealed that channel differentiation was best achieved by the test. There was little in the way of differentiation in the younger age groups for the level and  process evaluation. However, for the older age groups (approximately six years and above), it appears that the test was moderately successful in assessing some of the dimensions for which it was intended. (Author/DO)",

Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs in ten English prose passages were replaced by nonsense paralogs. The subjects identified paragraph boundaries in both English and nonsense versions. The median reliability for paragraphing English passages was .86; for nonsense, .75. The median correlation between paragraphing of English and nonsense versions of the  same passage was .71. In the light of inter-judge reliabilities, it seems clear that the paragraph is a psychological unit. It also seems possible to infer for each passage the relative saliency of the classes of semantic and formal cues, the nature of their interaction, and the univocality of each class. It is suggested that a paragraph is a unit composed of many &quot;structural constituents,&quot; each constituent consisting of a string dominated by a common marker--sentence subject (lexical system), verb tense (grammatical system), or generalized statement of a topic (rhetorical system).

On the basis of observations of monolingual and bilingual children, the author feels that \"the memorization of a fixed linguistic model associated with a constant non-linguistic behavior is at the root of the child's language acquisition.\" It is, therefore, open to question whether children acquire language by forming rules of a transformational type. The example of language learning ability in brain damaged or retarded children would  indicate that language is acquired primarily through imitation, analogy, and substitution processes rather than by rule learning. It follows from this argument that children interpret ambigious sentences by a process of tentative substitutions to test co-occurrence and distribution restrictions rather than by successively applying two different grammatical rules. It is also felt that it is pointless to construct grammars out of and for children's utterances.(JD)",

Her observations, based partially on observing her own bilingual child, suggest that the cenematic (phonological) and plerematic (morphological) levels are acquired independently of each other, and ought to be investigated separately. Individual differences in language learning procedures exist, and show up in much the same way when a foreign language is acquired. Parallelism during the \"telegraphic\" stage in Italian, Russian, and English-speaking children is a universal concept formation, rather than syntax. It appears most likely  that a child's language development is conditioned by his cognitive development and is therefore primarily semantic rather than syntactic. The maturation curve during which the child acquires his language at the same time he expands his cognitive powers is different from the mental process of second language learning, and raises the question of dominance in bilingual children. (The author discards the concept of co-ordinate versus compound bilingualism.) The memorization of a fixed linguistic model, associated with a constant non-linguistic behavior, is at the root of the child's language acquisition. (AMM)",

        "description":"This study is concerned with the problem of measuring rate of learning in individualized instructional situations, and with the relationship between rate and a number of variables. Pupil aptitude, achievement, and classroom performance were measures correlated with learning rates in six different Individually Prescribed Instruction (IPI) mathematics units. The predictor variables (verbal and non-verbal I.Q., mental age, mathematics and reading achievement scores, number of skills learned in previous terms, attention score, and reaction to the learning situation and learning materials) analyzed singly, or as a composite predictor, did not correlate significantly with any or all of the criterion variables. No single predictor consistently predicted any rate measure. Multiple  correlations showed that lack of rate measure comprehensiveness did not cause poor rate predictability. Multiple correlations and regression analysis showed the relative importance of various predictors as a function of specific units studied. Canonical correlations indicated some type of substantial relationship between the rate domain and the predictor variables domain. (WR)",

Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores, predicted grade point averages (GPA), and advisor creativity ratings were obtained for each subject. The Word Association Test, Uses Test, Make-up Problems Test, and Jackson's \"Creativity and Intelligence\" were used as creativity measures. The results of this study suggest that creativity measures would  not provide useful admissions information at Tufts University, but do suggest that aspiration level measures may provide useful information in predicting college performance. The low-risk group exhibited higher levels of aspiration, more realistic estimates of aspiration level, and superior performance on the SAT and GPA's earned compared with the high-risk group. Advisor ratings were not found useful. (WR)",

Junior colleges must assume more responsibility for the pre-service and in-service preparation of student personnel workers. Increased interest in, and by, professional associations requires junior college personnel to initiate and maintain productive relationships, to be best served by the organizations. Current practices in junior college student personnel work indicate a need for the centralization of organizational patterns, broadening of staffing patterns, direction change of the counseling function, imaginative student activities programs, the progress of developmental or remedial programs, and  the encouragement of changes in student roles. Several special projects are discussed. Student personnel work needs to develop a stronger commitment to the basic philosophy of junior colleges, re-conceptualize student personnel purposes, and focus on research and evaluation. (WR)",

Before family separation, 67 families with five- to eight-year old sons participated in an assessment evaluation including interviews, standard and experimental test batteries, and inventories. All objective measures were repeated with 40 families, six to nine months after family separation. Some six months after family reintegration, 18 families (12  experimental, six control) were re-evaluated. Family adaptation during father absence was marked by social introversion, role reversal, and developmental phase prolongation. The families coped by means of direct, appropriate problem-solving and substitutive gratifications. Recommendations for community support of families facing extended father absence include primary, secondary, and tertiary problem prevention considerations from the educational, religious, and medical communities.",

Although the project had, as its only basic guideline, the development of a model system of local occupational employment information to meet the needs of vocational education in Wisconsin, other areas of research were identified through reviewing existing information, defining the needs of vocational education, and answering problems referred by others in the field. During the early part of Project  VISION, attention was focused on the language problem existing between vocational educators and employment service personnel. Current research projects include: (1) reviewing population and labor force data to build a data system on future supply, (2) identifying patterns of occupational mobility, (3) determining occupational needs on the basis of new and expanding industries, (4) working with the Medvin Technique, and (5) doing a comprehensive employer survey.",

The approach is called \"percentage gain\" and is computed by taking the percentage that the actual raw score point change is, of the number of points available between the pre-score and the highest possible scores. Percentage gain scores were calculated for a sample of 196 workshop students and compared with simple raw change scores in  several statistical analyses. (Author)",

Profiles were analyzed in individual groupings by major area of study, natural combinations of interest, and indivudal major area groupings by school to identify the dominant personality needs of each group. Cross comparisons were also made. The statistical treatment of the data involved the t-test and analysis of variance with different comparisons of group organization. Because it was assumed that division into broader categories of natural affinities (males and females separated) might accentuate differences among groups, the overall groups were placed into three major classifications: (1) the away from people group, (2) the expressive group, and (3) the toward  people group. However, fewer significant differences were identifiable on the 15 scales of the EPPS than when the overall groups were studied. It appeared that combining the narrowly defined groups into broad groupings resulted in a neutralization of individual patterns. Differences found among the natural groups of both the male and female subjects were in the expected direction. The F-ratios suggest a degree of inherent interrelationships among the groups.

When administered to 173 adolescent students, the Color Association Exercise appeared to have only moderate potential as an assessment technique for verbal creative ability. Abstraction and elaboration scores were positively related to English compositional ability. Correlations, however, although statistically significant, were not sufficiently high for the CAE to be of immediate practical value. The Revised Art Scale (RAS) of the Welsh Figure Preference Test was administered to the same students, and it was found that cognitive predisposition for complexity in figures, as measured by that scale, was not related to verbal  creative ability or skill in language usage such as theme writing. Results of the present study suggest that the CAE may have potential as a new technique for the measurement of verbal creative ability, but it may more properly be viewed at this point as an approach in need of further investigation and development. Evidently, the RAS is not a promising device for the assessment of verbal creativity in particular. (Author)",

It is apparent that in most cases workshops who pay clients wages equal to, or in excess of, the minimums now required by law have the following characteristics: (1) older clients with relatively long service in the shop; (2) clients whose basic disabilities are physical impairments or chronic disease; (3) jobs requiring relatively higher levels of skill; and (4) income generated principally by the sale of goods and services. Some workshops  paying clients below $0.75 per hour may have characteristics similar in many respects to those enumerated above; however, the statistical analysis of available data suggests that wage levels in sheltered workshops are strongly associated with the organizational profile outlined.

        "description":"Based upon a multiple discriminant analysis of individual entrance examination data and upon a classification analysis of self-predictions, this study was an attempt to classify or predict major field of study at graduation for a sample of university students. University of Utah graduates of 1962 through 1966, in selected fields of study, served as the population. The study required two samples, and experimental sample upon which the discriminant functions were computed, and a cross-validation sample upon which the predictions as to major field of study were made. The results showed great variability as to the predictions which were obtained by the different systems of data among the various fields of study. It was concluded that there were characteristics measurable at the time  students enter the university as freshmen which distinguish, as groups, students who eventually graduated in specific major fields of study.

The relationship between differences in financial structure and other organizational characteristics is examined in the second section. While sheltered workshops derive income from (1) sales, services, and contracts, (2) client fees, (3) fees from referring agencies, (4) community fund drives, (5) workshop fund drives, (6) parent organizations, and (7) other miscellaneous sources, there is a large amount of variability among workshops, both in the magnitude of their incomes and in the relative amounts received from each source. Workshop expenses  include (1) staff salaries, (2) overhead, (3) supplies and materials, (4) client wages, and (5) miscellaneous expenses. If variations in financial structure are a valid indicator, workshops constitute a heterogeneous population of organizations. The relationships between financial structure and (1) level of technological complexity, (2) services and programs, (3) professional density, (4) administrative and supervisory density, (5) disability mix, (6) client tenure, (7) composition of boards of directors, and (8) community setting are analyzed. The data are presented in 25 tables. (IM)",

A case approach was instituted in conjunction with the college counseling division, illustrating the adaptation of parish procedures to college settings through ecumenical procedures. For the future, seminary education will change toward involvement in the on-going processes of academic inquiry. Campus ministers must abandon their postures as campus critics, moral guardians, and superior beings because these produce schisms. Campus and church representatives must cooperate toward mutual objectives, discussing differences and seeking the truth. To  effect changes, campus ministers must work through existing educational personnel and structures, and must have distinctive, visible, and identifiable functions. The minister's contributions and role stem from his concern with the application and development of the Judeo-Christian view in the lives of academic community participants. This involves assisting and advising students and administrators in developing the individual's worth and integrity, in dealing with crisis situations, and coping with the social action arena. (WR)",

Methods of establishing criterion measures for assessment of \"creativity\" consist, at the present time, of the following: (1) judgments by peers or experts; (2) test procedures purporting to measure creativity; and (3) tests for personality characteristics thought necessary to creativity. Both the latter types of tests are shaky in terms of validity criteria. Available methods for assessing parental behaviors in the child-rearing process were also reviewed. Problems here include the fact that naturalistic, as compared to experimental, research is commonly and probably necessarily  employed. This means that the direction of influence--parent to child or child to parent--is generally unclear. Interaction situations may standardize to a certain extent the natural situation, but precise definition of the causal effect is still a problem. The following parent variables appear with regularity as associated with child divergent thinking: (1) support, satisfaction with self and with child; (2) low degree of punishment; (3) low pressure for conformity; and (4) lack of intrusiveness.

These two groups were further subdivided by random sampling into a treatment group and  control group. The change from pre- to post-testing on the variables of the study was analyzed by using the analysis of covariance.

The criterion for a successful performance was set at three levels of difficulty. Each subject was assigned at random a problem in one occupation and at one of the three levels of difficulty. Subject variables were grade level, grade point average, and initial occupational interest as measured on the Holland Vocational Preference Inventory. Criterion measures of three types were taken: expressed interest in the occupation, scores on an information test covering the occupation simulated, and  incidents of information seeking during the week following treatments. Analysis of variance was used to test the main effects and all interactions. Difficulty level was not found to produce differences on the measures used, but did significantly interact with initial vocational interest pattern. The simulated problems in each occupation did generate interest and exploration in that occupation. Most students reacted favorably to the experience. (Author)",

The degree of vocational participation represented by a given occupation is defined in postulate VI as the proportion of women to the total workers in that job. Postulate VII contends that  women's vocational participation may be distinguished in terms of three levels.

        "description":"The purpose of the study was to investigate the proposition that subjects under stress will, in their behavioral interaction with significant persons, recapitulate the behaviors learned by the subject within the family constellation. The counseling interview was the model used to investigate the relationship between family learned behavior and non-family interaction. The general design of the study consisted of selecting a sample of (N=16) male and (N=23) female subjects and studying their initial interviews and a sample of later interviews selected by a critical incident method. The interactions of subjects were scored according to the interpersonal rating method of Freedman, LaForge, Leary, and others. The central hypotheses of the study were strongly supported. Over time and  under conditions of stress, the subjects' behaviors converged on intra-familial behavior with parents. In addition, reciprocal behaviors of the subjects in interaction were found to be predictable events. The subject-counselor interactions were in accord with previous research and resembled the subject-parent interaction with some notable exceptions. The results were discussed and recommendations for continuing research into personality development and counseling behavior were outlined. (Author)",

To understand vocational development, one needs to consider (a) how a man attains his identity in a given culture, (b) how vocational development is influenced by institutional forces, and (c) how cultural changes produce correlated change in vocational development. The basic assumptions are: (a) culture provides a context in which the individual validates his vocational-self; (b) cultural contexts comprise a variety of intitutional forces, each one influencing vocational development to some degree; and (c) cultural forces change with respect to urbanization and industrialization, with consequent changes taking  place in the patterns and/or possibilities of an individual's vocational development.

        "description":"The current interest in using non-professional therapists to work with chronic schizophrenics is usually focused on the effect on the patients. Relatively little attention has been paid to the effect this particularly intransigent patient population may have on clinically unsophisticated students, especially students who are planning a career as professional psychotherapists. The questions is asked about the advisability of engaging naive students in the task of &quot;helping&quot; patients who are unlikely to exhibit identifiable behavior or personality change. Biographical and rating scale data from untrained student therapists are examined, and the conclusion is reached that in most instances, the experience has a positive outcome. Students attain insights into the nature of  psychopathology and achieve a more realistic view of psychotherapy. The warning is issued, however, that the experience can be extremely frustrating and unnecessarily disconcerting to the naive therapist who expects but does not receive reinforcement in terms of a productive patient relationship or observable patient behavior change. It is suggested that unless considerable supervision is available a more responsive group of patients might provide a more suitable patient sample for the first therapeutic encounter. (Author)",

A comparison was made of the experiences of 111 randomly selected applicants included in an experimental group (given intensive service) and a similarly chosen control group of equal number (given normal service). Data were gathered by questionnaire. The cause of the superior job placement record for the experimental group is considered to be the existence of intensive service. The provision of a staff with adequate time to effect placements and the addition of relatively close  supervision that was occupationally and industry knowledgeable and capable of giving specific guidance to the staff were considered crucial. Intensive service for hard-to-place professionals should be installed on an extended trial basis. The superior placement record and improved public &quot;image&quot; of the employment service are the reasons for the recommendation. (Author)",

The model is designed to analyze various planning decisions in terms of their consistency, and, in cases in which dysfunctions are discovered, it can be used in an iterative manner to arrive at mutually consistent and balanced plans. The model  considers three separate systems: the Educational System, the Manpower System, and the Inter-industry System.

In one public school system in Pennsylvania an inservice education program was designed using \"A Guide to the Self-Appraisal and Development of Elementary Schools\" as a basis for discussion at a series of inservice meetings. Four fifth and four sixth grade teachers and their classes were chosen to be a part of the study. None of the teachers were told that a study was being undertaken, but were led to believe that it was a normal inservice program. Eight control and eight experimental groups, comparable in I.Q. and past achievement and each with approximately 250 pupils, were  used. The inservice program was explained to the teachers at a general teachers' meeting at which five subsequent meetings were scheduled. Each group was pre- and post-tested to measure the gain made by the experimental group. The \"t-test\" was used to measure the level of significant difference that arose. Compared with pupils in the control group, the program of inservice education for elementary teachers increased the achievement of pupils in the experimental group. (HW)",

Although school board members are usually drawn from the more able segments of society, they approach increasingly difficult problems (new educational demands, growing activity of pressure groups, increasing teacher militancy, civil rights and racial disputes, collective bargaining, problems of financial support, and the procurement and allocation of federal funds) with little or no formal preparation for such responsibilities. For this reason the Department of Educational Administration and Supervision of the University of Wisconsin organized the clinics to help school boards analyze and solve  problems. Use of the \"clinical technique\" is demonstrated in mutual exploration and analysis of (1) professional negotiations and collective bargaining, (2) school board policies, (3) school policy development, (4) intergovernmental relations, (5) problems of school district operation, (6) changes in school government, (7) schools as a focus of social change, and (8) relations between school and society.

It is emphasized that supervision has a unique definition for each user. Supervision in America evolved out of a basic school pattern inherited from the European school system. The early definition and concept of this position was vague. The first type of supervision was that implied in the head teacher concept. Eventually the school boards organized committees to inspect the schools. From these committees a single individual emerged as the overseer of the schools. This in turn led to the position of the superintendent. The normal school, elementary school, and the school district were among the agencies that influenced the development of supervision. These institutions were  responsible for a number of varying supervisory positions or titles. (HW)",

Preparation involves recognizing the school system's  structure, collecting negotiation data, and assembling an updated negotiation data guidebook for each member of the team.

State-aided districts increase their expenditures to education only about 15 percent of the amount of the state aid, and reduce local tax levies by 85 percent. This substitution effect also accompanies federal aid to states. To meet this problem, Congress defines federal purposes and grants federal monies (categorical grants) only to accomplish these federally-defined purposes, which frequently differ from locally defined or state-defined purposes. The federally defined purposes are training manpower, increasing economic productivity, and increasing efficiency. One possible solution to the substitution effect would be to negotiate the budgets of local school districts at the state level, and to allow  the federal government to deal with the states on a general aid basis. However, a powerful new tool to increase the effectiveness of categorical grants is program planning and budgeting systems (PPBS). PPBS is a highly systematized common language which should speed the trend toward the centralization of decision making in education. (HW)",

The study demonstrated TAPE's utility for analysis in three areas: (1) Similarities and differences among colleges, (2) sources of strain within a college, and (3) sources of stress for individual students. Utilizing semantic differential techniques, TAPE required that six concepts be judged on 52 scales: College, self, students, faculty, administration, and ideal college. For each college  these ratings were correlated with six satisfaction items: Thinking of dropping out for nonacademic reasons, similarity of values to the faculty, agreement with administrative rules and regulations, feeling out of place at the college, academic satisfaction, and nonacademic satisfaction. A three-mode factor analysis of the data is explained and the study's implications are outlined for selection of a college and for regarding the college as a social system. (JK)",

Utilizing questionnaire response data from approximately 5,000 adults and 6,000 fifth and 11th grade students, the project analyzed problems of planned change in schools, evaluated the results of several strategies of planned change, formulated a set of variables relevant to understanding the operation of a school system, developed instruments for measuring each variable, and determined a concept of organizational self-renewal. Each of the four centers in which the investigators worked formulated and applied a specific strategy of planned change in two or more school systems. A number of case studies are reported,  based on detailed documentation and on reports prepared by special observers. One case study outlines the development of the interuniversity consortium which conducted the study. Examples of materials used in the study are appended.

Reading scores were (1) below grade level for grade 4 and at grade level for grade 3, (2) lowest on oral reading and highest on the Gates comprehension tests, and (3) below average for mental age, grade placement, and reading speed, but higher than average in accuracy. IQ was related positively with reading in relation to grade level, but negatively with reading in relation to mental age. The subjects made no excessive errors of any kind; error types and  the degree of visual defect did not differ significantly. However, children with refractive defects read less well than the other subjects. On the ITPA, the subjects performed significantly less well than normals n visual decoding, motor encoding, visual-motor sequential, and visual-motor association subtests, but did not differ on the auditory-vocal channel subtests. ITPA performance was related to eye condition only through the indirect effect of visual acuity. Reading achievement was positively correlated with the three ITPA subtests at the automatic-sequential level. Eight figures, 12 tables, four case histories, and 32 references are provided. (JD)",

Two matched groups of 42 subjects each, one with IQ's from 130 to 150, the other with IQ's between 90 and 110, completed the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) and the LaForge-Suczek Interpersonal Check List. Additional interpersonal ratings were secured from teachers and classmates. Results on interpersonal behavior indicated that the superior students were significantly higher in independent-dominant traits, aggressive-rebellious  traits, and responsible-cooperative traits. On the TAT average students expressed a higher proportion of themes of masochism-weakness and conformity-trust. On concepts of ideal traits a significantly larger number of average subjects fell above the median on the responsible-cooperative cluster. On all other items, superior students failed to differ significantly. It was thus concluded that factors other than intellect influence personal and social adjustment.

        "description":"The study analyzed teacher-pupil interaction in the classes of nine experimental (E) and eight control (C) teachers and their 167 mentally retarded pupils (mean age = 10.2, mean IQ = 68.76) The E-teachers were given 32 training sessions in an experimental curriculum and the inductive teaching method. Classes were tape recorded for 1 day. Analysis indicated that the distribution of the E-teachers' questions was cognitive-memory (88%), evaluative thinking (5%), convergent thinking (4%), and divergent thinking (3%). Significantly more (.001 level) cognitive-memory questions were asked by the teachers than any of the other three types of questions. A comparison of the experimental and control groups demonstrated that E-teachers did not ask significantly more productive thinking or  ask for significantly more evaluations after the students' incorrect answers than C-teachers, (2) there was less consistency for E-teachers' questions irrespective of subject matter areas, and (3) there were no significant differences between the E- and C-teachers' statements in the categories studied. Additional data on teacher and student characteristics are considered. Appendixes describe the Gallagher-Aschner Classification System and provide samples of teacher-pupil interactions demonstrating aspects of the inductive method. (JD)",

The sample consisted of 30 centers and their directors, 67 teachers, and 250 mothers. Responses on the schedule of child rearing practices indicated that parents used punitive methods more frequently, whereas teachers used restriction. Teachers were more consistent in their enforcement of discipline, modified their approach more according to the child's age, and were more interested in maintaining order and the smooth functioning of routine. Parents, on the other hand, had higher standards in areas of behavior with moral connotations. Because parents of low  economic status were stricter than other parents and had higher expectations of behavior, their children were most likely to experience alteration. Among centers, differences were found in the degree to which teachers would accept behavior and in the type and amount of direction adults should give to children's activities. Additional data concern ethnic groups and their standards, the interviewers, and the centers' clientele, personnel, emotional climate, and programs. Specific behaviors are detailed. Conclusions stress the director's role and the discrepancy between standards and practices. Two tables are provided. (JD)",

The sample was selected from the extremes of a population of 87 TMR classrooms on the basis of their teachers' high (tending to flexibility and harmony) or low (tending to rigidity and autocracy) scores on the Minnesota Teacher Attitude Inventory (MTAI). Trained observers visited each class for 2 hours and recorded the verbal interaction used more questions (p&lt;.01) and had more student response (p&lt;.05); low MTAI teachers used more lecture and criticism (p&lt;.05) and had more student initiated talk (p&lt;.01). Teacher attitudes and measures of accepting feeling, praise, using ideas, and giving  directions were not significant. Results did not yield unqualified support for the hypothesis that teachers' verbal behavior in the classroom can be predicted from MTAI scores because the stratification of teachers by MTAI scores indicated bias in the amount of teaching experience (the high subgroup had fewer years of teaching experience). A histogram compares the data with data from an earlier study using educable mentally retarded and normal subjects. Five tables and l6 references are provided. (AA)",

        "description":"To determine whether differences exist in their listening ability, 152 blind braille-reading and 2 sighted children in the intermediate grades were studied. Subjects were classified into three ability levels on the basis of their scores on individual IQ tests. The Listening Subtest of the Sequential Tests of Educational Progress was administered at rates of 175 and 225 words per minute with the four types of listening material: expository, narrative, direction, and aesthetic. The measured listening ability of the sighted subjects was generally superior to that of the blind (p=.05), with the sighted superior in listening to expository and narrative material. Intelligence was positively related to measured listening ability. Order of administration or type of school (special school  or integrated class) did not constitute a significant variable. Scores achieved at the regular rate were significantly higher than at the speeded rate (p=.01). Neither speededness nor intelligence acted selectively in influencing the scores of the blind and the sighted. Recommendations are made for education and research. A bibliography cites 83 items; 32 tables present data. (KH)",

        "description":"A battery of four psychomotor tests was developed and evaluated as a measure of the potential of mental patients of varying diagnoses for rehabilitation training. The tests were to be suitable for administration and interpretation by non-professional level technicians. The relationship between performance on the 5 days of tests and patient outcome 1 year later was studied in 996 patients of varied diagnoses. Results indicated that the major share of significant differences on psychomotor performance occurred between two clusters of diagnoses: schizophrenic, manic depressive, and personality disorder on one hand; and chronic brain syndrome plus mentally deficient on the other. Through multiple correlation and regression analyses, accuracy of test prediction was found to be 70 to  78% correct. However, variations in discharge rate and level of performance among diagnostic groups limited the use of a cut-off score suitable for all diagnoses, and the small number of cases per diagnosis prevented development of separate norms. It was concluded that an inverse relationship exists between quality of psychomotor performance and severity of mental disease (coefficient of multiple correlation = .50 to .65). The method developed has applications in the selection of patients for train ng. An 86-item bibliography, 46 tables, and 17 figures are provided. (Author/JD)",

Future enrollment and space needs, various curriculum program organizations, traffic, urban development problems involving the university and the adjoining community, and present campus facilities are evaluated. Seven alternative schemes are derived from the two basic concepts of campus planning, centralization and decentralization. Design proposals are evaluated and graphics are used to illustrate the proposals. Among the evaluation criteria for the two campus plans proposed (centralized and decentralized), are  decentralization of service courses, relationship of campus plans to the adjacent community, closing of campus streets to traffic, educational needs given planning priority, and automobile parking restricted to non academic campus areas.

Since a data bank already existed at the University of Wisconsin, a study of student housing needs could readily be undertaken by means of a computer. The study defines the status of the existing supply and demand in student housing in order to measure the significance of changes occurring over time in the past or to be expected in the future. With data gathered, solutions regarding student housing policy become more evident. Information can be used in estimating the demand for particular types of housing as well as for showing trends in student residence locations. An essential question is the degree to which private investment can be expected to supply the  shortage areas given the relationship between rent paying ability of the students and the profit opportunities for the investor. One preliminary result of the study is the selection of a reasonable construction plan, rent schedule, and investment value for each class of site if it were purchased at an estimated acquisition value.

Questionnaires submitted to principals and teachers suggested system needs for curriculum development, teacher training, educational resources, and supportive services. Specific recommendations for remedying system deficiencies were organized about a proposed city center for learning which  would serve students of all city schools by analyzing a student's individual characteristics, improving teacher competence, developing appropriate learning experiences, and providing materials to support those learning experiences.

The average not-for-credit enrollment each semester was 3,550 students. About 65% of those enrolled for credit completed their courses. The instructors, responding to the challenge of teaching by television, demonstrated that, through careful preparation and well-directed creativity, the necessary adaptations to televised instruction could be made. Teacher-student interaction was accomplished through mail-in conferences. Achievement test data collected in controlled experiments during the three years  showed that televised instruction was superior to conventional classroom instruction only for certain subjects and certain audiences. The cost per enrolled student was slightly higher for this program than for classroom teaching, but an expanded enrollment could bring the per-student cost below that of conventional classroom instruction. The televised instruction program enabled many persons, including homemakers and prisoners, to pursue a higher education. (RS)",

In this study, size was measured in terms of the visual angle subtended by the material, brightness was stated in foot-lamberts, and contrast was defined as the ratio of the difference between the brightness of the background and the object to the brightness of the background. The effects of these independent variables were assessed by exposing three seventh graders (one boy and two girls) to all 125 experimental conditions in 20 half hour sessions. The subjects matched patterns on the upper half of a slide with one of two on the lower half. The criterion measures were reaction time and correctness of response.  Brightness did not affect either of these criteria. However, reaction time tended to be shorter with an increase in visual angle and longer for minimal levels of contrast. Correct responses were largest for the middle value of visual angle and for higher levels of contrast. An inverse relationship between angle and contrast produced a maximum number of correct responses. Application of these results in the classroom is difficult in view of space and equipment limitations. (PM)",

        "description":"During the exploratory phase of this two-year project, 234 instructional computer programs were written by 167 junior and senior high school students, instructed as individuals, in small groups, and in whole classes. Then a doctoral study investigated the effectiveness of computer-assisted instruction in the development of problem solving skills. The study compared three conditions of learning from booklets, three conditions of computer training, and one untutored group in each of six eighth grade classes, all crossed on sex and two IQ levels (above and below the class average). Data analysis showed that students below the class IQ average of 113 who used a combination of two types of computer training materials out performed every other group in the three main problem solving  functions. A study of paired learners at different IQ levels used the same design as the doctoral study, but no significant results emerged. Negative results were also obtained from another small study which investigated ability changes in seventh grade students following experience in computer programing. Finally, two versions of the language COMPUTEST for the IBM 1620 and a conversational language for use on the IBM 360 remote terminals were developed. The dissertation provides the bulk of this document. (BB)",

        "description":"This information on financing educational television stations comes from a structured questionnaire answered by all ETV stations in the U.S. and from a conference of national educational broadcast leaders. In terms of ownership, there are 31 community stations, 32 university stations, 13 state stations, and 19 school stations. They average between nine and ten broadcast hours daily, five days per week, and they employ 2,445 persons on a full-time basis and 1,199 workers part-time. Annual incomes of the stations range from $50,000 to $2,500,000, with the average being $368,000. More than half of a station's financing normally comes in the form of direct, budgeted support from a parent organization, and a little less than one quarter comes from donations. Educational broadcasters  at the conference believed their industry's financial problems could be improved by: (1) partial support from the federal government for community service programs; (2) the use of public funds for the endowment of stations; (3) greater support for new agencies, exchange libraries, national programing sources, and different programing approaches; and (4) the establishment of a national fund-raising organization, a national commission for intensive study of ETV, and a national citizens' advisory committee. The conference also concluded that taxes, license fees, and pay-as-you-view systems are not feasible means of support. (JO)",

Ten experimental groups were formed in which the 351 subjects viewed motion pictures and still slides accompanied by supplementary, redundant, directive, question-posing, and nonlinear narration. The posttest-only experimental design specified no control group. Two weeks after the experiment a composite intellectual ability test was administered in hopes of using the scores from it with the data from the experiment to improve predictions of performance for audiovisual materials. No differences in total amount of learning were revealed for the entire group, for either audio or visual variables.  Analysis revealed that students in the low mental ability group scored lowest on presentations that posed questions and that high ability students performed best on treatments with supplementary narration and poorest on question-posing treatments. Only on the knowledge portion of the posttest were there significant differences in learning, favoring the directive, redundant, and supplementary audio styles. A qualitative analysis using the semantic differential showed that motion pictures were more positively received than still pictures. (OH)",

Almost 250 seventh graders were stratified for  intelligence and randomly assigned to the six treatments. Each treatment consisted of a stimulus series of 15 nouns, followed by 40 items from which the respondent had to select the original items.

This study sought (1) to compare videotape recordings of lectures with live lectures, (2) to determine whether the quality of videotape affects achievement scores, and (3) to investigate the interaction effects of test validity, students' ability and age, and number of presentations of the lecture. Lecture effectiveness was defined as the ability to explicate ideas to students so that they are able to answer questions about these ideas. The complete factorial design initially included 20 groups of about 20 students each. Analysis of covariance of criterion test scores showed that high scores were  correlated with the viewing of videotapes of high quality and with the viewing of effective lectures by high ability students. Repetition of the same lecture on videotape intensified the variations in lecture effectiveness. It was concluded that his experiment offers a partial validation for the use of videotape to represent live classroom lectures in research on lecture effectiveness. (LH)",

Interaction effects between learner traits, learning objectives, and a film's attributes should be expected, since each attribute contributes to a different aspect of the film's message, thus creating an effect unique to that particular film. Attributes should be specified first in technical, or \"structural,\" terms and then in functional terms. Functional terms limit the number of attributes to those expected to have psychological effects on the viewer and specify the task to be performed in response tothe film. There are two approaches to functional descriptions, one through  information theory and one through psycholinguistics, and both are supported by research. However, the psycholinguistic approach assumes that different films share a commo language structure. This approach is logical in nature nd deals with the kinds of informat on presented, whereas the information theory approach is empirical in nature and deals mainly with the quantity of informat on presented.

Both state and federal legislation have provided impetus for instructional television, which now reaches more than a third of California's public school population. Fourteen stations, commercial and non-commercial, transmit over 200 programs for classroom use. Approximately 109 schools, primarily elementary, utilize closed-circuit television, including Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS), a sophisticated system capable of linking several schools. Portable video tape recorders are also being used in the closed-circuit systems. Local taxation is the main  source of funds for ITV, although there is reimbursement from the state on a matching basis. Assistance in paying capital costs is available under a series of federal education acts begun in 1958. The most significant development in ITV organizational structure has been the regional advisory group with its core of curriculum committees. Within the State Department of Education, responsibility for ITV rests with the Bureau of Audio-Visual and School Library Education. Along with the Department, school personnel share responsibility for further developing instructional television. (PM)",

Television can serve the needs of inquiry, especially visual (as opposed to verbal) inquiry, if it can be made flexible enough to bring data into the classroom at the instant needed for making decisions or asking questions. Television will not replace the teacher because it cannot provide all the conditions needed to sustain the process of inquiry, but it can bring into the class room a pre-packaged and empirically validated instructional program. The teacher's task is then one of following up the television presentation by continuing inquiry in the classroom. Much imagination will be needed in designing effective instructional television programs,  for the strength of such programs must lie in the stimulation of the thought processes within the learner, rather than in the pre-packaged presentation of a neatly and completely formulated explanation of all the data presented. Ideally, television should show the learner things he has not seen before, things that will make him sit up and take notice. To puzzle is indispensable. (RS)",

Over 300 non-music majors in three classes were rated at one of 10 levels according to their performance on a music achievement test and then assigned at random to six treatment groups and a control group for each class. The evaluative devices used following treatment were tests for five specific skills, a follow-up test for transfer, and a preference inventory. Results  indicated that the programed materials increased the students' perception of musical form in the works studied to a significantly greater degree than did the conventional materials. But there was no significant indication that the programed materials led to greater transfer of learning than did the conventional materials. Preferences for particular compositions were not affected by studying the programs. The students indicated on a questionnaire that they preferred the programmed materials to the conventional ones.

Topics under consideration included educational objectives, the historical and sociological background for the technological revolution in education, the need for the development and implementation of systems for general access to the collections of major libraries, and the potential applications in education of various scientific advancements, particularly in the realm of computers. Computers hold great promise as a means of individualizing instruction. But computer-assisted instruction is still in the experimental stage, and its  widespread use in elementary and secondary schools remains some years away. Computerizing American schools will be an extremely expensive venture, with a large portion of the outlays going toward the purchase of machinery and the development of programs to be used. Complete re-education of teachers and school administrators will be necessary to enable them to cope with the evaluation and selection of computer-input material. The specific role of the teacher is yet to be defined. Much research needs to be done on the learning process, considering not only how to teach children, but what to teach them. (BB)",

Schools selected on the basis of interest, location, budget, and size were a signed to one of three conditions. Plan A, used in 40 schools, was a breadth approach to dissemination, involving a multi-media demonstration, workshops, and team visitations. Plan B, a depth approach used in eight schools, involved an evaluation of audiovisual programs, a 12 week course in media utilization, and a follow-up consultation service. Non-host schools acted as controls. The four measuring instruments were a facilities checklist, an attitude inventory, and two questionnaires. Results are based  on data collected during the two year project and analyzed only for schools participating f r the duration of the project. These measures indicated an increase in the number of audiovisual directors, an increased willingness to buy equipment, a liberalization of buying policies, an increase in clerical assistance and in quantities of materials, and a favorable change in teacher opinions. Data also indicated a difference between administrators' and teachers' attitudes. No clear evidence supported one plan over the other, suggesting the need for both. (JO)",

Since 1963 at Stanford a study has been made of programing a total curriculum for elementary mathematics, grades one through six, and for reading, grades one and two. Mathematics curricula for grades one and for half of grades two and four have been completed. Computer technology provides the only serious hope for the accommodation of individual differences in subject-matter learning; it can relieve the teachers of routine record-keeping, thus allowing them to attend to the more important tasks of trouble-shooting and instructing children who need individual attention. Finally, computers offer  the chance to gather adequate amounts of research data under uniform conditions. The main problems encountered and envisaged are machine reliability, stimulus deprivation, costs of equipment, difficulty in communicating appropriate audio messages to the pupils, and, ultimately, the temptation to settle for less than the best curriculum because of programing problems.

Direct teaching by television was used for demonstrations in two engineering courses, for teaching presentations in Health and Hygiene Department courses, and for special presentations in several other courses. Television observation techniques were used in education courses which normally required school visitations by the students, and in courses such as Child Psychology and Child Growth and Development. The system consisted of a central station and 27 receiver stations, with cables to the schools to be observed.

        "description":"Even though response latency can vary greatly among subjects and from trial to trial for the same subject, latency as a measure of associate strength might be useful in connection with response frequency to measure degree of learning. The effects on latency and learning of two task variables--training procedure (anticipation vs. recall) and information transmission (amount of information required for errorless responding)--were investigated using a factorial design. Several aspects of latency as a possible basis for instructional decisions were studied: the \"TLE,\" or trial of last error, i.e., the trial immediately preceding the correct criterion response of N successive errorless trials; the correctness of response; item difficulty, individual differences, and the TLE; maximum  response latency on the TLE; and errors made subsequent to the first correct response. A series of eight stimuli that transmitted different amounts of information were presented to the 96 subjects on the display screen of an on-line computer. Subjects responded via a keyboard, which also gave them feedback. The main conclusion from many interesting results was that latency is not a sensitive measure of associative strength during the pre-TLE period, but it may well be an accurate measure during overlearning, after the TLE.

Order of presentation of two films covering different subjects provided the transfer task. Practice was introduced by five repetitions of the films, interspersed among six repetitions of an immediate criterion achievement test. The control subjects took only the achievement test on six occasions. Despite methodological obstacles inherent in a repeated measures anlaysis, the following general observations were made. Film repetitions continued to produce significant increments in achievement after three showings, whereas test repetition alone did not produce significant improvement. Although no consistent patterns of test score  correlations across trials were evident, the correlations did suggest a positive transfer relation that represented underlying aptitude variables other than content knowledge. These variables were related to general verbal facility, but not to memory span tasks or tests, nor to figural or symbolic cognition. Intrafilm correlations fluctuated very little, however, even though some abilities appeared to be more related to one film than to the other. (LH)",

Also stressed are the indications that in the learning of the mother tongue, meaning is acquired after there is familiarity and automatic control over basic linguistic structures.

Between 57.2 and 69% of the technician's time was being spent in communicative skills--originating letters (6%), writing technical articles (11%), reading technical articles (10.1%), and oral communication (30.1%)--with the balance being spent in manual or purely technical tasks. The study showed that English courses were geared toward secretaries, auditors, or accountants rather than technicians.  Little attention was given to reading development, speech, oral and written technical reporting, vocabulary, composition, spelling, or parts of speech. In the proposed program, the first semester includes two weeks of instruction in the writing of business letters, four weeks in developmental reading, and 12 weeks in speech. The second includes instruction solely in the areas of oral and written technical reporting. (DG)",

Respondents participating in the survey numbered 551 firms employing a total of 153,886 persons. Results showed that some medical auxiliary technologies, if offered as 2-year college programs, would fulfill a genuine educational need in the metropolitan area--especially the need for licensed practical nurses, associate degree nurses, medical secretaries, medical technicians, and psychiatric aides. In addition to secretarial openings, business  firms indicated a need for persons trained in accounting, electronic data processing, food management, executive administration, real estate, and personnel management. In the applied science technologies it became apparent that a need existed for trained personnel in printing and graphic arts, electronic technology, engineering drafting and design, civil technology, and several other fields. Three classifications of public service needs were reported: (1) law enforcement, (2) library assisting, and (3) recreational leadership. About 25% of the firms indicated an interest in working with the college in establishing relevant educational programs. (DG)",

        "description":"This summary of a study of salary and fringe benefits provides guidelines for considering teacher compensation in relation to academic rank, length of service, teaching load, and other conditions. Forty-two institutions, in three groups, supplied data: (1) all public and private colleges in Cuyahoga County, (2) all public colleges and universities in Ohio, and (3) a nationwide selection of multi-campus junior colleges. This is not a comprehensive salary study, but is directed to specific aspects of the meaning of &quot;salary&quot; and to the difference between salary schedules and salaries actually paid. It also points out that salary is only one form of compensation, others being retirement benefits, medical insurance, tuition waiver, and life insurance, all in varying amounts. A few  other statistically negligible prerequisites were noted, such as sabbatical leave and low-rent housing. The data are shown in tables and can be applied to consideration of either a rank-based compensation schedule or a step-based schedule with superimposed rank. Most junior colleges seem to be developing the latter kind of schedule. (HH)",

Responses were analyzed in regard to six main variables: sex, age, type of high school attended, plans to continue education, previous college attendance, and grade point average. When the percentage of responses of particular groups to an item showed considerable variance, the data were subjected to analysis through the chi square technique for determining statistical significance. The report contains background characteristics of the college's 1967 graduates, and investigation of the students' future plans, patterns of financial support, and an analysis of the graduates' attitudes toward the institution. It was found that  (1) almost 9 out of 10 graduates would return to CCC if they had it to do over, (2) more than a third of the graduates attended other institutions of higher education prior to attendance at CCC, (3) more than 80% of the graduates intended to transfer to one of four 4-year institutions in Ohio, (4) almost one in five received financial aid from the college, and (5) students cited the competence and friendliness of the faculty as the characteristics of the college which they liked best.

Increasing percentages of women in the labor force will continue during the last half of the 20th century. Implications for junior colleges are inherent in such developments. Along with the demand for additional post-secondary training has come a rapid increase in college enrollments--too rapid for many existing colleges and fostering the establishment of new ones. Typically, community college students are less bookish and read less than do university students, are from lower income families, and tend to make vocational and educational decisions later than those who attend 4-year institutions. With the sudden growth of  post-secondary institutions, a critical and growing shortage of professional personnel has appeared--particularly in engineering, business education, psychology, and vocational subjects. Not only must more teachers be recruited, but more teachers must be obtained who understand the characteristics of the students they are to teach, the institution's functions, and the teacher's adjustments necessary for effective functioning within the organization's milieu. The author lists some of the more pressing needs of community colleges and suggests appropriate responses. (DG)",

John Dale Russell discussed higher education finance, calling attention to the need for educators to use greater efficiency in the process of higher education and for legislators to increase the financial support of higher education in their respective states. Robert E. Smylie made the point that education shapes society. He appealed to the universities to provide public administrators to help solve the problems of society. Jack M.

(2) Logan Wilson maintained that higher education has become too crucial  to the general welfare for its development to be left entirely in local hands, and he therefore endorsed the trend toward statewide coordination. Observing that there has been a shift from voluntary to legislated coordination, he traced the historical development of state coordinating agencies. (3) Thomas B. Merson summarized the conference proceedings, cited conference gaps, and considered the question of whether a separate governing board for junior colleges in Washington should be created. Regarding the latter, he urged primarily that such a board not reduce local control and autonomy. (DG)",

The study  revealed that between 1965 and 1980 the total population of the county would increase from approximately 1.7million to 2.2 million (22%), the college-age population would increase from 111,000 to 149,000 (35%), there would be a 43% increase in the number of persons desiring education at the college level in the county, and there would be more than 50,000 full-time and part-time students for whom there were no accommodations presently planned. Results of the study indicated that during each of the five years immediately following, from four to 19% of the county's high school graduates would attend CCC. (DG)",

Initially, the orientation program was structured for eight groups of students meeting in six voluntary sessions with emphasis being placed on increased intellectual demands of college, use of library facilities, knowledge of one's interests and aptitudes, value of career planning, and specific offerings at  shoreline. Attendance records were kept for five of the groups so that the relationship between the number of sessions attended, cumulative high school grade point averages, and first quarter college grades could be explored. For four or more of the six sessions, 43% of the freshmen attended the sessions. Four of the recommendations made as a result of the study were (1) to decrease the number of sessions to three, (2) to discontinue administering the SSHA, (3) to place greater stress on specific Shoreline program offerings, both in the transfer and vocational-technical programs, and (4) to add emphasis to career planning.

Student scales were administered to 4,402 students in classes taught by 87 different instructors. Simultaneously an instructor characteristics scale was administered in each of the classes. The study showed that student ratings are not influenced even by variables such as grades previously earned from the instructor being rated, that ratings were different among various departments within the School of Education, and that younger instructors received higher ratings than older instructors in each category.

Twenty % of the freshmen scored at or below the 10.5 grade level, the cut-off point used by the R-S.

Advisory committee members were selected who, in turn, recommended contact persons in each community to assist in locating teacher-trainees, places to conduct sessions, and program onsultants. Communities chosen to participate in the project were narrowed to Lakeland, Winter Haven, Bartow, Fedhaven, and Nalcrest, Teacher-trainees (varying from housewives to college professors), who subsequently were appointed to the college's  part-time staff, selected topics of interest to the senior citizens. Two-hour seminars were held twice weekly for a 6-week period. Trainees served as forum coordinators and discussion leaders. Consultants (college faculty and specialists from the local area as well as from state and county agencies) gave lectures and/or demonstrations. Attendance reached approximately 100 per session, with 500 to 600 attending the meetings on a regular basis.

Glenn Leggett of Grinnell College spoke of the need to unite special and general education. More independent study in the sophomore year and interdisciplinary seminars at the senior level would help delay the choice of major, thus providing exposure to several disciplines and a consequent keener discrimination between alternatives. Lewis B. Mayhew of Stanford University felt that, if present conditions and attitudes are not radically changed, undergraduate education will not improve in the next 15 years. He listed current faulty approaches to curriculum development. He also pointed out areas where programs do not accommodate present national and international problems , and outlined the  principles on which courses could be reorganized for greater relevancy. Joseph Tussman of Berkeley described in detail a current experimental program, the core of which is a sequence of readings, clustered about certain periods in Western civilization. the readings, in turn, serve as a focus for serious writing and discussion. The coherence of the program is reinforced by lectures, student/faculty conferences as required, and informal activities. It is intended that the freedom thus cultivated will be \"the freedom of mastery, not of impulse.\" Three panel members expressed their objections and agreements, and speculated on the feasibility of the usefulness of the program for other institutions.

Faculty ratings by students have stimulated self-improvement where the criticisms, both positive and negative have been seriously considered. Students' ratings tend to favor teachers coming directly from graduate school and with some background in professional education. Retired military personnel do as well as others in general junior college teaching and usually better in science and mathematics. Attendance at graduate school, rather than reliance on military rank, enhances their status as applicants for teaching positions. Classroom observation, student  accomplishments, student ratings, and followup studies of graduates teachers also stress the importance of good supervision and departmental leadership. They believe that attendance at in-service workshops and at local and national meetings, reduced teaching loads, and better guidance programs would improve their teaching. (HH)",

At Southern Illinois, interns are assigned to master teachers to learn the mode of operation of a nearby junior college district and to gain a better understanding of the philosophy, organization, and functions  of student personnel services. South Florida has been involved in a cooperative project with four other institutions. Six participants from each institution are selected for the course in wh ch they get to visit, know, stimulate, and criticize their conferees in other institutions.

Therefore there is a need to study the process of communication as a science and to analyze this process in order to understand how one may improve his own communication abilities. Fundamental elements of communication are (1) the person who speaks, 92) the speech he produces, and (3) the person who listens. In the relationship between a college library and the vocational-technical program, the librarian must determine how he wants to affect his receiver and must be sensitive to four kinds of factors within the source which will eliminate all elements that interfere with the intended message: (1) communications skills (writing and speaking, reading and listening), (2)  attitudes, (3) knowledge level, and (4) social-cultural system. As messages travel through these channels they must be encoded and to improve communication, should have the proper attitude toward and knowledge of the vocational-technical education field, should provide students and faculty with an adequate orientation program, should select materials with care, and should keep the library open during the evening hours when many of the students have the most opportunity to use the facilities.

For this he must have a precise job description to determine whether the career fits his abilities and interests and whether the training required for it is within his time and money limits. Librarians must acquire this information for the counselors and students, not only from the standard sources, but also directly from industry, so that it will be accurate and up to date. The second need is for instructional material at an appropriate level of college specialization. This, too, should come from business and industry, probably  best through the advisory committees for various job clusters.

An innovative program designed to meet this need was introduced at St. Gregory's College. The course dealt with the history and the grammar of the medium, the film in relation to other art forms, and the film as an artistic esthetic experience. Methods of instruction included lectures, screening of films, discussions in groups and as an entire class, and reading and summarizing film reviews. The class met three hours a week for 16 weeks. Projects were the preparation of portfolios containing critic and student film reviews or the preparation of a 5- to 10-minute film  grammar and technique. At the conclusion of the course, the 42 students were asked to evaluate the objectives, film selections, and course content. All students agreed that the proposed objectives had been accomplished. With few exceptions, the students agreed that the films screened adequately represented the academic area under study. As a result of the evaluation it was decided that (1) the attempt to offer a comparative study of the film in relation to other art forms should be eliminated, (2) the order in which the material was presented should be altered, and (3) more concentration should be given to the era of the 1930's.

Conclusions based on the investigation were (1) the programed material did a creditable job of teaching many items in the workbook, (2) instruction in the classroom did not seem to have much effect on learning when  the instruction covered the same material as was found in the textbook, and (3) instruction which supplemented the details found in the textbook and which dealt with concepts appeared to help in the understanding of the applications of the mechanics of grammar.

The effectiveness of this instructional technique versus conventional instruction was tested by using a 2-tailed t-test on student performance. Also student interest was assessed via questionnaire.

A committee, comprised of junior college administrators, health facility administrators, and national health practitioners, developed a guide which (1) outlines procedures and informational sources to be used in planning health technology programs, (2) defines the roles of junior colleges, health practitioner associations, and health facilities, and (3) indicates cooperatively and individually performed tasks which lend support to the growth of quality education programs in the health technologies. The guide was partially  validated by testing the role delineations in large reaction groups and through evaluation by a sample of the participants at a Chicago conference on health education. The guide was determined to be usable and to deal with many recognized problems confronting those who begin health technology programs in junior colleges.

Areas of research emphasized most often were: (1) student characteristics (in various correlations), (2) faculty, (3) instruction, (4) curriculum and programs, (5) student personnel services, (6) institutional operations, and (7) other topics such as campus environment, drug use, and testing. The four most frequent approaches to research were: (1) observational studies from records or surveys, (2) group comparisons by  matched characteristic, by random selection, or by natural or existing group, (3) correlational studies for improvement of prediction and counseling. This report examines 25 recent studies, taken from 28 reports, with comments on the methodology and results of each. (All 28 reports are available from ERIC.) They are reviewed nder the following headings: (1) students, (2) teachers, (3) programs and instruction, and (4) student services.

It was given by open-circuit TV simultaneously to high school seniors and junior college freshmen in the hope that, in subsequent years, there would be fewer inadequately prepared freshmen and that more could enroll immediately in college-level English. Students (from six high schools) with scores in the upper and lower limits for college admission were randomly assigned to fall-semester experimental and control groups. The control group received the regular senior English course. The experimental groups, both high school and college, received the lessons by TV. The college control group was selected from students enrolled in both remedial English and  basic reading. Course content emphasized reading proficiency, language usage, and composition. The direction of change generally favored the experimental group in the high schools. The college groups showed no significant difference in the upward movement. A 3-semester followup study of the high school students' grades in later college English courses showed no significant difference in either level of class attempted or quality of performance. Both the college groups showed the same lack of significant difference. (HH)",

Fifty trainees from 11 states took part in day-long sessions covering research methodology and design, statistical analysis, computer technology, and the writing of research reports. The report discusses the process of recruiting trainees, characteristics of the trainee groups, and the purposes and program of the institute. Strengths noted in the evaluation include (1) timeliness of the training, (2)  advantages of the intense review, (3) merits of the practical focus, (4) competence of the staff, (5) trainees' sense of responsibility, (6) their responsiveness, (7) merits of the projects submitted by the trainees, and (8) an opportunity to improve competence in computer use. Major difficulties stemmed from late approval of the project. Trainees recommended that future institutes be at least four weeks, that instruction allow for differences in their preparation time and experience, and that more time be given to problem-oriented instruction. Each trainee developed a research project to do at his own college in the 1966-67 year. (HH)",

Each system is capable of operating at minimum cost by using a single voice-grade telephone line. In this report the operating principles and characteristics of each model are described and the reliability and copy quality assessed. Costs are compared and tabulated for equipment, supplies, and telephone line service in two hypothetical library systems, one comprising two libraries and the other, ten libraries. It is concluded that all three of these makes  of equipment perform with sufficient reliability and copy quality for most library purposes.

        "description":"A processing center which would meet both the cataloging and acquisitions needs of the public libraries of New York state has been proposed. Described in this report is the acquisition system, which provides for handling of both items received on standing order and items received separately. The state center obtains information as early as possible about new titles likely to be ordered by libraries in the system. Each new title is then assigned a number, usually the Library of Congress card number, and entered into the computer system with the appropriate descriptive information. Thereafter, ordering and other procedures are done by refering to the item number whenever possible. Requisition lists are produced describing each new title in the system from which most of the ordering  is done. A supplier is assigned automatically after the requests are returned, and orders to the supplier, receiving worksheets and process control reports are generated. The latter two are used to communicate with the decentralized processing centers about shipments to be received and processing to be done. An accounting system is provided as well as preparation of a cataloging work sheet and of spine, book-card, and book-pocket labels, and catalog cards. Discussed in detail are the input and output forms as well as the relationship of the acquisition procedures to the cataloging procedures. (CM)",

        "description":"The logic of the system presented in this report is divided into five parts for computer processing and manipulation. They are: (1) incorporating publication information and Library of Congress catalog copy into the system, (2) processing of authority files and assignment of supplier, (3) preparing data for cataloging and acquisitions, (4) ordering, invoicing, and library billings and payment, and (5) producing reports, worksheets, orders, bills, and statements and checks. None of these parts are independent of the other; successive parts feed back recycling information to earlier logical units. Having only one input point and one output point in the system provides an advantage in minimizing operations complexity. The system is designed to make extensive use of bibliographic  information received in machine readable form. The following information is provided in this volume about the computer operation of the cataloging system: (1) the flow chart of the computer runs and the associated input and output, (2) a narrative description of the functioning ofthe system, (3) the file content and record derivation specification for every data file, (4) the record content sheets for each record format used by the system, (5) the derivation of the output fields from the proper input fields, and (6) two sets of parameters which define options available to the user and options available within the system for each run.

        "description":"A batch-mode, computer-based, serials system was developed for the bio-medical library, a departmental library at the University of Minnesota. Patterned after the &quot;arrival card&quot; system now in use in several libraries, it is designed so that serial check-in is done by marking off the issue on a printed list of serial issues expected during the month, based upon predictions made by the computer. Any gifts or unexpected issues or supplements (about 20% of the total) which do not appear on the check-in list are handled by use of a serial check-in form. This information is added to the master file and at the end of the month corrections to the prediction codes, if necessary, are made. Other monthly printouts are: (1) a serials master list which contains all the information collected  about each serial title (7800 in all), (2) a patron holdings list, a list to be used by patrons containing less information than the previous list, and (3) bindery list of items for which volumes are completed. The first two lists are supplemented by daily cumulative supplements prepared from the daily input cards made when a serial issue arrives. A cost analysis made in connection with the pro ect shows that the average cost per transaction is $0.71 in the new system. (CM)",

The basis for the study is 1965-66 data which was obtained from annual reports, field visits to district-center libraries, regional resource centers and a sample of local libraries, interviews, and questionnaires sent to users. Findings show that there has been both qualitative and quantitative growth and that many librarians, trustees and legislators are committed to the existing plan. However, state financial support has just recently reached the specified level and Pennsylvania libraries are not realizing  their full potential. Proposals for improvement introduce new concepts in the governmental and tax base for public libraries, in the structure of library service in sparsely settled districts and metropolitan areas, in the State Library's regulatory role, and in relations between libraries and among types of libraries. Immediate steps call for a coordinated public information campaign, intensified library planning using this report as a starting point, preparation for seeking new legislation with a concurrent review of Pennsylvania library laws, and a periodic evaluation of progress and problems by the State Library.

A cost analysis was made for several different degrees of usage of the equipment, taking into account staff time, equipment costs and supplies, and the general set of conditions which must exist before the LDX system is used to advantage was found. From the preliminary analysis the following  conclusions were reached: (1) the LDX system appears to be capable of providing rapid, high-quality transmission of printed pages rom one library to another, with elapsed time for each transaction averaging 2.5 hours instead of the week or more typically required; (2) the cost of an LDX system precludes its use in libraries at current interlibrary photoduplication service levels; and (3) there is great potential of expanding access to existing large serials collections by establishing an LDX network serving several libraries, each with smaller collections of the more frequently used titles.

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine the employment possibilities for graduates of the library technology program offered at Sauk Valley College, Dixon, Illinois. Because a junior college has a major obligation to serve the needs of the local area, the study was limited to the elementary and secondary schools, hospitals, public libraries and several large industries located within the area served by the college. Based upon an analysis of questionnaires returned by these institutions, it was concluded that there is an apparent need for a library technology program in the Sauk Valley area, that there are enough positions available for graduates of the program to find employment, and that elementary schools seem to offer the best employment opportunities. Recommendations for further  study include: (1) more research to determine the relationship between the size of th institutions and their willingness to employ library technicians and (2) an investigation to determine the educational background and work experience desirable for technicians. Appended are a 43 item bibliography, a list of the institutions covered, the questionnaire used for the study, and a brochure describing the Sauk Valley library technician program. (JB)",

In addition to a recommendation for a centralized data collection agency, a coordinated program for library development is suggested that involves: (1) an increase in the number of professional librarians in all types of libraries, (2) expansion of Ohio library education facilities, (3) integrating Ohio librarianship more fully into national activities, and (4) a re-examination of the organization and administration of libraries and library  systems. Methods of increasing the number of librarians and improving library education programs are suggested for school and academic libraries. Recommendations for public libraries involve classification of the goals of public library service, participation in federal programs, a central source for manpower information, continuing education for librarians, and participation in national library events.

A survey team collected basic data on the state's libraries, conducted an in-depth survey of representative public libraries, examined library resources, analyzed the state economy in relation to public libraries, determined current and projected needs for adequate library service, and formulated recommendations. Survey methods included interviews, analysis of printed data, and an examination of multi-county and single library units. It was concluded that public and school libraries and the State Library need much development, while college and university libraries seem to be improving  and special libraries are good. The over-all library plan suggested involves: neighborhood libraries, bookmobile service, cooperation between school and neighborhood libraries, library systems, upgrading school libraries, strengthening the State Library, making resources of college and university libraries available to all libraries, connecting headquarters libraries to the State Library by a teletype system, a facsimile reproduction system to link the State Library and university libraries, and state aid to libraries.

Using data collected from librarians in thirteen large public libraries and faculty in twelve library schools, a taxonomy of educational objectives for the preparation of public service personnel was compiled. Curricular content from participating library schools was also analyzed and compared to the desirable educational objectives. In addition to needed factual knowledges, desirable areas of higher intellectual achievement were identified, including comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Findings  indicated that (1) librarians placed high priority on complex skills and abilities, (2) needed subject matter, related but not unique to librarianship, was not included in some library school curricula, (3) most factual knowledges regarding librarianship were adequately taught, and (4) the development of higher intellectual skills and abilities, above factual knowledge, was relatively neglected in the courses required for all students in the Master's Degree Program.

The sample consisted of 117 children of lower socioeconomic class from kindergartens of representative inner-city, lower class schools. Tests administered were the Object-Picture Categorization Test, a Haptic Test, and the Motor Encoding Test. Results indicate that classification training does enhance  the child's ability to employ grouping and scorable responses, as well as increase the variety of criteria by which to classify.

Four- and five-year-old Negro, Puerto Rican, and Caucasian children attended six classrooms staffed by three master teachers and 22 student teachers. About ll5 children participated. The program schedule was of a typical nursery school or kindergarten pattern. Weekly meetings of the parents of the pupils were held in order to improve their understanding of the objectives of the program and to increase their sense of responsibility in preparing their children for the school experience. The pupils were tested at the beginning and end of the program. This data showed the existence of encouraging  improvement in terms of the pupils' readiness to enter kindergarten. Not only did it appear that the program enriched the educational skills of the pupils, but it provided a significant student-teaching experience for the 22 college students.

The self-social symbols tasks developed to measure these components require the subject to relate himself to the social environment and are primarily nonverbal in character. Four studies were conducted within this theoretical framework. Study I investigated the relation between self-concept and social desirability in 50 sixth grade white children. Study II considered the relation between self-concept and geographic mobility in 219 eighth grade  students. Study III investigated developmental changes in self-concepts during adolescence based on a sample of 420 sixth through twelfth grade students. Study IV compared the self-other orientations of 100 Indian children from 10 to 14 years of age with 100 American children in the sixth through eighth grades.

An anxiety-by-memory support interaction occurred in the number of errors made prior to solving the marble puzzle, as predicted, but did not occur in the Porteus maze task. It was suggested that anxiety's interference with short-term memory could be offset by a variety of external aids, such as diagrams or notational systems, which problem solvers could be taught to use.

The purpose of the present research was (1) to develop further the new instrument by giving it an initial trial on a substantial number of subjects, (2) to select and revise the test items on the basis of item analysis, and (3) to identify the factorial structure underlying the preschool childrens' responses. This study was conducted in Hawaii and involved 4- and 5-year -old children. Of the 182 subjects, 114 attended Head Start classes and 68 attended private preschools. The test instrument consisted of 200 items, each composed of a pair of figures and a short situational setting. The two figures in the item represented different responses to the situation.  The child was told the situation and asked to choose the response he would make. Each response had a different motivational overtone. Thus, an evaluation of all of the child's responses provided an indication of his motivational structure. The item analysis of the data led to the elimination of 100 unnecessary items. The factorial structure was tentatively mapped, and data will be gathered to explore the validity of the instrument. Research is being planned to use this instrument to teach motivation to preschoolers. (WD)",

The Bereiter-Engelmann approach involves concentration upon the development of language skills and facility with basic sentence usage. The teachers who participated in the summer training program were each then assigned a summer Head Start class. The 49 experimental pupils were administered an experimental language curriculum. A control group of 20 children received a more extensive but less intensive Bereiter-Engelmann language curriculum. A group of analog tasks was developed to complement the basic learning tasks of the experimental program. The analog  tasks, as distinguished from the basic tasks, involved only nonverbal responses. The pupils of both conditions were administered the School Readiness Tasks as posttests. The results showed that on most tasks there was no significant difference between the performance of the experimental and control groups. (WD)",

A session lasted from 5 to 15 minutes and concerned control over the verbal responses of the children with token-operated reinforcement devices. In order to make the results of the experimental sessions meaningful, an attempt was made to describe the entering verbal repertoires of the children by observing vocalizations outside and within the sessions. The objectives of the experiment were different for children of different ages. The four children under 22 months of age at the beginning of the project were involved in the elicitation of echoic responses only. It was found that it was possible to elicit complex or multicomponent echoic responses by  strengthening each of the components separately. For the three older children, 30 months of age or more, the goal was to expand the verbal capacity of the child beyond acquisition of mere arbitrary echoic responses to the acquisition of more meaningful utterances. The results were encouraging that such a goal is practicable. Teachers and parents can and should be trained in the strategies of eliciting vocal verbal responses from young children. (WD)",

        "description":"Previous experiments with nursery school children have suggested that (1) subjects of preschool age do not verbalize during transfer learning or that (2) for these subjects, self-produced verbal cues have little influence on the learning process. To investigate the relative merits of these alternative positions, research was conducted among 80 nursery school children in Champaign and Urbana, Illinois. The subjects were assigned discrimination tasks with stimuli varying in either brightness or size. Half of the subjects were required to verbalize their choices. The others responded throughout the experiment without speaking. Confirmation was found for the preliminary postulates that verbalization would cause most subjects to use brightness labels to describe the stimulus  regardless of the dimension and that verbalization would significantly facilitate performance on the brightness dimension. Contrary to prediction, however, verbalization did not interfere with performance on the size dimension. The results of this research suggest that, for nursery school children, size discrimination is determined by proprioceptive feedback and is not, therefore, greatly influenced by verbalization. Detailed methodological and theoretical discussions are included in this research report and statistics are reported in five tables. (JS)",

Meetings were held to teach parents to reinforce children's school experience and to strengthen the adults' own self-concepts. Inservice teacher workshops were also held. A language program pilot study was conducted in eight of the centers. Data were collected by means of a questionnaire filled out by preschool staff personnel, an experimental test battery administered to a sample of the preschoolers, teacher reports on parent meetings, the children's medical service records, and other test  results. A significant result was that at almost all age levels, the preschool sample exceeded the norms means gains of a former pilot study group in language achievement. The results suggest that the preschool center program be continued with emphasis on a multisensory approach to curriculum and language functioning, that staff inservice workshops be continued, and that parent education meetings stress curriculum and program activities which the children were experiencing.

Children in the Frostig Experimental and Control Centers were pretested and posttested with the Marianne Frostig Developmental Test of Visual Perception. Children in the Doman Delacato Experimental and Control Centers were pretested and posttested for lateral and visual dominance in three areas: handedness, footedness, and eyedness. The methods used in the Bereiter Experimental Center were  prescribed by the Bereiter curriculum. Teachers and aides filled out evaluative questionnaires. Test gains of Head Start center pupils were compared to gains of children in centers using curricular modifications. The total population showed improvement at the .01 level of significance on these variables: vocabulary, total school readiness, achievement-ability assessment, and social-emotional behavior. None of the experimental teaching methods was found to be strikingly superior to the multisensory program prescribed by the basic Detroit Head Start and kindergarten program. (MS)",

The primary goals of such programs are given as (1) socialization, (2) development of basic learning and language skills, (3) preparation for the regular school experience, (4) establishment of motivational systems, and (5) stimulation of self-expression. A sample daily schedule of activities is presented in the booklet. Also enumerated are possible centers of interest into which the classroom can be divided. One is reminded that children with special needs will require special programs. Because of the new emphases on parent involvement in the education of their children, programs to improve communication between school and home are discussed. Also  discussed is the increasing interest in improving the quality and quantity of program personnel. The booklet presents some ideas on the nature of the problem and possible resolutions. In conclusion, guidelines for the evaluation of early childhood education programs are suggested. (WD)",

By age three a child is expected to have mastered the basic tasks of (1) good vegetative functioning (management of drives and impulses involved in eating and elimination), (2) perceptual organization and familiarization with the home environment and skills to orient to a new environment, (3) motor skills, (4) communication skills, (5) emotional organization, including the capacity to attach and respond to other adults and children and the capacity for love and anger, (6) sphincter control, and (7) beginning to understand time, number, and space which help to organize the present, recent past and near future. As the preschooler nears school age he learns how to adapt to separation from his mother and home,  to relate to peers and a neutral teacher, and to accept rules of behavior required by a structured school atmosphere. Throughout a child's development, learning processes including Pavlovian conditioning, trial and error learning, and operant conditioning take place. Individual differences affect the complex adaptational style which evolves as the child attempts to deal with his environment. A bibliography is included. (MS)",

The first three training sessions involved ascertaining which of 45 stimulus words the subject mispronounced. The 13 words so ascertained were used later in the study. Sessions four and five involved a visual match exercise. Sessions 12 through 15 paired the visual stimuli of the previous exercises with the sounds they represented. Sessions 16 through 25 introduced a fading technique to eliminate the visual stimuli and transfer control of the  discrimination to the auditory stimuli. Beginning at the end of sessions eight through 11, the l3 mispronounced words obtained in the first three sessions were introduced as stimulus items. It was found that the child's ability to discriminate \"auditorially\" between her response and the correct response improved over the sessions but that this discriminative ability did not appear to affect her verbal inability to correctly pronounce the stimulus words.

The next part of the study was similar in procedure except that Russian words were added but were never reinforced. In the third phase, subjects were not reinforced for imitating either English or Russian words. Later reinforcement of English word imitation was reinstated. The results, based on the number of correct imitations, showed that during experimental phases when reinforcement was tied to correct imitative  responses, the correct imitation of English and Russian words increased, even though the Russian words were never reinforced.

The average age of the experimental group was less than that of the control group. The experimental group was divided into three groups on the basis of language ability. The language program required the children to describe things, listen to the language models of the teacher, and imitate those models. Pretests administered at the beginning of the 5-month program were (1) the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities (ITPA), (2) the Peabody  Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), and (3) the Irwin Articulation Test. Only the ITPA and PPVT were given as posttests. The scores of the experimental and control groups on the ITPA and PPVT did not differ significantly except on two subtests of the ITPA, both of which tested grammar skills.

During the test sessions the BG was reinforced on a variable interval (VI) schedule of two to nine seconds. The abrupt delay condition was introduced on the first response after a VI, and no reinforcement occurred for responses until 60 seconds  had elapsed. The PG received the gradual 60-second delay condition, in which the duration of the delay was increased in 2-second incre ents. In both groups, supportive stimuli (a tone and a light) were used to indicate the delay period. Results of subject response data indicated that children of this age can learn the discrimination involved, but at least one PG subject did not learn it.

        "description":"Approximately 60 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old children were administered a language test constructed to determine theirlanguage usage levels and limitations. Half of the children were classified as Head Start and half as middle class. The language test involved the presentation of strings of three to seven phonemes organized on five levels of intelligibility: (1) nonsense words, (2) nonsense words with a verb in the middle of the string, (3) recognizable words in nongrammatical form, (4) simple sentences, and (5) transform sentences; that is, sentences in intelligible form but which necessitate transformation of a word or two to be gramatically correct, which the child was then asked to repeat back to the experimenter. The data from this study has not yet been completely analyzed, but  some trends have appeared. The five types of word formations appear to represent a hierarchy, related, in terms of the child's ability to recall them, to age. That is, the older the child, the more complete is his recall of words in higher order word formations. For strings of nonsense words, however, the 5-year-olds did not do any better than the 3- and 4-year-olds. It appears that the language ability of the Head Start child on the experimental task is about one year behind that of the middle class child. (WD)",

In the Navajo language, vowel length and nasal quality of vowels distinguish meaning, consonant clusters do not appear at the end of syllables, and the verb dominates to the extent that many English nouns when translated are verbal forms in Navajo. By distinguishing areas of sharp divergence between the two languages, a framework is presented for the development of materials, instructional techniques, and teacher training to  specifically meet the needs of the Navajo student of English.

Efforts were also made to determine and compare the achievement and resultant gains in intelligence, personality, and academic advancement of welfare recipient and non recipient children in each school. Analysis of variance indicated that there existed no significant differences between the 3 schools with regard to achievement of all students studied. Welfare recipient children performed at a lower level than non welfare recipients on the academic test. Children enrolled in the enrichment program at the experimental school made significantly higher gains than children at the other 2 schools.

A total of 101 students in nine secondary schools received instruction for one semester; a total of 100 students in three secondary schools received instruction for two semesters. The project was evaluated by pretests and post-tests to determine reading vocabulary achievement and student attitude changes and by reactions solicited from the teachers and principals involved. Test results indicated a mean reading vocabulary gain of 0.39 years for one-semester participants and 1.13 years for two-semester participants. There were no significant changes in student attitudes. School personnel responses were generally favorable except  that most teachers indicated difficulty in procuring interested students. Three of the eight teachers suggested that the project be dropped. Based on these results, it was recommended that the project either be changed so that more students could participate or continued only in schools where it would be implemented for two semesters. Sample copies of the student attitude measurement and school personnel questionnaire are included in appendixes. (BS)",

Individualization and motivation were the focal points of these projects; special attention was given to language arts. Neither of the language environment programs yielded significant results, but pupils in the experimental group showed progress as great as or greater than that of control pupils. In a comparison of reading approaches for first-grade children, the linguistic approach was effective for girls; the basal reader approach was more successful for boys. In a sixth-grade unit, pupils using individualized reading materials performed better than pupils using basal readers. With the aid of reading  consultants, the staff of one school developed a scope and sequence of skills for an individualized reading program. Primary pupils exposed to this program made greater gains in reading vocabulary and comprehension than would usually be expected. The reading program is being implemented at all grade levels in four schools for the 1967-68 school year. (Author/BS)",

The oral reading behavior of 12 children reading a story selected from a basal reader was examined. These subjects were fourth- and fifth-graders who were determined by informal test and teacher evaluation to be proficient readers. Initial analysis of miscues led to the formulation of a taxonomy of reading miscues. Questions concerning each miscue were asked. Change and acceptability were  examined semantically and syntactically at the phonemic, morphemic, and syntactic levels. Miscues were examined, compared, and contrasted in terms of their component parts, relative value, and levels of involvement. References are listed.

A Scientific Prototype Three-Channel Tachistoscope was used, and an erasing image was flashed immediately following the presentation of target words to avoid possible after-image effects. Ten word pairs were used. Associative value was measured by the Palermo Jenkins word association norms. Results indicated that word recognition speed was facilitated when associative connections between words in the text matched the word associations of the reader. Recognition was retarded when the target word was preceded by a nonassociate. A target word presented without  prior knowledge required more recognition cues than one for which the subject had prior knowledge. Differences between adult and child perception were detected in the reporting of a word based on partial information and in the stronger effect of associative words in children.

Two experiments investigating the effect of redundancy (structure) in written language on visual perception are reported. Seven-letter arrays differing in percentage of redundancy were repeatedly exposed for brief durations. The arrays were unfamiliar to the subjects in experiment 1. The subjects had to memorize the list of stimuli in experiment 2. All subjects were instructed to report what they saw. Perceptual &quot;reports&quot; (Natsoulas, 1967) were obtained in experiment 2 only. A third experiment was run to check the results of experiment 2. Letter position was the overriding determiner of perceptibility, yielding an inverted  U-shaped function about the fixation point. The increase in perceptibility as a function of stimulus structure was significant, but small. Information transmitted decreased markedly. The results are interpreted in relation to two models of information flow for the recognition and microgenesis tasks. References are listed (Author/BS)",

One reading program used a basal reading series which exercised little control over the grapheme-phoneme correspondences presented in the vocabulary. The second program used a basal reading series which exercised close control over grapheme-phoneme regularity. The vocabularies of these two programs were used in the remaining two programs, which emphasized meaning contrasts within basic patterns of language structure through the use of word substitution, pattern expression and elaboration, pattern inversion, and pattern transformation. Teachers were randomly assigned, and all reading programs were new to the teachers  using them. Reading achievement tests were administered to the pupils in May 1966 and May 1967. Higher decoding skills were attained when controlled regularity of grapheme-phoneme correspondences and emphasized language structure were combined in the same method than when emphasized language structure was presented alone. When used alone, grapheme-phoneme correspondences did not produce decoding skills superior to those produced by the program placing little emphasis on correspondence control. (WL)",

The purpose of the curriculum was to interest and motivate students by providing them with literature related to their own lives and by involving them in language activities related to their concerns. The anthologies which served as the core of these units dealt with human interest themes and included selections about minority groups. Each unit included a detailed manual for teachers, supplementary audiovisual materials, and an annotated book list for individualized reading. The methodology emphasized active learning and learning sequences which would  aid students to discover concepts and principles. Special attention was given to study and test-taking skills. These units were field tested in schools in New York, Ohio, Florida, and California. Approximately 5,000 students participated. Teachers, students, and independent observers judged the units relevant to student interests, motivating, and teachable. Schools which reported reading scores generally showed that students in the experimental program achieved gains equal to or better than comparable to control groups.",

According to Piaget, the perception of the young child is &quot;centered&quot; on dominant aspects of the field. With maturity, perception becomes &quot;decentered&quot; and progressively freed from the field. The visual training materials used in this experiment were designed with this principle in mind. The hypothesis that training in perceptual activity would improve reading skills was proposed. Sixty second-grade Negro children attending an inner city school in Rochester were matched in perceptual activity and reading achievement and split into a control group and an experimental group. The control group studied from a commercial reading program (The Bank Street  Readers), while the experimental group was trained with the series of nonverbal perceptual materials noted above. The experimental group made significantly greater progress in word form and word recognition than the control group. However, with regard to &quot;Meaning of Opposites&quot;, they did more poorly. This seems to indicate that noverbal perceptual training did not affect reading comprehension. References are included. (WL)",

The sequence of lessons involved the following concepts: (1) one-to-one correspondence, (2) perceptual rearrangement (3) as many as, (4) more than, (5) fewer than, (6) additions, and (7) subtractions. It was concluded that, for the kindergarten students, the lessons were uccessful in enhancing the children's ability to conserve numerousness. (RP)",

The regular syllabus for seventh grade mathematics in the school dictated the mathematical topics to be attempted, and a series of units was developed and tried out during the year. Underlying the instruction was the primary objective that the pupils have successful computational experiences. With the exception of standardized testing, students were allowed to use their notes and tables under all conditions. The analysis of data obtained from an experiment involving an experimental group and a control group indicated that both groups made substantial gains, with the control group making greater gains than the experimental group.

The first method involved a series of class sessions centering around material presented in the School Mathematics Study Group text, &quot;A Brief Course in Mathematics for Elementary School Teachers.&quot; The second used the text and, in addition, a series of 30 supplementary films shown via projector. The third used the text and the same films shown via television. In this study, it was expected that this education would produce favorable changes in teachers' ability to understand the concepts involved in the &quot;new&quot; mathematics and in their attitudes towards mathematics  teaching. In order to measure these changes, an opinion inventory and two parallel forms of a mathematics test were administered to each teacher before starting and after completing the course.

In addition, two classes at each of these grade levels, but from high socioeconomic areas were tested as were one kindergarten class and one first grade class using course materials other than SMSG. Most of these classes were followed throughout the school year, with individual tests being administered at three points.  Classroom observations, teacher reports, and a group test administered at the end of the school year provided other kinds of data. Variability in performance with in the disadvantaged classes was shown to be consistently very large. Variability between classes of disadvantaged children was also found with regularity. The changes in performance of the disadvantaged kindergarten children over the year were, on many of the tests, different from those changes observed in the first grade children. (RP)",

To evaluate the course, achievement tests and attitude surveys were administered to the experimental group and a control group of students in regular chemistry, physics, and biology courses. Achievement test results revealed a significant difference favoring the control group in biology at the five per cent level of confidence. No significant difference was noted in physics or chemistry. Results from the attitude survey revealed (1) that students favored the experimental course as often as the  conventional courses, and (2) that students in the experimental group were more willing to alter schooling and career plans.

Both groups had the same program except that 1 participated in an off-campus observation and teaching program; the other participated in an on-campus microteaching program. Five-minute pre- and postsummer lesson excerpts were video tape-recorded for each of the candidates. These were judged independently by each member of 2 independent teams of trained evaluators using the Stanford Teacher Competence Appraisal Guide and the Instrument for the Observation of Teaching Activities. A similar field follow-up assessment was made of each intern teacher in the fall and  spring. No significant differences between the 2 groups appeared at the end of the summer or developed in the assessments during the school year, indicating that a microteaching program, while saving time for staff and interns (80% in this study), can be just as effective as a regular student teaching program. Judges' findings were found to be moderately but significantly correlated with some exceptions. Included are 4 statistical data tables, the rating measures used (14 pages), a description of the microteaching program, and a 29-item bibliography. (JS)",

A 2 by 2 factorial design made it possible to test the influence of 2 independent variables (student teacher training in interaction analysis or learning theory, and cooperating teacher training in interaction analysis or learning theory) upon the dependent variables; attitudes, teaching effectiveness, teaching patterns, and pupil perception of student teachers. Volunteer cooperating teachers were randomly assigned to the 4 randomized groups of student teachers. Twelve hypotheses were tested by analysis of variance, but only one was accepted:  student teachers taught interaction analysis are more indirect, accepting, and supportive in working with pupils than those not so taught. There is some evidence that their pupils perceive the indirectness. They were not, however, rated as more effective teachers or as having more positive attitudes toward teaching. The results indicated no systematic effect of the training of cooperating teachers. Included are 76 statistical tables, a 79-item bibliography, and a 232-page appendix of skill sessions and materials used in experimental courses, individual teacher data and summary matrices, and instruments used in the study.

        "description":"This 2-year study attempted to determine whether feedback to teachers and principals about problems and tensions existing in their schools can be effective in changing morale for (1) teachers generally, (2) vocational teachers, (3) and nonvocational teachers. Relationships between teacher morale and such factors as age, sex, teaching experience, level of education, and major field were also examined. Principals and teachers (N=3,070) in 76 randomly chosen Indiana and Oregon high schools comprised the sample for the pretest-posttest control group design. The 10-component Purdue Teacher Opinionaire was used to measure morale. Statistical analysis of data revealed significant group differences. Contrary to expectations, however, all differences favored the control group.  (Noncontrolled use of the feedback may have affected the results.) Patterns for nonvocational teachers followed those of the total group, but vocational teachers responded less favorably on the teacher-load factor and more favorably on the teacher- principal rapport factor. While findings concerning the relationships between personal characteristics and morale confirm the results of earlier studies, the 10-factor breakdown introduces some new dimensions.

A 2-factor design was used to investigate the interacting effects of these 2 types of training; 92 student teachers in randomized groups received interaction analysis and/or simulation training or neither. Effects were measured with simulation tests, classroom performance records, course grades, Minnesota Teacher Attitude Inventory, Edwards Personal Preference Schedule, and Educational Testing Service Cognitive Test. Data, analyzed with standard parametric procedures, revealed that students receiving only simulation training spent more time than others in stimulation and management behaviors.  The hypothesis that students in simulation training would benefit from interaction analysis training was not supported: concurrent training inhibited them from discriminating problematic cues and responding appropriately on the simulation test. Interactions between learner characteristics and training programs were largely negative. It is recommended that the study be repeated with less rigorous simulation training to more closely approximate accurate user conditions.

The program consisted of 24 class hours weekly in 3 courses: Applied Mathematics for Mechanical Systems, Introduction to Design, and Seminar in Technical Education. Courses were paced flexibly since participants' backgrounds were in education with no engineering sciences and limited mathematics. About l/3 of the enrollees demonstrated enough capability in mathematics that success could be  predicted in further study of mathematics or engineering science requiring mathematics. About l/2 handled well the work in advanced production and design dimensioning, and l/3 clearly showed success in work in graphics and analytical statics, fundamental for kinematics or machine design. The seminar elicited group lament that past education courses had left them with little depth in technical subject matter to be taught. There was collective enthusiastic endorsement of the institute and recommendation for its continuance and extension into programs of four summers' duration. Appended are the class schedule, publicity materials, and a list of participants. (Author/JS)",

        "description":"An experimental attempt was made to determine if prospective women teachers could be helped through group counseling to sort out and clarify conflicting marital and professional roles in relation to their future professional status. It was hypothesized that such help would lead to a significantly greater sense of self actualization, a more positive self-concept, more freedom to express a professional commitment, and greater ability to relate to one's students. Subjects of the 15-month study were 60 home economics education majors randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. Statistical analysis of pre- and posttest results did not support the hypothesis; however, content analysis of recorded counseling sessions revealed that subjects were experiencing conflict, anxiety,  and identity stress. Five factors were isolated from the transcriptions which may facilitate more accurate measurement of counseling effects. Only 1 of the 5 focuses on the marriage-career role conflicts; the others document a syndrome of anxieties and feelings of inadequacy in the face of new experiences which do not represent a uniquely feminine problem.

Thus the objective of this special project is to improve methods of training change agents to improve classroom and school management practices. The 1966 programs involved 2 groups: (1) 22 university-based education interns with behavioral science backgrounds, and (2) 21 school system-based training consultants with in-service training responsibilities. Phase I of the action research program was an intensive 5-week residential core experience at Bethel, Maine. Phase II involved the equivalent of 3 weeks of field work on individual projects supervised by 12 members of the National Training Laboratories Network of  social scientists. Phase III was a 1-week follow-up for evaluation and further training. Major strengths of the program included the mix of training with practice, the development of an extended training design, and the emphasis on self-direction by the interns in designing their own learning activities. In 1967, with little outside support, 50 new trainees, some of them teams or task forces from the same systems, were recruited. Greater emphasis was placed on trainee-trainer roles moving from staff direction through collaboration to full self-direction.

The Measurement Competency Test, developed through consultation with a national sample of experts, was administered in 1964 to a sample of 2,877 senior education majors in 86 randomly chosen teacher-training institutions. Statistical analysis of the data, with that from the 1966 posttest (N=541), revealed that the test scores were unrelated to the kind, selectivity, or location of the institution; scores were related to teaching field, amount of test and measurement course work, and verbal ability. Major conclusions are that (1) there  is general agreement on the importance of some measurement compentencies for teachers, but a strong bias against statistics among some teachers; (2) beginning teachers do not demonstrate a very high level of measurement competency, and they show very small gain two years after graduation. It is recommended that some measurement course work be made compulsory, that all be made more meaningful, and that further research be conducted.

Of the 286 first and second-year male teachers in a midwestern urban school district in May 1967, 150 answered mail questionnaires regarding: (1) career expectations held for them by their families and friends, (2) satisfactions with other school staff and with teaching duties, (3) aspirations for social prestige, (4) problems faced in the classroom, and (5) educational characteristics of students and cooperativeness of parents.  On the basis of the first category of questions, the researchers predicted which teachers would move to other school systems or drop out of teaching by fall. Analysis of follow-up questionnaires seemed to confirm the hypothesis that group influences are a major determining factor in teacher dropout and mobility. While further research into the importance of reference groups in teacher career decisions is warranted, it appears that efforts to reduce turnover among teachers should focus upon activities which will elicit the support of teachers' families and friends.

Results verifying relationships between ANS and personality were consistent with those of previous studies of  children and males. Among other conclusions were that (1) teachers who show autonomic balance in the direction of relative parasympathetic nervous system dominance adjusted least well to teaching and (2) characterization of the less successful teachers as less friendly and sociable, less objective, less emotionally stable, more introverted and more tense, was consistent with differences in ANS functioning.

It represents an intensive study of 8 school districts chosen from a sample of 80 in which true impasses occurred prior to June 1965. The substance of the 8 case studies, based on data collected from questionnaires, interviews, written documents, and press coverage, is presented on a cross-sectional basis. Chapter I consists of introductory background. The individual school districts are analyzed in Chapter II as to the environment for collective bargaining. Chapters III and IV focus on the independent variables of conflict and power, Chapters V and VI on the dependent variables of issue settlement and longrun behavior. From the experience in the 8  districts studied, the final summary chapter draws conclusions as to the present status of collective bargaining and the processes of resolving impasses. (JS)",

Variables of age, sex, teaching experience, and teaching level were examined. The sample of 390 teachers from 3 California schools and 380 from 3 Oklahoma schools was selected on the basis of the independent variable, teacher negotiation with the board of education. The professional and bureaucratic orientation of teachers was an intervening variable. Data obtained through questionnaires were analyzed with use of the chi-square test for independent samples, and the Kendall coefficient of concordance. Findings indicate  that in schools where negotiations for salary and policy occur, the teachers more frequently perceive their role as being less professional and less bureaucratic. None of the variables, however, appear to affect leadership style preferences; nondirective, permissive style is preferred for the role of the principal and charismatic style for the role of superintendent. Included are 76 statistical tables, a 66-item bibliography, and the instruments used: Leadership Style Inventory and Views of Teacher Work Role. (JS)",

Correlation analysis of pre- and posttest scores and classroom observation yielded the conclusion that this in-service program was most successful for teachers  with several years previous teaching experience but with few hours of previous science courses, suggesting that the longer a teacher has taught, the more receptive he is to new and fresh approaches to teaching and the more valuable such in-service programs are.

This study attempted to determine which factors contribute most to teacher attitudinal change. Sixty elementary school teachers from 7 adjoining Texas school districts participated in a new curriculum, &quot;Science--A Process Approach,&quot; developed by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. All 60 used the innovation in their classrooms as part of the teacher education program. To measure teachers' attitudes the Semantic Differential was used for pre- and posttesting with multi-linear regression yielding 36 criterion variables. Predictor variables used were previous course hours in  science, years of teaching experience, grade level taught, and school location; each was assessed by analysis of convariance which held the other 3 constant. It was concluded that teachers' attitudes do change when they are involved in a teacher education program to increase competence in the processes of science. Results indicate that grade level is a relevant contributor to a positive change in the attitude of primary level teachers, but not for those at the intermediate level. Teachers with few or no previous course hours in science also developed more positive attitudes toward both science and their teaching. But previous teaching experience and school location appear unrelated to attitude change. Five references are cited. (JS)",

This study of such a program attempts to answer two questions: (1) What type of program most efficiently achieves the aims and (2) How are the results affected by location of the program, previous teaching experience, previous science courses, and grade level taught? Elementary school teachers (N=140) participated in training programs using &quot;Science--A Process Approach,&quot; a new curriculum developed by the Commission on Science Education for the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Three group programs were conducted: (1) a 6-credit-hour course on a college campus, (2) a 1-week preschool workshop followed  up by monthly 1-day visits and group sessions in participating schools, and (3) a released-time in-service plan of 11 half-day sessions throughout the school year. Pre- and posttest batteries along with other findings indicate that for improvement in both science competence and teacher attitude, the released-time format of teacher training is most effective; the campus program, least effective. Previous teaching experience and grade level taught seem unrelated to competence and attitude changes, but previous science training appears to contribute positively to both types of change. Seven references appear in the bibliography. (JS)",

In the introduction the system is discussed with reference to its theoretical base (J.P. Guilford's Structure of Intellect model) and to other systems of cognitive and affective interaction analysis. Each project is presented separately: Project I which observed the patterns of thought process classification when content and concept to be taught were held constant (12 pages), Project II which studied variations that might result from different content areas (8 pages) , and Project III which  compared teacher instructional strategies when variables of curriculum and concept were held constant (7 pages). In the &quot;Conclusions&quot; (8 pages) implications are drawn from the findings both with regard to the interaction analysis tool being tested and to junior high and high school teacher-student interaction generally. A 23-item bibliography and 14 statistical tables are included. Appendix A (42 pages), &quot;A System of Topic Classification&quot;: &quot;A Classroom Interaction Study&quot; by Gallagher, et al.

Interns participated in on-going research projects, focusing on as many aspects of institutional operation as possible, e.g. academic program, personnel, students, and finances. They came together for 2 seminars, attended 4 professional  meetings, and each developed 2 projects: (1) a plan for the establishment of an institutional research operation in his home institution and (2) a design for a project to be undertaken when he returned there. Mentors and interns made checklist evaluations of the program and the internship experiences, and each intern's projects were rated by the 5 mentors.

Second, he must accept certain basic assumptions with regard to educational goals: (1) educational goals should be defined in a process of interaction between professionals and representatives of the society, (2) goals and practices must be varied to accommodate a diverse population and must change as needs and values change, (3) goals must not be limited to purely academic objectives, and they must be stated in descriptive rather than  interpretive language. The function of the professional evaluator should be to help teachers and administrators in a given school (1) to define their goals in terms of pupil performance, (2) to learn how systematically to discover differences among pupils that require particular kinds of instruction, and (3) to design and administer evaluation programs in order to find out which of their instructional procedures are paying off and which are not.

That we so seldom train for generalized cognitive skills is paradoxical, for most authorities tend to assume these skills enable the student to learn a wide variety of instructional content. Research on whether or not generalized skills interact with instructional content to facilitate learning is now under way. Knowledge of how cognitive skills develop is limited, but some findings suggest that research should concentrate on the more advanced stages of formal operations. It may be possible to develop more efficient and precise  measures than those of Piaget. If so, they may be useful in evaluating educational programs because (1) measures of fundamental cognitive skills provide highly meaningful descriptive information about learners, (2) knowing the level of cognitive development attained by learners should provide significant information as to interactions between instructional phenomena and learning, and (3) we may find that the development of some cognitive skills is actually facilitated by a given instructional program.

Staff members acted as consultants, encouraging trainees to focus on design problems of interest to them, of value as learning experiences, and of potential use to the field of education as a whole. Statistical  analysis of data from trainee questionnaires indicates that (1) trainees felt that no part-time inservice program could provide the same benefits as the 6-week institute, (2) they favored a flexible scheduling approach which emphasizes competent consultation over formal lecture, and (3) they considered the institute worthwhile and their performance adequate.

Presentation is in 3 sections: (1) the methodology of the system, including the units of measurement employed in the analysis of teacher-learner interaction, the recording procedures followed, and the nature of the data that derive from the interaction analysis; (2) the content of the system, that is, the dimensions of teaching behavior, child behavior, and setting described; and (3) evidence of the utility of the system, based on tests of validity and reliability. Ten  tables and 8 figures are used to illustrate the conceptual basis of the system, relationships between the contextual variables it measures, categories used to describe the 4 aspects of teacher and learner behavior (focus, teaching operation, affective qualities, substantive content), etc. A 19-item bibliography is included. This system evolved as an adjunct to the Teaching Research project \"Increasing Prediction of Teachers' Classroom Behavior Through Use of Motion Picture Tests\"; the final report of that project is also in the ERIC collection.

A \"contingency contract\" is an agreement between teacher and student whereby the student, upon demonstration of specific task achievement, receives a reward: permission to participate in a \"reinforcing event,\" some specified, highly desirable activity. A \"contingency-managed classroom\" is an individualized instructional setting in which such systematic motivation management techniques as contingency contracting are employed. Chapter I (6 pages) lists the rules and principles of contingency contracting. Chapter II (6 pages) deals with the preparation and correlation of task materials and diagnostic test materials. Suggestions for the  arrangement of classroom facilities to include a task area and a reinforcing event area are given in Chapter III (8 pages) along with a list of suggested reinforcing events for various age groups. Classroom management procedures such as orientation methods, specification of task assignments, and student self-contracting are discussed in Chapter IV (13 pages). Chapter V (1 page) deals with correction of contract malfunctions such as failure and discipline problems. Various procedures are illustrated with the use of 12 tables and flow charts. (JS)",

Units are prepared, presented, and evaluated by teachers working together voluntarily. A 6-day American literature unit introducing Romanticism has been particularly successful. The contrasts between Neoclassicism and Romanticism are illustrated through recordings of music and slides of paintings, sculpture, and architecture, as well as lectures. The unit culminates in the showing of a film on the Cathedral at Chartres. In addition to regular classroom discussion, both large lectures in the auditorium and closed circuit television are used. This kind of introductory unit places literature in its proper artistic and historical contexts and increases student  understanding and retention through the use of visual materials. The pooling of the knowledge of a number of teachers improves the quality of information taught to students, and allows a teacher to concentrate on one particular part of a unit. (DL)",

Such a basis for comparison exists between Hawthorne's romance, &quot;The Scarlet Letter,&quot; which appeared in 1850, and Henry James' fantasy, &quot;The Beast in the Jungle,&quot; published 53 years later. Both works attempt to portray the &quot;essential truth of the human heart&quot; by evoking an awareness of the common doom or destiny that all men share in their isolation from each other, an isolation aggravated by the sin of pride. Although differences in surface structure, psychological point of view, use of symbol and image, and methods of execution exist between the two works, each novelist places his  characters in a situation which dramatizes the effect of erring, but free-willed, action.

        "description":"Beginning with Cooper's \"Leatherstocking Tales,\" the frontier has been a significant aspect of the American literary consciousness and has contributed to the popular folk traditions of the self-made man, of individual opportunity, and of progress through perserverence and hard work. In the first two decades of this century, the frontier novels tended to be sentimental romances in which the wilderness hero--genteel, aristocratically mannered, frequently southern, courageous, and resourceful--overcomes dangers to reestablish his honor and fortune, then returns to society with none of his initial nobility impaired. In the 1920's the frontier novel moved from romance to realism, from the glories of the wilderness to the ordinary events of life on the edge of settlement. The  aristocratic hero gave way to the common man as hero--humble of origin and, generally, a farmer who has come to the frontier to transform the wilderness and create settlements. Later shifts in emphasis in the 1930's and 1940's show (1) attention to the value of hard work, self-help, and simple living, and (2) a movement from concern with individual freedom of action to emphasis on human dignity, justice, and peace, particularly with respect to the Indian.

An alternative assignment was an historical survey using six versions of the Bible to trace a given passage. One nonhistorical  approach involved an analysis of words used in advertisements. In other instances, studying the origins of place names led to the compilation of linguistic atlases, and an essay assignment encouraged students to project generalizations about language after reading \"local color\" fiction. The limited and frequently erroneous conclusions which resulted became the bases for further discussions. (RD)",

The summer programs are intended to help talented students from disadvantaged environments bridge the gap between their backgrounds and the private boarding schools in which they will enroll.

The  writing program--set off from th area of study skills--centers on a sequence of 12 writing assignments, and the reading program is built around a core of five short allegorical novels.

Impressed by Dickens'&quot;artistry of style,&quot; they nonetheless disagree with each other over whether his characters are believable and whether the exaggeration of character traits is an effective device. The deepest level of understanding occurs after the students have finished the novel and can see the relationships among the characters and their correlation with the structure of the novel. Students respond emotionally to Dickens on a subconscious level because he reflects their deepest needs and attitudes. They support Dickens' attacks on institutions and his ridicule, through repulsive physical descriptions, of socially important individuals. The students also identify with  Dickens through his attitude toward life, which is dominated by a vast sympathy toward mankind, almost religious in its expression but lacking in specifically religious ideas; and through his tendency to criticize society rather than support specific causes designed to improve it.

These projects led to the inclusion of a two-part program in the senior high English curriculum. In the first part, students lectured and led discussions on topics relevant to a number of assigned works from classic and modern literature. The other part involved assigning two seniors to a ninth- or  10th-grade English class where they (1) observed the class for 3 days, (2) completed evaluation forms on the class, and (3) collaborated with the teacher on preparing lesson plans for three class periods.

Dimensionality was defined in terms of the content and number of factors derived from statistical analysis. Approximately 4800 students representing eight universities yielded more than 14,000 evaluations of filmed speeches representing three distinct quality levels. All data were subjected to the statistical technique of factor analysis. The results of the study indicate the following: (1) Students of public speaking perceive the evaluation of public speaking to be multi-dimensional, and tend to judge the quality of the speaking they evaluate in terms of three to four factor analytic dimensions. (2) A basic course in public speaking  broadens the base on which students make speech evaluations, and aids particularly in the development of a language facility dimension of speech evaluation represented by a concern for diction, fluency and word choice. The emergence of a factor tends to be additive to that which the student brings to the basic course. (3) A significant positive relationship appears to exist between the proficiency of student speakers and the acquisition of the language facility dimension of speech evaluation. (4) Training and proficiency in public speaking do not appear to offer a differential effect on the dimensionality of speech evaluation. (Author)",

Related studies included one of the dimensions of style in the works of established writers, a study of the tendency to give \"opposite\" responses in free association tests and its relation to verbal ability and personality, and a study of personality ratings based on experimentally controlled  voice samples. Few if any significant relations were obtained between personality measures and measures of speech or writing performance, but several dimensions of ability and style in verbal tests and performances were established. Speaking abilities were shown to be factorially complex, dependent partly on the method of measurement or observation. Significant home background factors in language development were identified. Certain teaching methods (\"Fluency,\"\"Structural Grammar,\" and \"Logical Thinking\") produced significant improvements in measured verbal abilities. (Author)",

Many of the \"so-called 'foundation courses',\" in which this philosophy should be developed, are \"the most irrelevant courses taught by incompetent professors;\" and until these courses are modified and good teachers are found to teach them, they will hinder new teachers more than they will help.

Students marked their answers on self-scoring answer sheets. An attempt was made to guide students in an orderly fashion in rewriting the theme, and the test items emphasized composition techniques that students can avoid in their free writing. The subjects were 306 grade 10 students in 14 different classes in two metropolitan school districts. Pretest scores indicated that the sample  was relatively typical of grade 10 students. Criteria included scores on a standardized test and marks on a theme. Analysis of variance yielded non-significant F's for all tests of main and interaction effects.

This process is particularly helpful to the blind. This study investigated the intelligibility of speech processed with seven different discard intervals and at seven rates from two to five times the original. Optimal parameters for processing speech at each of the rates are reported along with a comparison of intelligibility rendered by three different modes of presentation. Headphone presentation was found to be about 22% more intelligible on the average than presentation by loudspeaker. The commercial equipment available for processing time-compressed speech varies the sampling interval but maintains a constant  discard interval. The findings indicate that the sampling interval should be held constant for rates two to five times normal. A sampling interval of 15 milliseconds was found to be optimal at all rates for a low-pitched man's voice. A higher pitched woman's voice would require an even shorter sampling interval. Processing and presenting time-compressed speech using the optimal parameters reported here should promote greater comprehension as well as intelligibility at all rates, intelligibility being a necessary prerequisite for comprehension.

Instruction was planned to orient the participants toward the importance of developing researchable objectives by giving them a concentrated introduction to the phases of such an undertaking. The three principal objectives were for the participants to become able to (1) identify behavioral and conceptual objectives for art education, (2) write both objectives  leading to unit construction and instructional processes and materials, and (3) identify and produce component parts of a unit and thus make these objectives operational for instruction and evaluation. The results of the participant performance indicated that the program objectives were successfully achieved.

Two experimental curriculums were designed and introduced into 12 intact primary classrooms, matched for grade level and randomly assigned to one of the curriculums. Curriculum \"A\" gave instruction in the central organizing concept of the discipline, developed through practice in the analytic processes directing geographic inquiry. Curriculum \"B\" gave instruction in the major geographic generalizations, inductively developed from illustrative instances presented to children. Criterion instruments were designed to measure children's achievement in geography at three cognitive  levels. The difference between the programs in knowledge acquired was statistically significant in grade 2 only. In both grades 2 and 3, children's mean achievement in comprehension of the concept and in ability to apply the concept in unfamiliar regional analyses was significantly higher under Curriculum \"A.\" No statistically significant between-programs difference was obtained in grade 1.

Four sixth-grade classes in two schools (a laboratory school in a culturally advantaged neighborhood and a school in a culturally disadvantaged locale) executed 832 art products, judged by 16 art educators. One class at each school used inexpensive or \"found\" materials and the other used expensive materials. Greater art quality, craftsmanship, and originality were produced by the use of expensive materials, by fantasy motivation, by students at the culturally  advantaged school, by girls, and by academic high achievers. The low-budget art programs considerably diminish high-quality art performance and enjoyment. (This report also includes tables and charts which substantiate findings.) (Author/JB)",

The procedures by which theme raters and  experimental and control groups of students were selected are described in detail, as are the methods of rating themes.

Three of the 4 home-school coordinators lived in the neighborhood of the school. Moreover, parents were encouraged to participate as teacher aides in the classroom or on field trips. Home-school contact was further strengthened through parent conferences  and a health program. Featured in the instructional program were learning experiences to develop the child's language facility, visual and auditory discrimination, and ability to pay attention. Other educational experiences were designed to enhance the child's self-image and to increase his knowledge of basic scientific, mathematical, social studies, and health concepts. Followup research was conducted to determine the impact of the program on pupils' social and intellectual functioning and on their attitudes toward learning and testing. (LB)",

The educational system in which a student functions is composed of his primary environment, the instructional environment, and the eventual transfer environments. When there is congruence among the elements of these environments, the educational process functions effectively. Breakdown in the process occurs when the elements are discontinuous. It is suggested that the most critical areas for educational research are studies of environmental differences, of the acquisition and use of language, and of the ways in which motivational patterns may be modified. Truly basic research, as distinguished from applied research, can  be carried out within a framework of practicality and applicability.

MFY is a private organization financed by an NIMH grant and OEO funds. Since its inception in 1959 it has remained administratively independent, but while this system provides relative autonomy in program implementation, a community action project faces problems of gaining support, as shown by attacks on MFY from the press. As an independent organization it had challenged the traditional power structure of both private agencies and city bureaucracies in the community action field, and, as a result, had cut itself off from any established base of support while remaining dependent on public  institutions for funds. In response to public criticism, the city administration curtailed the autonomy of MFY programs and instituted a public investigation of its practices. Interested private groups did not defend MFY's position, and the organization has been compromised. (NC)",

Studies were the language patterns of white first graders, and the attitudes, cognitive and affective variables, and academic achievement of Negro and white fifth and sixth graders. Poverty rather than race was found to be the significant factor affecting these variables. It is noted that it is especially important that schools include on the child's permanent record information about his economic status. These data would help in designing special educational programs to alter self-concept, improve attitudes, and foster acceptance by peers and teachers. On the basis of the findings of the dissertation on the language of the lower class child, a recommendation is made that  reading materials should initially use the same sentence structure as the child uses in his speech, with gradual guidance toward improvement in school language.

Suburban &quot;white nooses&quot; surround the cities, in which are concentrated the swelling nonwhite population. Former Federal mortgage policies gave preference to &quot;modal&quot; families--young, upwardly mobile couples with children, and thus excluded low-income families. Urban public housing fostered Negro dominance in cities as whites moved away, while urban renewal tended to create while white middle- and upper-middle enclaves. &quot;Blockbusting,&quot; a prime example of private discrimination for profit, contributed to segregation patterns. The &quot;new towns,&quot; self-contained urban complexes, in many ways also may perpetuate segregation. However, there are forces for change--nondiscriminatory Federal  regulations, state and local fair housing laws, privately developed interracial communities, grass roots efforts to stabilize changing neighborhoods, and suburban fair housing groups. The needed massive National measures to end segregation would require comprehensive Federal planning and incentives, new types of subsidies to low income groups, higher minority incomes, and vigorous enforcement of anti-discrimination and equal opportunity laws.

The formerly all-white district in which the school is located had become increasingly Negro, and as a result &quot;racist&quot; rumors and social unrest had spread in the community. The major emphasis of the program is on the orientation of the teachers to provide them with insights into their students and community. For the problems the teachers cannot handle there are school counselors. Paddling is used as a disciplinary measure when there is severe cause. The general reactions of the teachers, parents, and students are favorable to the school and the program. At present, the school has the best junior high school  attendance record in the city and has reduced both dropout and tardiness rates.

Adult judgement of intelligence is based upon observation of the student's behavior and his performance on standardized tests. This behavior is in turn affected by the student's motivation, background experience, and attitudes. The lower-class child comes to school with a feeling of personal inadequacy and because he lacks the language skills and general academic know-how necessary in formal learning situations, he inevitably fails. Thus, there is perpetuated a cycle of frustration and failure in which the child's academic deficits become cumulative. The experiences of a Baltimore Head Start Project have shown that for the cycle to be broken these children  require a continuous enrichment program with warm, varied, active, and flexible teachers. It is important, moreover, that the worthwhile aspects of the lower-class child's own culture not be destroyed in the educational process, and that the school recognize his language and learning styles.

The quantity and quality of verbal and nonverbal communication transmitted to the child determines how well this scheme is adaptable to differing life situations. If there are interruptions in this process, the child will find meaning only in the immediate stimulation, he will have no basis for guiding his behavior, and he will have limited communication skills. Also, he will seek a high level of stimuli at all times, and maintain a level of self-stimulus by engaging in constant action. Such persons become isolated from the mainstream of the larger society. Because poverty programs designed to reach them are successful with only a  small number, to help these youth educators must assume the responsibility of developing curriculums and teaching techniques which will prevent improper cognitive development.

To do so, however, the children must be approached within the framework of an empirically-based classification system. A behavior checklist filled out by teachers and parents can be used as a basic diagnostic tool to identify syndromes of problem behavior (conduct or personality disorders, or the disorders of the subcultural delinquent or the immature child). Classroom remediation methods should be based on the application of the principles of learning theory. The child should be taught to substitute acceptable alternatives for his inappropriate behaviors.  To do so, it is necessary to experiment in the classroom with types of reinformcement, agents of reinforcement, and methods or presentation of reinforcement. Although most methods of behavioral remediation are designed for individual instruction, it is important for economic reasons to extend them to group situations. The goal of this remediation must be to help the child reenter the regular classroom cycle. Examples of empirical attempts to deal with specific problems in a special class setting are included.

Too often urban schools encourage pupils to renounce their individual differences and submit to external controls and group pressures. Many pupils feel frustrated and agressive and may participate in delinquent gangs to maintain a nearly destroyed ego. Instrumental to the role of the school as an ego-supporting institution is the relationship between teachers and students, which can be especially constructive if the teacher himself has an adequate self-concept, is responsive, and has a positive understanding of his role despite the bureaucracy within which he must work. The school should also provide students with  immediate rewards for their efforts. Success experiences might be generated by offering the student a variety of educational tasks appropriate to his needs and interests. The urban pupils' need for success might also be met through small, programed units of instruction. (LB)",

Eleven tutorial centers were established in neighborhood elementary schools, and 240 students from local academic and vocational high schools were hired to tutor 544 fourth- and fifth-grade pupils. Each center was run by a master teacher, who, in addition to administrative activities, was responsible for training the tutors. For the purposes of evaluation tutors and tutees eligible for the program were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. Experimental pupils were tutored either once or twice a week for 2 hours. Findings are reported concerning the impact of the program on the participants' reading achievement, school marks,  behavior, and attitudes before and after their tutoring experience. Also presented are specific recommendations for the establishment of similar tutorial programs. Separate technical reports containing extensive evaluation data on both the pupils and their tutors are included. (LB)",

At Trezevant high school in Memphis, Tennessee, up to 40 percent of a student's time over a 5-day period may remain unscheduled. For students unable to manage the freedom of flexible scheduling there are supervised study halls and continuous counseling. One critic of the modular system claims that it is too administratively complex and troublesome, and that the system, which requires the use of computers, is being promoted mainly by the electronics industry. However, proponents of modular scheduling claim that it offers closer contact with teachers and greater opportunities for in-depth teaching, raises student morale, and is more democratic and natural. Evaluation of this system at a  Wilmington, Delaware, high school revealed that although only 3 percent of the interviewed students felt they had more individual contact with teachers, most of them reported significant benefits from the new schedule. It is no t known, however, whether this schedule will be successful with disadvantaged youth. At present, the system is in use primarily in suburban schools. The great cost of this computer-based method is frequently prohibitive. (LB)",

The conflicts within HEW and between it and Congress are related, with special attention given to the activities of Peter Libassi, special HEW assistant for civil rights, to the attitud s and roles of Southern Congressmen, and to the status of desegregation in the Southern and border states. Under the leadership of Libassi the approach to urban school desegregation will probably be on a case-by-case basis. HEW is now  required to uniformly enforce desegregation guidelines in both the North and the South, and Libassi is attempting to survey the de facto segregation situation in the North before he begins enforcement there. Also discussed in this article are the organization, staffing, and operational aspects of nine regional enforcement offices. (NH)",

It indicated that the system's neighborhood school policy segregates Negroes from whites, who are permitted to escape from assignment to Negro schools by transferring to optional school zones. In addition to ruling on racial discrimination, Judge Wright applied his decision to socioeconomic and class discrimination, suggesting the importance of social class integration as well as racial balance in the schools. It is felt, however, that while  Judge Wright's decision invalidated discriminatory de facto school conditions, it did not actually outlaw de facto segregation on constitutional grounds. Also, since the -Hobsen v. Hansen&quot; case was heard at the district court level, the ruling is applicable only to the Washington school system. (LB)",

Combining the attendance zones of Negro and white schools enabled the establishment of biracial schools with students divided by grade into different school buildings. A pairing plan, it was felt, would overcome de facto segregation. The 12 Negro teachers in the system retained their jobs and were placed in biracial classes. The smooth desegregation of the high school was helped by the transfer of top Negro athletes from the closed Negro high school. Appropriate curriculum changes, including the addition of reading programs, have been implemented in the desegregated schools. Under the determined leadership of the school superintendent and  the school board, the integration process was accomplished without incident. In five other Kentucky counties the schools have been desegregated through pairing. (NH)",

However, teacher aides, on the whole, lack a previous orientation toward a career, are not prepared for competitive college admission, do not have the financial resources to attend college full time, and might be discouraged by the length of time required to earn a degree at night school. Therefore, the &quot;Career Incentive Plan&quot; proposes that an aide's knowledge of the disadvantaged environment, his ability to communicate with the residents, and his work experience as an aide be considered for partial credit toward a B.A. degree in education. The plan also proposes a  one-fifth study program to enable an aide to complete 16 college credits yearly toward degree requirements. A tuition fund would be needed, however, because aides are not usually eligible for scholarships. Federal education acts might be amended to provide scholarships for these students on a part-time basis and to enable universities to develop special curriculums. (NH)",

He states that the increasing tendency of mayors, governors, and school superintendents to rely heavily on the Federal government for solutions to educational problems should be reversed. The Federal Government's role in helping the states is to provide additional resources for equal educational opportunities for the poor to absorb much of the cost of educational change, and to aid the states in planning for and administering programs to achieve these purposes. However, the state and local governments are still expected to increase their support for education and to maintain educational standards. Too many bond issues and  school tax levies for teachers' salaries and school facilities have already been defeated because it has been assumed that the Federal Government will bear these costs. In addition, states have not given sufficient support to cities, who need more state aid as their educational problems grow and as the tax base diminishes. To provide educational equality for all children, a state should allocate funds on the basis of need rather than property values. (NH)",

Stressing the notion of partnership between the Federal and state governments, it notes that states have particularly important opportunities for action in the areas of finance, administration, and leadership. State governments must establish a minimum baseline of educational quality and must tax sufficiently to maintain it. In terms of administration, strong independent state boards of education are necessary, with a strong executive and with freedom from political intrusion. State leadership in education should involve the creation of a positive climate and emphasis. Such leadership should also create conditions which stimulate and encourage educators to innovate and improve the schools.  (NH)",

However, Federal educational legislation has prohibited any Federal control over local districts. Moreover, state education departments have the power to approve Federally-funded local plans.

To compensate for the wide discrepancies which, as a result, occur in schools, the state must set minimum standards of educational quality and must tax sufficiently o insure that they are met. However, such action should not imply state control of school curriculums, and local schools should retain the option of determining how high their academic ceilings will be. The state must also take a leading role in comprehensive planning for higher education. It must decide what range of academic programs and other types of continuing education are to be offered and who is to have administrative authority  for guiding the development of education at this level. It is especially important, however, to guard the academic freedom of faculties in higher education. (NH)",

The program is analyzed as an educational innovation rather than as a school integration method. The plan involved transporting volunteer Negro children in overcrowded schools to white underutilized schools. It is concluded that sensitivity is needed in each busing situation, which should be preceded by much planning and \"in-house\" education. Also, programs for Negroes should be supported and initiated by them. There should be flexibility about the percentage of nonlocal children bused into a school, depending upon what kind of school \"image\" is desired. The principal is probably the most vital force in implementing such a program, and if  he is antagonistic, he should be either replaced or there should be no program in his school. Moreover, educational programs should help the Negro to achieve his own social and intellectual goals. (NH)",

Negro interviewers conducted the survey at the prisons. Despite some stated shortcomings in the data collection process and in the instruments, a profile of these men is presented. The typical prisoner was a single man about 30 years old, protestant but not a regular church-goer, and a nonveteran high school dropout. He was southern born and had lived in Detroit for at least 15 years. A blue collar worker, he earned about $120 per week and had been out of work more than 5 weeks in the past year. The prisoner thought the riots had been caused by&quot;police brutality.&quot; He believed that poor housing, lack of job opportunities, and discrimination also had contributed to the conflict. Martin Luther King, Jr. was his favorite leader, and nonviolence was the preferred means for achieving civil rights. In general, the prisoner felt that conditions for himself and other Detroit Negroes had improved recently, and he was hopeful of eventually achieving what whites now have.

The project design involved four groups--(1) bused students receiving supportive services in the suburban schools, (2) bused students receiving no support, (3) nonbused students receiving support- in their inner city schools, and (4) nonbused students receiving no support. There were gaps in the data collection process which seriously limited the interpretation of the findings. However, the bused students showed  regular attendance, persistence in school placement, and participation in extracurricular activities. The suburban teachers found them responsive to high academic expectations and able to adjust quickly.

        "description":"The relationship between self-esteem, academic expectations, and ethnic group membership was studied in a New York City elementary school which had an approximately equal enrollment of Negro, white, and Spanish-background pupils. Subjects were 162 sixth-grade students who were tested with two projective tests and one specifically designed achievement test. Self-esteem was measured by the projective tests, and expectation level was determined by the pupils' pre-exposure predications of their correct responses to the three administrations of the achievement test. Results show that there was no racial difference in self-esteem but that Negroes had more negative attitudes toward school. Although both white and Negro children approached the academic task with equally high aspirations,  the Negro level dropped after experiencing failure. The gap between aspirations and achievement was significantly greater for Negro than for white children. Implications for school programs include creating a positive image of Negroes among white children, for image-building may not accomplish very much for Negroes. Human relations courses for teachers should be research-based and should pinpoint the sources of Negroes' negative attitudes. Curriculums should provide successful academic experiences, and guidance programs should clarify the relationship between means and goals. (NH)",

The discussion focuses on programs to develop the preschool child's language ability and learning readiness, programs for remedial reading and individualized instruction, programs for children whose bilingualism presents learning problems, and programs for the problem adolescent. In addition, the educational effectiveness of school integration as compared with compensatory  education practices is discussed. The importance of administrative leadership in the schools, of parent involvement in the educational process, and of the use of audiovisual equipment are also discussed.

By the end of fiscal 1967, 1.2 billion dollars had been obligated for training the unemployed and underemployed under Title II of the Act. As the combined result of original congressional intent and subsequent experience, MDTA induced programs have come to have six potential and identifiable objectives: (1) facilitating employment of the unemployed, (2) reducing poverty, (3) lessening inflationary pressures, (4) meeting labor shortages, (5) upgrading the labor force,  and (6) revamping traditional institutions. On the basis of a detailed analysis of both quantifiable and nonquantifiable accomplishments, the extent to which each objective has been achieved is examined and estimates of the overall costs of the program are made before turning to a review of cost-benefit studies for comparison with previous conclusions. The results of the appraisal are clearly favorable. In general, every current component may not pay, but the overall contributions of the program have exceeded its costs by a margin which not only merits support but justifies expansion. (ET)",

Society in general feels that the wrong people will have the new leisure, that the professional persons of the country are going to work hard while those on the technical level will be less and less committed to their jobs. The new leisure will go to the imperfectly educated, unmotivated part of the community which will \"misuse\" it. The idea that each individual buys his way to food, shelter, education, and safety by holding a job was characteristic of the industrial revolution. The idea is no longer appropriate. A future problem will be how to devise a system in which every individual has dignity and purpose in society, and the society has a rationale for distributing the results of its high  productivity. A way must be devised to simultaneously talk about full employment for the present and plan for a different kind of society in the future. The dichotomy between work and leisure must be eliminated. There is needed a new concept of participation in society, participation meaning something like citizenship. A question-answer interchange between speaker and audience is included. (SL)",

The public school has the responsibility to make vocational education both attractive and respectable. The Commission feels that the following policy issues deserve notice--(1) All staff members should be aware of and take responsibility for the vocational development of students, among other growth objectives, (2)  Vocational education should be included throughout the school program, (3) Instructional materials and procedures among school subjects should be mutually supportive, (4) Vocational teachers should feel themselves included in a pattern of joint instructional responsibility, and (5) The funds available for improving vocational education should go in all practicable ways into strengthening comprehensive schools and programs of instruction.

A quasi-experimental matched control group design was used, and pre and posttests were given to pilot and control classes of senior vocational agriculture students in mathematics, feeds, seeds, fertilizers, and chemicals. Differences in score gains and posttests over pretests between pilot and control groups were not impressive. Separate evaluations of the pilot programs were made by students, businessmen, and teachers. The overall evaluation was favorable.  The findings showed that programs of systematic instruction in agricultural occupations can prepare 12th grade vocational agriculture students for job entry into agricultural supply sales and service businesses or for entry into an advanced educational program.

        "description":"Twenty-five sophomore students recommended by their school principal or counselor participated in a pilot educational program designed to be appropriate to the interests and needs of potential high school male dropouts. Test scores, inventories, student records, office files, and employment analyses of the participants were examined to determine similarities of those students who showed some or little success in school, on the job, or in school and on the job. The students were provided with some form of low-level community work experience and 1 hour per day in the classroom. Some findings were: (1) The boys participating in the project had a mean IQ of 88 with a range of 82 to 99 for 95 percent of the group, (2) 82 percent of the participants scored below the 50th percentile on  the Iowa Silent Reading Test, (3) All of the students tended to score low in mental ability and achievement tests, and (4) The boys as a group had a dislike for academic subjects before and during the study. The objectives of the project were generally met, and the majority of the boys were retained for the 1965-66 school year. Although the project had its impact and served a good purpose, it was concluded that the progress made by the participants was not commensurate with the time, effort, and money invested in their interests.

The study's principle focus was on matching jobs in correctional settings with a range of individuals from the high school to the college dropout, with particular emphasis on the indigenous leader, the ex-offender, and the offender himself. New career lines could result from several approaches examined in detail: (1) The tasks now being performed by professionals could be broken up and the jobs redesigned to create viable functions for nonprofessionals,  (2) Those who have been traditionally employed as nonprofessionals could, with appropriate inservice training, be upgraded to semiprofessionals and provided with career steps and training leading to professional accrediation, (3) Jobs which nonprofessionals could perform suitably could be developed to provide services not being rendered, and (4) Offenders and ex-offenders could also be employed as participants in their own rehabilitative process. Barriers to and advantages of these and other manpower innovations are discussed. An 85 item bibliography is included. (ET)",

Data presented were collected from 1940, 1950, and 1960 U.S. Bureau of the Census reports and other available research studies. Some findings were (1) Structural change in Iowa is basically due to rapid technological development in agriculture and the emergence of new industry, (2) Iowa's population has changed from 42.7 percent urban in 1940 to 53 percent urban in 1960, (3) From 1940 to 1960, the number of employed persons increased by  156,221, of which 135,000 were women, and (4) Professional, technical, and kindred workers were the fastest growing occupational groups during the past decade for males. Major predictions were: (1) The number of agricultural workers is expected to be surpassed by the number of workers in manufacturing by 1970, (2) The greatest employment growth in Iowa appears to lie among professional and technical occupations, and (3) Industrial requirements for labor skills, farm and nonfarm, are expected to continue to decline.

The selected pilot sample, 835 residences in Hennepin County, Minnesota, was drawn from city directories. Interviews with 502 nonprofessional and 74 professional members of the available work force who lived in the residences selected provided data on employment history, individual characteristics, and vocational training. Interview attempts indicated (1) 24.8 percent of the residences contained no eligible members, (2) 8.4 percent refused interviews, (3) 3.6 percent could not be contacted, and (4) All subjects were  interviewed in 88 percent of the residence in which eligible members resided. The results of this preliminary phase suggested that some modification of the scoring system for employment experience was desirable, that validation of the statements made by subjects did not increase the accuracy of the results sufficiently to warrant the cost of such validation, that the sample for the major study should probably be selected from telephone directories, and that a few questions in the interview forms should be changed.

The subjects were unemployed or underemployed school dropouts, between the ages of 17 and 22, who had been out of school for at least 1 year. Comparisons were made among the groups: 118 subjects who received a combination of vocational and academic training, 115 subjects who received only vocational training, 59 subjects who received only academic training, and 46 subjects who received little or no training (control group). A pre-test/post-test control group design and extensive use of analysis of  covariance procedures were basic to the study. Findings included: (1) During the first year covered by the followup period, the academic-vocational and the vocational groups exceeded the control group in proportions entering the labor market, in average number of weeks of employment, and in average annual earnings, and (2) By the end of second year of followup, however, there were fewer significant differences on each of these variables.

Appropriations increased from $6,500,000 in 1965 to $24,000,000 in 1967. Training costs declined in 1964 and 1965 compared to 1963 but were doubled in 1966 because of an extension of the time for which training allowances could be paid. Equipment costs rose from 10.58 percent of the training costs in 1963 to 18.02 percent in 1966 due to equipping undeveloped programs and programs for highly skilled occupations. A total of 48,644 persons received training during the four fiscal years. New Jersey, Ohio, Mississippi, Puerto Rico, Pennsylvania, New York, Wisconsin, Kentucky, Washington, and Alaska had 69 percent of the  trainees in fiscal 1966. The five predominant occupations in numbers of people trained were nurse aide and orderly, sewing machine operator, welder, machine tool operator, and clerk stenographer. During the first half of 1967 there was an increase in the number of proposals for on-the-job training programs, and more proposals included basic education. Training under the program is basically sound and is accomplishing its purpose of training unemployed and underemployed workers in economically distressed areas.

It is prefaced with a discussion of the basic philosophy and principles of administration and supervision. Problems of administration and supervision at the state, city and local levels, including specific qualifications and duties of the state supervisor, high school curriculum problems, and responsibilities of the principal and the  department head are discussed. The final section of Part I covers problems of administration at all levels, such as standards of achievement, budgeting, guidance, public relations, and classroom visitation. Part 2 is devoted to administration and supervision of business education in colleges and universities, with emphasis on undergraduate and graduate programs in teacher education in state colleges, state universities, liberal arts colleges, and private schools. Part 3 contains selected references. (PS)",

Thirteen vocational education teachers participated during the period from July 13 to October 15, 1966. A specific objective for each participant was to develop a 1-semester course in his particular subject area which would be used in establishing a Computer Assisted Instruction (CAI) Curriculum in vocational education. The objective of completing a semester's course appeared to have been too ambitious. From 50 to 150 hours of work was required to produce one 40-minute class lesson. Only one to one and one half class lessons could be prepared since the participants spent 15 hours in preparation each week, outside of the required  attendance of 2 hours each evening on Monday through Thursday, in 6 weeks. The most important single impediment of the project was the lack of reliability of the CAI equipment. Recommendations and guidelines for future programs are listed. A sample course section, \"Introduction to Data Processing,\" for CAI instruction is included in the appendix. (PS)",

Farmers participating in the educational program were generally younger, better educated, and more affluent than the average farmer described in census data. Polynomial curvilinear regression statistical techniques describe the relationship between investment in farm business management education and three measures of economic success: farmer's labor earnings, return to capital and family labor,  and total farm sales. Farmer's labor earnings and farm sales increased rapidly during the first three years of instruction, declined for the fourth, fifth, and sixth years and then increased rapidly in subsequent years. The benefit-cost ratio for individual farmer participants was 4.20:1. The community benefit-cost ratio when increased business activity was measured by increased farm sales was 9.00:1. This study assists in establishing a rationale for educational programs to increase community assets and describes an educational model for efficient program operation and growth.

A rationale, based upon literature in the field, was developed for vocational education at each level of the educational system. A student occupational inventory determined high school students' career interests in eight occupational categories. Of these students, 46 percent expressed interest in community college or vocational-technical school. Upon the basis of this interest, Kirtland Community College and the high schools might consider programs for drafting, chemical technology, surveying, electronic  technology, art, journalism, auto mechanics, cosmetology, scretarial, distribution, law officer training, carpentry, and computer operation. The jobs mentioned most often on 704 questionnaire returns (78 percent) from businesses were retail salespeople, waiters, bus drivers, bookkeepers, janitors, cashiers, nurse aides, auto mechanics, assemblers, and secretaries.

If a man helped by an automatic machine can turn out twice as much per hour, then, presumably, only half as many hours of work will be available for each man, or only half as many jobs. The President of the United States has said that approximately 1.8 million persons holding jobs are replaced every year by machines. Thus, presumably, 18 million persons lost their jobs in the 1950's because of machines, yet total employment rose. In fact, it could be said that technological change has created more jobs than it has destroyed. While 13 million jobs were destroyed by various causes in the  1950's more than 20 million were created as a result of technological change and growth in the stock of capital. Automation should be welcomed rather than feared. The rate of automation depends on the availability of capital and the rapidity in the rise in real wage rates. The unemployment problem is not the result of automation and will not be worsened by automation. This new, and old, technology is spreading very slowly, and the present slow pace is not likely to accelerate. (HC)",

Our's is the first generation which must educate and reeducate to new dimensions of time and change. Today a person's role in society is determined almost exclusively by his work role. This concept leads to several conclusions: (1) Vocational education must become a part of all levels of education to assist individuals in the transition from school to work, (2) Educators must help students make this transition, and (3) Schools and colleges must make learning how to work a part of their program. Programs which give all persons the opportunity to serve a useful purpose must be developed. Ways to bridge the gap between man and his work are to establish exploratory  occupational programs in junior high schools, a nationwide work-study program, and an entry-job placement system, and to construct residential vocational schools. Man's work must be recognized as his most important product and education must become the link between man and his work. (EM)",

Unlike traditional vocational training, which tends to give the worker a training of long-term value, the AVT program is closely linked with the problem of short- or medium-term employment. The AVT courses are an average of 6 months in length, reserved for adults, and supplement the traditional systems which provide vocational training for the young. In 1962, the  International Labor Conference devoted the main part of its &quot;Recommendation of Rapid Training&quot; to the enumeration of principles for AVT training and methods. Some of the principles include establishing an AVT syllabus which provides for preparatory training based on taking one difficulty at a time compatible with the knowledge or skill already acquired, a range of exercises in increasing order of difficulty, a synthesis of exercises carried out in conditions as similar as possible to those f the work or factory, and application of exercises to facilitate the transition between theoretical and actual work.

The findings and conclusions are summarized in the form of answers to questions formulated from the basic objectives in the area studies. Some of the findings were:  (1) Schools should provide vocational and technical education for all who could benefit from it, (2) There are neither enough schools providing adult education, nor typical high school experience adequate for preparing the average person to enter the job market, (3) Most employers want students to have training to develop good attitudes, effective speaking and writing, and occupational skills, and (4) Communities will support an increase in public occupational education.

It outlines a method of estimating future manpower requirements by occupation and industry and future training requirements or high-level occupations. The method is based largely on United States experience. However, modifications of the techniques used in the United States are suggested, based on a study of forecasting techniques employed in different counties. Steps in the method are: (1) Derive a rough first approximation of the future employment structure by economic activity, (2) Make a detailed analysis of each activity, (3) Modify the first  approximations of future employment in accordance with the activity analysis, (4) derive an occupational employment breakdown in each activity, in the future period, and 5) Estimate training requirements for each important occupation by analyzing the probable supply of qualified workers under existing training arrangements in comparison with estimated needs for the future period.

The specific objectives were to (1) upgrade teachers in distribution, (2) acquaint teachers with cooperative education methods, (3) broaden rural school offerings, and (4) adapt existing distributive materials to agriculture. The 30 participants from 30 states were selected upon the basis of their ability to profit from the institute. Presentations by distributive education coordinators and participants, committee work, and field trips were among the methods. Participant selection was considered the most important single staff decision. The participants were found  to have gained significantly in knowledge of distributive education. An evaluation committee judged that the major strength of the institute was the instruction during the workshop and its weakness was the lack of administrator involvement. Among other conclusions, implications, and recommendations were statements concerning morale, incentives, implementation difficulties, home community size, multiple-teacher departments, cooperative training stations, institute length, and participant housing.

Scholars in the fields of sociology and psychology served as consultants. The first week of the workshop was oriented toward understanding the life styles of the disadvantaged with an examination of such factors as relevant socio-cultural concepts, the culture of poverty, minority group relations, and strategies and alternatives for solving the problems of the disadvantaged. During the second week an attempt was made to translate insight gained during the first week into teaching goals  and techniques. Consultants provided opportunities for participants to explore some introductory strategies of implementation involved in teaching the disadvantaged, to set forth basic concepts relative to differential perception, to develop a motivational system for more effective instruction, and to recognize the influence of emotions and prejudicial attitudes in understanding and teaching the disadvantaged. The workshop seems ultimately to have not only made a contribution to knowledge ut to the belief that there is worth in every individual. A bibliography is included. (HC)",

Principal objectives of manpower training programs include increased rate of pay, decreased average unemployment, and greater lifetime employment stability. These objectives imply assumptions relative to the &quot;no training program condition&quot; and may not include a consideration of any other parties and factors involved. If the program affects only the trainee, or if other effects are disregarded, a comparison of individuals' income and employment experience with and without training would suffice. Evaluation relative to  employment level must consider aggregate unemployment and how the effects here enter into the evaluation process. Other considerations which must be made are the effects on third parties such as nontrainees, the distributional effects by groups and regions, and the time dimension of benefits and costs using proper discount rates for various circumstances.

Major divisions are (1) The Over-All Standards, (2) Adult High School Standards, and (3) Vocational-Technical School Standards.

In addition, the experimental group teachers followed suggestions for improving reading ability as set forth in a written guide. The &quot;Diagnostic Reading Tests, Survey Section,&quot;&quot;Kuhlman-Anderson Intelligence Test, 7th Edition,&quot; and &quot;Sequential Tests of Educational Porgress&quot; were used in pre- and post-testing. Reading abilities of students in the study were  below national norms.

        "description":"The objectives of the study were to identify present and emerging off-farm agricultural occupations and to determine for present and anticipated numbers of employees, competencies needed for entry and advancement, job characteristics, and educational needs. A sample of 472 was drawn from a population of 2,952 firms. Of 437 firms contacted by 60 trained interviewers, 336 employed persons needed agricultural competency. Findings indicated that about 2,200 firms employed about 35,000 persons of which 13,000 (37 percent) in 158 job titles needed agricultural competencies. Each year for the next 5 years, the 2,200 firms will need 240 additional and 400 replacement employees. Employees generally started at 23 to 30 years of age and stayed in a job 11 to 15 years. A wide range of  salaries averaged $462 per month and a longer than 40-hour week was prevalent. High school graduation was the minimum educational requirement for most jobs. Farm background and work experience were advantageous to job seekers. Competencies for most job titles included (1) employee relations with supervisors, (2) employee relations with fellow workers, (3) communications, and (4) salesmanship and customer relations. Specific competencies were identified for each ob title, and grouping of competencies was evident. (JM)",

The experimental program was one in which students were introduced into the world of work and spheres of the citizen within the broad context of &quot;man and society&quot; by use of a comparative cultures approach. Forty-four students were subjected to the experimental program and 50 to the conventional program. Pre-post measures of attitudes considered basic to citizenship behavior and several other instruments were administered to both groups. Data indicated relevant attitudinal change for both experimental and conventional programs. Data from a social distance scale  favored the experimental with respect to increased acceptance of racial and nationality groups. Tests of student self-concept of academic ability and self-identity indicated no differential effectiveness. Subjective student judgments indicated the experimental program was more interesting. The results of the pilot study were considered sufficiently promising to warrant the recommendation that a more comprehensive study be initiated. (MM)",

Concomitant purposes were to investigate the relationships of creative abilities and (1) intelligence, and (2) school achievement. A definition of relative creative abilities in the industrial arts and guidelines for their measurement were developed and submitted to a sample of educational psychologists and industrial arts teachers to determine their acceptability. A procedure was selected for applying this to secure criterion measures of native abilities. Three pairs of industrial arts teachers were trained to rate a sample of 95  eighth-grade students. The &quot;Minnesota Tests of Creative Thinking, Abbreviated Form VII&quot; were administered. Verbal and non-verbal IQ tests, five standardized achievement tests, and eight sets of teachers' grades were analyzed, along with peer ratings. The abilities presented and measured by the Minnesota tests are inadequate to account for the creative output, but the test measures components not measured in the typical intelligence test. The fairly high relationship between substantive creativity and IQ appears to indicate that some of the convergent thinking abilities influence the production of unusual and useful ideas. (EM)",

The 1963 survey provided data from 337 of 604 employers contacted on September 1963 employment and estimated expansion needs as of September 1965 and September 1968. On a followup form in the fall of 1965 showing their estimated September 1965 employment, 302 respondents indicated actual September 1965 employment, and checked reasons for any discrepancy between the two. Data suggested that, in  overall terms, estimates of changes in total employment were reasonably accurate. It was concluded that the estimates collected in 1963 might have served with other available information provide as solid a basis for occupational manpower needs as might be wished, the imperfect estimate was better than none. Improvements would require more personal contact with respondents and would increase costs on an already costly survey, but the enhanced accuracy might make the effort worthwhile. (MM)",

A total of 120 persons were enrolled in dry cleaning, shipfitting, welding, auto service  mechanics, and diesel mechanics. New courses were added to replace those inadequate because of lack of job placement opportunity and low salaries. Prevocational training to include basic and remedial education, citizenship, work habits, and job r sponsibilities, and assistance in solving health and other problems are needed.

This report is limited to the immediate effects of two experimental programs for dropouts. Four groups of students were utilized: (1) the diploma group of 115 students who had dropped out of school but came back for 1 year after which they received a diploma, (2) the skill training group of 128 students who had dropped out but came back for 1 year of vocational training, (3) the control group of 91 students who had dropped out but were offered vocational guidance and financial incentives to participate, and (4) the graduate group of 85 students who were seniors matched with the experimental subjects on race, sex, curriculum and I.Q.  The diploma group benefited the most as measured by psychological tests. Chapters are devoted to the social and psychological aspects of school withdrawal, students' evaluation of the program, human relations in the program, and teacher characteristics. The appendixes include the analysis of pre- and post-test results and a student interview-questionnaire. (EM)",

This document, a summary of workshop presentations and discussions, is intended as a guide to consultants and as an introduction to civil engineering technology for junior colleges administrators. A consultant should be used by junior colleges in conducting meaningful manpower-need studies to determine the feasibility of instituting a program in civil engineering technology. If the decision is made to establish a program, a consultant should assist in selecting a competent individual to serve as head of the department. This  individual would then be responsible for developing the curriculum, staff, and facilities through the involvement of consultants and a local advisory committee. The 2-year program in civil engineering technology should include an integrated sequence of educational experiences with a distribution of approximately 19 credit hours in basic science courses, 15 credit hours in non-technical courses, and 38 credit hours in technical courses. The objectives of the program will determine the requirements for faculty, laboratories, potential student population, and other program facets. (HC)",

        "description":"Research was concerned with determining mobility and situational factors linked to the behavior and attitudes of job-displaced workers, and examining the influence of each variable in explaining the social consequences of unemployment. Data were derived from interviews with 260 white, blue-collar respondents from a larger random sample of former employees of an automobile manufacturing plant which closed operations in 1956. The interviews were conducted in 1958, about 27 months after the shutdown. The major components of adjustment to job displacement selected as dependent variables were: (1) personal alienation as measured by a seven-item version of the Srole Anomia Scale, (2) satisfaction with life as measured by a four-item scale, and (3) social participation as measured by  contact with relatives and friends. Independent variables were age, education, skill level, unemployment status, number of months of unemployment, degree of economic deprivation, and the amount of variance explained by each combination of five at a time. Data indicated that the situational factor (the degree of economic deprivation) was more important than the mobility factor (post-displacement job pattern) in shaping the attitudes and behavior of displaced workers. Economic deprivation was more productive of alienatory attitudes and behavior (anomia, dissatisfaction with life, and withdrawal from human contacts) than job mobility. (ET)",

The major outcome of the Conference was the refined concept of a Center for Health Occupations: an \"organized department or facility, or unit, within a school or school system that provides occupational training for health occupations.\" Recommendations concerned (1) cooperative ongoing planning, (2) attention to the high school curriculum as  well as to programs for adults, and (3) provision for student progression from one level to another. An executive committee was appointed to provide means for assessing new programs and to evaluate conference impact. After the conference a questionnaire was distributed to conference participants, a film strip describing the Springfield project in which pilot programs were inaugurated out of the core of the medical assistant program was in process, and curricular materials were sent to participants and other interested parties.

The present attempts of home economics educators to identify the basic concepts of the field and organize curriculums around them are potentially fruitful, both for students and for the image of home economics. However, these educators have limited the meaning of \"concept\" in their use of the \"concept approach.\" Curriculum groups have thus far been concerned only with concepts as products while experimental psychologists have investigated the process of learning concepts. The home economics teacher would profit from the curriculum in which the two approaches were unified. Only national cooperation in building  high school home economics curriculums would make possible the development of correlated textbooks, pamphlets, films, filmstrips, tapes, demonstration equipment and other illustrative materials. Topics discussed are (1) meanings of concept, and the task, methodological, organismic, and strategy variables in concept learning, (2) the use of the concept approach in improving high school curriculums in the physical, biological, and social sciences and mathematics, and (3) sample lessons in the area of management of personal and family life illustrating the \"conceptual mode\" of teaching.

An attempt was also made at isolating attitudes and skill development during the training program which might be related to success in the occupation. The sample consisted of all trainees on whom there were complete data (138) enrolled in 10 purposively selected MDTA projects in Minnesota to represent technician, sales and clerical, and skilled training programs. Multiple regression equations were developed  for each group using 22 personal and training related variables and 15 in-school instructor rating variables. Each equation predicted the criterion (post-training employment status) above the .01 level of significance for their respective groups. However, no equation was developed that predicted well in all of the three groups. The findings imply systematic differences between persons who succeed and those who do not.

Summary findings included--(1) Relatively high rates of youth unemployment are to be expected even in years of low general unemployment because of the large amount of movement into and out of the labor force resulting from the extended period of education characteristic of the United States, (2) In 1966, between three-fifths and seven-eights of youth unemployment arose from inexperienced and reentering job seekers, (3) Rapid increases in the size of the youth labor force and the proportion enrolled in school has led to  increased proportions of youth seeking part-time and summer jobs, (4) There is no evidence that employers have become more restrictive toward young job seekers, but they have become increasingly selective among youth, with the result that unemployment rates of the youngest age groups, nonwhites, and girls have increased more than others, and (5) Insufficient vocational guidance, lack of information, and the seasonal pattern of enrolled job seekers entering and leaving the labor force contribute to high frictional unemployment. High economic growth rates, modifications in minimum wage standards, and job creation are recommended to relieve youth unemployment. (ET)",

Participants were 20 high school teachers of trade and industrial subjects, 20 industrial supervisors, and a small number of representatives of union apprenticeship programs in the Salt Lake City, Utah area. Methods included visits to schools by the industrial supervisors, visits to industry by the teachers, observation of union apprenticeship council meetings by each teacher, and  subject area discussion meetings for each skill group. A questionnaire was administered to the participants at the beginning and end of the project to obtain information on such items as the adequacy of high school vocational programs, and suggestions for improving or changing these programs. The program proved effective in generating ideas for changes in or additions to programs of vocational trade and industrial preparation and in stimulating cooperative efforts between teachers and industrial supervisors.

The investigation was based on 10,000 high school seniors in 16 closely matched communities in the Midwest, Pennsylvania and California. Graduating seniors were asked in spring 1959 to respond to Thorndike's 20-item CAVD verbal intelligence test, 5 attitudinal scales from the Omnibus Personality Inventory and a student questionnaire devised by the research staff. Class ranks were noted and all academic aptitude scores converted to equivalent School and College Ability Test scores. Over the next 4 years, educational, vocational and marital data were obtained and over 500 subjects were interviewed in 1962 and  63. In spring 1963, the sample completed a lengthly questionnaire and personality inventory. Students were categorized primarily according to college attendance patterns. It was found that a direct relationship existed between academic success and socioeconomic status, parental values and interaction with parents, expectations of college and development of intellectual and especially autonomous attitudes and modes of thinking. The data all indicate that success in college depends on factors beyond ability, such as the values and related goals ascribed to college. By anticipating patterns of attendance more precisely, problems can be identified and dealt with earlier and more adequately by counselors and teachers. Such procedures would eventually modify attendance patterns. (JS)",

It examines the extent of commitment of federal and provincial governments to community programs and projects, and comments on the degree of balance between local needs and expert planning. In support of its claims for the interrelationship between theory and practice, it outlines four basic elements in community development. Against these and the classification of the types of programs (integrative, adaptive, project), it examines the relevance and success of numerous organizations and institutions. It concludes that, on the whole, the programs are few in  number, irregular in quality, and uneven in distribution. Furthermore, it judges the lack of a &quot;developmental&quot; policy as the limiting factor in the national community development programs and in the assessment of the common needs of the communities.

Fifty percent of the trainees lived on campus while the others commuted. Intensive teaching and counseling were needed since most trainees were functioning at or below the eighth grade level and were being brought into a basically alien environment. The trainees, almost all aged 21-50, were grouped by learning potential, and special academic courses were designed for each skill.  Lectures, films, and field trips were also provided. Trainee autobiographies, class day and graduation activities, exhibits, participation in high school equivalency examinations, and the job placement rate (121 out of 166 by September 1965) were generally indicative of program success. Resident trainees performed significantly better, had less absenteeism and fewer personal problems, and showed more regard for personal characteristics, than nonresidents. (ly)",

Twenty assessment categories (grouped under such headings as intended results or objectives, transformation of resources to maintain stability and stimulate change, and agency assessment and feedback) were identified, the categories were analyzed in terms of standards of excellence, deficiencies in the existing situation, and the causes of the deficiencies noted, and  suggestions were offered for action. An increase was deemed necessary in financial support and in the number of full time adult education administrators qualified to help manage educational resources. The fundamental recommendation of this report, however, was that a substantially larger portion of the leaders and general citizenry of Washington, D.C., should become involved in deliberations regarding the role of adult education.

Although the existence of a social problem often indicates that educational needs exist, individual needs are more useful than social problems as a basis for program development. Experts and potential participants are both important in the appraisal process. The focus of this essay suggests the usefulness of distinguishing between ways of meeting needs, and indicates that situational adjustments, along with learning, educative, and educational adaptations, might be appropriate on various occasions. The importance of autonomy and application as distinguishing characteristics of adult learners must also be stressed,  together with the use of methodological rigor and judgmental balance, and the selection of needs to which a given agency or program elects to respond. The following activities might aid in need appraisal--delimiting the scope, describing potential participants, setting forth criteria of success, selecting most pertinent needs, relating needs to program design, and predicting widespread or emerging needs.

This set is therefore a preliminary collection, prepared for  internal use and as a basis for assembling in the future a more carefully selected and prepared set of readings on adult development. Additional copies were run in the belief that in the meantime they might be of value to researchers and scholars who are interested in adult development. (author)",

        "description":"Two principal speeches at the Conference were \"The Educational Requirements of Working Life\" (Paul Cherrington) and \"Leisure as a Consequence of Economic Development\" (Herbert Grau). Mr. Cherrington stated that adult education starts at about 21 years of age, has to do with experienced people, and is concerned with individual development and the effects of change on individuals rather than with acquisition of facts. In spite of the introduction of liberal elements into industrial education, adult education has its own job to do and must use a variety of approaches, all differing from those essential to industrial education. Adult education must maintain its independence if it is to influence industry and the educational establishment. Dr. Grau stated that although leisure and  economic development interact, it is not a simple cause and effect relationship. Creative activity is the essence of leisure, although its pattern differs with geography, social class, stage of development, and other factors. Since leisure is an opportunity for the individual to find himself, adult educators have a duty to try to help people in their organizations to leave, to do things for themselves, and to find their individual patterns of leisure activity. (Discussion followed the speeches.) (aj)",

        "description":"The Canadian Commission on Human Relations Training sponsored a conference in Toronto in April 1968 to focus on six major concerns of Canadian trainers--trainer development, communication, research, theory and design (of training), public acceptance, and participant satisfaction. In preparation for this conference, it was found that collected research on these six topics was limited to an annotated bibliography published by the Human Relations Center at Boston University containing 40 pieces of research done over the period 1960 to 1966. To augment this collection, this compilation and commentary of 90 items of 1967 research, gleaned from PSYCHOLOGICAL ABSTRACTS (subsections on developmental psychology, social psychology, physiological psychology, animal psychology, experimental  psychology, personality, clinical psychology, educational psychology, and military and personnel psychology) was prepared. From these reports, it is concluded that the sensitivity trainer cannot fulfill his professional, ethical, and moral responsibility unless he makes himself familiar with such information. A National Journal on Human Relations Training should be set up to report fully on all relevant research. (aj)",

More careful planning and coordination of human resource development programs and services is required. The rise of new agencies may threaten or stimulate existing agencies, but no new structure can be created at once to abolish the old and install the new. Strong state level coordination by and among agencies is a necessity, and agency professionals ought to encourage the strengthening of state government for this reason. Some agency duplication is wasteful, but there is a place for competitive, creative overlap among and within  agencies. The future of North Carolina and the nation depends on the efficiency with which agencies develop human resources. (The document includes 11 references.) (author/ly)",

During the months covered by this report, the Center cosponsored a conference on continuing education for women in the two-year colleges of the State University, began a second series of career information radio programs, and planned a seven-session Career Opportunities Workshop. Twenty-eight percent of the clients receiving counseling and testing during this period were from disadvantaged groups, compared with five percent previously. A pilot evaluation of the individual counseling done at the Center was undertaken to help the staff prepare for larger scale evaluation to be carried on in July 1968. Projected research includes comparisons of  the usefulness of the Strong Vocational Interest Blanks for women and men, and studies of personal and demographic characteristics which may distinguish clients who use counseling and testing effectively from those who do not, and of selected psychological and social processes related to the difficulties women experience in enlarging their activities beyond the home. The Center has applied to the American Board of Counseling Services for accreditation. (aj)",

The Center's counseling records indicate that while women considering employment or further education need guidance and information and are willing to seek it, husband's  attitudes, inflexible work and school schedules, and fears of impersonal work situations and inability to compete with younger students deter them from returning to work or school.

Data were obtained on the Muskegon educational system, the population to be served, and legal, historical, and fiscal background. Task force and related reports were prepared, and basic recommendations were made for an area system  of continuing education encompassing public schools, community colleges, and community agencies and councils, together with specific steps for the year beginning September 1, 1967.

Only 54 such trainees were secured, and the remainder (315) were male and female inmates at the Lorton, Virginia, prison complex. The Accelerated Progressive Choice Reading Program was used to develop literacy skills, provide experiences in goal achievement, and impart subprofessional literacy instructor skills to the trainees. Dropouts and inmates both showed gains in literacy scores and in measured intelligence, with literacy gain scores strongly favoring the inmates, and most instruction was ultimately  trainee led. The benefit cost ratio at Lorton was extremely favorable. Conclusions on program support, incentives, and correctional literacy education were offered.

The four courses offered in 1964 and the nine in 1965 were taught by regular University faculty and carried full resident credit. They were supplemented by weekly discussion groups, except for psychology which had no discussion center, and biology which had a laboratory session. The typical enrollee during the 1965 Fall Term was a married women, about 31 years old, with at least one child. She was a Minnesota high school graduate who had completed at least one college course and was seeking a college degree, usually in liberal arts or teaching. She enrolled in the TV College because she could attend classes at  home, avoiding transportation problems. Although only 44 students attended both terms, there was a striking similarity between 1964 and 1965 students, the notable difference being that the mean enrollment for 1965 was considerably smaller than for 1964. Psychology was by far the most popular course in 1965, possibly because attendance at a discussion center was not required. The study indicated that the population responding to the TV College was a stable one, consisting of low-middle aged persons and not the college-age group initially sought.

Monthly salary correlated with two of the Kuder scales, with the numbers subtest of the Minnesota  Clerical Test and with four MMPI scales.

One estimate of the declining number of these French-speaking Americans today is only 400,000. In addition to the factor of assimilation, the decline in the number of speakers is due, the author feels, to limitations in the teaching of French in the schools, the social attitudes prevalent, and the impact of English mass media. The author outlines the history of these people and points out the commercial and cultural  advantages of preserving their language and cultural heritage. A bibliography of approximately 50 books, newspaper articles, and other publications concerning Acadia concludes this paper. See related document AL 001 250. (AMM)",

Two teaching situations were set up for the programed materials. The first group, 24 students who met in a room \"equipped somewhat like a language laboratory,\" were \"self-paced,\" using books, tapes, and a tape recorder. They were encouraged to ask questions, which were answered individually. For the second group, 34 students in a regular classroom, the same programed materials were put on transparencies and used with an overhead projector, a loudspeaker, and a screen. This group also encouraged to interrupt at any point with questions, which were answered briefly (and usually in English). The students responded in unison when an oral response was  required, and kept notebooks for written responses. The teacher, standing so that he could see when the students were finished writing, paced the presentation of the frames accordingly. Various tests were given to these two groups, along with a third group of several conventional classes. Because of inadequate controls, the author feels that the results are inconclusive. However, \"it is easy to conclude,\" he reports, \"that even though the achievement tests did not measure the skills that were given the most emphasis in the program, these (programed) students more than held their own with students receiving the conventional type instruction.\" (AMM)",

        "description":"A procedure, designated &quot;MORPH,&quot; has been developed for the automatic morphological analysis of complex English words. Each word is reduced to a stem in canonical or dictionary form, plus affixes, inflectional and derivational, represented as morphemes or as syntactic features of the stem. The procedure includes the task of analyzing as many nested levels of affixation as a word may contain so that each morpheme of the input string will have a distinct representation. The overall strategy includes--(a) a set of analysis rules, (b) a set of morpheme-combinatorial rules, and (c) a set of redundancy rules. Spurious analyses are dealt with by certain modifications in these sets of rules. The procedure has been implemented on the IBM System 360 in TREET as part of an experimental  text-processing system in which it provides the input to a transformational syntactic analysis procedure. The present sets of rules are quite small, removing only the most common inflectional suffixes (-s, -ed, -ing). Using these rules on a small vocabulary, MORPH has performed accurately at an average speed of 0.7 seconds per word. It was discovered in experimenting with this program that proper names require special treatment to avoid spurious analysis and that there is far greater homography with English prefixes than with suffixes, to the extent that the value of prefixational analysis is questionable.

Because their syntax also differs from standard English, the psychologist, not aware of the rules of Negro nonstandard, has interpreted these differences not as the result of well-learned rules, but as evidence of &quot;linguistic underdevelopment.&quot; The psychologist must learn to distinguish between the questions (1) Has this child acquired language? and (2) Has this child acquired competence in standard English?

Students must have completed one year of high school Spanish with at least an average grade. Since the course is taught through Spanish in the comparative method, the student continues his study of Spanish while acquiring new skills. In addition to describing the  program, this paper discusses some of the problems standing in the way of a full-scale Portuguese program: (1) space in the crowded curriculum, (2) availability of qualified staff, (3) lack of variety and range of teaching materials, (4) anxieties of curriculum planners, (5) budgetary considerations, (6) competition with established language programs, (7) lack of convictions strong enough to support a full program, and (8) lack of university programs for program continuity.

Twenty-four (12 male, 12 female) native speakers of each of the following languages were tested: English, German, French, Spanish, Japanese, and Chinese. Most were graduate students at the University of Michigan or Michigan State University. The same seven types of restricted associations to the same 35 stimulus nouns were obtained in all languages. Written tests were administered individually with self-explanatory instructions in the language of the test. There was no time limit. The seven restricted association tasks were to give (1) class names for stimulus words, (2) another member of the class to which the stimulus belonged, (3)  synonyms, (4) antonyms, (5) verbs denoting usage of the stimulus, (6) adjectives denoting qualities, and (7) parts or attributes of the stimulus. The results indicate that restricted association tests can be successfully adopted for use in foreign languages and that the results will indicate marked response variability between individuals as well as between languages. Since the numbers of subjects within the groups were rather small and since most subjects were recruited on a university campus, the study must be regarded as preliminary. (DO)",

All sentences were of the form subject-verb-object or subject-verb-location, and were presented to eight male and eight female undergraduates in a learning task. Hi-m sentences were recalled significantly more often than lo-m sentences. The interaction, but not the differences, between the first and second trials were significant.

In order for the library to best serve the student, adequate provisions for the selection of instructional materials and equipment should be provided. Provision should be made for circulating all types of materials for overnight use. Adequate time for library use should be provided all students during the school day; the library should be accessible to them in the evenings and on weekends and holidays. Teachers should cooperate with the librarian in planning library services and should familiarize themselves with resource material holdings in their subject areas. Funds available to purchase audiovisual  materials should be used. Microfilming and microreading should be utilized to compensate for limited storage space. No library program can be completely successful without the interest and support of the school board, the principal, the superintendent, the teachers, and the librarian. (BS)",

The law provides for the employment of teachers specifically trained to teach reading, for monetary incentive to encourage such training, and for the establishment and maintenance of school libraries. All districts receiving equalization aid may participate in the program to provide for specialist teachers who are classroom teachers given special instruction in the teaching of reading. These specialist teachers work with first-grade children to prevent reading difficulties and do remedial work with small groups of second and third graders. Districts that receive aid are allowed to plan their own reading  programs with the stipulation that they meet the basic requirements of the California State Board of Education. In the program's first year, 1966-67, 53 districts employed 252 specialist teachers, absorbed 238 scholarships, and participated in 193 courses and workshops. In the second year, 224 districts applied with requests for 950 specialist teachers. This figure is expected to triple in the 1968-69 year. (BS)",

School achievement was determined with the Metropolitan Readiness Test, Form A. Data on first-grade subjects with Spanish surnames were collected from 16 elementary schools in San Antonio, Texas. Attendance data were collected for Negro, upper-class Anglo, and middle-class Anglo pupils. It was found that knowledge of the socioeconomic variables listed above contributed significantly to the prediction of achievement. When the variables were considered separately, significant  relationships were found between the parent's occupation and achievement and between attendance and achievement. When attendance was analyzed in relation to the other variables, there was a significant correlation only with the parent's occupation. The Mexican-American group was inclined to attend more often than the Negro group and less often than the Anglo groups in the first grade. (WL)",

Readiness levels were determined by the Metropolitan Readiness Test; achievement areas were measured by the Metropolitan Achievement Test; and personality adjustment was measured by the California Test of Personality. A 4x3x2 and a 4x3x2x2 factorial design were used to analyze the data. Chronological age significantly affected only the reading scores of Negro pupils. Readiness differences significantly affected all achievement scores and personal and total adjustment, but had no significant effects on social adjustment. There were significant  differences, favoring girls, in reading, spelling, social adjustment, and total adjustment. Significant differences, favoring white pupils, occurred in all three achievement areas, but no differences were noted in adjustment. Significant interactions, educational implications, suggestions for further research, and an extensive bibliography are included. (RT)",

Orientation to forthcoming changes in the teacher's role includes consideration of programed instruction, flexible scheduling, and differentiated teaching staff. The focus of the Center is reformulated to consider three types of variables: the behavioral (\"the observable, objectively denotable, verbal and nonverbal behavior that occurs in the interaction of teachers and students in the classroom\"), the personological (\"the traits and characteristics of teachers that intervene between variables at the institutional level\"), and the institutional (\"phenomena and events that occur in the society at large, the community, school  system, and the individual school\"). Section 2, \"Program Summary and Projection,\" delineates each of these major problem areas by describing existing projects and projecting plans for years immediately ahead. Section 3 concentrates on \"Facilities and Services\" and Section 4 on \"Center Management and Administration.\" Section 5, the budget, is not included because it was submitted separately.

Special features of the program include using community members as lecturers to interact with the students and serve as liaison with local minority groups, having students live together at a location within the  urban community, and coordinating the preservice education program with an inservice program for public school personnel. Included in this report are two outside evaluations (primarily descriptive) of the program which were written by Raymond Budde, University of Maine, and Maureen Lapan, Rhode Island College. Appended is a daily activities log prepared by a student in the preservice teacher education part of the program.

The first three papers, by Lindley J. Stiles, Robert Maidment, and Lloyd S. Michael, deal with the functions and responsibilities of both the clinical professor and the public schools under the Northwestern plan. Roland H. Nelson, Jr., explores the role dilemmas facing clinical professors. Richard E. Collier and James F. Collins present cooperative plans developed by the University of Maryland and the Montgomery County, Md., public schools. Arthur S. Bolster, Jr., a clinical professor in a dual assignment with Harvard University and the Newton,  Mass., schools, explores the institutional and professional stresses facing the clinical professor, and John A. Granito explores the new role as it relates to one of omnipresent state departments of education. The final two papers place the clinical professorship in its historical and operational context. William R. Hazard summarizes the interdisciplinary planning, development, and operation of the program at Northwestern, and James B. Conant reviews the historical evolution and development of the clinical professorship. Reactions to and discussions of the papers (following each presentation) were edited to convey the essence of the conference proceedings. (Author/JS)",

Advantaged and disadvantaged schools were selected; one of each was a control school, while the other six were experimental schools. Involved were 59 teachers and over 2,000 children. Six mental health consultants, assigned one to each experimental school, met with the same group of teachers  weekly and were available for individual conferences. Pre- and postquestionnaires were administered to every teacher and child in the eight schools. Each consultant kept a log of the 15 weekly sessions, consultations, and classroom visits. Results indicated: (1) In the control schools, where there were no consultants, only negative behavioral and attitudinal changes occurred. (2) To the extent that consultants and teachers together clearly defined the goals of their meetings, there were positive changes in teacher and student behavior.

        "description":"Classroom interaction may be described in terms of communication events, i.e., sequences of teacher-pupil communicative behaviors separated from preceding and succeeding sequences of behaviors by natural boundaries. Communication events may be institutional (related to managing the classroom and meeting the expectations of the institution), task (focused on teaching and learning subject matter), personal (centered on the personal needs, goals, and emotions of a pupil, a group of pupils, and/or the teacher), or mixed (containing elements of two or more types). Events may also be identified as individual (interaction between a teacher and one student) or group (interaction between a teacher and several students). These events may be symbolized: I = institutional events; P =  personal events; T = task events; M = mixed events. Individual events can then be indicated by placing an &quot;i&quot; after the symbol which appropriately characterizes a particular event. Duration of an incident may be recorded by tallying dots after the symbol at 3-second intervals as long as the event continues. The resultant model (called PIT for &quot;personal,&quot;&quot;institutional,&quot; and &quot;task&quot;) for analyzing classroom communication has been applied to video tapes representing 1,360 minutes of interaction in junior high school classrooms and has yielded some interesting data. It has a number of potential research applications and may be used in combination with other observation systems. (Author/SG)",

Asahel D. Woodruff's model of behavior as an energy system characterized by perception, concept formation, decisionmaking, trial, and feedback was adopted to accomplish these purposes. The first two components of this model were used for a series of regional workshops in teacher education. Major content components of the workshop format were interaction analysis, nonverbal  classroom communication, microteaching, and simulation, each presented by an expert in the development of that particular area, backed up by an instructional materials specialist. Small groups of participants viewed a video tape presentation of each content model, followed by discussion. When all participants had been exposed to all four models, content and design and media utilization were analyzed in large-group discussion, and alternative models were presented. The evaluation component substantiated the workshops' effectiveness. (Included are detailed presentations of each component of the workshop format plus bibliographies.) (SG)",

More community attention will now be directed toward how paraprofessionals are selected, trained, utilized, and how professionals are trained in working with them (learning from them as well as imparting knowledge to them). Moreover, there will be an increasing focus on the paraprofessional's role in producing reorganization and expansion of the human service  system. Several related trends may coalesce with the paraprofessional movement to produce such change: the demand for accountability of the professions, the demand for community control and decentralization, the whole new involvement of the ghetto in regard to the human service agenda, and the great concern among increasing numbers of professionals regarding the nature of their profession. The paraprofessional by his very existence \"inside the system\" may increase the relevance of services and improve contact through his bridge or two-way communication role, functioning as a translator, expeditor, ombudsman, and advocate.

Behavioral studies investigate technical skills, teacher effectiveness, small group instruction, computer assisted instruction, methods of teaching children to recognize alternative answers and inappropriate certitude, and the effects of anxiety on intellectual processes. Studies of the teacher-pupil relationship are made within the personological domain using a photographic pupillometer, factor  analysis, and other devices to test pupil interest and cognitive preference. Studies in the institutional domain involve the organizational context of teaching, the professional socialization of teachers, and teachers' attitudes toward innovation. Present and future work is based on three problem areas--heuristic teaching (developing self-motivated and sustained inquiry, emphasizing affective as well as cognitive processes, and placing a high value upon the uniqueness of each pupil, teacher, and learning situation), teaching environment, and teaching the disadvantaged--which are extensions of previous research.

These elements are the logical objectives for a program of teacher education and the criteria for assessing teacher effectiveness. By successively defining the largest meaningful components at each stage of analysis, the analyst insures that he will define all the components he can conceptualize and identify all the possible relationships of those components. Teacher educators and teaching evaluators subjectively decide to terminate analysis when further analysis is not justified in terms of cost and effort. Then, for each significant element of the total behavior, learning systems can  be devised to enable future teachers to be effective. This total model of defining objectives, criteria, and learning systems for teacher education is itself a system, which possesses self-correction capability through the analyst's continual reexamination of his judgments.

Differences between the scale means of  American and German samples were significant. Comparisons of teacher education students from different universities confirmed the importance of religion as a sampling variable, but data provided little evidence that age, college class, sex or commitment to elementary or secondary education are potent variables for anticipating variability in open-closed mindedness. Teaching major appeared to be related to the scores, and thus a matter of consideration in drawing teacher education samples. There was no evidence that students in teacher education are more authoritarian or dogmatic than university students in general.

Four goals of the classroom simulation were identified and practiced in three training modes: (1) four at a time, the simultaneous mode; (2) two separately and two together, the combination mode; (3) one at a time, the successive mode. The subjects, undergraduate students in elementary education at Oregon College of Education and University of Oregon in 1965-66 and 1966-67, were randomly assigned to the three treatments, and data was obtained from simulation pre-, post-, and retention tests and from two classroom evaluations of subsequent  student teaching behavior. The conclusion after analyses of variance was that the simultaneous method was more efficient. Data revealed no significant interaction of cognitive and personality factors with training modes, but this exploratory phase of the research was limited (as was the total effort) by methodological and conceptual problems.

Domains of organismic adaptation roughly corresponding to (1) the need for internal regulatory mechanisms that permit survival and growth of the organism (regulatory domain), (2) the need for interpersonal relationships which lead to the perpetuation and social ordering of the species (interpersonal domain), and (3) the need for competencies which permit adaptations to external environmental demands (cognitive domain) may be identified. Each domain is composed of three systems: regulatory-physical, emotionality,  and identity; interpersonal-sexual, status, and friendship-love; cognitive-psychomotor, intellectual, and attitudinal. It is assumed that only cognitive or competence outcomes are &quot;learned.&quot; Outcomes in the vital domain are viewed as accrued &quot;residue&quot; from all that happens to an organism in the course of its existence, while outcomes in the interpersonal domain are seen as &quot;shaped&quot; rather than learned.

Joint Inquiry is implemented through a five-phase cycle (planning, observation, analysis, strategy, and conference) related to seven underlying principles: (1) The I.M. and the trainer jointly share understanding of the problem situation. (2) Shared understanding demands full exchange of information. (3) The I.M. must attempt to achieve his goals, not the trainer's. (4) There will be no learning unless the I.M. makes a provisional try, i.e.,  exposes his behavior. (5) After making a provisional try, the I.M. must receive information about his performance, not about his personality. (6) The I.M. must receive information about the effects of his performance. (7) The I.M. performance indicates the order in which desired changes are to be accomplished. Transcripts of the teaching act plus records from planning sessions and conferences serve as a basis for further counseling and referral. An evaluation team consisting of a group of trainers determines when the I.M. has completed the practicum.

RUPS is an instructional system for an inservice program designed to provide the needed competencies for an entire staff to engage in systems analysis and systems synthesis procedures prior to assessing educational needs and developing curriculum to meet the needs identified. Thirteen instructional problems (or instructional subsets) necessitating research utilization and problem solving skills are delineated: identifying a problem, using research about the classroom, diagnosis using force field technique, diagnosing teamwork relationship, data gathering skills, selecting tools for data collection, spotting the major results in data, anchored trainer ratings, the  concept of feedback, deriving implications and action alternatives, planning for action, small group dynamics, planning for action practicum. Instructional/learning objectives and product performance specifications are provided for each instructional subset. Where appropriate, instructional strategy steps and materials are also specified.

Competencies in the interpersonal behaviors dimensions are listed under five subcategories: personal descriptive dimensions, meaning in terms of group process and group dimensions of growth, intra- and interpersonal purposefulness of the personal behavior-learning climate, extrapersonal purposefulness of the interaction, and meaning of the  behavioral as an interpersonal relationship.

Both are directly related to the &quot;global objective&quot; of providing for adaptive capabilities. The first reason derives from the already established mental health movement in our schools--the accepted responsibility for the personal and social development of students as well as the charge to develop intellectual abilities. The value of a focus on teacher self-definition, self-evaluation, and self-direction in providing for adaptive capabilities has received support from both clinical and educational sources. The second reason for concern comes from advances in the efficient acquisition of knowledge through the use of programed materials,  particularly those mediated by computer. This is a trend that is gaining momentum and that will require increasing numbers of teachers being trained today to accept roles in education quite different from those of the past. These roles will emphasize the human factors in education that cannot be handled by machines. A model teacher education program should attend specifically to the conditions requisite to achieving a total individualization of education.

The major purpose was to provide an opportunity for each student to examine his behavior in a safe and supportive environment to assist him in establishing a set of beliefs and commitments congruent with his makeup and relevant to the teaching profession. Of the 40 junior and senior students who volunteered for the study, 20 served as a control group. The 20 participants each met with the experimenter for five or six 1-hour weekly interviews to discuss the interaction between the student's personality profile (compiled from a test battery) and his  philosophical commitment, and to analyze a video tape record of his student teaching performance. Three independent judges viewed 16 video tapes, eight representative of each group, and rated each student on use of expression, reactions with pupils, and style of presentation. Although the interrater reliability was extremely high and analysis of variance of scores yielded a significant difference in experimental and control group ratings, the unsophisticated nature of the research leaves many unresolved questions.

Inservice seminars were conducted by University of Oregon personnel for volunteer teachers who desired to have teacher aides. Aides, selected from the Upward Bound program at the University, received preservice training through the department of teacher education at the University and were enrolled in two education  courses there. Release time teachers were hired as consultants to work with the cooperating teachers, and graduate research assistantships were granted to provide for quality control research. The program evaluation indicated that major weaknesses stemmed from managerial problems which do not affect the general feasibility of the New Careers model but that the model should be further developed with a careful delineation of the training and curriculum for both teachers and teacher aides.

Each of 12 school district superintendents from the 17 largest U.S. cities identified an elementary school attended by many disadvantaged children; then principals of those schools selected randomly two teachers at each grade level to provide information (over a 10-day period) to be used in the construction of an instrument entitled, &quot;My Biggest Problem Today Inventory.&quot; Three doctoral assistants synthesized the approximately 1,400 critical incidents into 184 somewhat  different problem statements which served as the basis for construction of a 184-item instrument, &quot;The Teacher Problem Inventory&quot; (TPI), which requests respondents to consider each problem statement in terms of its frequency of occurrence and its severity. The TPI was then administered to all 287 K-6 teachers in the cooperating schools (Major results of the data analysis are appended: (1) chi square values for the 96 problems significant on either the frequency or severity scales or both, (2) frequency percentages and rank orders for the 45 significant problems reported by more than 1/3 of the respondents as either frequent or severe or both, (3) the 37 major problems grouped under nine categories.)

Role definition and specialization of purpose tend to place the teacher in the role of lower level functionary rather than autonomous professional. Principles of organizational change indicate that to produce change in such a system would require the linking of functionaries, the provision for communication between those at the top and at the bottom, the engaging in programatic activities which are centered in the situation where the functionaries are at work, and the selection of school systems and individuals who seem  to have a propensity for testing out new ideas. If schools are to be related to the educational development of children and are to serve other than a gatekeeper or bureaucratic function, priority should be given to (1) programs which design a closer meshing of university and school personnel in a situational context, (2) emphasis on the education and reeducation of administrators, supervisors, and long-term professionals who are in control of the school systems, (3) program development which looks to vertical contexts in professional development, and (4) diagnosis of school difficulties, both teaching and administrative, as the beginning point of courses, with field experiences viewed as mandatory.

        "description":"In response to a challenge by the Kansas City Public Schools superintendent, Central Missouri State College (CMSC) instituted the Inner City Teacher Education Project (ICTEP) to prepare teachers in teaching and understanding disadvantaged children. Originally a spare-time program of field trips and seminars, it was developed in 1965 into a full-time 5- to 6-month block with four instructors and 24 students involved in conventional teacher education courses, a thorough study of ethnic groups, minorities and the poor, at least nine hours of psychology and sociology, field trips to the inner city, and inner city student teaching. Because ICTEP was a departure from standard teacher preparation with excellent results (favorable reports from Kansas City and winner of the 1966 American  Association of Colleges for Teacher Education Distinguished Achievement Award), the program raised serious questions about the relevance of conventional teacher education, causing great dissension on the CMSC campus. The number of students participating in the program decreased, and in 1966, six of the seven most closely involved with the project resigned. However, one of those who resigned, Dr. Grant Clothier (who joined the Mid-Continent Regional Educational Laboratory), is planning a project patterned after ICTEP for fall, 1967 (see SP 002 249).

Another technique emphasizes individual experiences in school and community, a program in which the needs and individual skills of interns are diagnosed and structured into a system for involving students in the community. In addition, brief reports of the other techniques used in the program are provided, such as a human relations training laboratory, microteaching, and the use of individual team leader and intern skills.

An experimental group was composed of a representative sample of students (grades 10-12) and graduates who attended the University of Nebraska's University High School and were taught entirely by supervised student teachers. A control group was composed of students and graduates from Nebraska high schools staffed by regular teachers. An attitude scale was created to measure the affective domain, and scores on the National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (NMSQT) along with university grade point averages were used as measures of high school and post high school cognitive achievement. Analysis of covariance was used  in making the comparison, with intelligence quotient and socioeconomic level being the covariants. Results indicated that students taught by student teachers reached a higher level of achievement than did students taught by regular teachers. Therefore, instruction provided by supervised student teachers seemed to be no less effective than that provided by experienced teachers. Also, the impact of student teachers upon student attitude toward school and teachers was as positive as that of regular teachers and is greatest and most positive in close student-teacher contact.

Data included in this document, prepared in response to requests for information on MAT programs, is derived from TEACHER PRODUCTIVITY--1967, published by The American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education (AACTE). Shared objectives of MAT programs are briefly enumerated and include making college graduates eligible for  certification and enabling inservice teachers to add an additional teaching field to the one in which they are now certified. A table presenting the variations from state to state in the number of persons reported to have been made eligible for initial certification through MAT programs is included in the introduction, along with totals of the number of people made eligible for initial certification through both MAT programs and all kinds of programs. A major limitation of the data, that all MAT programs are included regardless of their nature, is also noted. (SM)",

D. W.

The schema developed to order and integrate this kind of learning is called the wheel. Arranged around the rim of the wheel in a logical progression are six distinct media: the body, design, sound, photography, the moving image, and print. Since communication is both active and reactive (e.g., creating and listening to sounds), learning activities which explore content to be taught and which involve action and reaction can be designed for each medium on the wheel. The advantages of a wheel-oriented curriculum are that it offers  easy access to more content areas, is in closer touch with natural learning, and provides a better context for teaching literacy skills.

A recording by Bill Cosby, for instance, can be studied as an example of satire and can encourage discussion and writing. A record festival in the classroom not only lets the teacher hear what the young are thinking but also gives the students practice in organizing, selecting entries, evaluating, and writing advertisements and invitations. Furthermore, the lyrics of some current hit songs can be compared to poems, plays, and novels, or they can be used as springboards for the writing and tape-recording of original poetry. Other resources are plays given on television and in the community, old sets of  anthologies, columns in various newspapers or magazines, talks by fellow teachers, and novels and articles read aloud by the teacher himself.

A multi-level instrument of syntactic analysis, similar on the first level to the Strickland instrument, was developed and used over a 3-year period to analyze the writing of over 13,000 sentences from 2,000 compositions. Results indicated that children move steadily toward the  syntactic model of the adult writer as they grow older; that a statistically significant difference is evident between high, middle, and low I.Q. groups in their use of a variety of syntactic structures; and that children in programs using the Nebraska Project English curriculum progress toward the adult model more rapidly than do children in traditional programs.

Roger K.

James R. Squire outlines the three primary aspects of the successful English  programs: (1) strong, effective leadership of a department chairman and a building principal, (2) an English faculty which includes some outstanding teachers capable of inspiring the efforts of other well-prepared but less remarkable teachers, and (3) an English curriculum designed to meet the needs of all the students and balanced in its emphasis on each of the components of English.

Michele, a poor Sardinian shepherd falsely accused of aiding bandits, flees from the police with his younger brother and the herd of sheep that supports them. By the time they finally reach safety, the entire flock has died from exhaustion, and Michele is compelled to steal to preserve himself and his brother. Thus, he is forced by circumstances beyond his control to become the criminal he was earlier accused of being. Although presenting the harsh economic realities of the shepherds' lives, this film avoids the sentimentality of such similar films as \"How Green Was My Valley\" and thereby gains in power. If a teacher wants his students exposed to the crushing effect of  environment on the individual so that they can better comprehend the effect of the ghetto on its inhabitants, for example, this film conveys the message.

Albert H. Marckwardt surveys the history of language standards, presents the respective views of the English teacher and the linguist on standard English, and attempts to show how each can benefit from understanding the other's viewpoint. David Mackay emphasizes the need for the English teacher to relate standard English to the student's personal dialect, and to guide him in understanding and mastering the most appropriate forms. John M. Sinclair considers what the English teacher needs to  know about linguistics and what types of linguistic system would be most valuable to teachers in describing the language. Joshua Fishman points out that because mot Americans have some cultural roots in languages other than English, their sensitiveness to these languages should be taken into account by the teacher of English. The last paper, the final report of the joint working party and study group, presents seven main issues that must be dealt with in any discussion of teacher education and language learning. (LH)",

Chapter 1 explains the function of structure in written composition. An extensive second chapter cites and discusses 15 children's literature selections divided among units for two educational levels (K-3 and 4-6) and for advanced students. Children's expected achievement levels, objectives, and suggested learning experiences are given for each selection. Chapter 3 contains two  illustrations of the use of literary models: the first illustration presents 12 sample lessons for fifth-grade children, and the second is comprised of items from a test on understanding figurative language used experimentally with 145 sixth-grade children.

        "description":"Literature can play a prominent part in revitalizing the teaching of English because it can provide students with both immediate and future rewards. As an immediate reward, literature allows students to imaginatively experience situations which they have not yet encountered. It thus acts acts as a liberating force for young people from the confines of limited experience and inadequate knowledge of human nature. The \"ultimate reward\" of literature is obtained \"through the chemistry of experience and verbal symbol.\" Through the metaphoric, imaginative language of literature, men can identify and indirectly come to terms with their fears and sorrows. Another reason why literature should figure prominently in the English curriculum is that the study of literature can be significantly  related to the study of composition and language. The oral reading of literature, as well as dramatic activities, can not only provide an additional dimension of experience with literature but also help students gain further comprehension and appreciation. Also, three basic kinds of writing can grow out of the study of a literary work: interpretative and critical, imitative, and writing that derives from ideas, meanings, or literary elements. (SW)",

Thus, a teacher in the primary grades, made aware that his students have learned their language well in the first 4 or 5 years of their lives, can attempt to interest children in understanding suprasegmentals of language, in expanding basic sentence patterns, in learning informal  standard English, and in expressing their own ideas in writing.

Although a perfect critical system which accommodates all literary works and illustrates their interrelationships is lacking, the teacher can provide the student with four types of literary criticism and demonstrate the value of each to elucidate literature and reveal the workings of the imagination. Literal criticism considers the work of art as an isolated artifact which forms its meaning only through its verbal structure. Descriptive criticism turns to such extensional contexts as  social and historical perspectives and autobiographical documentation. Formal criticism is intent on extracting the meaning of a work's total structure and on relating this meaning to typical life in the actual world and to other works in the genre. Myth criticism unifies literature by comparing and relating the dominant patterns and ideas that perpetually recur in human literary criticism. (LH)",

Since many modern writers frequently ignore the guidelines proffered in traditional writing handbooks, the &quot;new rhetoric&quot;--a descriptive approach to composition that substitutes objective, verifiable data for traditional rules--can be of immediate practical value to the teacher in describing contemporary writing models. An analysis of a paragraph from Ray Bradbury's &quot;A Sound of Thunder,&quot; based on such quantitative descriptions as frequency counts of words, sentence length, modal varieties and repetitions, and grammatical and rhetorical constructs, indicates that Bradbury almost entirely ignores most traditional advice and  achieves his effect through a &quot;cumulative&quot; layering that builds the paragraph sentence-by-sentence in a manner similar to the phrase-by-phrase construction of a sentence. By leading students through such an analysis of contemporary writers and then devising suitable exercises based on the principles discovered in the models, the teacher can clearly and exactly guide his young writers in the process of composition.

Harbans Singh Bhola has identified four major issues which have immediate relevance to English education and which must be faced by educators: the individual versus the group, local versus state control, the common versus the elite, and the right to privacy versus public obligations. Although the role of teachers has changed over the past 25 years from that of generalists to academic specialists who guide student inquiry, teachers must constantly identify the social needs of the present and devise programs to fit the changing values of students.  Furthermore, whole school curriculums need to undergo reorganization in response to new knowledge and modern developments in technology. The potential of education in society can be fully realized only if teaching practices and curriculums are continually evaluated and if socially relevant innovations are planned and instituted at a more rapid pace than in the past.

All sections met 3 times weekly, and the research was conducted during a consecutive 8-day period. The students were exposed to expository material on small group discussion through one of four ways: observing a television lecture, listening to the identical lecture read from a manuscript by their regular instructors, reading the televised lecture individually, or receiving normally scheduled instruction by their instructors. A control group received no instruction on the topic. A true experimental pre-test--post-test control group design  was employed, with the use of \"t\" test and analysis of variance (single factor) procedures. Results showed that televised instruction was just as efficient as the other methods used, and that no method was superior to any other one. Although certain limitations might have influenced the results, it is concluded that there is no reason to condemn television as an inferior method of instruction. (SW)",

Since the decision, certain conclusions about the status of the Bible in the curriculum can be drawn. (1) Except for programs designed to circumvent the law, few schools provide an opportunity for students to study Biblical literature. (2) Because Biblical literature is an essential part of a student's literary education, the need for teaching the Bible as literature is clear. (3) The teaching of the Bible as literature is within the law. (4) Traditional textbooks provide only  an inadequate sampling of Biblical materials. (5) The Bible remains a controversial aspect of the curriculum, and, therefore, teachers should frame a clear philosophy of why they are using Biblical selections. (JS)",

Improvement in composition was measured by five reader-rating variables--organization, style, working and aspects of phrasing, quality and development of ideas, and a total of the previous four variables. Related language growth was measured by analyzing the students' writing through the use of seven variables, part of which were based on the T-unit. Results  indicated that the teaching of selected concepts of invention, arrangement, and style significantly aided growth in written composition of above-average third-grade children, with girls improving more than boys; that the experimental program did not produce significant gains in grades 4, 5, and 6; that the seven language-related variables were of little value in measuring growth in written composition; and that boys and girls demonstrated no appreciable difference in sentence-structure ability at any one grade level.

        "description":"The interest and delight which students find in film should be preserved from a teacher's excessive zeal to analyze and explain. As the beauty of poetry is frequently diminished through exhaustive analyses of similes, rhyme schemes, and other technical devices, the value of film to high school students can be weakened through too great an emphasis on \"film appreciation, movie comprehension, image recognition, visual-media technology,\" and other standard but dull teaching devices. Rather than following such methods, a teacher should watch and react to the film with his students, talk with them afterward, listen to their opinions, guide them back to the film when necessary, let them explore relationships between the film and their imaginations and lives, and, above all, let them  see the film their own way. Instead of explaining how and what the film means, the teacher should encourage the student to expand his awareness through empathy and identification with what he sees in the film. (LH)",

The 20th century, despite its scientific and technological advances, has been dominated by myth; and White's book, with its suffering and &quot;existential squirm,&quot;&quot;is a veritable bellwether for our time.&quot; (Suggested teaching activities for a unit on the quest motif are listed.

In addition, the concept that the &quot;mass&quot; can develop into an &quot;audience&quot; with specific interests and demands was considered. The four sources of information for the research were official government records in London and Kuala Lumpur, interviews with Malay schoolteachers, the pre-war Malay press, and a local survey in the subdistrict of Ulu Langat, Selangor, Malaya. The investigation revealed that, at the establishment of the colonial government (1896), the Malays of the Federated Malay States were not a homogeneous community, but a diversity of Malaysian peoples. The  period of British rule saw the emergence of the Malay community as colonial policies caused both stimulation and reaction. Among the educational forces contributing to the creation of a cultural community were the government Malay vernacular primary schools, the trained Malay schoolteachers, the Islamic religious teachers, and the secular Malay vernacular press.

The main purpose of the project was to build a structured program for high school students which would focus on building musicianship and which could be integrated with the study, rehearsal, and performance of the choral score. The principal product was a 2-year, two-volume instructional program entitled &quot;Choral Musicianship,&quot; dealing with both the development of concepts and skills related to pitch, rhythm, texture, and form and the characteristic uses of the structural elements in choral music of major historical periods. A  pilot program, with 361 experimental subjects in five high school classes, will be completed and evaluated after the date of this report.

        "description":"A study conducted at Harvard University proposed to obtain evidence concerning the use of art museum exhibitions by public school groups and to determine better ways of improving that use. Interviews, with museum staff and school personnel, were conducted at 57 museums in various geographical locations. The evidence identified several attitudes and current practices: (1) Many art museums tolerate school visits as an obligation to be endured. (2) Many teachers are too ill-trained to visit an art museum with confidence. (3) Visits frequently take on the nature of an outing. (4) Only a few educational exhibits in museums are especially designed for school use. (5) The museum's permanent collection is apt to serve better than temporary exhibits. (6) Visits to museums are rare for  high school students during school hours. Some of the recommendations were (1) that teams, each composed of a museum staff member and a school official, might promote school-museum interchange in many parts of the country, (2) that further study should be given to the use of television correlated with museum visits, and (3) that the burden of education in the arts should be borne by the school system. (Excerpts from interviews conducted with museum personnel comprise the major portion of this report.) (Author/SW)",

        "description":"One part of this review of research contains summaries of studies offering sociogenic or psychogenic explanations for the behavior of members of different social classes. The former position, which deemphasizes the importance of child rearing practices in the socialization process, maintains that the adult personality modal to a particular class is made up of behaviors necessary for performing the role of a member of that class; in contrast, the latter position posits that class differences in child rearing practices produce modal personality characteristics which have a constraining influence on other behavior. Another section includes reviews of studies of social class differences in child rearing practices of families in Chicago, Boston, Detroit, and Eugene (Oregon). Also  reviewed are studies which stress the continuing nature of socialization through the adult years as part of a life cycle and place less emphasis on childhood socialization. These studies explain social class differences by either a social-economic-ecological, a genetic, or a developmental interpretation. Developmentalists attempt to understand the effects of the sociological variable of social class membership in terms of the psychological variable of personal development level. (EF)",

The paper by Joan Gussow, &quot;Behavioral Management and Educational Goals,&quot; is concerned with operant conditioning as a theory of learning and an instructional method. Basing their methods on the work of B.F. Skinner, educators who are proponents of this theory emphasize &quot;positive reinforcement and its use in shaping and maintaining new and desired behaviors.&quot; Gussow discusses some applications of operant conditioning--behavior management techniques, and a contingency management system. Also noted are some of the philosophical issues raised by this learning theory. Harold L. Cohen's paper, &quot;The Educational Model,&quot; summarizes two previous articles. He discusses his involvement with a special  education project which is studying the factors &quot;that can change and maintain learning behavior.&quot; (NH)",

        "description":"Most Southern public schools are still unintegrated despite the 1954 Supreme Court decision. This study sought to determine the causal factors related to the decision of those Negro mothers who did enroll their children in white schools. Samples were 207 Negro mothers with children in grades one through five who were enrolled in a North Carolina school district which had opted for a &quot;free choice&quot; plan. Interviewers were Negro women. The following factors were found to be significant for an increase in the probability of the mother's making a &quot;favorable&quot; decision: valuation of education, perception of educational facilities differential, educational expectations, (inversely) perception of Negro social approval, valuation of desegregation, knowledge of the environment, and  powerlessness. Two models were tested, and a fused model constructed. The important causal variables found were: knowledge of the environment, powerlessness, valuation of desegregation, and valuation of education. Noted was a conflict between pride in blackness and a desire for good education (usually white controlled). Community controlled supplemental schools teaching black culture could lessen this conflict and school integration should be reciprocal. (Author)",

Data were gathered by student questionnaires and school records. Subjects were Negro and white eighth grade students in a recently desegregated Southern junior high school. Findings show that the educational and occupational level of fathers, their administration of rewards, and also the frequency with which reward is coupled with school achievement are  particularly relevant factors. Sex of student and race of teacher in relation to race of student also seem to influence the probability of achievement. (NH)",

Some 1980 projections are: (1) continued reduction in land in farms, (2) continued reduction in number of farmers, (3) a sharp reduction in the number of farms, (4) further specialization of farms, (5)  markedly greater capital and credit needs per farm, (6) far less total labor needs in agriculture, (7) higher managerial requirements needed to successfully operate the larger farm business, and (8) greater need for education for both those remaining in agriculture and those moving out.

Clinical judgment is defined as involving the ability to make sound decisions after gathering and evaluating all the pertinent evidence, weighing possible alternatives in terms of past experience or normative probabilities, and arriving at problem solutions which reflect basic science orientations. The plan worked to determine the reliability of the judge's estimates and to correlate their estimates and the composite success scores. Ten judges, including clinical psychologists, guidance counselors, and home economic teacher educators each analyzed 16 randomly assigned cases, providing two evaluations per  case. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences among judges, subjects, and measures, and that correlation of judges' estimates and composite success scores was not feasible. All types of predictive data were considered useful as they were referred to in the judges' evaluation. The appendix contains interpretations of test scores and samples of the judges' rating sheet.

Data were derived from interviews with labor market authorities in each country. Generally, relocation assistance in each country covered the cost of transportation from the home area to the new place of employment, the cost of the removal of personal possessions, and a starting or settling-in allowance. Major deterrents to mobility included: (1) lack of adequate housing in areas with employment  opportunities, (2) reluctance to leave the home area and (3) lack of knowledge of the availability of relocation assistance. Efforts to bring jobs to depressed areas through inducements to industry should be supplemented with efforts to move the unemployed, or underemployed worker to areas where employment is available.

        "description":"As of October 1963, there were 102 associate degree programs in nursing, 82 of them in 2-year institutions. These 82 represented only 3 percent of the 704 junior colleges listed in the 1963 Junior College Directory. Surveys were conducted to discover the factors that led to or inhibited establishment of nursing programs. The volume of full-time enrollment is the characteristic that most influences the college's interest. The comparatively high cost of nursing programs, difficulty in providing the necessary physical facilities within the college, and inadequacy of clinical facilities are factors which deter program development. Finding a qualified nurse administrator was also a crucial factor for administrators who had faced the problem. Some recommendations were: (1) eliminating  nursing programs in junior colleges in which total enrollments are under 500 and forecasts indicate only limited increases, (2) educating controlling boards to the need for a preplanning period for the nurse administrator prior to admission of students, (3) alerting junior colleges to availability of federal funds under the Nurse Training Act of 1964, and (4) establishing nursing programs only when sufficient qualified faculty are obtainable. Appendixes include questionnaires and survey data. This Ed.D. thesis was submitted to Columbia University. (JK)",

The project provided vocational counselors to participate on several of Fort Logan's eight psychiatric teams which served 800 patients, of whom only a small percentage were under 24-hour care. During this initial period, 479 patients were served in some way by the project and 236 were placed on training or on jobs. It was concluded that a reasonable proportion of persons treated for major mental illnesses  can return to work, some in spite of immense residual emotional handicaps, and it was estimated that 90 percent could benefit from vocational counseling and rehabilitation services. Integration of the vocational counselor on the therapeutic team increases the counselor's sensitivity to the patient's therapeutic needs and the hospital's sensitivity to his vocational needs.

The states each must submit a state plan to the U.S. Commissioner of Education outlining their vocational education programs. Apprenticeship programs are operated voluntarily by firms or trade unions in cooperation with the U.S. Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training. A wide variety of on-the-job training is available  through many types of employers and is generally considered the most effective type of company training. Technical education is often offered at post-secondary technical institutes or junior colleges. Some of these schools date back over 100 years and many are proprietary in nature.

U.S. Department of Labor and 1960 census data were used to estimate the 1961 growth and replacement demand for each craftsman and operative occupation and this was compared with average annual training output for 1960-1963 as determined by the questionnaire. Analysis showed that in the early 1960's less than half the demand for the  occupations was met by regional vocational education resources. The training is concentrated in a narrow range of traditional skills and is only partly responsive to actual needs. The rate at which new courses have been added since 1960 is negligible.

The 3-day seminar included 39 participants from seven states, Guam, and The Vocational Rehabilitation Administration. The intense and concerted emphasis on cost effectiveness and cost benefits analysis makes it necessary for the state to build a competent statistical system to provide meaningful data for the determination of content through proper reporting and collection techniques, analysis, dissemination, application, and follow-through. Some of the statistical reports discussed during the seminar include the referral caseload, the active case load,  length of time to close cases, historical caseload relationships, acceptance rates by source of referral, and rehabilitation rates by source of referral. Discussion effectively revealed many of the strengths and weaknesses in program operations, and provided a means for measuring the effectiveness of agency policy, program development, and training needs.

The 491 female participants indicated the degree of difficulty experienced on a one to nine rank scale. Six clusters of items found to be intercorrelated were: employment, clothing, social adjustment, money, food management, and food preparation. Results showed: (1) Girls living with parents considered parental acceptance of them as adults to be their greatest problem, and (2) Girls away from home reported budgeting, housing, housekeeping, and finding compatible roommates as problems. Interpersonal  relationships on a social basis were of greater concern than those on the job. Nutrition created more difficulty than food preparation. Decision making about jobs created more difficulty than keeping jobs and getting along at work. As the population of the home town increased, problems in employment and food management decreased. As semesters of home economics completed increased, the problems in clothing and food preparation decreased. Clerical workers had the fewest problems with employment.

Questionnaires were administered to 87 randomly selected employees chosen from 6 different locations in Iowa. The responses were analyzed to determine common tasks. The three occupations were found to be predominantly women, 36 years of age or over, married, and working part-time. A core of 11 items related to household maintenance were found to be common to the three occupations. Homemaker/home health aide  performed the greatest number of unique tasks. Six clusters of tasks in relation to their function were formed. Tasks most frequently performed by the homemaker/health aides were those related to food production; those performed most frequently by hotel/motel and nursing home housekeeping aides were household maintenance. It was recommended that common and unique knowledges and competencies be determined in order to suggest training programs. Initial training in the common core was recommended with a specialized training for homemaker/home health aides. Training programs should be available to both high school age and adult students.

The decision to use auxiliary personnel is based on the conviction that there are differential needs of clients that may be met by persons with an educational and experience background in fields other than social work. Auxiliary positions relating to administrative procedures are: administrative aide, research and statistical assistant, and welfare assistant. Those in direct service to the clients might be a household helper and homemaker, or a neighborhood worker.  Specific details are described for assessment of needs, scope and content of services, analysis of organization and staffing patterns, restriction of jobs, written politices, supervision and training, program evaluation, and community relationships. Illustrative job specifications for use in the development of class specifications for auxiliary positions for family services in public welfare agencies are included, together with information on how to adapt and interpret them to reflect specific programs, job content, and agency organization.

Employment needs were ascertained and a 1980 projection of supply and demand for professional pilots was formulated. A mathematical model for computer prediction was also developed. Existing pilot and mechanic curriculums were analyzed and an improved curriculum was devised. Two sites in the Phoenix area were proposed, and their usefulness for a national training program was examined with respect to location, land, runways, buildings, and utilities. Related to this examination was an analysis of the employment impact on a nearby Indian reservation. Cost  estimates were developed on the basis of 500, 1,000, 1,500, and 2,000 student enrollment modules and a general financing plan was developed. Short and long range program plans were developed which included land leases and site development, an industry-sponsored non-profit educational organiztion, and designs for proposed facilities.

Almost all formally trained technologists are being produced by the 1,200 hospital schools approved by the American Medical Association Council on Medical Education which provide courses 24 or more months in length, and more than 90 percent of which are terminal without college affiliation. There are approximately 60 colleges and universities (mostly community or junior colleges) which offer associate degree programs and a dozen which have developed or are  developing baccalaureate degree programs. It is hoped that the college affiliated programs will produce more and more of the technologists of the future. The American Medical Association Council on Medical Education has made available \"Essentials of an Approved School of Radiologic Technology\" and \"Essentials of an Approved School of Technologists in Radiation Therapy.\" The publication of \"Essentials of an Acceptable School for Nuclear Medical Technicians and Technologists\" is anticipated.

The survey revealed employer receptivity to employment of retardates in both large and small companies, and emphasized the need for training of supervisors who are to work with retardates. Specific questions covered by  the survey include: Would you anticipate difficulty with a union in your company in the hiring of mentally retarded employees? Would you expect any problems with your insurances if you hired mentally retarded employees? Are there any occupations in your company for which you think it practical to waive educational requirements for persons otherwise qualified to do the work? (CH)",

The practical nurse study seeks to determine whether certain biographical data or stated reasons or goals for entering practical nursing programs relate to the probability of program completion and employment as a graduate. Over 3,000 1962 enrollees were chosen as a 20 percent random sample of the 693 approved practical nursing programs in existence at the beginning of the study. At the time of the report, each person had completed a maximum of three questionnaires: one on entrance to the training program, one on  graduation, and a third 1 year after graduation. The findings to date indicate a composite picture of the person most likely to succeed as a woman over 25, married, and a member of the lower middle income group. She should show signs of stability, modest ability, need, and a commitment to others. Her high school accomplishment would have been average.

It was observed that even though the problems of disadvantaged ghetto residents vary and the programs to employ them vary, there are commonalities in the various approaches that can be instructive to employers who are developing programs for the employment of the hard-core unemployed. Among the program components and issues discussed are:  (1) developing an understanding of the special problems of the hard-core, (2) top management involvement, (3) Union Participation, (4) Screening, Testing, and Selection, (5) Restructuring Jobs, (6) The Question of Payment, (7) Transportation Difficulties, (8) Orientation Procedures, (9) Use of Discipline, (10) pre-vocational and on-the-job training, (11) preventing dropouts with the buddy system, job coaches, volunteers and other procedures, and (12) data collection and program evaluation.

This study was concerned with 33 girls enrolled in two sections of shorthand and 49 girls enrolled in two sections of typewriting at the post secondary level for the entire 2 school years of their program. The findings indicate that there is no significant difference between the performance of shorthand or typewriting students taught with automated instruction and professional personnel and those taught in the same manner utilizing  instructional assistants. Therefore it was recommended that professional teachers' time should be spent in more creative work such as preparing the material for the classroom, planning methods, and procedures to be followed, and coordinating the work of the assistants, rather than supervising skill techniques and proofreading papers which may be done as effectively by instructional assistants. With the automated method and semi-professional assistance, it should be possible to offer specialty courses even though the classes are small. (MM)",

The 71 graduates for the school years 1964-67 were compared with the 48 member control group which consisted of men interviewed but not selected for training. The leadership scores obtained indicated that the trained groups improved at a greater rate on the leadership variables measured than the control groups. It was impossible to separate the effects of training from the effects of selection when accounting for this improvement in leadership behavior. A prediction equation was developed which accounted for 25  percent of the variation in the leadership behavior measured. Some study highlights were: (1) An objective and quantitative measure of leadership behavior was obtained, (2) The selection procedure and training program accounted for impressive gains in leadership behavior, and (3) The combination of the 8-week summer workshop and the year-long internship was superior to the internship alone.

An analysis of jobs in child care services indicates that there are many jobs for all levels of training. A difference between the existing and desired levels of training for employees indicates a need to up-grade child care personnel, particularly at the technical or subprofessional level. Job descriptions, competencies for child care workers, and curriculum for child care services are outlined. A curriculum designed to prepare individuals for employment in child care services in day-care centers, nursery schools, children's institutions, medical institutions and recreational  facilities lists necessary course work at a junior college or area vocational technical school. Instructional materials are designed to develop concepts of developmental tasks and characteristics of children, environmental influences, child care services and personnel, program criteria, equipment and supplies, employee and employer characteristics, and personal professional development. They are presented in tabular form specifying content, experiences, evaluation and resources. Related materials are available as VT 003 400. (FP)",

It seeks to describe and explain variations in the labor market position of the males who were between the ages of 45-59 at the time of the initial interview in mid 1966. Forthcoming annual surveys of this same cohort will allow analysis of labor market experience and behavior, including mobility, over time. Data were derived from personal interviews with a multi-stage probability sample of 5,043 males in the civilian noninstitutional population. Attitudinal measures were included in the questionnaire. Some  conclusions were: (1) There is hardly a dimension of labor market behavior in which black men and white men do not differ, although these differences disappear in some cases when occupation is controlled, and (2) The presence of health problems is related to low labor force participation, high unemployment, low commitment to work, high propensity to retire, low rates of pay (even within major occupation groups), and relatively more dissatisfaction with current job.

The Service Station Training School has  served approximately 100 students since its beginning- - approximately 30 within any one school year. Followup of students completing the program indicate that only three are employed in work allied to the service station; however, none are listed as unemployed. (CH)",

Some recommendations were: (1) initiation of a massive information program on vocational and technical education, (2) the alliance and identification of technical education with higher education, (3) organization of joint vocational school districts on a complete county or multi-county basis, (4) greater availability of vocational education facilities, (5) certification of teachers with a trade or industrial background and a minimum of formal teacher-training, and (6) distribution of state funds on the basis of need.

The project, which lasted from September of 1963 to the summer of 1964, included basic education, vocational training, and group and personal counseling. The study focused on individual rather than program factors related to success, using data derived from questionnaires and interviews with 339 trainees, their mothers, job supervisors, and project staff. A secondary focus of the study was more on the training program itself and reactions of the trainees to the different aspects of the program. Trainees were interviewed upon entering the project, at its completion, and again six to  nine months after leaving it. Among the conclusions were: (1) Skill training is clearly the most significant aspect of these manpower programs, even when heavy emphasis is placed on other things, (2) Basic education components of these programs must focus around content that is clearly and obviously job-related, (3) The counselor's personal interest, sympathy, and supportive functions may be more important than the more formal socializing functions, and (4) While the post-training employment of program completers was more regular than that of dropouts, there were no significant wage differences.

Within all occupational categories Negroes, on the average, have worse jobs at lower rates of pay. This is revealed even in broad occupational categories such as professional, white collar, and blue collar. To maintain their present rate of progress, Negroes will need increased high school and college attendance and completion in both absolute and relative numbers. The low rate of high school completion is the greatest single obstacle to economic equality. A policy to promote economic equality might include: (1) special federal grants based on performance set up to reward school districts whose outstanding job of  helping children of the poor can be empirically measured, (2) an increase by colleges of their active research for Negro applicants, (3) an increase in parental encouragement and help, and (4) redesigning of jobs by employers.

The value of this study is its potential value in increasing the understanding of circumstances under which certain behaviors occur. In particular, this study has attempted to evaluate the usefulness of the General Aptitude Test Battery (GATB) in providing valid information to ninth grade students who are considering entrance into the senior high school vocational curriculum. The study was conducted using a sample of 92 10th grade boys in the 14 vocational shops of the Altoona area vocational-technical school. Based on the findings of this study, it appears that the GATB does provide useful information for the ninth grade student who is  contemplating entrance into the senior high school vocational curriculum. Also, it can be hypothesized that the GATB is superior to other aptitude measures in predicting shop achievement because it contains manipulative as well as cognitive aptitudes. Its value to counselors may thus lie in its ability to assess youngsters' potential motor skill development. (CH)",

The major changes to be found in this revision concerned a criterion for stating on-the-job tasks which simplify the design process, greater emphasis on the role of tests in the feedback loop, a new point of view on the statement of objectives, and a general clarification of the steps in the design and redesign process. The 10 steps of the redesign process are: (1) state the course mission, (2) identify the tasks to be learned, (3) establish gross job entry standards for inventory tasks,  (4) group the tasks for instructional planning purposes, (5) develop training exercises for each task, (6) state tentative end-of-course objectives, (7) develop lesson plans, (8) integrate lesson plans within and across instructional units, (9) conduct course and evaluate attainment of end-of-course objectives, and (10) improve the course.

The original study, conducted in Erie, Pennsylvania in 1964, involved a sample of 455 male and female blue-collar workers. The study focused on: (1) differences in jobseeking behavior among skilled, semiskilled, and unskilled workers, between old and young workers, and between men and women, (2) the relative effectiveness of the various sources of job information used by jobseekers, and (3) whether the social-psychological factors of achievement motivation, achievement values, and job interview anxiety played a  role in the jobseeking behavior of unemployed workers. Among the many findings were: (1) Reemployment success was greatest among those who did not avoid applying to certain companies and who used a wide-ranging job-hunt approach, (2) Social-psychological factors determined, in part, how early unemployed workers began their job search, their method of choosing companies at which to check, the number of companies at which to apply, and other behaviors, and (3) Workers finding new jobs through the State Employment Service had lower motivation and higher anxiety than workers finding new jobs through other techniques.

The study examined the effectiveness of the training program in upgrading its graduates and, in so doing, enhancing their earning capacities. The results of study reaffirm the finding of an earlier study involving only 12,000 trainees, which showed a general upward shift in overall hourly earnings following training as compared with pretraining earnings levels, but with differing impact upon various component groups. Some of the findings were: (1) Overall, median earnings for employed graduates were $1.73 per hour after training compared with  $1.44 before training -- an increase of 20 percent, (2) Special tabulations made for graduate trainees who were family heads showed a greater advance in earnings levels than for the trainee group as a whole, (3) Non-white family heads also had greater earnings gains, compared with the group as a whole, and (4) Over one of every four trainees moved laterally within the same earnings level, while one of every six retrogressed to a lower earnings level -- many of these, however, represented displaced workers who of necessity had to learn new skills.

Questionnaires also determined background information, reasons for taking the course, policy of organizations and relation to the participants, interests, and knowledge and job experience. Raven's progressive matrices measured intellectual ability, and Rubenowitz's flexibility-rigidity scale measured resistance to change. Results showed some meaningful relationships  between initial attitudes and background variables, a negative correlation between initial scores and change, and some change and background covariance requiring more verification. Change showed a tendency to relate to reasons for course attendance, suggesting that participants should be motivated before beginning the course and that study should be made of the motivation necessary to compel participants to take courses.

Replies were received from 53.4% of the 375 universities and colleges polled. The most specific question, on whether the institution has a community development department, received the lowest affirmative response (19%), and the least specific question, on whether community development is considered a responsibility of the institution, received the highest affirmative response (63%), showing there is a definite awareness of community development. Institutions differ in definitions and in extent of commitment to community development, but junior colleges show the most initiative.  More interest was found concentrated in the Great Lakes states, and in institutions located near or in cities. Adult education programs, consultative services, and use of institutional facilities were frequently mentioned, but the survey indicates that the community development field is still changing.

They participated in Extension programs to the greatest extent through the mass media, considered traditional programs important (with the possible exception of leadership development) but also desired programs geared specifically to their own needs and interests. They also tended to have favorable attitudes toward Extension programs, personnel qualifications, and the involvement of the University of Wisconsin in problem solving. Community improvement, marketing, and  business management were the leading choices among program areas desired. Moreover, 51% were willing to pay a specified fee for such programs.

CSLEA has produced interest and participation in program planning and experimentation in liberal adult education, a climate more conducive to change, increasing numbers of innovative programs at Brooklyn College and other institutions, a large body of pertinent literature, and publications and administrative structures for promoting professional and liberal adult education. Both the history and the demise of the CSLEA suggest several requisites for a change  agent; a more or less independent organization; enough seed money for experimental and demonstration programs; active field involvement in testing and development; concentration of activities and energies on a reasonable number of concerns; a diversified plan of action and supporting services; a vigorous leadership role; and firm, clear-cut policies reflected in activities and methods.

The following adult education activities were identified: apprenticeship training on farms and in factories; extension training of army physicians through discussion groups, lectures, and an information-reporting network; religious instruction of civilians through newspapers and special lecturers; and adult basic education for illiterates by means of tutorial and dyad relationships in the army and on the home front. Results of this study support the contention that adult education tends to develop in response to a social crisis or other urgent need. Suggested areas for further research include agricultural  education, Protestant adult education, vocational training for the handicapped, and the covert adult basic education of slaves.

The construction proceeded from a theoretical description of selected characteristics and expected behaviors. Specific curiosity was conceptualized as a three-faced cube; face 1 is the nature of stimulation (complexity, novelty,  ambiguity); face 2 is the nature of the response (observation, questioning, thinking); and face 3 is interests (outdoors, mechanical, computation, scientific, persuasive, artistic, literary, musical, social service, and clerical).

In January, 1968, under the Title III Adult Education Act of 1966, Adult Basic Education Program, an experimental group (49 students) and a control group (47 students) were established; teachers were licensed and all were receiving inservice training. Student attendance records, reasons for dropout, cycle growth and placement at completion of the program, and subjective evaluation by the teachers were collected. On the basis of the Metropolitan Achievement Test, a seven month grade equivalent difference in favor of the  L-100 students was found. Teachers found the program successful in that it raised aspirational levels, was self-evaluative, maintained high interest, and was flexible; instructional materials, created especially for this population, were rated good to outstanding; however, suggestions were made for more instruction in such writing skills as personal and business letter writing. Materials used in the control group provided for individual work and progress but students found them not challenging enough. (pt)",

Linguistics is either a theory of language or a description of a particular language, and both vary greatly from investigator to investigator, both as to scope and substance. Linguistic \"analysis is the business of the linguist\" but it is not essential to the learning of a language, and the units of analysis may not be the same as those needed for learning the language. The linguist's prediction of expected errors, based on contrastive analysis of native and target languages, is not as useful for teaching as the experience of teachers listing actual errors made. Most contrastive descriptions are so \"incomplete as to be misleading.\" Linguistics can help the teacher to know more about the  foreign language, which, in turn, can help his teaching of it. The author concludes: \"Contemporary claims that applied linguistics can solve all the problems of language teaching are as unfounded as the claims that applied psychology can solve them. For the problems of language teaching are central neither to psychology nor linguistics.\" (MK)",

        "description":"Forty third-graders and an equal number of sixth-graders listened to a list of words and for each word had to indicate, by saying \"old\" or \"new,\" whether it had appeared before on the list or not. The subjects gave more erroneous \"old\" responses to words which were semantically or phonetically related to previously heard words than to control words. Furthermore, they took longer to respond correctly (\"new\") to the experimental words than to the controls. Experimental words which were highly associated to the preceding words did not produce more errors than words with little association to the preceding words. The semantic relations were relatively less effective in producing errors for the third-graders than for the sixth-graders. These findings are interpreted to favor the  hypothesis advanced by Anisfeld and Knapp (ED 019 639) that false recognition results can be more adequately and directly explained by a logical analysis of the semantic and phonetic features common to words than by free association norms. The relatively lesser effectiveness of semantic relations in producing false recognition errors in the third-grade subjects than in the sixth-grade subjects suggests that at the younger age the semantic features for interrelating vocabulary items are not yet as prominent as the more superficial phonetic features.

Within each of these genera there are two varieties: Educated and Uneducated. These are further defined by distinguishing features into &quot;registers&quot; which the author characterizes as &quot;School&quot; and &quot;Nonschool&quot;, each of which may include more than one style. Most studies which have characterized Child BE as deficient have dealt only with the school registers. The nonschool register is characterized by longer utterances, more rapid speech, lower pitch, less stress, inventive and playful use of words, and greater variety of content. Lack of suitable instructional  material adapted to the phonology of Child BE speakers has hampered teaching of reading. The author finds &quot;that Black and White English differ principally in phonology. The base component of Child BE should not differ appreciably from that of Child WE.&quot; A probable phoneme inventory and a set of ordered rules are given with examples showing some possible relationships between Child BE and standard urban WE.

A word sort was administered to a different group of 15 subjects in order to determine in a relatively direct way the principle semantic features which underlie the 13 lexical items used in the experimental sentences. The word sort provided data which supports the contention that the dimensions of &quot;animateness,&quot;&quot;humanness,&quot;&quot;sex,&quot;&quot;marriage,&quot; and &quot;engage&quot; are ones which underlie the lexical items in question. The sentence results provided evidence which supports a distinction between the informative (synthetic), redundant (analytic), contradictory, and amphiguous semantic categories.

They were then compared with the corresponding passages in English to determine equivalence of translation. Distortion in translation was found to be in the direction of the translator's way of perceiving things in terms of his first language. The perception study compared the perception of Japanese with that of Americans by using stick figure cartoons depicting interpersonal conflict situations with negative outcomes. As  hypothesized, Japanese were found to have a greater tendency than Americans to attribute responsibility to others. In order to separate the role of language from other crucial cultural factors in the perception of interpersonal events, 20 monolingual (English-speaking) Americans of Japanese ancestory and 90 Germans in Berlin were also tested. No significant differences were found between the Americans and Germans; but the English-speaking Japanese-Americans fell in between the Americans and the Japanese, closer to the Japanese. (DO)",

Madison Coombs, comments on the history  of the BIA, and its past and ongoing research. The final section deals with recommendations for background studies, related research projects, direct studies and research, and pilot projects. The recommendations are based on three principal assumptions--(1) the relation between learning in Indian society and behavior in schools, (2) the lack of studies of learning in Indian societies, and (3) the relation between low achievement and both language difficulties and different approaches to learning.

Investigation of such learner systems is crucial to the development of contrastive analysis theory and to its application to language teaching. However, these systems also merit investigation in their own right through their implications for general linguistic theory. Experimental and informal observation of the contrastive approach in its present form reveal serious limitations, in part because learner behavior cannot be exhaustively described without reference to the AL. Theoretical and practical  considerations therefore converge to suggest the direct and systematic examination of such learner speech, viewed within the general framework of the current theory. Such investigation would (1) provide attested information, of immediate utility in teaching and course development, on patterns of learning behavior for the principal structures of the target languages; (2) permit further assessment of the current suppositions of contrastive analysis; and (3) make possible a preliminary description of AL, thus progressing toward a reformulated contrastive approach.

Some 41 male college students served as the sample. Findings indicate that college students seeking vocational counseling are generally quite accurate in estimating their measured needs and interests, although they tend to over-estimate in areas of high vocational identity. Self-esteem and defensive self-esteem, as measured here, showed little, if any, independence in  their relationships with difference between estimated and measured needs and interests.

Major differences are in the psychologist's depth of preparation, wider variety of diagnostic and therapeutic techniques, and, concomitantly, his presumed greater insight and knowledge. The counselor is more frequently school-based, and has more continuous contact with teachers and  children than does the psychologist, who may serve an entire district. (BP)",

Using Minneapolis test norms as a point of reference, inner-city youth show up much less favorably than do comparison youth, in areas of school achievement, absenteeism, teacher ratings, delinquency, and home environment. High-mobility youth in both test groups do less well than low-mobility youth, but high mobility youth in the  inner-city group show the greatest number of deficiencies of all groups.

Suspicious and unsuspicious subjects were analyzed separately by a 12 by 12 factor  analysis. Some five factors were identified for unsuspicious subjects, and three for suspicious subjects.

Research relating intelligence and creativity is then discussed, coming to the general consensus that creative individuals must have at least minimal ability to deal inventively with symbol systems and to conceptualize the environment. The authors find that both traits correlate significantly with high scores in a test of creativity. Some 75 nursing students were asked to complete intelligence and curiosity tests as well as the Remote Association Test and a test which  required production of humorous captions for a number of Thematic Apperception Test cards. Results generally supported the hypothesis. (BP)",

        "description":"Counselor education emerged from the period 1965-1968 with a more professional status. As with any developing professions, however, some areas have advanced faster than others. For example, areas such as the evaluation of counselor education programs, problems of professional ethics, and the counseling of children with special problems received proportionally little attention. Other areas, such as standards, content of counselor education programs, use of subprofessional support personnel, and problems in selection and role, received considerable attention. The organization of this paper, presenting a critical review of literature from January 1965, through September 1968, is as follows: (1) selection and role of the counselor, (2) content of counselor education programs, (3)  approaches to supervision, (4) evaluating effects of counselor education, (5) standards and accrediting, and (6) special issues, including use of subprofessional support personnel, and ethical concerns.

In 1967-68, 31,000 pupils from pre-kindergarten to grade 12 were included in the program. This paper outlines the training program for teachers and administrators, but says little of the curriculum organization itself. The bulk of the paper consists of an extensive evaluation of the program by students, teachers, and administrators. Opinions were generally favorable, but instances of lack of support and unfavorable attitudes are noted. Significant attitudinal  differences were found among pupils of differing ages and sexes. Generally, the program was integrated into the regular curriculum and, to some extent, seemed to effect changes in classroom behavior. Recommendations focus on expansion of training, available resource materials, and the assessment of pupil attitudes and knowledge in the related areas. (BP)",

The establishment of special educational settings for modification of deviant behavior, as reported here, provides opportunity for a controlled analysis of the effects of groups of experimental variables, where treatment in regular classrooms is less amenable to the analysis of cause and effect relationships. This paper describes the development and evaluation of a treatment model designed for one class of deviant behavior: hyperactive, disruptive, acting-out behavior in the classroom. Some 12 males, in grades four, five, and six, average or above in intellectual ability, were the subjects. Socially acceptable behavior was reinforced by the accumulation of  individual and group points exchangeable for free time for high valence activities. A variety of timing and recording devices were used to monitor behavior and points. Observations were made of subjects' behavior in special and regular classrooms. The treatment model proved very effective. Of three components, (1) token reinforcement, (2) social reinforcement, and (3) aversive controls, social reinforcement exercised the greatest control.

The present study evaluates the effects of token reinforcement, programed instruction, and Hawthorne-type social reinforcement, on the attending behavior and learning rates of behaviorally disruptive fourth-grade boys.

They illustrate plans for organization with responsibility flow charts, diagrams, and outlines giving detailed recommendations for each service concerning: (1) training, (2) staffing ratio, (3) location and facilities, and (4) primary function. A discussion follows on school district size and priorities. Chapter Four, \"Administration and Leadership for Pupil Personnel Programs,\" states the primary purpose of such programs: \"to facilitate maximum  development of the individual through education.\" The authors then discuss roles and functions of administrators in fulfilling that purpose, with emphasis on interpersonal relations. The responsibilities of specific administrators are outlined. A list of readings follows each chapter. (BP)",

Osipow contrasts them with regard to their strengths and weaknesses by two general criteria. Formal adequacy subsumes: (1) explanatory adequacy, (2) empirical support, (3) generality, (4) parsimony, (5) operational adequacy, and (6) logical consistency. The understanding of career development includes: (1) normal development, (2) problems in career development, (3) facilitation or modification of career behavior, (4) critical periods and  agents, (5) the role of interests, (6) the role of aptitudes, and (7) the role of the family. Osipow evaluates not to find the superior theory, but to show in which context each is most likely to be useful. He finds them generally lacking in formal adequacy, and finds differences between theories in choice of emphasis, suitable research methods, and the degree that relationships between events are specified.

The staff data were collected in 1962 from a sample of 68 districts, and the holding power data were collected later from the same districts. The data are treated statistically in three steps: (1) The percentage of staff falling in each index of every factor is determined for both sets of data (K-6 and 10-12), (2) the percentage falling in each index is correlated with holding power and expenditure, and (3) the indices are combined, so that every possible combination is added and correlated with holding power and expenditure. Five factors show a significant and logical relationship: origin of  staff, travel, literary interest, college training, and professional interest. The factors age, distance lived from work, intent to remain in present position, sex, marital status, number of school age children, children in parental family, residence while a college student, and level of father's education show a significant relationship but have no logical theoretical explanation. The results generally parallel those of similar studies. (HW)",

The study was conducted in all 94 school districts in the Detroit SMSA, including the Detroit district within the city proper and the 93 districts in the suburban areas adjacent to the city. The area's population is defined ecologically in relation to six concentric zones, based on a pattern of progressive deconcentration ranging from &quot;inner city&quot; to &quot;outer  suburban,&quot; with Negroes concentrated in the inner zones and whites concentrated in the suburban zones. Variables correlated with school support include zonal distribution by race, educational background, annual family income, length of residence, number of school-age children, and membership in voluntary associations. Analysis of data confirms the study's basic hypothesis that support for public schools varies in relationship to the distribution of social characteristics over urban space. (JK)",

The schools were a selected sample of the schools attended by the 28,000 pupils included in the October 1965, educational supplement of the Current Population Survey of the U.S. Census. The American public school was defined as (1) a purposive organization with an institutional role of preparing students for participation in the larger society and (2) an open social system displaying a high degree of interaction with its environment. Schools were distinguished by 12 sociocultural context categories defined by two regional, three metropolitan, and two social class categories.  School specialization was measured by the proportion of full-time faculty members holding at least a masters degree. Output was measured by the number of students continuing education after high school. Findings supported the study's primary hypothesis that the input-output relationship of a school with its sociocultural context varies systematically from one context to another, leading to the general conclusion that the product of the American school depends greatly upon the particular values and ideology of its sociocultural context.

Questions covered (1) the relative importance of the school board role, (2) motivation for seeking the office, (3) expected qualifications for school board members, (4) accomplishments and shortcomings of the board, (5) operating procedures of the board, (6) school board response to pressure groups, (7) public involvement in school policy making, and (8) fiscal responsibility of the board. Results show that the public's image of the school board role is quite respectable, with school boards being viewed as important bodies which are fiscally responsible and whose  members are altruistically motivated. In general, boards are felt to function openly and to be resistant to external pressures. Citizens were found to be rather naive in some respects and poorly informed in others.

        "description":"The employment of teacher aides, guidance aides, family workers, and other auxiliary school personnel has increased sharply, but preparation for such new programs has not kept pace. Advantages of using auxiliary personnel in school systems include (1) more individual attention for students, (2) improved teaching conditions with more teacher time for professional duties, (3) easing of the shortage of professionals, and (4) provision of a means by which unemployed and educationally disadvantaged persons may enter the mainstream of productivity. Difficulties which might arise for administrators, principals, teachers, and auxiliaries in the deployment of auxiliary personnel range from problems of job titles, salaries, and training requirements to concern for professional standards  and the limited backgrounds of most auxiliaries. Recommendations concerning the development and use of auxiliaries include (1) that role specifications and prerogatives of auxiliaries be clearly defined, (2) that there be preservice training to develop communication and job skills, (3) that there be a continuing inservice training program, (4) that cooperation of community colleges be sought for training auxiliaries, and (5) that use of auxiliary personnel be institutionalized into a program offering job security and being an integral part of the school.

Four general classifications of factors affecting population and thus enrollment are (1) The number of  dwellings available in the community, (2) the type of people living in those dwellings, (3) the demand for dwellings in the community, and (4) factors controlled by public and nonpublic schools.

An exhibit on the role of the Federal Government in science and technology was used as the subject matter. Two basic groups of viewers were used, casual viewers and paid experimental viewers. Both were tested on knowledge gained and on interest and attitude levels. Control data were obtained for both groups. The paid subjects, obtained from high school, college, and adult populations, were divided by age, sex, education, and science and nonscience background. Time was the variable in the experiment, with one group of paid subjects having unlimited viewing time and one group being limited to one-half hour. Casual viewers were observed for comparison with the  experimental groups and to determine the relative attractiveness of the exhibit elements. A mockup or small-scale replication of the exhibit was built to determine the feasibility of using such devices for prevalidation and experimental purposes. Results indicate that an exhibit can be analyzed using a wide variety of techniques and that studies of this type can make a major contribution to improved exhibit design and effectiveness. The mockup study also proved successful. A theory of exhibit effectiveness is described. (HW)",

The most serious charge is that the study attempted to do too much. By analyzing resource inputs and levels of achievement and by trying to analyze the effects of various inputs on achievement, the study failed to do well the minimum requirement--a careful study of inputs that would provide an adequate measure of educational equality. On the other hand, the author argues that the major virtue of the study is that it did not accept the definition of educational equality based on input levels; therefore, its major impact has been to shift policy attention from the traditional focus on comparison of inputs to a focus on output and on the  effectiveness of inputs for bringing about changes in putput. The seemingly simple and measurable concept of inputs is further called into question by pointing out the difference between inputs as disbursed and inputs as received by the child. Other criticisms of basic design and specific criticisms of statistical methodology are discussed and met. Although the report is admitted to contain imperfections, it is defended as a major step in the development of policy-related social research. (TT)",

        "description":"Subsidies to education are often justified by arguing that society derives political benefits from education in terms of individuals who perform better as citizens. Since these benefits are external to the student and therefore do not provide him with incentive to invest further in his education, society must devise a means of subsidy that will induce students to continue their education and thereby improve the workings of political democracy. Many argue that an optimal subsidy policy is one which stimulates the student's private economic motive for demanding education. By offering cheap tuition or providing loans at subsidized rates of interest, the consequent cost reductions lead to a greater demand for education. However, such across-the-board cost reductions stimulate  investment in education among the more able students and lead to greater investment in training for higher paid occupations, where the private incentives are highest. The logic of majority voting indicates that a more efficient method by which to gain citizenship benefits from education might be through a more egalitarian subsidy policy which would allocate larger subsidies to less able students. Moreover, some selectivity in the areas of study to be supported is desirable, since some courses may be more effective than others in improving citizenship quality. (TT)",

Each part has its function in the organization. The board sets objectives for the system. The board and administrative staff sets budgets, formulate policies, and make rules. All levels are involved in the evaluation of the school programs.  The board must develop two kinds of objectives for the school system--general (a philosophy of education) and operational (specification of the general objectives). The board has the responsibility for decisions to meet these objectives. In this area the board's role includes policy making, rules, budgets, maintaining consistency with administrative decisions, and evaluation of programs on the basis of administrative reports. (HW)",

In Part III, the possibility of mapping experimental designs into social space characterized by feedback loops is confirmed while refuting statements by Stufflebeam to the contrary.

        "description":"In a fully graded plan all children in a given grade are expected to do the same work in a year's time, while in a nongraded program each child works at the level in each subject for which he is ready. Most schools today lie somewhere along the graded-nongraded continuum. Three ways of implementing a nongraded program are (1) provide multilevel instruction in a self-contained, heterogeneous classroom; (2) assign children to self-contained classes according to performance levels; and (3) regroup a large aggregation of children from time to tome to form classes that work at different levels under different teachers. Administrative leadership is essential in implementing a nongraded approach. One of the principal weaknesses of the graded plan is that it does not provide for  individual growth and learning differences. Other factors contributing to the present interest in nongrading are the influence of progressive education, the mental health movement in education, and the published materials of Professors J. I. Goodlad and R. H. Anderson. Research efforts have not yet yielded meaningful results on the relative effectiveness of graded and nongraded programs, but the nongraded program seems to be the trend of the future. (HW)",

        "description":"The literature in organizational climate research lacks information regarding the empirical use of the concept of authenticity. This is primarily due to the lack of an appropriate operational definition for the variable, even though it has received much interdisciplinary interest. One possible means of clarifying the authenticity concept to make it empirically operational is to link it to role theory, especially to the concept of role distance. From this perspective, authenticity may be conceptualized as some point on the role distance continuum ranging from behavior perceived as expressing complete embracement of a particular role through behavior perceived as expressing complete alienation from a particular role. This conceptualization of authenticity does have support from the  literature. If role distance can be accepted as defining one possible dimension of authenticity, then two means of operationalizing this aspect of authenticity are suggested: (1) Measure the frequencies of behavioral slips in a situated role in situated activity systems, and (2) determine the amount of time an actor is perceived as behaving \"out of role\" as compared to \"in role\" in a situated activity system.

Evidence shows that this sequence is seldom followed in actual practice and that special efforts must be made to assure that the results of research are applied. In an attempt to remedy this problem in education, a traveling seminar and a conference were organized for the implementation of educational innovation. Schools across the U.S. where significant innovations had been introduced and in operation for at least one year were selected. Groups composed of local administrators, State education department officials, and college teachers toured the schools, after which they participated in a conference. One year later the  innovative activity in districts participating in the tour was compared with that in a nonparticipating control group; it was found that the participants had introduced more innovations than the nonparticipants. Analysis of this experiment suggests that such programs can speed research into application more successfully than printed communication or demonstration schools. Factors leading to the successful application of research results and the importance of the regional laboratories in evaluating the effectiveness of innovations are also discussed. (TT)",

In a school organization, administrator competences are related to the effectiveness with which the school functions. If a school system is to function properly, the administrator must solve to some degree the four problems of productivity--external flexibility, internal flexibility, and reduction of tension and strain. To solve these problems he must possess minimum technical, conceptual, administrative, and human relations skills. Two similar New York State school systems with vast differences in levels of achievement provided data for a comparative study. Data were obtained from the responses of teachers of the districts to a questionnaire, and from interviews with other  organizational members. The study concluded that the administrator's competences seem to be related to the effective functioning of the system. Whether the functional requirements of the organization are solved and whether the needs and behaviors of individuals in the organization are made congruent with the organizational goals seem to depend on the competences of the administrators in the organization.

It was found that the capacities of school research offices are limited by lack of autonomy, role uncertainty, and inadequate fiscal and personnel resources. Where school district leadership and teamwork with other school personnel create favorable conditions, the school  research staffs have demonstrated proficiency in assessing needs, formulating problems, and in collecting, analyzing, and disseminating data. Where school staffs are resistant to systematic program planning or self-evaluation, the instructional research function has become an isolated and largely expendable function.

Results indicated few consistent differences on measures of divergent and convergent thinking, and no significant differences on measures of self concept.

Further, in the lab school, a greater number of students expressed negative feelings about school or doubts about their own ability to do well.

The groups were as follow: a machine audio group (MAud) exposed to rate controlled taped material by audio means alone; a machine audiovisual group (MAV) that received visual copy and also listened to the taped recordings; a teacher audiovisual group (TAV) using bimodal stimulation; and a control group (C). Materials were recorded and presented at appropriate rates of presentation by means of a tempo regulator, a machine which varies rate without pitch distortion. Results  indicated little impact of the experimental procedures on the standardized pre-post test measures; however, daily comprehension measures favored the bimodal presentation modes, particularly the MAV group. Some trend favoring slowed presentations was evident. The subjects demonstrated significant retention of instructional material after a 1-month interval, and significantly higher performance on a relearning measure than on initial presentations, after a 2-month interval.

All who had failed conservation of substance pretests using juice, sand, clay, and paper were then put through a programed five-stage sequence of conservation training with posttesting after each stage. When a child exhibited conservation with all four materials, he was given two extinction questions which tested the stability of the conservation concept. The main differences between groups were on errors during training, extinction, and explanations. Retardates were significantly more susceptible to extinction of  conservation responses (p .05) and further study is suggested since this would make a difference in performance if retarded children come out of learning experiences with empirical hypotheses and normal ones with logical certainties. However, no relationship was found between general intelligence level and intuitive concept formation. Eleven tables and a 15-item bibliography are given. (SN)",

Effectiveness of speech teachers in providing therapy services was evaluated. The measurements of effectiveness were determined from the following: trained speech pathologists' observation of the speech teachers and completion of an evaluative form, teachers' responses to a questionnaire assessing the therapy program, and an interview with the program administrators. A total of five trained speech pathologists visited 15 schools and interviewed 13 speech teachers; 30 of the 38 teachers completed the questionnaires. Recommendations included speech teachers' screening of all children in grades 3 to 7 using a clinical rating  scale; administration of diagnostic tests to children being considered for therapy; definite referral procedures with coordination and followup; greater flexibility in therapy methods, particularly for older children; the establishment of regional supervisory centers; improvement and expansion of speech teachers' contacts with parents of children in therapy and with other school personnel; and continuation of the orientation program.

Three phases emphasized these objectives: feasibility, class size, pupil safety, approval, incidence, referral, diagnosis, placement, curriculum, treatment, evaluation, teacher qualifications, parent reactions, expansion, demonstration, and research. In phase 2, 116 neurologically impaired children were placed in either special (64) or regular (52) classes. The special class group generally contained older (1/2 year) and more severe cases; boys outnumbered girls 7 to 1. After a 3-year attendance in a special class, 12 students were recommended for return to regular class (out of 19) while 15 out of 19 children in the regular classes were felt to need  special class placement. Steady attendance for 2 years was in favor of special class students (86% to 40.4%). Parents of children in special classes attended meetings concerning their children more frequently than parents of regular class children (52% to 7%). Special class students seemed favored in the few cases of academic comparison although the children were about 3 years academically retarded. Recommendations were made for future research. (RP)",

The students were given tests to determine attitudes and divergent thinking abilities and were evaluated for social qualities and class contributions by their teachers. Parents were asked to complete questionnaires independently to determine family relationships. Three judges, working as a team, tape recorded five consecutive sessions of classes in social studies, science, and English conducted by different teachers in the fall and again the  following spring; all comments were classified according to levels of thinking defined in Guilford's structure of the intellect. The types of questions asked by teachers strongly influenced the quality of pupil response. More than 50% of questions asked in a class session were cognitive memory questions. The second most frequent category was convergent thinking, with a much smaller proportion of divergent and evaluative thinking questions. (BB)",

Recipients of university and state fellowship awards were included in the sample. The findings indicated that 95% of the fellowship recipients had had prior experiences (academic and work) in education and that 36% had taken prior work in the education of the mentally retarded or other fields relevant to the education of exceptional children. They have remained in the field of special education and have assumed increasingly responsible leadership roles in teacher training or administrative and supervisory roles (at the time the data were taken, 48.9% were involved in work in higher education in  special education, 40% in local school systems, and 10.7% with state departments or agencies). The mental retardation fellows were generally satisfied with their goals. However, responses suggested that both program and student goals need to be more clearly delineated at the various levels of graduate study. The evidence indicates that the fellowship program substantially accelerated and increased the supply of a stable cadre of trained leadership personnel in the area of mental retardation for positions of responsibility at the state and local levels and in the area of personnel training. Data are provided and responses are summarized for 79 items. (Author/JD)",

Parents observed the children, aged 18 months to 3 1/2 years, receiving language stimulation in free play in a nursery and observed individual therapy based on the Tracy Correspondence Course. Non-directive group meetings encouraged parents to find their own solutions to problems. Therapists met with parents to discuss the goals and techniques of therapy; parents administered therapy first to another child and then to their own. Lecture type and fathers only meetings were also held. Evaluation of program success based on staff observations indicated growth and change in all of the children and in many parents. Almost all children were lipreading,  using speech meaningfully, and performing better in social and play situations. Parents seemed to be helped in resolving their initial confusion, in getting the problem of having a deaf child into perspective, in recognizing that the child was primarily language handicapped, and in appreciating the job of the therapist.

Of 108 day supervisors (D), 23% were supervisors only while 77% were also either teachers or administrators. One-third reported three-fourths to full time devoted to supervision; one-third reported one-fourth time or less. Day supervisors were responsible for wider age ranges of children and types of teachers supervised and tended to receive better salaries. Of 150 residential supervisors (R), one-third were supervisors only, 93% worked with teachers of the deaf only, and two-thirds reported three-fourths to full time supervision. Both groups spent similar amounts of time per month with teachers; the majority had master's  degrees (D-group 82%, R-group 67%); and degrees in deaf education, audiology, or speech correction were held by one-half of the D-group and one-third of the R-group. Results indicate a need for more supervisors, improvement in the quality of supervision, setting of standards for supervisory personnel, and professional consideration of these problems. (JB)",

Of 198 referrals during the 3-year project, 61 persons started training and 42 persons between the ages of 12 and 92 successfully completed the instruction. Trainees began to learn independent foot travel in their own homes, then moved to an unfamiliar indoor setting. Successful indoor mobility was followed by training outdoors in a quiet residential area with stress on mastering the mechanical aspects of cane manipulation. A semicongested area was visited next; the trainee learned to locate some stores and to ride a bus. The last phase of training was in a heavily congested area involving exposure to more  distractions. Successful trainees were those who achieved a level of travel proficiency commensurate with their physical, emotional, or mental capacity. Case histories are included. (LE)",

Twenty-one schools and 1,640 students with a variety of conditions participated. The most frequent limitations of participants were low physical fitness, overweight, and curvature of the spine. Pupils attended an average of two 45-minute classes a week where they engaged in regular physical education activities adapted to their specific needs. Measurement of program effectiveness revealed that although the number of schools having the program increased, the number of students served decreased, and there was no difference in improvement of students with low physical fitness related to whether they had  one, two, or five classes per week. Instructors estimated that 30% of participants reached maximum improvement, 44% showed moderate improvement, 17% minimal improvement, and 9% no improvement. Of the students, 16% were returned to regular physical education classes. Administrative considerations are included. (LE)",

The 17.8% who were designated as inappropriately hospitalized more often presented problems in management and training (as from moderate to severe retardation) and none was psychotic. The 8.6% judged hospitalized for an inappropriately long time were characterized by socially unacceptable behavior due to psychotic break. Findings and recommendations  considered the institutions' programs, comprehensive treatment plan for each child, release planning and aftercare, the roles of disciplines, case records, and communication between agencies. The lack of community resources, early problem identification and prevention, modification of the child's environment, community programs to handle the acting out child, and guardianship were judged for each child's community; and the institution-community relationship was treated.

Tests were devised to attempt to pinpoint brain damage on the basis of auditory tests; Jerger found that both temporal lobe tumors and brain-stem damage could lead to the same results on the tests. Bocca suggested delivering different signals to the two ears to assess the integration or binaural summation of the central neural system. Matzker suggested two individually meaningless sounds presented simultaneously, one to each ear; a normal system would apparently integrate sounds better. Studies by Bocca,  Jerger, Sanchez-Longo, Forster, Matzker, Harris, and Hayashi indicated that subjects with organic symptoms showed poorer integration than subjects without these symptoms; however, it was not clear where binaural integration took place. Conclusions were that Matzker's procedure is probably inadequate as a general test to localize brain damage. More research is indicated as the technique shows promise for studying an organism's binaural integration abilities. (RP)",

        "description":"The relationship between the difficulty with which the retarded adolescent decodes visual social cues and the appropriateness of his social behavior was the basis of a study to determine whether social cue decoding could be taught the retarded in a manner analogous to the teaching of reading and writing, with beneficial behavioral results. The Test of Social Inference (TSI) was developed and used as the before and after criterion of social comprehension. During four trials, 11 classes of retarded adolescents at the prevocational level were provided experimental lessons designed to promote social awareness daily for periods of from 6 to 10 weeks as a part of their special education. Two control classes were provided placebo materials and five were provided contrast materials to  supplement their usual curricula, and one control class had no change made in its usual program. All pupils were given social behavioral ratings by their teachers before and after the periods of treatment. The association between social comprehension and social behavior was confirmed by significant correlations between the pupils' TSI scores and their social behavioral ratings (p=.001). Improved comprehension as a result of special training was confirmed by significantly higher TSI scores following treatment (p.05). Improved behavior associated with gains in social comprehension was supported by results only of the initial trial. (Author/RP)",

It was intended to encourage inservice training, to assist in planning for cooperative use of training and research resources, to provide information to states, and to assist in planning student recruitment. Professionals in the field donated time to attend conferences, to plan, and to do research and writing on activities they had agreed to handle. Consultations were held with schools or agencies with problems; communication by phone, mail, and convention attendance was used to obtain information from various groups, persons, or organizations in the South; assistance was given to colleges to help them in teacher  preparation; and research proposals were submitted for funding. Regional cooperation and planning were elicited. A major accomplishment was the avoidance of duplication of efforts by cooperating institutions; other results were preparation of a monograph on special education teachers, improvement of professional standards, establishment of guidelines for state certification, and preparation of a recruiting film. Recommendations for future regional activities and questionnaires used in regional surveys are included. (RP)",

Twelve children received 50 sessions of instruction, 1 hour long, using the new materials based on the Initial Teaching Alphabet and structured to cover auditory discrimination, sound sequencing, visual discrimination, phonemic synthesis and analysis, and rhyming. A control group of 12 was exposed to traditional articulation therapy procedure. The experimental group made significantly fewer errors in articulation after therapy than the control group based on the Goldman-Fristoe  Filmstrip Articulation Test (p=.05). No significant difference was found between groups in auditory memory skills and intelligence scores. Conclusions were that the experimental, visual-symbol approach has great potential in the modification of misarticulation. (RP)",

Objectives were to evaluate experimental curriculum units and to obtain data to determine to what extent learning difficulties characterize emotionally disturbed adolescents in particular or to what extent they are characteristic of adolescent learning problems in general. One cognitive style dimension investigated was reflection-impulsivity, or a student's disposition to reflect in a problem situation as opposed to an impulsive unconsidered response. The emotionally disturbed students showed a higher degree of impulsivity on one of the two standardized measures used compared to a  group of normal controls (p=.05). On tests of creativity there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups. Disturbed students showed a greater relationship between creativity and reflection on verbal measures and between creativity and impulsivity on visual measures. Language problems were found to be semantic, not syntactical. Various curriculum units combining visual and verbal materials, and specific intellectual skills training were helpful in improving cognitive functioning. (Author/RP)",

Anticipated costs are expressed in terms of their present value per square foot of wall area. The financial aspects of the value of money, depreciation, price increases and taxation are reviewed. Initial wall costs are estimated. Formulae are given for calculating the influence of depreciation, speed of erection, heating, air conditioning, illumination, real estate taxes, and usable floor space occupied by the wall. Fourteen examples are given to demonstrate calculation methods for anticipated costs. Typical cases are cited to show the  effect of insurance rates and the cost of supporting walls. Maintenance and ultimate salvage value are considered. Twenty-four references helpful to the designer are cited. Charts and tables are provided to assist the designer in computing ultimate wall costs. The authors conclude that aesthetics, engineering and economics are equally important to good architectural expression, but that the variation in the ultimate costs of typical walls may be five hundred percent or more.

The degree of expectancy of loss depends upon many factors. Some risks can be assumed by the owner but others are of such magnitude that insurance must be carried.

Information relative to safety of particular buildings is included along with a comprehensive analysis of the County Board's existing  insurance program.

The patterns of planning which have emerged as well as the reasons educators have advanced for considering the educational park concept are cataloged and briefly discussed. The main concerns of those who are in dissent are stated. After summarizing the hopes for the kind of educational program and intellectual environment the concept will afford, the article cites the four  basic needs a functionally planned facility must meet i.e. sufficient space, efficient relationships between spaces, preservation of the individual identity of the student through subschools, and space for outside persons who come to the school to assist with various parts of the curriculum.

The point is made that two basic causes underlie these conditions--(1) irrational school organization that divides people, resources, and energies into mutually exclusive but impotent camps, and (2) reliance upon folkways rather than technical proficiency and upon folklore rather than research in the design of school facilities. Some short term recommendations include an increasing look to technology and research for better answers to design problems, while the long term exhortation prescribes new kinds of leadership from state education agencies, professional associations, and universities. Several steps that  the Council of Educational Facility Planners can take in these directions are also outlined. (NI)",

The keynote address offered challenges to the NAEB to accept its responsibility in dealing with the problems of our time, to develop a profession for educational electronics, and to function in the technical, production, legal, and administrative areas for the effective use of educational media. Twelve major types of activity were discussed in group sessions, and final reports were made on each area.  These reports, covering: programs, professional advancement, teacher and educational development, member services, research activities, technical services, public relations, promotional development, policy direction, financial support, liaison with government, and international relations, are intended as guidelines for the administration of the NAEB, as well as for educators interested in the application of educational media.

The program series allows a user to set input levels, simulates the behavior of major variables in inventory systems, and provides performance measures as output. Inventory Systems Lab (ISL)1 deals with carrying, shortage, and replenishment costs. The user selects three parameters: unit costs, interim demand, and planning horizon. He then must decide when and in what quantities replenishments are to be made. The program enables him to observe effects of changing parameters and/or replenishments on overall costs. ISL-2 and 3 introduce the user to factor optimization. For any reorder point and lot size set,  interim system behavior and average costs are available. The user may then build a model for long-run system behavior, formulate optimization decision rules, and have the program test his results. In ISL-4 a user faces a system with a variety of properties and policies including lost sales, prescribed variable demand, and fixed inventory policies for which he carries out model building and optimization exercises. The program series is considered flexible and effective as a heuristic aid. Fortran IV listings are included. (SS)",

As a friend, he should counsel, listen, accept the student as a person, and help him solve his problems. As a &quot;doctor,&quot; he should diagnose and prescribe for the student's learning difficulties, emphasize individual needs, and stress applications and practice specific knowledge. As a manager, he should supervise, motivate, and reward. He should plan and organize group and individual instruction. He can combine group and individual instruction by using programed lectures, films, and games. In the Draper Project, a PerceptoScope (an all-purpose,  visual-aid instrument) was used with particular success in a reading program. All teachers involved with correctional education should receive in-service training to teach them techniques in counseling and human relations as well as in job analysis and lesson plans. This in-service training is essential to the growth and development of the teacher and of the offenders whom he will teach. (CG/MF)",

In a comparison of overt and covert response modes no differences were obtained on an immediate post-program criterion test; however, overt responses were found more effective on a delayed retention measure. When an overt response was required, it was more effective given as a sentence in context than as a single word. Considering the frequency and scheduling of reinforcers, increases in reinforcement decreased error rate on an immediate posttest and increased student interest in and perceived value of the program. Studies of cueing and examining procedures  indicated that typographical cues improved performance when a program was difficult but had an interfering effect on moderate or easy programs and that increases in the number and plausibility of multiple-choice alternatives improved retention generally. In a review of the entire study series, it was noted that error rate during learning was not related to any retention measure and therefore appeared to be an inappropriate criterion of program adequacy.

Designed to exclude light viewers, the interview schedule featured questions on viewing habits, relevance of TV to personal problems, audience preferences in news coverage, and entertainment vs. information. An attempt was made to correlate opinion with variables of age (by describing TV use among adolescents), class, race (by describing the effects of white television in the black community), emotional health (as judged by the respondents),  and frequency of viewing. Such variables influence the choice of a network newscaster (Huntley-Brinkley, Cronkite, or Jennings), the selective perception of news and editorial content, and the taste for reality or fantasy in hypothetical programs.

Therefore, a pilot study was conducted as a preliminary attempt to establish correlational relationships between types and frequencies of games played and general attitudes in children. The research was conducted in a rural school in Maryland; all sixth-graders (108) answered a battery of questions. Two independent categories of games were identified: sports, and board and card games. Participation in sports was found to be strongly associated with school achievement, span of attention, and the feeling that one can learn, but  not related to self-image or attitude toward luck. Involvement in board and card games, on the other hand, was related to low school achievement, a negative self-image, reliance on luck rather than work, and a feeling of impotency in learning. These findings are considered to provide evidence of game importance and to indicate specific relationship between social processes and autoletic (game and play) activities. (SS/MF)",

Communications between the film libraries and the computer are maintained by Teletype model 33 ASR Teletypewriter terminals operating on TWX (Teletypewriter Exchange) service, programed mainly in S/360 Assembler Language. This configuration permits on-line (real time) tele-processing, the central concept in the system. The files (S/360 data sets) are stored on either direct access storage devices (disks) or sequential access storage devices (magnetic tape) according to their use in processing. Within the Network's system, there are three classes of files: system files, containing  system programs and backup files; input/output files, containing tables for I/O editing and temporary I/O storage; and the data files, containing information about films, libraries, customers, and bookings. Appendices: list of files by sort sequence, notes on System/360 organization and data storage, and notes on disk storage devices. (TI)",

Until now only single tests of potential ability have been evaluated. In this study several tests used in various combinations were evaluated as test batteries. The IBM Aptitude Test for Programmer Personnel (ATPP) and the Strong Vocational Interest Blank (SVIB) were administered to 68 students enrolled in an introductory computer science course at Michigan State University. Grade point average (GPA) and College Qualification Test (CQT) scores for participants were available from college records. All test scores correlated significantly with course grade (p .05). GPA was found to be the best single predictor of success. Among total test scores, general scholastic  aptitude (the CQT) predicted achievement as well as specialized aptitude (the ATPP). However, the best results were found to be obtainable with a judicious choice of subtests emphasizing numerical and spatial reasoning (ATPP Part III, CQT Numerical). An &quot;interest&quot; variable as assessed by the SVIB appeared to identify a dimension discrete from aptitude that was significantly related to course achievement. The results were taken to indicate that instruments presently available can be used effectively to predict achievement in computer programing. (SS/MF)",

        "description":"In articles on student unrest, there is a great tendency to oversimplify the issues and to assume that the components and stakes are the same from Minnesota to Czechoslovakia. To understand this complex phenomenon, the following questions should be answered: How many different problems, of what orders of magnitude and intensity, need to be recognized? What can faculties and administrations do to meet these problems without relinquishing educational freedom to bigotry? Can the university, after identifying the levels of problems, deal with them? Can it emerge with its structure and underlying values intact? If danger to these values exists, how can the individual professor help counteract it? To analyze the structural variety of student unrest, it is helpful to consider the  membership and motives of students in terms of a series of concentric circles. From this perspective, the different sources of unrest can be dealt with differently. (The Vietnam war injects a special element of venom into student discontent.) Many students have turned to quieter and slower ways of effecting change and the worst of the destructive frenzy may be over. Out of the turmoil has come the ominous evidence of a possibly damaging anti-intellectualism and evidence of the lack of recognition by college faculties of their own pivotal role in dealing with student unrest and their view that the troubles are none of their business. Faculty reticence must be overcome and the university must be recognized as an overarching institution composed oa a maze of subcommunities in which there can  be no special rules for anyone. (JS)",

Enthusiasts have overestimated Compact possibilities and opponents have overestimated its dangers, so if the organization has limited rather than total success fears should decline. Although there has always been a strain between educators and elected officeholders, they have cooperated in many programs. The idea for the Compact was contained in James B. Conant's SHAPING EDUCATIONAL POLICY and foundation officials turned to Terry Sanford to carry forward the proposal. Sanford favored an organization that gave power to governors but that aspect was changed after legislators objected.  Strong protests came from other sectors, notably higher education, concerning their lack of representation and concessions were made. It is necessary for the Compact to more further in the direction toward better understanding and cooperation among educators, public officials and citizens without undermining satisfactory relations already in existence.

As late as 1964, 85% of federal funds for higher education were allocated for organized research. In 1962, 95% of research funds were devoted to work in the physical and life sciences. Federal monies are also highly concentrated geographically and are distributed in ways that allow large numbers of graduate students to devote full time developing research skills. Some of the sources of inefficiency in higher education are: poor quality of faculty, the teaching and learning of wrong things, neglect of undergraduate education, neglect of the poorer states and their gifted students. Federal involvement has helped to improve the quality of teaching but has not had a  beneficial effect on the other sources of inefficiency. One solution might be to provide the states with block grants to strengthen all higher education within their borders. The states, however, would still be responsible for accounting for the use of funds and evaluating the success of federally funded programs. An annotated bibliography is included. (JS)",

(2) Although the existing structure of higher education represents a sizeable investment, parts of the system are under severe financial strain. (3) Recent Congresses and Administrations have indicated that the federal government has a major role to play in financing higher education. (4) In spite or because of this influsion of federal funds, many institutions have a more precarious fiscal situation now than a decade ago. This is partly because demands have outstripped available resources and partly because federal support has  been almost entirely categorical and requires the commitment of additional institutional funds. Ways must be found to provide general institutional support as a supplement to categorical aid. Major adjustments in funding formulas and in concepts of the responsibility of higher education must be made. Many areas should b e explored--academic and housing facilities, graduate education, research, student aid, development of major university centers, undergraduate institutions, institutional cooperation, division of labor, revision of tax laws.

The movement toward creation of coordinating boards of citizen members having substantial powers has bee n  accelerated because (1) the agencies are exercising greater political leadership in formulating and advocating policies for developing and expanding higher education (2) more and more federal grant programs are being oriented toward states rather than institutions (3) private institutions are becoming more involved in public policy making and coordination for all colleges and universities.

The identity of an institution is the image established by the dynamics of its constituents and the freedom they exercise in establishing this identity determines its autonomy. In California, external constraints are produced by the interaction of the university system with the development of the Master Plan for Higher Education and the Coordinating Council for Higher Education. Accrediting agencies, professional societies, local, state and federal agencies account for other constraints. Sources of influence within the system are the regents, offices of presidents and vice presidents and university-wide committees. Within the  institution, faculty, staff and student views shape the development and maintenance of institutional autonomy. The faculty tends to equate institutional autonomy with personal autonomy and the staff tends to view the university as a public trust requiring accountability to all it serves or is served by. Students, on the other hand, are vitally concerned about ends or results presumably provided by freedom of action. Students, faculty and staff not the administration, are the primary resources for achieving and preserving institutional identity and autonomy. An annotated bibliography is included. (JS)",

Subtle personal contacts, the essence of this relationship, are undefinable and differ in every instance even though they are the true means by which the balance of authority, responsibility and independence is maintained or upset. The first reality in the university's relationship with the state government is the degree of our faith in the democratic process and a belief in the elected representatives. A clear universal reality is the advocacy in political circles of an expanding system of higher education, a desire to know the facts and then act in light of them. Danger and problems arise when governmental  questioning intrudes into areas of academic competence and judgment. Erosion of a university's independence can begin in matters that seem trivial at the time. Continuation of independence, therefore, depends on our readiness to recognize and defend those portions of academic and institutional life that are the university's sole responsibility to control. Any evaluation of state government-university relations should start with an examination of how well and in what formal terms this protection is provided. (Most academic fears center on this point.) Public universities should have basic freedom of action constitutionally guaranteed to them yet seek to create a climate of trust that will make recourse to legal defense unnecessary.

The 7 campuses are Davis, Berkeley, Irvine, Los Angeles, Riverside, Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz. Students responded to questions about their backgrounds, personality traits, college aspirations, past activities, and opinions of their schools. Comparisons are made among students at the 7 campuses, between all of them and national normative groups at public and private universities, and in some instances between them and students at Stanford University. The majority of students on the UC campuses rated themselves as above average in academic ability, with the largest group making this claim  coming from Santa Cruz. Four traits that received the widest range of responses with Davis students scoring lowest and Santa Cruz the highest, were liberalism, writing ability, originality, and self-confidence. A majority of all students came from Protestant homes. Students describing their religious backgrounds as Jewish or as none tended to be least anti-intellectual as groups, and fundamentalists seemed to be most anti-intellectual. The largest precentages of the first two groups were found at UCLA, Santa Cruz, Berkeley and private universities. In contrast to the public university normative group, UC students did not seem to be as interested in material success as they were in understanding and helping others who are in difficulty. (WM)",

        "description":"Contrary to popular belief, much power is vested in university governing boards that are usually composed of individuals not professionally concerned with higher education. The Center conducted a study in 1965 of trustees at 38 member institutions of the American Association of Universities, in an effort to expand previous findings on governing board members' social characteristics, attitudes and political beliefs. Since the control of higher learning shifted from the clergy to successful businessmen in the eighteenth century, academic freedom was permitted in the area of religion. Current data reveals that while a majority of board members still approve academic freedom in religious matters, they oppose the same free pursuit of knowledge when it concerns social, economic and  political issues. Today's trustees are more sympathetic to the values of the academic community than their off-campus peers. But when their attitudes are studied in relationship to the aims of higher education, data show that approximately 1 out of 3 would feel that \"the university is best run along the principles of a business enterprise.\" They therefore tend to view faculty members merely as employees rather than competent scholars, and give the administration--along with other decision-making powers affecting educational and institutional quality--authority to select, hire, retain, and fire instructors. There is a need to reappraise the relationship between the aims of higher education and the control of universities. (WM)",

The collection of professional experts on one campus represents a system of groups with similar status and power that coexist or battle with each other within the structure. At large universities faculty authority resembles what is called \"professional authority\" in hospitals, industry, and research and development laboratories. But where peer professionals in these other organizations work closely toward one goal, faculty authority is divided between departments, colleges, and separate or allied disciplines. Faculty influence on campus is enhanced by the growing availability of external sources  of support such as grants from the federal government, and a labor market which is highly favorable to the professor. The basic weakness of this federated structure is that chaos may occur if there is no strong leadership to channel the efforts of and mediate conflicts between the groups. The university president should serve as mediator, unify the diverse groups on campus, and at the same time maintain the overall objectives of the institution in order to \"move the whole enterprise another foot ahead.\" (WM)",

        "description":"One of the most important purposes of a college is the development of the intellectual nature of its students. It appears that US Catholic colleges and fundamentalist Protestant colleges (representing Pentecostal, Baptist, and Lutheran sects) have failed to produce students who possess intellectual attitudes. In the case of the Catholics, students evince traits such as docility, dogmatism, intolerance, and defensiveness. A closed, authoritarian background involving strict Church-family-self relationships may partly account for this restricted and uncreative behavior which leads to a marked lack of scholarly or intellectual productivity. The most intellectual Catholic students, when compared to their classmates of lesser ability, indicate a need for religion, yet are critical of  the policies, practices and customs of their faith. Intellectuality among these students may be interpreted as \"critical devoutness\" as contrasted with a docile acceptance of Catholicism. If this kind of criticism indicates a new trend of self-evaluation among the general Catholic population, colleges may have to replace authoritarian practices with innovative curricula, student personnel services, and professional counseling.

Professional education should be more intellectual and theoretical. By organizing it around the disciplines basic to its own systematic body of knowledge, it has a broad foundation and provides bridges to other fields. Study in the disciplines cognate to social work seems to be especially important in doctoral programs. Interprofessional collaboration is desirable and various structural devices have been employed to facilitate interdisciplinary and interprofessional teaching and research in some institutions. Social work education has been  handicapped by 2 dominant characteristics a constraining allegiance to Freudian theory and a paucity of research on social welfare problems and education. If schools of social work wish to enjoy full university membership, they will have to increase research productivity and threrfore recruit a different kind of faculty. Research findings (summarized here) have contributed to our knowledge about the psychological attributes of people with strong intellectual interests and about differential recruitment to colleges and fields of study. In professional education, strong theoretical orientation should be balanced with applied research and training. Universities are already heavily involved in meeting social needs and, with the demands for more outside involvement, they must remember that  their primary function is intellectual. (JS)",

Refraining from entering the conventional world of work, the nonstudent lives a marginal existence reflective of his unconventional role.

The supposition is that this individual, regardless of ability or social class, is attracted to engineering more than to non-technical professions and is relatively restricted in the roles he identifies with and in his life style. To explore this contention, the personality characteristics and reported opinions of engineering majors were investigated in order to compare their modes of thinking and attitudes with those observed among liberal arts majors. Several attitudinal scales were administered to  graduates in 1959 and 1963 and scores were computer to yield measures of intellectual disposition, manifest anxiety, and autonomous, open and flexible thinking. The engineering and liberal arts majors, all of whom had persisted in college 4 years, were then compared on these measurements. Opinions expressed through questionnaire responses were also compared. Each of the study's hypotheses--most of which were related to the less intellectual and less flexible nature of the engineering major--was supported by the data observed.

Today academic liberals enunciate the view that most protesters are sincere and idealistic but that there is a small band of nihilistic revolutionaries dedicated to destroying the university. At the center, it's said, is SDS. The author's experience as a founder and national officer of SDS, as a researcher on the social-psychological roots of student protest, and as a college teacher are drawn upon in dealing with the actual motives and attitudes of SDS. Recent studies on student activists are remarkably convergent, particularly in their finding that student activists are much more closely linked to academic life and  intellectuality than their nonactivist peers. The history of the student movement from the late fifties provides some of the answers to why radical students, who have strong commitments to education, have selected the university as a major target for disruption. The primary concern of SDS has always been social reconstruction, and disillusionment with the university because of its irrelevance to basic human questions and undemocratic character was expressed at its founding. However, the history clearly indicates that student radicalism did not begin as, nor have as its major focus, an attack on the universities. SDS's present position is a direct outgrowth of student experiences in the university and outside society. (JS)",

Interpreted within a causal model, partial regression coefficients appear to be a generally more satisfactory measure of college effects.

An alliance of black and white leadership is needed to take a positive view of black militancy.

Every school of education should prepare its own Green Beret squads and curriculum specialists, and acquaint teachers with the mode of life of disadvantaged youth.

Such leadership would help to change the country's hostile mood to one of mutual respect between the races, in which black ethnocentricity does not exclude full participation in the country's social, economic, political and cultural structure.

Humanistic studies (history, philosophy, literature and the fine arts) are special targets and victims of the ideology of relevance. They have been viewed as having something important to do with the expression and communication of human values, therefore if what is wrong with our society is the scheme of values to which we subscribe, then humanistic studies should be the educational fulcrum to bring about social change. The methods of  inquiry used in humanistic studies are less subject to codification than those to be found in the factual sciences. Because of this it is easy to manipulate the humanities in the interests of fulfilling political objectives. Institutions of higher learning may find it difficult to stand their ground since many academics sympathize with the political goals of relevance ideologists and cannot bring themselves to reject the educational demands they bring to higher education out of the fear that by rejecting them they will be thought of as having repudiated the political goals. It would seem that there are no changes that can satisfy what is demanded by the relevance ideologists and at the same time preserve the intellectual inquiry of humanistic studies. (WM)",

These students, unable to meet course requirements, usually drop out of college in their first year. The freshman class entering Knox College in Fall 1963 included 24 AWR students who either (1) had an average SAT below 425, (2) had an average SAT below 520 and did not rank in the upper quarter of their high school class, or (3) ranked in the lower half of their high school class. A year later, 50 AWR students in the entering freshman class were referred to certain faculty members for special academic advising, and were offered a different course combination from the one taken by the 1963 group. Sixty-six  percent of the 1964 group were in good standing after 2 years, compared to 33% of the 1963 group. Onl y 4 of the 1964 group have been dropped from the college, compared to 10 of their 1963 counterparts. None of the students in either group earned a B average in any one year, but the 1964 AWR students' chances of academic success were greatly improved. Results of this experiment suggest that admitting marginal students at their own risk and placing them in \"special\" or \"filler\" categories usually leads to failure, but that faculty counseling and course patterns that meet individual needs in the first semester of the freshman year can raise academic performance to a satisfactory level.

Governors, state legislators, local politicians, alumni, and parents form some of the groups that provide financial support, often influence university decisions, and sometimes threaten to withdraw support when an institution attempts to move away from the traditional. Although there is an effective working relationship between the federal government and the academic community, federally-funded university research that does not blend in with institutional goals, and federal approaches to campus disorders that differ from those of the university also represent intrusions into  university freedom. As components of groups who influence the direction of higher learning, alumni should protect and defend the right of their universities to questions, analyze, and make constructive judgments on internal matters. Faculty and students should be free to investigate and discuss pertinent issues, and faculty should maintain the right to teach and conduct research on what they consider to be important. Continued infringements upon university functions would eventually suffocate academic freedom and deprive the university of its basic responsibility of training tomorrow's leaders and contributing to the future of higher education and society.

Of the people within the academic community who have responsibility to consider the possibility of change, the professor is the most important. The central issues seem to be the problems of students in the university and the kind of teacher the university makes available to the students. There are many individual programs underway at some colleges and universities, but too many institutions have, in the name of  maintaining standards, fenced out the children of the poor and the victims of discrimination. Something special needs to be done for post-secondary education that is not graduate-school oriented. This would involve a wider array of subjects rather than specialization in one field or in research that leads to the Ph.D. Academic credit could be earned by all students who particpate in university-sponsored social action programs on or off campus. The training of prospective teachers should include specialized knowledge and skills that equip them to work effectively with students at post-secondary levels, particularly at the growing number of junior colleges.

The department head articulates and interprets the overall institutional concerns and transmits them to the faculty.  No dean can be knowledgeable in all fields of instruction over which he has jurisdiction, and has to rely on the knowledge and experience of the department chairman, who is the spokesman for the intellectual aims and vitality of his discipline. Among his many functions, the department chairman sets the course for the direction and development of the department, sets up conditions of faculty service that allow faculty members to make their best contributions to the welfare of the students and the department, and balances the needs of the department against the needs and resources of the institution.

The degree of activism was determined by items checked by the students to indicate their participation in any of several campus activities. Some survey results concurred with earlier findings: the identifiable activists came from middle-class homes where educational experiences had stimulated their mental curiosity, and they were more creative, autonomous, and service-oriented than other students. Unlike previous  studies, however, activists were found to be practical rather than romantic, and no less religious or dogmatic than their non-activist peers. They were found to be intellectual but not academically inclined and therefore not outstanding students. They tended to be talented in nonacademic areas such as art, speech, drama and writing. Findings also indicate that a majority of the student activists studied seem to be aggressive, self-confident, and find leadership roles stimulating. Yet they are normal, well-balanced individuals who share many similarities with and are liked by other students. (WM)",

No shred of evidence was found to indicate any basis for preferring one teaching method over another as measured by the performance of students on course examinations. Underlying all theories concerning the efficacy of one teaching method over another is an implicit model of how teaching and learning are linked. However, we really do not know what the linkage is. The need for establishing clear and unequivocal links between a theory of learning and a theory of teaching is a vital one. To answer this need, research on comparative college teaching methods has to move in new directions: (1) to find the commonalities among all  distinctive college teaching methods; and (2) to develop models of the teaching-learning situation. Nothing new will be discovered about college teaching methods until new questions are asked and their answers sought in research that is significantly different from that pursued in the past.

Their difficulty with basic mathematics is further aggravated by traditional teaching techniques that demand extensive reading ability and a thorough knowledge of English. At Morgan State College, a non-verbal program of instruction for remedial mathematics was developed which requires limited reading skills and allows students to progress at their own pace. A 2-phase study was conducted to assess the program's applicability in teaching. Selected participants were freshmen who scored below the twenty-fifth percentile on the qualitative and quantitative sections of their college entrance examinations. In the first phase the students were divided  into an experimental group that utilized the program and a control group that was taught by the lecture-and-text method. The second phase was similar to the first, but weak elements of the program had been improved. The 2 groups in both phases worked 3 hours per week for 10 weeks. Programed instruction proved to be as effective as traditional teaching methods in the first phase, and superior to them in the second. It was also observed that the experimental groups progressed faster than the control groups. It is felt that this program of instruction has the potential for providing effective remedial mathematics instruction at the college level. (WM)",

        "description":"A formal analytical approach was utilized to develop chart analyses of all movements within 33 selected piano concertos composed in the twentieth century. The macroform, or overall structure, of each movement was determined by the initial statement, frequency of use, and order of each main thematic element identified. Theme groupings were then classified under formal classical prototypes of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (ternary, sonata-allegro, 5-part or 7-part rondo, theme and variations, and others), modified versions of these forms (three-part design), or a variety of free sectional forms. The chart and thematic illustrations are followed by a commentary discussing each movement as well as the entire concerto. No correlation exists between styles and forms of the 33  concertos--the 26 composers use traditional, individualistic, classical, and dissonant forms in a combination of ways. Almost all works contain common unifying thematic elements, and cyclicism (identical theme occurring in more than 1 movement) is used to a great degree. None of the movements in sonata-allegro form contain double expositions, but 22 concertos have 3 movements, and 21 have cadenzas, suggesting that the composers have largely respected standards established in the Classical-Romantic period. Appendix A is the complete form diagram of Samuel Barber's Piano Concerto, Appendix B has concentrated analyses of all the concertos, and Appendix C lists each movement according to its design.

During this period student selection practices differed at each institution but were generally based on prescribed standards of academic readiness. The need for consistency in requirements led to establishment of the College Entrance Examination Board, which administered standardized testing across institutions to evaluate student performance (scholastic achievement) and predict grades in college (scholastic aptitude). The Educational Testing Service later became the Board's testing agent to build, administer and score examinations, report test results and conduct necessary research. Part II covers  the second half of the twentieth century in which measurement emerged as a science, supplementing measures of academic aptitude and high school performance with measures of other variables such as interests, motivation, leadership, and other individual student differences. Research organizations or teams in university-based centers currently utilize measurement science to study problems such as student input factors, influential forces within college environments and their impact on students. These efforts could expand to include studies on the interaction between students and their learning environments, teaching procedures for heterogeneous student bodies, and the improvement of criteria by which students are evaluated.

Widespread use of graduate assistants has caused equal concern although there is little doubt that their participation in all aspects of research and instruction will continue. The relationship of undergraduate to graduate education is changing, and as knowledge increases, graduate programs are becoming more specialized. A response to the problems of smaller institutions is the development of consortia. The appropriate role and authority of the graduate dean is a topic of attention in the literature and 3 patterns have emerged--the dean as clerk, the dean as scholar, the dean as  scholar-administrator. A comparable administrative question concerns the organization requied to discharge functions within departments. Many factors --the draft, job requirements, obsolescence of technical knowledge-- account for a greater number of students than formerly and their conditions of life vary considerably. There is also great diversity in the requirements for graduate degrees and few trends are discernible. In the determination of what degrees fo offer, there is a growing need for flexibility and relevant standards.

During the freshman year, undergraduates make crucial choices concerning their academic goals and performance and personal lives. These key decisions are usually made while the freshman is taking general education courses and he is highly influenced by his experiences in them. Although they may provide the most memorable undergraduate experiences, be used to reward bright students, and serve as an area of experimentation, general  education courses are generally hard to staff. Depending upon the university's reputation, clientele, size and financial status, the 3 main channels open for faculty recruitment are: the tenured scholar, the tenureless, and temporary help. The graduate teaching assistant has a key role in defining the university and providing the student with his most important orientation to higher learning, but little is known about the assistant's recruitment, training, teaching ability or future career. Also, too little is known about the social matrix of general education or the context of power within which it must function.

The evaluative reports provided by the FCES of the US Office of Education are authoritative and up-to-date, but are considered as somewhat general in nature. If this Service were to be discontinued, it was  felt that a new independent agency should replace it. The new FCES would speed up the delivery of more detailed reports which would include: number of a student's years of formal education, quality of academic work in terms of his country's rating system and of the US grading scale, number of credit hours in major field and in all subjects, US equivalence for foreign certificates and degrees, and other items. No consensus was reached on the organizational structure of a new FCES but outside funds would be needed for its first 5 years, after which it would be entirely self-supporting.

Divided into 2 parts, the report first surveys 2 decades of research literature concerning the educational, occupational and sociopsychological development of undergraduate and adult women. It includes a critical evaluation of the research and recommendations for further studies. The second part contains an analysis of test, questionnaire and interview data obtained in a 4-year longitudinal study of male and female students. An analysis of the interview data led to the ordering of female students on a continuum of degrees of autonomy.  This ordering into subgroups was subsequently corroborated by an analysis of the test and questionnaire responses. It was found that the differences in degrees of autonomy the women achieved were related to differences in background factors, mainly parental influence, and were predictive of life styles in and after college. Recommendations are made for modifying the academic program, counseling and milieu of each of the subgroups distinguished in the study. The variations of female responses to societal and parental pressures to adopt specific roles or follow specific careers are described in extensive detail. Recognition of the intellectual and marital motivations of college women and their effect upon educational and occupational objectives should be helpful in formulating sound  educational policies.

The projects were designed to be educationally useful to the student trainees, and could be continued on an advanced level in graduate school. In a few cases, more than one trainee worked on one of the studies, which involved: the hippocampal contributions to motivational regulation in the albino rat, admission criteria and procedures in graduate schools of economics, socioeconomic mobility in Rockbridge County (Virginia), the effects of financial aid  on academic achievement, the role of memory requirements and stimulus factors in paired-associate learning, local support for public education in South Carolina, the role of prison organization in the problem of re-educating the inmates, and the organization, teachers, teacher compensation and operating revenues of the Virginia public school system. The program was successful in stimulating meaningful participation in undergraduate research and in contributing new knowledge on some educational problems. The report summarizes each project and indicates how each set of findings could contribute to specific areas in the field of education. (WM)",

The LAD system allows a subject to proceed in his own way and at his own pace to solve problems which increase in complexity, while recording how the subject solves a problem and the level of difficulty he has mastered. As problems increase in complexity, the subject must develop a logical procedure for arriving at an effective solution. The research was based on two hypotheses, that freshman LAD scores would not change significantly during 4 years of college, and that freshman or senior scores could probably predict career  choices within occupations followed by engineering graduates of The Cooper Union (electrical, chemical, mechanical, and civil engineering). A correlation of .14 between freshman LAD scores and 4-year college grades was too low to add to usual grade predictors. A correlation of .39 between senior-year LAD and college grades showed that there was a significant relationship between senior year LAD scores and grades. No significant differences in mean LAD scores of those preferring more theoretical careers as opposed to less theoretical careers was found in the 1967-1968 career reports. A later career follow-up is planned. (Author/WM)",

The purposes of such a program, in which students and faculty live in the city while continuing their normal course work, would be to: (1) enhance the curriculum by broadening the context in which courses are studied rather than adding new courses (2) rehabilitate housing units in which the project was located (3) participate in and render service to the community (4) provide college-age personnel to social service agencies already operating. The program is designed both to supplement existing community services and to respond to unmet needs within the community. The provision of college trained people  functioning as MEMBERS of the community was aimed at countering a major weakness in community development--the lack of trained personnel. Research indicated that buying and rehabilitating demands large capital investments but the establishment of residence units on a rental or leasing basis is feasible and desirable. A small college can successfully initiate and implement such an urban residence program without capital outlay. Cost analysis of the project and analysis of the geographic area and choice of site are included; the course structure, social service opportunities, and the administrative problems of implementation are discussed.

        "description":"Recreational use of wildland is growing rapidly and forms a major portion of the manager's job. About one-third of today's forestry students will be employed by land management agencies or by companies committed to the multiple-use concept. Education, course materials and the supply of forest management graduates have lagged considerably behind needs and the demand for published information on managerial skills and for qualified personnel is increasing. To help meet these needs, this report contains information on the current and expected nature of the recreation management job on the western national forests; judgments of recreation managers on educational deficiencies of forestry graduates and recommendations for changes in forestry education; basic philosophies of education  and recreation management accepted as guides in course development; a general framework for the technical content of a course in wildland recreation management; and a group of 4 courses geared to the above factors. The proposed courses should provide educators with a useful source for preparing their own courses in recreation management within the multiple-use context. Four categories of literature were reviewed and utilized in implementing the project: methods of research in education, methods of job analysis, theory of education and curriculum development, technical components and education in wildland recreation management. Additional course recommendations are expected to appear in 1969 as a publication of the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station. (JS)",

The final pattern, however, was the establishment of a system of area community colleges and area vocational colleges. Particulars of their organization, governance, and funding are given. By July 1966, all 99 counties had worked on a study or plan for developing a vocational or community college. Of the 13 resulting area schools, four became area vocational schools and nine, area community colleges. The 13 areas took in 83 counties. Work had also begun on incorporating the  existing 16 public community junior colleges into an organized area school administration. Currently there are 11 area community colleges and four vocational schools. At date of writing, seven counties were still unorganized, unassimilated, or unspecified for vocational or community function. The concept of area schools has permitted such great expansion of post-high school vocational/technical and adult education programs that 1967-68 enrollment in the system exceeded 80,000. Certain issues remained unresolved, such as certification, accreditation, and the training of adequate staff. (HH)",

Literature on pre-service training shows general agreement on the need for knowledge of the history, philosophy, and unique features of the junior college, of adolescent psychology, of curriculum, and of subject matter. Of the 20 state-supported senior colleges and universities (out of 22 queried) that had graduate programs, 16 had programs for junior college teachers. The programs varied greatly: none had courses in adolescent psychology, many had administration courses, some taught both senior and junior college teaching, two led to a master's degree in teaching, one provided post-master's work, one led to an Ed.D., several gave a master's in subject matter, one offered  an internship ($3150) in selected junior colleges. Two programs were still being prepared. On in-service training, a questionnaire to the presidents of 39 public junior colleges brought 31 usable replies. Twenty-one said they had an in-service program; 26 had a faculty handbook. Replies to 21 questions on the usefulness of certain items to the orientation of new faculty are shown by total and by percentage. Knowledge of one's own college is considered more important than knowledge of junior colleges in general. Recognition of duties and responsibilities to administration, staff, other faculty, and board were considered most important. Responses varied on the value of counseling, psychology, student traits, programs available, and follow-up studies. (HH)",

It asked for identity, reasons for leaving college, job information, curriculum, courses, and educational, vocational, and personal guidance data. The respondents were mostly single, non-graduates, working full time, or in school full time. Non-graduates transferred to a senior school, had money problems, had poor grades, or had not found the courses they needed. About half were taking (or had taken) further education at another institution. Almost three-fourths had received a better understanding of their interests and abilities, usually from a teacher. Graduates and transfers had been helped  by a counselor. Non-graduates had used guidance tests or self-help. Eleven per cent wished they had had more guidance and help with study habits. All but the non-graduates felt that the programs suited their work plans and that vocational advice was available. Technical students felt a shortage of vocational courses. Nearly three-fourths felt the programs suited their educational objective; more than half, that it suited their personal needs. Graduates and transfers were more favorable toward the curriculum and student personnel services. Non-graduate opinion was less favorable and should be studied further. For on-going evaluation and to improve offerings, the author recommends a questionnaire for all full-time students who withdraw or drop out. (HH)",

This idea of a residence hall where students live and work together may be organized around a major field (science, engineering, arts) or for a deliberate interdisciplinary mix. Usually a House plan brings living and learning together to complement each other, but a commuter college like Cypress must organize its Houses without benefit of dormitory life. The plan is intended, in these days of large enrollment, to minimize the impersonality of a &quot;punch card&quot; campus and the sense of alienation that exacerbates current student revolt. Each House will be in a major building (vocational technical, fine arts, library, business, humanities, sciences, physical education), near the  entrance for easy access and prevention of interference with classes. It will be a complete student center and, depending on size and interest, will include food services, lounges, library reference and browsing material, seminar rooms, study areas, possibly audio-tutorial systems, a House manager, student government offices, space for leisure-time activities (music, sports), bookstore, and barbershop. House spirit and pride will be achieved by participation in House government, social and cultural activities, vocational and personal counseling, and the chance to enjoy diverse opportunities. A few disadvantages are anticipated, but it is felt they will be solved without great difficulty. (HH)",

For evaluation of college outputs, several indices were used; for student attitudes, two sets of items were used. Of the seven canonical  analysis made to estimate the relationships among the three factors, five showed statistically significant correlations. One showed two dimensions between external determinants and the four JCES; the second found three common dimensions between the external determinants and measures of student satisfaction and achievement; the third described the relationship between external determinants and student participation in activities; the fourth associated the JCES with 19 items of student satisfaction and achievement; the fifth correlated the JCES with participation in student activities.

At CCNY there was a slight difference in graduation rate between transfers and natives; at Hunter (Bronx), there was none. Of the transfers, 72% lost no credits; 21% lost up to four credits; only three students lost 10 or more credits. The comparison of academic performance takes into account initial differences in academic readiness between the natives and the transfers on entry into their respective freshman classes. (The native students were a random sample of those who had had a high school average below 85%, to make them comparable to the transfer group.) On  entry into the junior year, relative progress seems somewhat better for the natives than for the transfers; this, however, should be interpreted cautiously, as several dissimilarities were not taken into account. The analysis suggests that students entering Bronx Community College with the same high school average as those entering CCNY as freshmen can be expected to earn about the same final 2-year indices as the native CCNY students. This expectation is even clearer in the case of the Hunter (Bronx) students. (HH)",

With medical and health services growing so fast, federal agencies predict an average need of 10,000 workers per month through 1975. In North Carolina alone, employees in the surveyed services exceeded 66,000 in early 1967, and employers forecast about a 30% increase in health service jobs by 1973, raising the total above 85,000. Currently the greatest need is for registered nurses. About 80% of all personnel is expected to come from schools, on-the-job training, and the presently unemployed, leaving an unmet need for about 3900 workers.  This report gives charts and tables detailing and correlating the six types of employing institutions surveyed (hospitals, rest homes, laboratories, offices, etc.), the 48 different occupations examined (nurse, medical technologist, orderly, etc.), anticipated employment by occupation, distribution of employment by sex, current job vacancies, projected manpower supply, types of training facility, statewide and area surveys, changes by number and percentage, anticipated additions to health services, etc. Appendices include definitions from the Dictionary of Occupational Titles for all the occupations studied, a list of non-surveyed occupations considered in short supply by sampled employers, and the methodology and scope of the study.

Students gave data on their background and plans, participation in non-academic activities, financial and work status, and general satisfaction with the college. Most planned to transfer to a 4-year college. They were satisfied with most aspects of the performance of their instructors, describing them as clear, factual, consistent, and concerned with the students. The students typically participated in extracurricular activities, but seldom achieved in the sense of attaining public recognition of their accomplishments. Most worked for at least part of their two years and most commuted to campus. Working or commuting, however, had little effect on college  experience or achievement. Graduates were generally satisfied with their 2-year college. Some expected problems, such as finances, were found to be real; others, such as working or commuting time, were not as great as anticipated. (HH)",

That students taught and/or counseled by other students will benefit from the experience has been demonstrated in recent research, but the present proposal differs in that it does not require the students who teach or counsel to be academically superior, and the greatest change in desired behavior is predicted for the counselor or tutor, not the counselee or tutee. The models included are for student counseling, a freshman English composition course, and a biology course. The objectives, procedures, and a plan for evaluation are provided for each model. These theory-derived guidelines were developed to assist  educational planners to deliberately capitalize on the influence which peers are known to exert on each other, and the evaluation plans make it possible to determine whether the programs have their intended effect.

Follow-up studies, begun with the opening of the College, have indicated that the student who completes the remedial program and proceeds to freshman composition has a better chance of success (C or better) than the initially qualified student who was not required to enroll in remedial courses. Two main problems were faced: (1) 60-70% of the entering freshmen require remedial English; (2) most instructors are prepared to teach only literature and have little interest in composition and grammar. Only enthusiastic and qualified teachers, therefore, are selected to offset the hostility and/or indifference of the students and the difficulties of  large-group instruction. Course content and objectives are carefully defined. An intense schedule--daily classes for a 9-week term--is recommended for reinforcement. Details of the College programs in Basic English Review and Basic Writing Review are given, including schedule, class size, teaching methods, testing and grading, statistical results, workload credit for the staff, and distribution of students from large to small groups. The College uses a test of its own making (rather than ACT or SCAT) and plans to adopt an audio-tutorial system in Fall 1969. This system will not require additional staff as it can be supervised by a full-time, paraprofessional tutor. (HH)",

The writer finds that colleges generally operate under what he calls &quot;the traditional&quot; or &quot;the productive&quot; system of hierarchy. The traditional administrative pattern includes a rigid chain of command; fixed division of labor; motivation, control, and direction of people by persuasion, reward, or punishment; and a generally low opinion of both faculty and students. He feels the productive system is more acceptable to modern educators as  it enhances both professional and student effectiveness and achievement of personal goals; withdraws administrative direction; resists compartmented and proliferating administrative titles; and rotates administrative assignments. Under this system, both students and teachers are involved in formulation of institutional policy, not its enactment. The board of trustees (which can also formulate policy), exists to establish or enact it for the district. Faculty are truly involved in policy formulation when they are sure the board will enact it to an acceptable degree; they work best on continuing problems through standing committees, their committee assignment subject only to formal ratification by the Senate.

Responses are reported in self-explanatory tables, presented in declining order of frequency and percentage of responses. The results indicate that participating students view the program favorably, and many recommend participation by more students in more courses. These favorable responses are consistent with previous studies on the academic performance of these students that show the program to be successful and worthy of encouragement by high school and college advisors.

In September 1968, the first regional conference for state leaders of community colleges was held to discuss the role of state board members and their staffs in these growing systems of higher education in the West. Among the current programs of WICHE that concern the junior college is the Improvement of Nursing Curricula to revise the programs in western schools of nursing, from the associate degree through the master's, by applying research findings to clinical content. Each year, starting in 1967, four meetings are to be held for this  purpose. Also, the nursing profession in the West has recognized a need to clarify the differences between BA and AA degree nursing programs by behavior and function of graduates. The 100 schools of the Western Council on Higher Education for Nursing have taken part in the Nursing Measurement Program by providing more than 1500 items for preliminary selection of nursing behaviors. The most pertinent items were chosen to make up a pilot questionnaire. This was submitted to a sample of nursing faculty and graduating students of the Council's member schools. The results will be analyzed to establish the differences between graduates of the two kinds of nursing education. (HH)",

Lloyd Warner Index of Status Characteristics were studied to determine: (1) differences in the motives, values, attitudes, goals, aspirations, self-concepts, and interests of these two groups; (2) if any of these factors distinguish between nonachievers (GPA below 2.0) of different socioeconomic backgrounds; (3) if measures of motivation distinguish between achieving and nonachieving students; (4) if socioeconomic background is related to achievement in junior college and career aspirations; and (5) the implications of the findings. Among the conclusions: (1) achieving lower-class students have a higher need to achieve than achieving middle-class students; (2) the high proportion of Mexican-American students  in the lower socioeconomic group typically receive D or F grades in the lowest available remedial English class, which contributes substantially to their underachievement; and (3) the personality measures administered distinguish between socioeconomic groups, but not between achievers and nonachievers. It was concluded overall that the junior college is not meeting the needs of many of its students, and special curricula and help from the counseling staff in providing realistic evaluation of students' aspirations are needed.

As a control group, 73 randomly selected students, eligible for the remedial program, were placed in the regular freshman English course, to be compared with an experimental group of 461 students who were in the remedial program because of GPA, attrition rate, and re-test results. Results showed that the remedial program had little effect on the students' academic progress as measured by these three dependent variables. The remedial program, as presently designed, produced a slightly higher overall first-term GPA, but even that did not reach a grade level of C. The program made no difference in student withdrawal rates nor did it produce a better overall score on a standardized test (one not  previously seen by either students or teacher). Moreover, 70% of the control group succeeded in the regular English course. From these results, it seems that (1) present attempts at academic remediation need considerable revision, (2) such remediation per se may not be a viable goal for students with low scores on standard tests, and (3) it is generally just as effective for low-scoring students to go directly into the regular freshman English sequence. In short, the program fails both in facilitating success in typical academic courses and in reducing withdrawal from college. (HH)",

Evaluation of the project involved examination of changes in student achievement and attitudes, library circulation  and attendance records, and teachers', librarian aides', and principals' reactions to the library project.

The instructional materials center, as defined for this discussion, is a library with broader than traditional purpose, housing more diversified and extensive collections of materials. It  is staffed by leaders with varied general experience and specializations in library, curriculum, and media, who work supportively with staff and students. Topics discussed include personnel, program, materials, the indexing system, budget, and housing spatial allocation. An annotated bibliography of 24 items is appended. (Author/JB)",

The survey respondents, all members of the American Educational Research Association, were teachers, administrators, consultants, and researchers. Half had Ph.D's and most were authors of papers and articles as well as active readers of other journals. They advocated more frequent review of several topics. Respondents proposed changes to improve the writing style, editorial quality, and scope of the Review. Half indicated they would prefer an annual review of educational research to the current Review. Overall use of the journal was found to be moderate, partly because each educational  researcher tends to read issues only in his areas of specialization. Two major uses of the Review were for current awareness and for learning about areas peripheral to one's speciality. In addition, the Review acted as a stimulus to information-seeking. The author recommended changes in format and content so that each issue would appeal to specialists on the topic reviewed and also to a more general audience attracted by current awareness features.

The study recommends a library facilities master plan that calls for the establishment of a county library system to be operated by Dade County with headquarters at the existing Miami Public Library. The master plan suggests a new headquarters facility in Miami, the building of four regional libraries in various parts of the  county, the establishment of new branch facilities, the expansion of certain existing facilities and the closing of others. The study suggests that some of the libraries' existing services ought to be intensified and that various new services need to be provided. A timetable for the implementation of the governing structure for the county library system, the methods of providing financial support for its operation, and the procedures for financing the recommended construction program are included.

The need for such a plan arises from the requirements of Title III of the Library Services and Construction Act and from the increasing demands placed upon libraries and the resulting need to use available resources better. The intent of the program is (1) to promote the increased sharing of resources by libraries, particularly of different kinds and with different area jurisdictions; (2) to use modern technology in an appropriate, economic manner to facilitate the sharing of resources; and (3) to expand the availability of library materials to every resident of the State. Although elements of the program are already in existence, in experimentation, or in  discussion, the plan proposed a logical integration of these elements into a single planned progression of steps. Included in this report are a description of the proposed network, the program plan and schedule for implementation, and the specifications of the processing center and switching center. Aspects of the network which are described include geographical area groups, the State Library Card Production Service, specialty groups, a switching center to provide access to major library resources and geographical speciality groups, and technical services.

Johnson argued that if early environmental stimulation or deprivation has a significant effect on intellectual ability, then individuals who are genetically identical and who are exposed to a common early environment should resemble one another more closely in IQ than similar individuals who have not shared a common environment. Johnson compared the IQ's of 23 pairs of twins separated at different times. He found that twins who were separated after they were 1 year old resembled one another significantly less closely than early separated twins. A Danish study of 12 pairs of Juel-Nielsen (1962) supported this result. A study by Shields in 1962 found no significant difference in the scores of 48 pairs of twins on (1) Raven's Dominoes Intelligence Test and (2) the synonyms  part of the Mill Hill Vocabulary Scale, regardless of the age of the pair of separation.

There were 104 families selected. Included in the study were the fathers, the mothers, and 58 teenage sons, and 72 teenage daughters. They were given eight psychological tests. In the 58 tests of the first hypothesis, word association was the only variable which did not show significant similarity between parent and child. In regard to the last part of the hypothesis, English vocabulary and height were the only factors which showed a significant correlation  between father and mother. The second hypothesis was accepted because spatial visualization and reasoning ability showed a unique family correlation pattern. In the third hypothesis, only perceptual speed and musical aptitude clearly fulfilled the requirement that the best fits to the autosomal genetic model were approximately same percentages for the father-son distribution of scores as they were for the mother-daughter scores. Inductive reasoning showed a possibility of having an underlying dichotomy, but none of the remaining variables showed any evidence of underlying dichotomy for both father-son and mother-daughter distribution.s (DO)",

The experimental children were divided into two stimulus condition groups; one received the same stimuli each session, and one received different stimuli from one session to the next. Each of these two groups was also divided into four rating groups. During a rating session, the child was asked to choose from 14 adjectives the one that he thought best described a particular Greek letter.

Subjects in the pilot assessment consisted of 80 children (3 1/2 to 6 1/2 years old) and their mothers from each of Monongalia and Upshur Counties, West Virginia. Mothers were given a demographic child-rearing practices interview-questionnaire. Children were divided into two groups and were given different batteries of tests. Their performance revealed cultural diversity rather than uniform cognitive-intellectual deficits. Clearest deficits centered on verbal tasks or problem settings which demanded symbolic representation, which appeared to increase in severity in disadvantaged children.  Spatial reasoning, memory functions, and conservation or logical operations skills did not appear impaired. A section on behavioral objectives for a preschool curriculum is outlined in the document, and a section is devoted to a survey of representative preschool intervention research. An extensive bibliography is appended. (DO)",

This finding may be explained in part by a lack of specific academic achievement objectives in the program design. The evaluation processes also showed a need for a more detailed definition of desired teacher behavior. Each teacher was observed for 1 hour on two separate occasions in accordance with an observation schedule, to find out the number and kind of adult-child interactions in her classroom. Each child was rated by his teacher on the Children's Rating Scale developed in the Pittsburgh project.  Analysis of the data led to the recommendation that more specific guidelines be established for classroom personnel concerning their duties, ways of reinforcing learning behavior, use of individualized instruction, and academic skill development. Over half of this report is made up of appendixes, which include a detailed description of the primary program and facsimiles of the rating scale and observation schedule. (MS)",

Subjects were 140 families from city-sponsored, private cooperative, and university-operated nursery schools. Eight constructs were devised: (1) high vs. low stress tolerance, (2) self-confident vs. fearful, (3) achievement-oriented vs. nonachievement-oriented, (4) approach-oriented vs. withdrawn, (5) autonomous vs. suggestible, (6) rebellious vs. dependable, (7) destructive vs. constructive, and (8) alienated vs. trusting. Observation data on parent behavior were rated on scales approximating child scales and self-report parental attitudes were collected. Research  is incomplete, but laboratory experimental and naturalistic observations were assessed and the latter was favored. It was concluded that observational studies which focus on the human psyche and human behavior seldom can achieve situational control, reliability of measurement, or precise formulation of process variables. They can, however, proceed self-critically, using statistical tests of significance on well-formulated hypotheses which are well defined conceptually and operationally. (DO)",

        "description":"It has been observed that following a brief period of isolation, children tend to show a greater increase in responsiveness on a simple motor task than nonisolated children do when verbal reinforcement is given periodically during a task. One explanation is that the social deprivation of the brief isolation heightens the motivation to receive social reinforcement. Another explanation is that the phenomenon is attributable to the generalized motivational properties of the anxiety which the condition of isolation arouses. Forty first-grade children were given a simple motor (marble drop) task after their anxiety level had been measured. After the child became familiar with the task, periodic verbal reinforcement was given as the child performed the task. An analysis of the data  showed that response-rate increase over the task period (4 minutes) did not distinguish between high and low anxiety children. It was concluded from the overall findings that anxiety in young children is more likely to obstruct than facilitate performance on a simple motor task involving periodic social reinforcement. (WD)",

The objectives set were (1) to improve self-image, (2) to increase perceptual acuity, (3) to improve language ability, and (4) to improve problem-solving and concept-formation skills. The school is organized as an autotelic responsive environment which the children attend for 3 hours a day. The program has been operating for 3 years, with the number of children participating each year being 30, 30, and 50. Evaluations have been based on pretests and posttests of NNS children, on comparisons with middle class children who also use the school, and on comparison in kindergarten and first grade with children from similar backgrounds. Tests have been selected  or developed to measure program effects. Due to the small sample sizes, the results are quite tentative. But the following conclusions are supported for graduates of the program: (1) the school seems to improve their self-image and (2) their language and perceptual development is ahead of what would be expected had they not had the program. One negative datum is that first grade teachers do not see any difference between NNS and other deprived children which suggest that the program effects may wash out by the middle of the first grade.

        "description":"In an attempt to improve the readiness of 3- and 4-year-old disadvantaged Mexican-American children, the New Nursery School was developed in Greeley, Colorado. The activities are autotelic; that is, the child does something for its own sake rather than for the sake of obtaining rewards or avoiding punishments that have no inherent connection with the activity itself. One of the activities available is the typing booth. If the child wishes, he can play with an electric typewriter. This activity is structured to subtly lead the participant through several levels of achievement with respect to language development: (1) free exploration, (2) matching upper case letters on a card and on the typewriter, (3) matching upper and lower case letters, (4) typing words, and (5) dictating  stories. The children's performance on the typewriter and on subsequent achievement tests indicates that (1) there is a relationship between the number of times the child goes into the booth, the amount of time spent therein, and achievement on the booth activities, (2) the booth experience is of little value to the 3-year-olds, (3) children with low IQ scores are least likely to be high achievers in the booth, and (4) the children with high booth achievement were the most benefited in language development.

Three teachers from Group II and four teachers from Group I were assigned to classes in Experiment A (Bereiter-Engelmann), and four teachers from Group II and three from Group I taught in Experiment B. Observation revealed that while there was more variation among B classes than among A classes, no classes in B were similar to classes in A, either in terms of content emphasis or predominant  method of instruction. At the end of the program tests were administered to the children, and teachers and parents were inventoried. Experiment A appeared to overcome initially negative teacher attitudes. Students in Experiment A (with a mean IQ of 108.1) and Experiment B (with a mean IQ of 105.7) had a higher measured intelligence than the control group (with a mean IQ of 94.8).

The Title-I sample included 122 prekindergartners, 52 kindergartners with previous school experience, and 42 kindergartners with no previous school experience. Prekindergartners improved on three subscales of the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities (ITPA) and on color and shape naming. The group having prekindergarten experience surpassed the others only on the vocal encoding scale of ITPA. Title I children surpassed non-Title I children only  on the verbal shape name inventory. Non-Title I children excelled in the auditory vocal association and the auditory vocal automatic subtests. No significant differences were found on teacher-rated pupil behavior.

Translation of this concern into constructive programs for early childhood education is a profound problem, one that is debated often and emotionally. There is a dichotomy between those who favor educational practices based on concepts of the child in terms of his whole emotional-cognitive development and those who favor a narrower approach aimed specifically at developing certain skills measurable by intelligence tests. Evangeline Burgess and the Pacific Oaks College and Children's School fall close to the former class; the Bereiter-Engelmann program, close to the latter. There are also debates on the merit of Piaget's ideas on the relationship of early  experience and cognitive development. There is concern for the need to understand the quality and quantity of stimulation most beneficial to intellectual development. This includes the debate over the value of such projects as Head Start and the importance of employing teachers who can do the job intended by the educational program involved. Often neglected by educational program planners is the clear definition of their educational goals--whether they would or should emphasize intelligence and narrow skills or intellect and understanding.

The returns supplied the following statistics: agency sponsored competition occurred in almost twice the number of communities (64 percent) as school sponsored interschool athletics (37 percent); 81 percent of the schools utilized a teacher trained or experienced in sports, while only 28 percent of the agencies employed adults with training; many schools and  a vast majority of agencies did not provide adequate medical screening for boys joining teams; and less than half of the principals expressed approval of school sponsored athletics, and 13 percent reserved opinion. Research does not prove that sports adversely affect physical growth, and there are no data concerning long-range physiological effects of competitive athletics on youth. On the basis of these findings, the committee issued a policy statement containing guidelines for a sound physical education program. The statement and a bibliography are included in this document.

In human relationships, the mental health status of teacher and child interact to produce a positive or negative classroom environment. Mental health consists of (1) objective judgment, (2) autonomy, (3) emotional maturity, (4) self-realizing drive, (5) self-acceptance, and (6) respect for others. Basic needs of an individual can be divided into five categories: physiological needs, safety needs, love needs, esteem needs, and the need for self-actualization. The home and school should fulfill these needs as a minimal requirement for good mental health. Neurotic anxiety exists when a need is unfulfilled, and teachers can do things to cope with pupils' anxieties. Mental health aids  for teachers are important, and schools should have counseling services. (DO)",

Short term intervention research has made gains when directed to specific behaviors, but its effects on complex behaviors have not been established. Massive environmental change produces great improvement in abilities associated with adult social competence and affects intellectual functioning, educational attainment, economic productivity, and  family stability. Intervention effort which lies between these extremes is too new to be adequately assessed. While physical environment has received much attention, priority should be given to the behavior of the interpersonal environmental agent interacting with the child and mediating between the child and physical environment. Behavioral requirements of an effective environmental agent are outlined. Longitudinal intervention research is needed and should be encouraged. (DO)",

The purpose of this testing was to compare the verbal recall ability of children of different ages and socioeconomic status. The verbal material was read to the child. At the completion of each item, the child was asked to recall the verbal material in the order given. Task I consisted of CVC trigrams. Task 2 consisted of nouns. Tasks 3 and 4 consisted of sentences, meaningless and meaningful, respectively. The language skills necessary to perform the tasks increased, theoretically, from Task 1 to Task 4. The hypotheses that children remember more verbal units as language habits can be more  fully utilized and that older children remember more units than younger children on the higher level tasks and that there is an interaction between socioeconomic status and performance on the tasks were not confirmed. A prediction of a cumulative deficit between socioeconomic groups with increasing age was rejected. (WD)",

The program classes were unstructured and permissive. A contrast group of 33 children was also chosen. Both groups of children participated in a preschool program which began in September 1967. The contrast group would also be ready to enter kindergarten in the fall of 1968, but they had not participated in a preschool program prior to September 1967. The children in both groups were administered the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities (ITPA) in November 1967. The test results indicated that both groups were functioning below age norms. Another finding was that the contrast group performed  significantly better than the experimental group on the total ITPA. The contrast group did significantly better on two of the subtests: visual decoding and visual-motor-sequential. The explanation for this result would seem to be the existence of systematic sample bias. The boys scored consistently higher than the girls on the subtests, an unusual finding explained perhaps in part by the fact that a male teacher was present in the program.

The evaluation consisted of analyzing 666 letters and 691 drawings from children, photographs, taped interviews using questionnaires, and letters from educators and professional advisors. The results showed that an educational program using dance, music, and sculpture to integrate visual form and anthropological content  could be used successfully to teach children of ages six to eleven about various cultures.

The data were obtained in a previous study, a survey including a multistage, cluster sample of some 7,000 cases representing 13,484,000 public and private school students. The data had been gathered through questionnaires. Tests for interaction were used to determine if the effects of the mother's aspiration, race, and other characteristics influenced college plans. Findings indicated that a subject's plan to attend college was closely associated with his mother's educational expectation for him. This expectation was related to the mother's educational attainment and religion but  was relatively independent of such characteristics as the subject's IQ and the socioeconomic status of the family. Negroes had the same level of educational aspiration as whites, but the mothers were less likely to expect that their children would go to college, primarily because of the cost involved. Negroes were also less likely to be enrolled in a college preparatory curriculum. Educational goals appeared to be formed at home and in the peer group, rather than in the school environment. (MS)",

Several programs have been undertaken in attempts to meet the needs of Indian students. Among these are counseling and home visitation programs which stress contact with the home in an effort to retain students in school; lunch and breakfast programs which provide free or reduced-price meals; and categorical aid to meet special needs of Indian children. Another plan is to provide sensitivity training for teachers and teachers' aides with emphasis on providing opportunities for Indian children to take pride in their culture and  background and to develop in a well-adjusted manner. The recommendations for providing equal opportunities for Indian children include (1) increasing communication between Indians and whites at all levels, (2) recognizing and teaching the Indians' cultural background, (3) developing the Indian reservations economically, (4) intensifying preschool training programs in order to attack the principal learning obstacles, and (5) sponsoring more research on Indian education.

        "description":"One of a series of studies based on data collected from 1,844 high school students in Canada, this study examined twelfth graders who indicated plans for some post high school training. The study focused on the educational plans of 541 rural and suburban students and the sociological factors relating to the realization of these plans the following year. Factors considered were area of residence, size of community, average high school marks, I.Q., socio-economic status, and religious and ethnic origin. A follow-up on the initial data collection was made a year later to determine if plans were fulfilled. Statistical analysis of data revealed that 4 major factors influenced whether or not a student fulfilled his educational plans. These factors were (1) the student's innate ability,  (2) financing of an extended period of training, (3) student motivation, and (4) social acceptance of such training by elders and peers. Fourteen major findings are included in this report. Related documents are RC 003 186, RC 003 187, and RC 003 293. (SW)",

Educational level and educational performance limited the number of Mexican Americans on the police force. The job performance factors considered were scores on promotion examinations, supervisory ratings, use of sick and annual leave, and accident rates. Mexican Americans were significantly underrepresented in the police force in proportion to Mexican American representation in the city, and they scored lower on the Probationary Patrolman Examination (perhaps attributable to the lack of language facility or poor education in school). However, there were no significant differences  between Spanish-surname and non-Spanish-surname officers in the amounts of sick and annual leave taken, nor in the accident rates. The supervisory efficiency rating was not found to be lower for Spanish-surname officers as previously believed. It was concluded that there was little evidence to support the hypothesis that the rural folk culture background of the Mexican American limited his effectiveness in a complex organization in an industrial economy.

There is an increasing deficit of talent in rural areas due to urban migration. The overall strategy to cope with these problems must be to improve the capability of the rural work force to compete successfully for jobs and to create more jobs in rural areas. There is a lack of opportunity for rural youth for work experiences that lead to fulfilling careers without leaving home. Educational work in the field of labor management is being requested by employers in commercial agriculture at an accelerating rate.

The purpose of the study was to investigate differences in sociocultural origins and migration patterns between individuals residing within the eastern Kentucky area and those who had migrated and taken up residence outside that area. The conclusions of the study indicated that most of te men came from very large, rural families with little formal education on the part of the parents, nearly half of the men completed high school, most of the men had all of their formal schooling in  eastern Kentucky, and most of the men who left the area did so in the initial stages of the ten-year period.

The objective of the study was to investigate differences between migrant (youths who had moved to areas outside eastern Kentucky) and nonmigrant segments of the population. Conclusions indicated that the social situation of the migrant was not favorable for replacing family ties, resulting in the migrant's identifcation more with the home area than with the urban communiy; this in turn reinforced the migrant's definition of his situation as one of transiency rather than permanency.

Technological advances in design (such as open space plans) and construction meterials (such as flooring materials and acoustical treatments) have greatly facilitated the concept of flexible school plants. Advances in the control of illumination and thermal conditions now enable adequate planning for the school  environment.

The causes of and some corrections for these two problems are discussed. Since reading is essentially a process of reconstructing one's experiences back to the printed symbols, background deficiencies seriously hamper the reading of middle- and upper-grade students whose reading material has not been purposely selected to represent a familiar environment. As a corrective approach, teachers should identify and clarify unfamiliar concepts. Secondly, a major inattention factor is prolonged exposure to material that is too difficult. This problem can be corrected by providing appropriate reading matter. Another inattention factor is lack  of reading purpose. This can be remedied by keeping motive questions before the child and by teaching him to set his own purposes. Poor listening skills also hamper reading, but practice in listening will improve the student's reading ability. Finally, lack of interest is a serious inattention factor. The teacher must be careful to teach reading interest as well as reading skill. References are listed. (BS)",

The 40 sounds distinguished by Pitmanic shorthand and some provision for schwa can serve as a basic code. The symbols can be derived from either of two major sources--standardizing the Roman alphabet by assigning each letter and digraph a single sound or supplementing the Roman alphabet by assigning a constant value to each of the 23 useful letters and by creating 17 or more new symbols. As far as possible, the i.t.o. should have only one symbol per sound and should regard the predominant spellings of traditional orthography (t.o.). The i.t.o. must have a similarity to t.o. that allows immediate readability for those  familiar only with t.o. and permits easy transfer for i.t.o. students. An outstanding example of an i.t.o. which supplements the resources fo the Roman alphabet is the Initial Teaching Alphabet. An excellent example of a standardizing i.t.o. is World English Spelling. If it can be demonstrated that educational results from the standardizing i.t.o. are comparable with those of the supplementary type, the latter is preferable because of its similarity to t.o.

This descriptive approach, when applied to reading, means that the child's reading education should focus on the realities of daily life. Syntactic analysis in reading has been handicapped by an overemphasis on lexical content at the expense of other syntactic structures. Thus, the student analyzes language in single words. If a broadened concept of syntactic analysis is to become a valid part of the reading program, it must follow the descriptive principle. Classical studies prepare students for the reading of classics but not for reading \"Time\" magazine or the daily newspapers. The following syntactic and semantic problems are involved in the intelligent reading of a newspaper: (1) headlines and their accuracy in  relation to the story, (2) concentration of information in the lead paragraphs, and (3) frequent use of direct and indirect quotations. The reader should be aware of the verbal jugglings of the content possible within these three areas. Another untapped source of dynamic prose material is the spoken word of radio and television. Prose analysis will probably never be popular among students; however, if the material is pertinent, their interest will be greater. (WL)",

The skill-content approach was aimed directly at teaching reading skills. The guidance approach did not specifically include or exclude skills typically included in teaching children in special reading classes; it was concerned with answering pupil questions about reading skills, understanding self, or social and emotional adjustment. The combination approach combined these two methods. The results of the evaluative tests used--the California Reading Test, the Gray Oral Reading Test, and a special reading  teacher rating scale--suggested that focusing on guidance provides experiences for students in special reading classes that lead to initially higher performance on reading achievement tests. This student enthusiasm for reading presumably can be followed profitably by the direct teaching of necessary reading skills. Statistical procedures and tables are included in two appendixes. (BS)",

Principals' and teachers' opinions on the requirements for a good reading program were surveyed. Data indicated that reading comprehension was more closely related to family income and education than to any facet of the school reading program, that the most effective approach to reading was the whole-word approach with gradual phonics, that remedial work administered during school hours was more successful than that offered during nonschool hours, that a class of 35 students was the maximum size  for successful reading achievement, and that students who had used supplementary readers in addition to basal readers achieved better. The status study indicated that the typical reading program was composed of self-contained classrooms of ability grouped children. Approximately 6 weeks of readiness activities were followed by work in basal and supplementary readers. Phonics and study skills were introduced in the primary and middle grades. Principals and teachers expressed the need for reading specialists, remedial teachers, consultants, and teacher training in the teaching of reading. (BS)",

Getman's program stresses the attainment of proficiency in basic developmental processes such as general body movement, eye movement, and visual-perceptual organization. Kephart's approach attempts to orient the child more fully to his environment in order to promote successful perceptual-motor matches. Delacato's method claims to alter the neurological organization through physical activity.  Visual training has resulted in improved reading ability, but not all attempts have been successful. Optometrists generally support the visual training approach; most eye doctors see little value in it.

A sample diagnostic grouping sheet and skill coding sheets assist teachers in grouping students for instruction. A list of student recreational reading materials is given and supplementary  instructional materials and suggested games and activities are provided for each grade level. A professional reading list is included. This research was supported under Title III of the Elementary and Secondary Act. (CM)",

The major conclusions reached were that implicit speech is a natural adjunct of the reading process, that it is a residue of initially learned oral language patterns, and that it is often used as an additional sensory input. Implications drawn from the study were: (1) that no inhibitory measures should be taken to cause a decrement in manifestation; (2) that implicit speech may be a frame of reference for validating written language patterns as consonant with oral language; (3) that organization of an optimal  reading environment conducive to maturity is a sound method for causing a decrement in implicit speech manifestation; (4) that a basal program emphasizing phonics does not result in an undue manifestation of recorded implicit speech; and (5) that mechanically presented reading material may result in greater implicit speech manifestation.

Twenty second and third graders were interviewed to determine favorite after school and weekend activities.

Each of the three reading pictures was paired with each of the nine nonreading pictures, and 13 choices between two pictures of nonreading activities were included as distractors so that 40 total choices were required. The inventory was administered, and readministered a week later, to 73 second and third graders. A test-retest reliability coefficient was significant beyond the .001 level of confidence. The  following fall, to obtain a measure of concurrent validity the test was administered to another group of 94 second and third graders. Their classroom teachers were then asked to select the 10 students with the highest and lowest interest in leisure time reading. A t-test indicated that the means of the two groups were significantly different. Attitude inventory scores and achievement test scores showed no significant correlation. References are included.

Treatment A subjects used the regular basal program. Treatment B subjects used the same basal program, with the low subgroup receiving additional instruction from remedial reading teachers. Treatment C low subgroups used Houghton Mifflin readiness materials and tradebooks, while the rest of the class used the basal program. Treatment D low subgroups received additional remedial instruction as well as regular classroom instruction with the Houghton Mifflin readiness materials and tradebooks. At the end of the 140-day experimental period, the Stanford Achievement Test, Primary 1, Form X, and the San Diego Attitude Inventory were  administered to all subjects. Additional testing was done with a random sample. Fifty-three tables present and compare the data, and eight tables summarize the trends. It was tentatively concluded that use of the Houghton Mifflin materials plus tradebooks instead of basal readers was more effective than either a regular basal program or remedial teacher time spent with the low subgroups. However, the combination of the special materials with remedial teacher time appeared to be more effective than either by itself. (CM)",

Three studies explored sex differences in relation to differences in socioeconomic status and learning materials. In experiment 1, 16 disadvantaged children explored the keyboard individually for 6 sessions; then a matching task was presented. Eleven keys with words only were exposed. Experiment 2 expanded these procedures, with 20 disadvantaged children participating in 17 sessions. Ten of these subjects were exposed to letters only; 10, to words only. Boys scored significantly higher than girls on the matching task in experiments 1 and 2. No differences were found between word and letter programs. In experiment 3, 15 middle-class  boys and girls participated in 10 exploratory sessions followed by a test. No sex differences were found for the middle-class children. However, the letter program was easier for them.

        "description":"In a study of paradigmatic responding, 14 educable mentally retarded (EMR) boys from a training school were matched on chronological age (CA) and Stanford-Binet IQ scores. Six served as controls, six as experimental subjects, and two as training controls. They were pretested individually for a baseline measure of their paradigmatic responses to noun stimuli. The experimental group was trained to choose high paradigmatic associations following selective monetary reinforcement of their correct choices; all were posttested immediately following training and after a 1-week interval. Results indicated that the EMR's learned the training task regardless of CA. The reinforcement training procedure had a significant effect (p<.05) in rapidly increasing the paradigmatic performance on the  word association task, and this frequency of paradigmatic responding transferred from the training list to the posttest as well as to words not occurring on the training list but used as free associative stimuli on the posttest. The change (p<.05) was still evident 1 week after training. It was concluded that the relatively low incidence of paradigmatic word association responses found in EMR children reflected performance variables rather than a developmental lag in language of EMR children.

Results indicated that subjects reading the two shorter versions required significantly less time (p<.01).

Analysis of comprehension data revealed few significant differences among the three groups  on either immediate recall or long term retention.

The experimental classes received a modified curriculum utilizing the simulated environments technique through the unit approach in social studies with primary emphasis placed upon interaction in small group situations. The contrast classes received whatever was available in their schools or individual instruction in a highly structured environment. Results indicated significant differences (p<.01) favoring the experimental groups in interpersonal relationships, personal effectiveness in social situations, and use of problem solving skills. However, there were no  differences between regular and special class groups. Improvement was noted in all groups on the behavior scales. The only significant difference in academic achievement was in reading comprehension and favored the special classes (p<.05).

        "description":"A 4-year research project developed a preschool program for exceptional children unable to attend public school but not needing to be institutionalized on the basis of empirical behavioral principles. Children were referred from agencies and most had already unsuccessfully used special school services. The average age was 5-5 years, average IQ was 83, and average mental age 4-3 years; scores on the Wide Range Achievement Test averaged early kindergarten level. Utilizing special features in the physical plant, curriculum, and operation of the school, behavioral principles were applied to weaken behaviors interfering with academic learning and to strengthen desirable social and intellectual behaviors. Reading, writing, and arithmetic programs were developed as well as procedures  for maintaining motivation for learning. Specific techniques were applied to modify the behavior of aggressive, shy, and speech deficient children. Investigators worked with parents at home, and the parents supplemented the nursery program. Objectives and procedures of a teacher training program are specified; a bibliography with 23 entries, a list of 10 publications resulting from this research, samples of program studies from the first 2 years, case studies, and eight figures are included.

Scaling was done by jury judgment and by full trial with the children and refined to 26 subscales which related to self-help in travel, formal orientation and mobility pre-cane skills, movement in space, use of sensory cues in travel, and directions and turns. A test-retest procedure with 41 subjects was used to test the reliability. Norming data was collected on 173 subjects, ages 3 to 12, who were representative of elementary age blind children. All were blind or had light  perception only, and had normal intelligence and no physical disabilities which would interfere with orientation and mobility. Twenty-four test items which possessed an acceptable range of difficulty (20 to 80%) and a high reliability (.91 for the entire form) were used to construct a short form. The remaining promising items were used to construct instructional tasks in orientation and mobility for young blind children (34 items) and pre-cane orientation and mobility skills (25 items). Forty-four references, 11 tables, and the instruments are given. (Author/SN)",

        "description":"Several experiments that manipulate stuttering by the use of delayed auditory feedback (DAF) and the prolongation of speech are reported. In a study on six severe stutterers (aged 15 to 47), self monitoring as a source of reinforcement in the use of DAF reduced stuttering frequency. Stuttering frequency was investigated with six severe stutterers (aged 14 to 28) as a function of five different intervals of DAF. Results indicated that the continuous presentation of DAF significantly improved fluency (p&lt;.02), that there was little difference between the various levels of DAF, and that there was no lasting effect. A method for shaping fluent speech in stutterers was developed that modified the Goldiamond (1965) method by using the DAF without his special contingent relationships,  that used no monitoring of reading rate, and added rate discrimination training to the fluency shaping program. Eight severe stutterers (aged 15 to 47) spent a total of 10 to 40 hours in the program, advanced at their own rate, and had blocking levels of zero by the time they reached the conversation part of the program; the effect had lasted 6 months as the time of this report. An auditory interference theory and a reexamination of the Sutton and Chase report are presented. (Author/SN)",

In the Rotation-Discrimination Complex and the Size-Discrimination Simple experiments, upper and lower test achievement subgroups were subjected to two basic types of visual discrimination at different levels of task complexity. Significant improvement in differentiation by the posterior intrinsic system was achieved by training retardates with a mental age of at least 5 1/2 years. Both groups solved a simple problem but with no improvement in differentiation. The function of intention was inefficient on both problems for both groups. On the Distance-Discrimination Complex boys did significantly worse than girls at the more difficult position. Distance perception  was maturational and related to mental rather than chronological age. Incorrect responses were made with reference to a rigid, orderly space of parallels and perpendiculars. On the Hypothesis-Discrimination Complex the subjects were confronted with experimental situations in which they could choose either of two equally valid hypotheses, and when a choice was made, conditions were changed to bring about a switch to the other. Difficulty in shifting was associated with older chronological age. (Author/SN)",

Detailed information was collected on 4,300 of the estimated 6,755 hearing impaired students enrolled in schools, classes, and other special education programs in the states of Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. The information concerned hearing threshold levels, ability to communicate, intelligence levels, achievement levels, methods used to communicate, and selected demographic characteristics. Every state in the country was also surveyed to obtain descriptive information about hearing screening programs and  educational services for the hearing impaired. The conclusion was that a nationwide system for collecting data on hearing impaired students is feasible. Recommendations were made that a permanent program for collection of data and procedures for a sequential and segmented approach to the major operational and coverage problems be established; that major policies be determined by representatives of the sources and users of the data; and that the program include resources for improving methodology and evaluating data.

After each item, the tester's voice was reduced 5 decibels. In the DIP test, pictures were arranged in rhymed pairs with a distinction in consonants between the two word items. Of the 202 subjects, a random selection of 138 was used for final data analysis. Subjects were grouped by year (age range 4-10 to 12-10 years), had an IQ over 90, and included a variety of degrees, types, and patterns of hearing loss. All were screened for significant visual, neurological, motor, and emotional problems. It  was concluded that the TIP and DIP tests were satisfactory measures, with a threshold correlation of .88 to .98 with pure tone thresholds for the TIP test and a test reliability of .60 to .84 for the DIP test. Twenty-six references and 21 tables are given. (Author/SN)",

        "description":"The purpose of this first phase of a continuing research program was the development of a test of creative problem solving in general design. A design class of 186 members was divided into an experimental and control group; a non-design control group (an educational psychology class) of 45 was also tested. Multivariate interpretation of creative problem solving was developed; five test problems were selected to make up the Creative Design Test (CDT); and solutions were judged for fluency, flexibility, and originality. An acceptable scoring and interproblem reliability was achieved on the instruction, library materials, and school pride problems, but not on the laundromat and paper product problems. No construct validity was obtained from teacher ratings of creativity in class or  from a comparison of design and non-design students. Predicted relationships were not supported between performance on the CDT and the amount of problem-related knowledge possessed or whether systematic or non-systematic problem solving procedures were employed. Variations in variety and originality of prior solutions examined before the test made little difference to test performance. (Author/SN)",

Existing facilities must be remodeled to carry on the educational process for earthquake resistance, and for fallout protection. Residential areas, where schools are located, are deficient in shelters. Fallout protection can be achieved in schoolhouse design without impairing the educational intent and without excessive cost. Remodeling should also include improved library facilities, media center, and special facilities. Studies were made of six existing schools in California. Burton Elementary School serves grades K-8 in  semi-rural surroundings, and enrollment should increase to 1,000. Sacramento High School is akin to \"campus-type\" plan arrangement of 14 buildings. Enrollment is 2,500. Marie A. Murphy Elementary School is a \"finger-plan\" school. Future enrollment after remodeling will be 780. Alessandro Elementary School will serve 700 in grades K-6. Edison High School is projected for 1,400 pupils, grades 10-12. Raphael Weill Elementary School is planned for 950 enrollment, K-6. (LD)",

Architects, administrators, teachers, school committeemen, and consultants all participated in designing both a new physical plan and a compatible curriculum. This was accomplished without a communications gap among the participants by the employment of a physical model of a proposed school plan. By observing the physical model with movable elements and simulation techniques, planners were able to comprehend more quickly and relate the number of variables present in curriculum change, new course structure, or  the design of the building to house instructional programs. The educational specifications for the Chelmsford Park High School are included as are recommendations for simulation as an instructional tool.

Older school buildings which may no longer provide a safe or adequate environment for education have become a matter of increasing concern to legislators and responsible citizens. Assembly Bill 450 which was passed in 1967 intends that all structurally deficient pre-1933 school buildings will have been repaired or replaced by 1983. Thus the crisis is one which is taxing the imagination and resources of school officials whose buildings do not comply with the state safety standards. The magnitude of the problem is discussed in terms of dollars and cents. Survey expectations are outlined for those  districts that request a safety survey along with recommendations for modernization. The question of rehabilitation versus replacement is presented along with guidelines in terms of a questionnaire for the determination of educational adequacy. In salvaging old schools facility upgrading, suggestions are made that the primary considerations in addition to earthquake safety should be to provide open, flexible spaces where interiors can be readily modified to accommodate many varied teaching-learning activities.

        "description":"The comparative efficacy of overt and non-overt practice responses in programed instruction was investigated under a variety of practice and test conditions using a paired associate learning task. Proponents of operant learning models have consistently questioned the relative effectiveness of passive viewing in programed instruction. An alternative position maintains that programed learning primarily involves the selection of responses from well established repertoires. Overt practice responses under such conditions are redundant if not disruptive. Differential practice effects were considered in a series of experiments requiring the association of keyboard responses to single letter stimulus displays presented on a viewing console. Overt practice responses were found to have an  essentially neutral effect upon paired associate learning. An interference effect was noted when the temporal interval between successive stimuli was minimal. The extension of unfilled interstimulus and intertrial intervals was found to have a strong positive effect on response acquisition and to warrant further parametric research. Non-overt practice effects were discussed in terms of existent contiguity and hypothesis selection theories none of which adequately accounted for all the findings. (SS)",

        "description":"In 1961 a three year study was inaugurated in Hampshire County, England, to investigate the possible applications of closed-circuit television in secondary schools. The study included investigations of new teaching methods and of the technical, financial, and administrative arrangements prerequisite to the use of television on a large scale. The first phase focused on the use of the equipment in a single classroom which was then linked to a second classroom. The second phase saw the construction of a studio and the linking of the original school with two others by cable. Studio teaching methods, production techniques, program content, and the balance between enrichment and curriculum materials were the foci of this phase. The third phase was concerned with an objective program  assessment, consisting of a series of controlled experiments to ascertain the most effective uses of the television medium. Some of the more important findings indicate that television teaching is equal or superior to conventional instruction; programs must be directed to a limited ability range; students show high interest in locally produced programs; lesson and teaching notes should be issued for each broadcast; and a talk-back system on a limited scale is effective for establishing pupil-teacher communication. The report includes information on facility design and administration, production techniques, and staff use. (MT)",

Educational broadcasting in general has grown slowly since National Educational Television (NET) initiated \"network\" service in 1954, but now other groups are experimenting in telecommunications interconnection and the supplementation of existing ETV service. More than half the states are operating or have plans for ETV network activity with no common purpose except to extend educational and cultural offerings to students and the general public. On a regional level, various organizations are conducting studies in information processing, instructional television, and programed instruction. Television connection between educational institutions can aid the exchange  of courses, faculty talent, and research facilities. A review of inter-institutional television use in Oregon, Texas, and Florida indicates that the distribution of video tape recordings and the use of open and closed-circuit transmission meet with resistance from institutional prestige, faculty pride, and general apathy. Educational systems that desire to introduce inter-institutional communication systems should attempt a clear definition of objectives and commit themselves to appropriate facility and staff development.

Therefore, a study was made of the feasibility of constructing a multi-channel system for the transmission of television and data signals to schools in the area. Field strength measurements were taken of the local educational broadcast signal WXXI-TV to determine extent of coverage. Various problems of terrain and reception were identified, and various approaches to their solution were designed. Factors taken into account were BOCES communication centers, costs and financing, location of the Rochester control center, and FCC regulations. In each of the four systems considered, a microwave system arranged &quot;round-robin&quot; fashion was provided to overcome some of the deficiencies of the&quot;off-air&quot; Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS) repeating technique. The study ended with the conclusion that a few strategically located translators could provide significant improvement in the WXXI-TV coverage not now adequately serviced by CATV systems. It was further concluded that all schools using WXXI-TV be equipped with crystal controlled convertors and distribution systems to provide high quality signals in every classroom. These systems must be designed and installed with future ITFS utilization in mind in order to provide future system compatibility. (MF)",

Classes at the experimental school used TMI-Grolier's &quot;Modern English Series: Spelling&quot; and the Min/Max II teaching machine as their spelling instruction for the year. Classes at one control school studied the word list for the programed course by conventionalmethods. Classes at the other control school followed the traditional, conventional course for the year. A descriptive analysis of the program was made from teacher and student evaluations. An analysis of variance was made for each of two possible variables considered, intelligence scores and  spelling achievement, and for each of the five criteria instruments used in the study. Tests of statistical significance were made for total groups, by grade level, and by ability level to test the gain made by each group. It was concluded that there was no evidence to support one form of instruction over the other, that classes using teaching machines spent too much time with mechanical difficulties, that low ability groups benefited most from programed methods, and that the use of programed materials in textbook rather than teaching machine format should be investigated for elementary school use.

        "description":"A set of criteria for use as guidelines in evaluating educational media programs in institutions of higher education was developed from two primary sources: first, from the literature dealing with educational media programs such as articles, books, and monographs; second, from papers discussing model media programs written by 12 outstanding educational media specialists. The list is comprehensive though not inclusive and is intended to assist in making subjective judgments about specific aspects of an on-going program. The criteria are arranged in groups relating to the major aspects of educational media programs. These aspects include institutional educational media services, the services a program should offer and the goals it should aspire to; educational media  services--curriculum and instruction, the relationship between media personnel, their services, and the regular faculty; the educational media center, the components and sub-components which comprise the effective center; physical facilities for educational media; budget and finance of the program; and educational media staff. A checklist, which accompanies the criteria and is based on them, is designed to aid in the evaluation of a particular program and to develop a profile image of the high and low attainments of a program in order to aid policy and administrative decisions.

        "description":"The COST-ED model (Costs of Schools, Training, and Education) of the instructional process encourages the recognition of management alternatives and potential cost-savings. It is used to calculate the minimum cost of performing specified instructional tasks. COST-ED components are presented as cost modules in a flowchart format for manpower, teachers, facilities, attrition, and student opportunity. Computer-assisted instruction (CAI) is an educational medium which can be described within the context of the COST-ED model. CAI equipment cost factors are defined on the basis of functions performed: instructional process control, curriculum availability, or student-system communication. Radical economic differences between CAI and classroom instruction explain the&quot;all-or-nothing-effect&quot;: CAI can be economically justified only if it becomes the dominant mode of instruction in a given instructional environment. Until CAI costs decline, applications will be confined to the military, welfare, and industrial sectors of the nation. The expansion of CAI into public education depends on methods of submitting, soliciting, and evaluating CAI projects and on public policy measures in behalf of the educational technology industry.

To date, the most ambitious project has been to develop some of the vast material on human behavior in the national television and radio archives into teaching and research materials for the social sciences. Specifically, a program was initiated to make use of footage from the television show, &quot;Candid Camera.&quot; With the co-operation and financial assistance of Allen Funt, a pilot project utilizing five years of film was undertaken. Graduate teaching fellows and undergraduates wrote descriptions of film content and cataloged, when possible, the sequences into a  psychological taxonomy. These sequences were then used to develop two to four minute single concept films illustrating already well established psychological concepts. Sequences were also used to develop longer films explaining a theory or concept in psychology. These films bring empirical evidence from a natural setting into the psychology classroom. The pilot project was successful and the entire &quot;Candid Camera&quot; collection is being cataloged. Those interested in the films, which are restricted to educational use, should contact Prof. James Maas, Dept. of Psychology, 326 Morrill Hall, Cornell Univ., Ithaca, N.Y. 14850. (MT)",

An evaluation of the program was carried out by means of a questionnaire administered to 50 teachers and through some informal staff interviews. Twenty-nine teachers returned the questionnaire (58%); and of these teachers, 21 reported viewing one or more programs per month. Those who use the program are largely satisfied with it, though room for improvement is cited in the area of program dynamics. The most common impediments to program use are increasing scheduling difficulties, inadequate viewing facilities, and  inadequate teacher information on the value and use of television teaching.

It was conducted to insure effective utilization in the teaching-learning situation of audiovisual resources provided to these schools through ESEA Title I and Title II monies. The program dealt broadly with the educational values of audiovisual presentations, with their applications to teaching the disadvantaged child, and with the optimal uses of instructional television, overhead projectors, filmstrip projectors, phonographs, and audiotapes and tape recorders. The evaluation aimed to determine whether participant teachers' abilities in using audiovisual resources were improved, and whether the addition of  audiovisual techniques improved pupil involvement and performance. Data gathered in the evaluation indicate that the program was well organized, useful, and fairly successful in achieving its objectives. The success was limited by several factors: the program was conducted too late in the school year for teachers to practice their new skills, and shortages of equipment further decreased opportunities for use. Given the program limitations, participants were better equipped to utilize audiovisual technology in the classroom as a result of the training experience. (MT)",

In the present study using 75 university students, it was possible to correct errors without teaching erroneous material by using materials designed to teach 30 commonly misunderstood concepts in general science by means of computer-assisted instruction (CAI). The five treatment groups differed only with respect to feedback modes which were no feedback; feedback of \"correct\" or \"wrong\"; feedback of the correct response; feedback appropriate to the student's response; and a combination of modes two, three, and four. Items missed were presented repeatedly until a criterion of correct response to each  item had been attained. There are indications that the subjects who received feedback guiding them to the correct response were learning more effectively and performed better than those who were forced to \"discover\" the correct response. Data indicate that for correcting error, providing a student with a statement of which response was correct or why the correct response was correct may be the most valuable. The analysis of variance on posttest scores indicates that a combination of modes is slightly superior to some of the individual feedback modes in affecting immediate retention. (MT)",

Six sections of an introductory sociology course were assigned various experimental conditions involving quizzing and incentives. Examinations were administered at intervals during the course and once after course completion. Incentive conditions included grades, best-grade doubling, honor seminar, excused class attendance, and exempt final examinations. The major methodological problems confronted were variation in instructor behavior, within-group variation of student performance, comparative examinations, ineffective collection of study time data, and the brevity of periods to effectively manipulate experimental conditions. General findings were that two of  four incentive conditions were effective in systematically modifying examination and study time performances, most of the information acquired in the course was lost fifteen weeks after course completion, neither the frequency nor scheduling of quizzes had a systematic effect on academic performance, and only a very low but significant relationship was found between study time and examination performance.

Of the 9 \"positions\" in the scheme's main line of development, the first 3 represent a simple right-wrong structure and their adjustment to diversity, the middle 3 trace the move to a generalized relativistic structure in which students face the issue of identity through personal commitment in a relative world, the last 3 represent stages in the  growth of commitment. Included in the scheme are 3 conditions of delay or alienation expressing defection from the main line. Testing the validity of the scheme, judges rated interviews under 4 conditions. Within strict limits, the findings are valuable because they demonstrate the feasibility of assessing the epistemological and axiological development of late adolescents, and it validates a common theme of commitment in human development.

At Hope College, 54 students enrolled in a social psychology course in Fall 1966 were randomly assigned to groups of 6 after undergoing pre-testing, completing a pre-course questionnaire, and receiving a detailed syllabus, explanation of course requirements and grading procedures and a manual on small group discussion. Groups met once a week and turned in individually completed sheets reporting feelings toward the group and the particular meeting. About 1/3 to 1/2 the meetings were held in an observation room where the  students were observed (from behind 1-way mirrors), tape recorded and videotaped. A voluntary meeting of the entire group took place every 2 weeks. Once a week, the professor was available for free discussion. Students took a final exam on course content and evaluated their own as well as individual group member's progress and contribution. Final grades \"ere determined by exam performance, a paper or project, group member evaluation, and self-evaluation. Results were generally positive. Students and investigator learned much about group dynamics, critical thinking was better and the students' satisfaction with the course was high. Students having low GPAs reported better study than in other similar courses. There were some negative reactions but evidence indicates that small group  interaction combined with established values of traditional teaching techniques produces an educational experience that is total, and not merely academic.

        "description":"A difficult and urgent task facing the university is the formulation of a satisfactory philosophy of public service. Because of the great interdependence between the university and society, it is a notion that cannot be rejected. On the other hand, overcommitment to public service could result in a damaging financial burden, a dwarfing of major institutional pursuits, or a loss of the university's reputation for objectivity. Thus, each institution individually must decide how much and what kinds of public service functions to assume. In establishing limits, the simplest precept for the university to follow is to undertake only those activities that are a direct outgrowth of and will strengthen regular teaching and research programs. Governance should be modernized to include  public service functions. Activities to be considered in deciding policy are (1) establish high standards of racial integration in campus housing (2) provide a refuge and platform for dissenters (3) manage, on an emergency basis, urgent national or local projects for which no auspices can be found regardless of their inherent research or training value (4) provide leadership to coalesce various forces into a joint attack on large-scale social problems. In so doing, the university should guard against actively seeking federal contracts simply for self-aggrandizement, being regarded merely as a pool of talented manpower available on call, or accepting long-term responsibilities for managing projects of little benefit to the university's internal functions. A variety of pressures, including  desire within the academic community, impel the university to expand its public service role. (JS)",

The modern university finds that it will be necessary to involve itself more actively in social participation. This outlook will require curriculum changes, enhancing the otherwise traditional system of higher education with an academic environment more relevant to and cognizant of the significant societal and community problems. This new focus has been catalyzed in part by discontented students who demand an active and meaningful involvement in the world in which they live. Also a growing demand for manpower, particularly in the public or human service sector, is making itself increasingly felt. To help meet this challenge,  the urban college and university should create systems for providing realistic, integrated human service learning and work experiences for their students. A college should educate and prepare students to face the unique problems o\" urban societies; conduct research on these problems; channel services to the community through institutional programs and cooperation with other concerned city agencies; provide the capability for multi-disciplinary attacks on identifying, analyzing and solving the complex physical and social problems of the urban community; and provide the type of liberal education all cities will need to prosper.

A balance must be found among conflicting sets of pressures generated by the pace of change and the growing tendency to regard all events and phenomena as interrelated. These 2 central forces have stimulated other pressures to plan for public services and manpower needs and to devise means to handle increased individual participation in social affairs. The promise and threat within these trends provide the context for evolving dimensions of the urban university. So far, academia's response to urban needs has been meagre: pertinent research is lacking, faculty is  unconcerned, the curriculum is fragmented and unrelated to city problems, adequate adult education is unavailable, and little support is given to experimental programs. To end this neglect, the university must view itself as a social institution whose role has always been that of a manpower development agency. Present organizational structure would have to be modified to coordinate and utilize knowledge generated by different disciplines. Problems will arise in revising the recruiting and reward systems, integrating academic programs and assuming political risks. A new constituency demanding attention and providing an area for cooperative ventures is the residential community surrounding urban universities. Through involvement with the city, the university can help create better urban  citizens and more vital educational institutions. (JS)",

Nine panelists led the discussion on how to meet the need for professional highly skilled administrators. Organized training efforts, which were described, have been weakened to date by the lack of coordination among sponsoring groups, lack of systematic evaluation, and lack of research. Three competencies are required: professional skill, comprehensive understanding, and political insight in the Aristotelian sense. The panel considered basic issues of how to find and train administrators for specific posts and what qualities were most important for  leadership in academic administration. Although administration is a demanding academic specialization, the idea of special training for potential college presidents is not universally accepted or put into practice. The topic debated at greatest length was whether administrators need to have a scholarly background. A national conference to develop a program of joint action on the preparation of administrators was recommended. (JS)",

As a matter of policy, the nation should accept the responsibility of providing all citizens with at least some form of further education that contributes toward freeing the mind. In considering future policies and facilities, the proper question to ask is \"Whom can the society, in conscience and self-interest, exclude?\" Although personal awareness cannot be completely achieved by years of college, it doesn't seem possible to promote self-sustaining progress toward intellectual freedom in less than that. With increased expenditures for higher education, the public will likely insist that subjects in the curriculum be useful. Because general  education aimed at developing conceptual thinking has more lasting utility than training in specific skills which soon become obsolete, the theoretical aspects of all courses should be emphasized. To enhance the curriculum's sensitivity to individual growth, the faculty must be of high quality. Steps should be taken to obtain more teachers who are generalists and who value teaching, and to raise their status both by increasing salaries and defending intellectual values to the outside society. Better preparation for college can be facilitated by effective communication between secondary and college levels and by public understanding and support. Opportunities for education should be both flexible and readily accessible. Being nonselective, these 2-year colleges will be public, but various  financing measures for students are still needed.

Although they were not major literary works, several novels revealingly depicted discords within the academic community. Some of the books on Negro education seem to be of such significance that they will affect the future course of events: International education received more than usual attention from authors. Canada emerges as the most important producer of works on  higher education with topics ranging from the undergraduate curriculum to governance and graduate productivity. A total of 124 books are reviewed in varying detail. (JS)",

(1) It provided equality of opportunity unparalleled in the nation's history. (2) Veterans demonstrated that far more of American youth could benefit from education than had previously done so. (3) Veterans helped to alter the balance between public and private enrollments. (4) Popular attention, unprecedented enrollments and the obvious success of the Bill forced a re-examination of the objectives, facilities and methods of the higher education system. (5) The married student became an accepted part of  academic life. (6) Increased federal aid was made possible, especially for construction, scholarships and 2 more G.I. Bills. Neither the sponsor of the Bill nor the popular media anticipated its significance. The number of G.I.s who attended college under the Bill far exceeded expectations and some educators feared the influx would lower educational standards. This proved to be another of many erroneous assumptions. The G.I. Bill was underestimated in its broadest conception and in its operational detail. (JS)",

A verbal concept-learning task suitable for college students was devised which permitted the externalizing and quantifying of behavior at 6 points in the learning process. A pilot study evaluated the effects of 4 experimental conditions on learning. One of the conditions, described as \"postulates removed, no feedback\" was employed in the factor-analytic study. The learning task and 16 nonarbitrarily selected ability tests purporting to measure reasoning, memory, and verbal factors were administered to 102 college women. Two major conclusions were (1) that the psychological constructs underlying the learning task are an ability to make  multiple discriminations and an ability to respond to stimulus items as representatives of a class rather than as individual entities and (2) that the pattern of loadings on each task factor is evidence of an occurrence of learning. The type of learning is specific to the learning task and the abilities isolated by it. (Author)",

And because faculty members, who control most academic policies and procedures, have remained strangely silent about such matters, it was decided to investigate, in a more detailed and systematic fashion than had been done previously, their attitudes toward student participation in determining cogent campus policies. At the same time, an effort was made to obtain data that might indirectly reflect the conventionality of faculty thinking about approaches to teaching and learning. A randomly selected sample of 200 faculty members was interviewed at 4 colleges and 2 universities. \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Don't know\" answers to questions regarding specific areas of  student participation (e.g., curriculum planning) could be qualified. There was general agreement that students should participate extensively in matters of student discipline, but not in the affairs of a legal governing board. They should be encouraged to complete evaluative types of questionnaires on teachers, but the results should be seen only by the teacher concerned. In other areas, a \"Yes\" vote meant only that student ideas should be heard, but the means for obtaining their views is left unclear. This study has been highly limited in its sampling of institutions, and more land-grant colleges and universities should be sampled via mailed questionnaires. (JS)",

Three major areas were investigated: lower division college preparation as recorded in university transcripts; high school preparation as recorded in high school transcripts; and American College Test (ACT) results. These data were collected from the records of students who graduated or were academically suspended during 1965 and 1966. Frequency distributions, statistical tests of difference, and correlation analysis tests were processed on the computer for 783 samples. Significantly different variables which showed a high correlation with university grade  point average (GPA), lower division core GPA, and grades in specific lower division core courses were considered for selection as admission requirements to the College of Business. A review was made of the relevant literature on academic success factors in general and on success factors in the College of Business. Admission practices of other colleges of business in major universities in the West were reviewed. Findings were divided into the following sections: academic status; transfer status, major department and sex; and relationship of variables. Within each section, the subfactors of lower division preparation, high school preparation, and ACT scores were examined and conclusions were drawn concerning their respective importance as predictors of success. Based on the findings  recommendations concerning admission requirements were made and suggestions put forth for further research in the field. (JS)",

For more than 10 years, curricula have been carefully designed with future professions in mind, and courses in the natural resources, such as wildlife and park management, recreation planning, and others, are now included in the curricula of all colleges of agriculture. Flexibility in program planning has resulted partly from an increasing percentage of job-oriented students who want to specialize in particular disciplines. Education for international agriculture has expanded to include  study and experience in foreign universities. Statewide instruction accommodates students who cannot major in their chosen field at particular colleges. A major obstacle to broader use of computers for instructional purposes is the lack of familiarity with and understanding of them; one solution would be the retraining of faculty. Interstate college agreements would permit the sharing of expensive facilities and faculty if higher enrollments in specialized courses justified consideration of such arrangements. (WM)",

Enrollments have increased, new emphasis is placed on reorientation of curricula, teaching practices, specialization, and admission requirements. The university's size, function and relation to its environment has been considerably transformed; however, to meet modern societal needs, it must also alter the traditional management of its affairs. Obstacles to this change include the lack of communication between professors of different disciplines, the power of departments and boards in decision making, presidents who lack administrative abilities, the struggle to remain autonomous, and the inability to deal  with student needs. The authority to decide on this change rests only with the president, yet the character of his position almost precludes his taking charge.

The students, mostly freshmen, are predominantly black Washingtonians.

Race has been the greatest problem and moderates have passively allowed black separatists  and their white supporters to dominate the faculty. Three solutions are (1) to remain open and responsive to the city and its racial frustrations (2) to use reason not dogma within the college (3) to learn from the cries for black dignity to give attention to the enormous contributions of black men throughout history. If it can survive the birth pains of divisiveness, FCC should become a major resource center (and catalyst for other universities) for black studies. (JS)",

Their contributions to budgets of public colleges and universities increased between 1954 and 1964, but the percentage of the states' contributions to total budgets decreased from 44% to 38%. Before legislative reapportionment, politicians were largely influenced by rural state agricultural institutions. Today the college-educated legislators representing urban constituencies appreciate the budgetary needs of their alma maters, but they evaluate all government-funded operations, including the colleges and universities, in terms of objectives  and performance. Indeed some of the student complaints against the university are justified and merit legislative consideration. In a survey of 215 colleges and universities (50% were public) on compensatory programs for low income and minority groups, 60% of the responding public institutions had no programs. One midwestern university enrolled only 2% of an over 20% eligible black population. Universities should concentrate on self-evaluation, rational long-range planning, and acceptance of higher education as a comprehensive system. Expanded benefits to society can then be provided through state capital-campus cooperation and profit both. (WM)",

The worst disruptions have occurred at the most liberal institutions where there is a heavy reliance on a mistaken theory of liberalism that does not distinguish between belief and behavior, and thus does not meet violations of due process with appropriate sanctions. Condoning lawless behavior often provokes further lawlessness and is indicative of faculty and administrative cowardice.  Recent incidents at the University of Colorado and Columbia University indicate the extent to which flagrant misconduct is tolerated and the concepts of free speech and academic freedom misconstrued.

Many colleges and universities designed experimental and compensatory programs for Negro students with deficient pre-college backgrounds, but few institutions are fulfilling their social obligations. Colleges should conduct open recruiting among high school students to include other disadvantaged groups such as American Indians, Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and poor whites in rural and mountain areas, particularly in the South. Academic requirements should be adjusted and techniques should be developed for systematic evaluation of compensatory programs, and dull remedial courses  replaced by a new set of stimulating curricular experiences that motivate rather than discourage low-achieving students. The university's obligation extends to the individual student. A broad academic and social counseling and guidance program is necessary, along with provisions for adequate financial aid, for the added burden of loan and job obligations makes scholastic improvement unrealistic. An integrated environment is an important component of equal educational opportunity and minimizes the extent to which disadvantaged students are made to feel rejected or on display. (WM)",

Many of these programs, however, are token efforts, e.g., 100 high risk students in a student body of 20,000. Although the most common characteristic of high risk students is a lack of funds, their economic deficiency should not be equated with lower academic proficiency. Directors of some significant programs report that the academic mortality rate for disadvantaged students has been no higher than that of regular students. Some major features of these programs are financial aid, special housing, special  courses, small group instruction, tutorial assistance, personal counseling, compensatory study in language arts, and an extended time period to obtain a degree. It is difficult, though to determine what specific factors are responsible for success or failure. If high risk programs are to succeed, they must be supported by the students involved and administrators responsible for decisions on money and staff, and faculties must be trained to communicate with disadvantaged students. Integrating the disadvantaged with regular students in class and housing is as educationally important as the curriculum. Apathy within the university must end, to prevent further waste of human resources and social discord. Data are based on replies from 159 major colleges and universities.

Although the US is more troubled, colleges are not necessarily in worse shape than they were 50 years ago when academicians earned a bare living and students were mindlessly rowdy and materialistic. Too, learning in the past was regarded as effeminate and unnecessary and it was not until World War II and after that academic talents were valued and states and local communities competed for funds for new colleges. As higher  education became more popular, the outlook of whole neighborhoods was tipped in its favor, especially regarding education of its sons. The expansion of a flexible system of higher education created pressures and demands in other parts of society and a combination of forces converged to heighten the power of faculty and lesson that of students, administrators, trustees and local communities. Its rising power is now accompanied by a form of student power that is anti-collegiate and in some ways anti-academic, as well as an upsurge in doctrinaire conservatism among students. Uncommitted students can be rallied because of shared concerns over the war and draft.

        "description":"Solutions to the urban crisis, the Vietnam war, and other national problems require, and could be met by, the knowledge and manpower developed in American colleges and universities. But a severe financial crisis increasingly threatens even their normal operations. Enrollments have risen by about 3.5 million since 1930, with a large segment of this growth occurring in the past 10 years. Between 1955 and 1965, student bodies grew by 2.9 million and total expenditures and income increased from $3.4 to over $14.9 billion. Current federal assistance includes student aid, research grants and contracts, and construction funds. Most of this support takes the form of categorical aid, or programs linked to a specific federal agency. Future manpower requirements will help to raise  enrollments to approximately 8 million in 1975. Broad institutional grants could narrow the gap between income and expenditures. More funds for research libraries, computers, international studies, and the arts and humanities are needed as well as new aid programs for areas of public concern such as inner cities, pollution, and improvement of elementary and secondary education. As federal support programs increase, better coordination among them and more communication between their policy makers and educational leaders are necessary. (WM)",

This development has not extended to the field of psychology, in which the university psychological center could effectively serve to collaborate on university-community efforts. Such a center at the City College in New York has been conducting an experimental project in which a unit of 9 white and 9 black policemen, biracially paired, were trained to combine their normal work with the skills of family crisis intervention specialists. They receive regular consultative support from the Center staff. Their work covers a West Harlem area of 85,000 people to whom they are available at the time of a crisis, 24 hours a day.  In 1 year the unit served 665 families, enhancing police-community relations in the area. The Police Department has been provided with a capacity it previously lacked for reducing certain types of crime and injuries to policemen, and the community has benefitted from direct university involvement. The results clearly demonstrate that university psychological services can be successfully provided through existing community agencies, and that the use of these agencies may be more logical and economical than the creation of new ones. The Center is working on a similar project with the Fire Department. (WM)",

This pattern has changed somewhat in the last few decades, when new universities or branches of older ones have appeared in the metropolis. But frequently these institutions are unconcerned with finding ways to contribute toward improving urban life. Their traditional concern, (going back 120 years), has been for rural and agricultural matters. They should now focus more attention on solving challenging urban problems such as pollution, transportation, housing, city planning and health. The task will require adoption of an interdisciplinary approach to the problems, special programs for each area of concern, and adequate, long-term funding from all available sources. A network  of interdisciplinary teams attacking individual problems could lead to significant positive changes in present and future urban life. Further, the merging of separate disciplines would deepen understanding of and encourage involvement in the urban community by those qualified to tackle today's and tomorrow's complex problems.

In studying this group, an attempt was made to predict achievement criteria by evaluating the effectiveness of precollege variables such as educational orientation and experiences, religious background, parents' education, and views on marriage. Other variables considered were academic standing, significant relationships with other students, postgraduate career or study plans, and perception of the university. A comparison of precollege test  scores and high school grades in predicting college GPAs and other educational achievement criteria taken from the \"College Graduate Survey\" revealed that mathematics was the best high school GPA predictor, and that quantitative test predictors had a greater utility than verbal tests. It was also found that high school grades are better predictors of college grades than other achievement criteria used in the Survey. The study concluded that nonverbal reasoning ability was the largest overall contributor to college achievement. (HM)",

The subjects were 1,178 member of the class of 1963 enrolled in 50 colleges and universities. Survey responses to a standard set of 23 scales were obtained at the completion of the sophomore, junior and senior years. The procedures provided means of studying (1) the relationship of perceived college environments to aspirations and values of students entering a major field (2) the degree to which aspirations and values changed concomitantly with changes in perceived values and expectations of teachers and peers (3) the effect of college environment and experiences upon decisions to enter graduate school immediately after graduation. Tests  confirmed the hypotheses that the desire to pursue graduate study was strengthened by the achievement of good rapport with faculty during senior year, by experiencing pressure from peers for advanced study, by talking with faculty, students and parents about graduate study, winning recognition for academic achievements, and participation in research. Most of the results indicate that the examples of teachers and peers persuade many undergraduates that advanced training is an appropriate goal. Alternative methods of controlling errors of measurement in assessing initial status are discussed, and different criteria for assessing impacts of college environment upon student attitudes are evaluated.

The reported return to work of 99% of the women, their satisfaction with their professional, personal and financial status indicate that society also benefits from their investment. For many women, the lack of  guidance, counseling, or cultural expectations delay acquisition of the doctorate; apparently they could complete their studies in less time if more financial aid was available.

As part of a trend toward liberalizing staffing patterns throughout the nation, it is expected to ease the shortage of teachers by relieving them of many routine classroom chores. A second purpose is to provide a career ladder for people from disadvantaged groups. Candidates, recruited through schools, social agencies, and community programs, are chosen less for academic success than for such qualities as sensitivity to children's needs, flexibility, interest in achievement, self-esteem, social adaptability, sense of responsibility and leadership, and acceptance of authority. An in-depth interview, with both oral and written questions, is used to  discover these attributes. Ideally, the aide is placed in the local school system where the teachers participate in the training program, both as planners and as themselves trainees in the use of aides. Pre-service training takes two to eight weeks and includes workshops, laboratories, seminars, and discussion groups. The in-service training takes one year of supervised on-the-job work, along with workshops and seminars. The aide may work not only in the classroom, but also in the library, in counseling, and in similar areas. (HH)",

It was hypothesized that there would be no significant difference in their choice of advisor for the four problems. Eighty-three students in the psychology classes answered questionnaires on which, for the four problems, they made first-to-third choices among eight possible counselors--advisor, chaplain, counselor, commandant, dean, friend, teacher, and other. If the choice were &quot;other,&quot; they were asked to explain their reason. A Chi-square test showed a significant difference in the selections, except in the third choices allowed concerning  future education and vocation. The hypotheses were therefore rejected. The main findings were that the cadets would (1) seek out the teacher to solve a present academic problem, (2) look to the counselor to answer future educational and vocational questions, and (3) discuss personal problems with a friend. Although the counselor's role in vocational and educational matters had long been accepted, the author found it surprising how few cadets would turn to him for personal advice. This suggests that some counselor training be provided for all personnel working with students. (HH)",

He also provided charts as guidelines for several programs. Discussion groups covered (1) problems of having junior colleges and vocational schools in the same area, (2) means of realizing truly comprehensive programs, (3) necessity for better career counseling, (4) use of teaching techniques other than lectures, (5) interinstitution use of faculty, (6) cooperation with industry in student training, (7) examination and grade procedures, (8) multiple-level programs, (9) improved public relations, (10) more scholarship funds, (11) high attrition rates,  (12) special uses of programed learning, (13) faculty standards and recruitment, (14) developing special graduate training for junior college personnel, (15) need for special textbooks for the junior college, (16) faculty travel funds, (17) status of remedial programs, (18) courses for low-ability students, and (19) adequate building programs. All groups were interested in and made suggestions for the proposed junior college center at the University. Many functions were seen for the center, but mainly it must be a service, not a policy-making, organization. Participants also noted the dangers of professional isolation of one group from others at all levels of education. (HH)",

His lack of skill is a cultural problem, not necessarily an intellectual one. Two programs leading to careers in social service, along with their attraction for students and the allocation of resources for their implementation, are discussed here. The first is &quot;civil service,&quot; referring to middle-management positions in state and federal government, filled by competitive examinations. The Junior Federal Assistant program is designed especially to attract 2-year college graduates at GS-4 entry level. The second, &quot;social welfare,&quot; would train the student to the subprofessional level as aide to the professional social welfare worker. Courses proposed as  generally useful to civil and social service include American studies (20th century society, culture, politics, technology, and values), psychology of life adjustment, basic business mathematics and practices, elementary typewriting, civics, public speaking, conservation principles, interviewing techniques, social service theory and field work, and a limited number of electives. The author urges that a program to prepare students for these careers should be adopted as soon as possible. Appended are copies of correspondence with various agencies and officials concerning the feasibility and establishment of these programs. (HH)",

Questionnaires were sent to 375 small colleges, of whom 275 responded (139 public, 48 private, and 86 church-related). Nine criteria were used for admissions selection: (1) high school record, (2) other standard test scores, (3) principal's or counselor's recommendation, (4) rank in class, (5) scholastic aptitude test scores, (6) personal interviews, (7) other recommendations, (8) extra-curricular record, and (9) National Merit Scholarship Qualification Test. The first was used by nearly all of the colleges; the last, by only a few. Of the three kinds of college, generally speaking, the public ones presented the least number of admissions barriers, the private colleges had the  most, and the church related schools were in between. This indicated that the public colleges accepted most applicants (94%, in accordance with the usual open-door policy); the private schools, the fewest (71%); and the church-supported schools, 83%. The students actually enrolling in each case, of course, were fewer than the number accepted for admission.

The awards in each of the 19 semesters covered ranged from four to 14. In 1959, scholarships were $50; in 1965, they were changed to $100 scholarships and $50 book grants. Among the findings: (1) the 153 students with time to complete four terms attempted a mean of 47.7 units and completed 46.5, with GPA of 2.72; (2) aid recipients had a 3.06 GPA; those with book grants made 2.31; (3) 63% attained a GPA of 2.4,  21% were in the 2.0-2.39 range, and 16% fell below 2.0; (4) on entry, 38% chose 2-year majors; the others, a transfer program; (5) some later changed goals; (6) most popular majors were legal secretary for 2-year programs and teacher for 4-year; (7) mean raw SCAT scores were in the 50-53 percentiles, higher than LACC women as a whole. The group's record was high in retention, adherence to original goals, GPA, graduation, and transfer attainment. Only six of the 177 failed to finish first semester; 22 of the rest fell below a 2.0 GPA. Those with a 2-year major were slightly more successful than those in a transfer program.

(4) Is he likely to finish his bachelor's degree? and (5) Why do some of his peers fail to transfer?

(3) Nearly a fourth of the transfers continued with a  philosophy course. (4) At least 92 received their bachelor's degree. (Others were still working toward it or were only then in process of transfer.) (5) The decision of equally capable students not to transfer generally had a sound basis (matrimony, military service, or the like).

        "description":"In July 1967, the California State Board of Education set minimum probation standards for junior colleges, providing that (1) students having less than a 2.0 GPA (with 12 or more units attempted) will be put on academic probation, (2) all such students will receive special counseling, and (3) those failing to maintain a 1.75 GPA for three consecutive terms will be dismissed. Anticipating the effects of these standards on its own system, Shasta College decided to review all its penalty grading and probation practices. The probation statistics of first- and fill-time freshmen for the 1966-67 year and the projected and actual figures for the 1967-68 year were examined. Comparison of the figures showed that a 10% increase in probations could be expected, requiring a corresponding  increase in counseling service. It became apparent that, after due consideration of non-academic influences on the student's possible success, the counselor had three possible recommendations--remedial courses, a limited unit load, or change of major. It was concluded that the counseling could be greatly improved by giving more attention to the initial choice of major, making sure it comes close to the student's apparent ability. It was also felt that an unlimited withdrawal policy would do much to protect the student's GPA, allowing him to drop a specific course at any time during the term without penalty. Instructors agreed with the lenient withdrawal policy, considering it a protection for their own grading standards. (HH)",

First-time transfers to California University (1966-67) and to the state colleges (1967-68) were examined. Tables show various correlations of the data for transfers to the University. It was concluded that GPA's after transfer were a little higher than in the past, no way was known to reduce withdrawals, junior college corrects certain lacks and permits transfer, some majors show higher GPA's than others, college and university GPA's are similar and related,  transfers generally pursue the same or similar major as at college. Teachers of subjects producing consistently lower GPA's could modify their content or teaching technique. As for the transfers to the state colleges, fewer than half would have been admitted from high school, but San Mateo was able to correct their deficiencies. They have about the same GPA at the state and the junior college, motivation was the characteristic most closely related to success, proximity and specialized majors most influence selection of a state college, transfer students are highly mobile, the number of units (excessive or insufficient) should be examined, most transfers take the same or similar majors, performance in several subjects, especially English, should be improved.

This study examines the benefits currently available at 389 colleges and shows their order of frequency and their relation to college age, size, and location. The most frequent benefit is the retirement program. The next most frequent ones are health insurance, travel pay, sick leave, secretarial help, and major medical insurance. Next come faculty parking, social security, leave without pay, life insurance, and leave with pay. Less frequent and only irregularly available are a faculty club, discount purchases through the college, tuition-free enrollment for families, faculty housing, privileges for retired faculty, moving  expenses, personal loans, mortgage loans, and availability of college facilities for private use. Further research is suggested on (1) which benefits faculty members most want, (2) the attraction of non-institutional factors (e.g., climate), and (3) whether these findings apply to administrators as well as to faculty.

Various methods were used to determine his academic and emotional needs. The 78 students were divided into four groups. Four teachers and four tutors (for math, reading, and writing), four counselors, and a speech teacher on one-third time comprised the faculty, who kept detailed daily records. Main findings were: (1) varied teaching techniques (e.g., individual help) must be used, (2) schedules must be flexible, (3) programed material is not practical for unmotivated students, (4) as suitable textbooks are scarce, teachers must develop their own materials, (5) more student data should be on  hand before the program begins, (6) most students changed their self-image from failure to success and acquired a sense of personal worth, (7) mid-term evaluation should be by interview, (8) students had difficulty applying logic and accepting responsibility, (9) they disliked the testing program, and (10) tutors could often reach them best. Recommendations included correction, where possible, of the negative findings above and (1) sharing of ideas on teaching methods by participating schools, (2) faculty travel money for workshops, (3) staff sensitivity training, (4) more staff for reading and writing, (5) full-time staff member for testing and research, (6) more field trips, (7) class limit of 15, (8) continuation of programs like SPEED.

Evaluation included methodology, persistence, academic achievement, redirection, student opinion of faculty and program, innovation, team teaching, questionnaires, and statistical analyses. Among the findings were: (1) as many ECD as liberal arts students planned to transfer, (2) both groups persisted at the same rate, (3) more ECD's than liberal arts completed a year's credits,  (4) the ECD group had lower SCAT scores, but earned more credits in less time than the liberal arts group, (5) after two years, three times as many ECD's graduated, and (6) the differences between groups in redirection, changed attitude, and increased involvement were less clear-cut, but worth noting. Recommendations are: (1) preserve a unified environment, (2) continue team teaching, (3) integrate subject matter, (4) keep to a middle ground between stability and innovation, (5) encourage student persistence and social involvement, (6) keep discussion groups small, (7) emphasize success in a chosen goal rather than redirection, (8) retain enthusiastic faculty, (9) evaluate constantly, and (10) keep the program autonomous.

To reduce wasteful competition, it recommended a change from local to area planning and the organization of a Regional Occupational Center (ROC) System with subsystems in contiguous high school districts. Points to be considered were: (1) each school should continue to offer basic programs in agriculture, homemaking, industrial arts, and business; (2) vocational courses should be given in clusters; (3) for operating ease, the 2-county area should be divided into ROC subsystems, and (4) some courses, because of small enrollment or costly equipment, should be offered only at the junior college, from which ROC could  contract for the training under appropriate arrangements. Special ethnic interests and adult needs must be met throughout the system, as well as the change from a predominantly agricultural to a light industrial employment market. Particulars of employer and student needs have been examined and the data incorporated in the basic organization of the ROC system. To support the various ROC classes, three special committees are needed: (1) to coordinate regional work experience and further the development or addition of certain training slots; (2) to articulate pre-technical and technical programs, and junior college and high school programs, and (3) to study the continuing impact of the Miller Act of 1968.

As for student activism, understanding must work both ways, taking into account non-student activities, the use of county counsel for advice on the legality of district regulations, the influence (liberal or conservative) of the surrounding community, and the very number of issues (single, simultaneous, or successive) that demand action. Hostile groups must be handled on an individual basis; faculty must acknowledge students' legitimate concern for curriculum development, grades, tests,  etc.; alignments and special coalitions of campus segments must be encouraged to solve problems, not create them; and less attention should be given to the deliberately off-beat demonstrator. The dean should be prepared for extremes when allowing outside speakers and should try to involve all groups in continuing discussion directed to the solution of problems that, though created by the community, are expected to be solved by the college.

        "description":"Indices of the impact of public libraries on their municipalities are made by measuring the relationship of registrants against the municipal populations. Three indices based on registrants in households are developed. The methodology is based on \"pairs\" of libraries exhibiting two comparable characteristics--the population served and the per capita expenditure for library services. The hypothesis tested is that there is a correlation between level of impact (effectiveness) measured by the indices and the per capita expenditure for services. A linear correlation method is used for testing. The hypothesis is rejected. However, a significant variable is discerned. Registration is strongly related to the economic profile of municipalities--where a high percentage of households earn  over $7,000 per year, the percentage of registrations is large; where the percentage of incomes over $10,000 per year is higher, the percentage of registrations is higher. The conclusion is drawn that economic position in the community is a stronger factor in registration than the amount spent by the library for services. The \"population served\" concept of the public library standards is questioned. A uniform statistical reporting system for public libraries is recommended. The study was made of small and medium sized public libraries in New Jersey with 1964 data. This document is a Ph.D. thesis submitted to the graduate school of Rutgers University. (Author/CC)",

The problems examined include library collection policies, the impact of computers and other technical innovations on the Library's operations and services, availability of additional resources and possible savings through interlibrary cooperation, and questions of personnel, space, and finance. One major conclusion of the report is that an annex to Widener should be constructed. A second conclusion is that by 1975/76 an additional $2,100,000 per year over the 1964/65 budget will be needed to purchase library materials, as well as an additional $6,800,000 for other library expenditures. Appendix A provides tables and charts describing various aspects of the Harvard  Library's operations by years from 1953/54 with extrapolations to 1975/76. Appendix B gives statements on individual units of the Library. (CC)",

A total of 224 bibliographically verified requests for monographs, 30 vender names and addresses, and 62 campus departments having library fund allocations comprise the three files constituting the main data base for the pilot project. Fixed field formats are used for bibliographic input; the vendor file uses a variable field input. Searching is on both fixed and variable lengths and the initial methods of accessing elements in the files are through table lookup, sequential match, and algorithmic search and  retrieval strategies. The modes of interaction among the computer configuration, the programming system and the user in the project are on-line, real-time, time-sharing, and conversational. Documentation of programs in this report assumes the use of a cathode ray tube terminal as the input/output device; however, these same programs have since been modified for use on the teletypewriter. An area of programming not included is the algorithmic search used for locating the main entry. This report documents work done from May 1967 through January, 1968. (Author/CM)",

It is designed to have sufficient flexibility to serve as the standardized communications format for a wide variety of bibliographic data. The basic format has the following parts: (1) a leader which identifies and describes the record, its length and its effect on the file, (2) a directory which is essentially an index to the location of the variable fields within the record, (3) a  control number which is the unique number assigned to the record, (4) variable fixed fields, which are the fixed fields which would appear in a given type of record, but which vary in number and length among the different types of records, and (5) variable fields which may not be present in all records of a given types. The use of the format is shown in the cataloging of monographs, demonstrating how each of the elements on a catalog card would be transcribed into MARC II format. Also included in this report is &quot;The MARC II Format, Supplement One&quot;, including additional changes designed to make the format more flexible and to simplify the structure. (CM)",

It is concluded that the legal framework exists for Montana to meet all of the state responsibilities for library service but financial support is inadequate for the State Library to fulfill its function. The State Library needs a much larger book collection, additional staff, including specialists and a local library consultant, a building adjacent to the Capitol, and a substantially increased budget. It  is also concluded that the federation system is the most economical means for achieving adequate and equal public library service for the entire state.

Paradoxically, many librarians were formerly teachers or workers in a quasi-intellectual field carrying more pay and prestige. This is possibly because many who are dissatisfied in such fields wish to remain in an academic milieu without its attendant problems. A small literature shows that some teachers leaving the field because of conflict situations have personality traits in common with practicing librarians. This investigation of library students who hope to become academic librarians used the California Psychological Inventory (CPI) and found that they had smaller mean scores than a composite of 14 other occupations on all but the Femininity  Scale. The twenty percent who were dissatisfied with former work scored significantly lower than satisfied students on seven of the scales. Significant correlation was found between those who were satisfied with former work and those with high expectations for library work, and these students scored higher on eleven scales. The students were also found to have a mean Social Maturity score no higher than that of unselected samples, and 26 per cent had CPI profiles that were indicative of personality difficulties.

A statewide network for library service to the blind and visually handicapped is  recommended, consisting of a system of regional centers where major collections of frequently used materials in special media would be maintained for use by local library outlets. In addition, the State Library would handle more of the specialized requests and have overall responsibility for the statewide system.

Conclusions and recommendations were that: (1) the growth of the four counties indicates that a cooperative technical services operation is feasible and will provide better services at substantial unit savings, (2) the center should continue to produce book catalogs using brief bibliographical information, as the four systems now do, although this does not preclude recording fuller bibliographical information in machine-readable form for later use, (3) uniform standards should be adopted for  cataloging, classification, acquisition and processing, and cooperative methods of book selection should be explored, (4) the new processing center should be housed in quarters independent of but centrally located to all four systems, (5) the State Division of Library Extension should give financial assistance to the center for the initial establishment period, to be followed by adoption of a simple, equitable method of allocating support requirements among the member libraries and State, and (6) the libraries should begin at once a detailed implementation study for joint service.

They were chosen because they were significantly language-related or language-mediated. The results of performance on the cognitive functioning tasks showed that (1) the normal children performed consistently better than  the psychotic children, (2) the language facility groups of the psychotic children differentiated their performance on the memory task involving a verbal cue, with the functional group performing best, and (3) certain trends in the data suggest a relationship between language functioning and cognitive performance on the tasks investigated.

        "description":"A. R. Luria, in his conception of the verbal control of behavior, regards four fundamental and distinctive functional attributes of the human speech system as making up a signaling system that humans alone possess: (1) the nominative role of language, (2) the generalizing or semantic role, (3) the communicative role, and (4) the role of regulating, directing, or controlling sequential behavior. Prior to the time a child learns to speak, his signaling system is nonverbal and is generated by the physical attributes of the surrounding environment. Luria contends that as the individual matures, the two signaling systems, verbal and nonverbal, work more closely together. He states that the verbal system, both in its communicative and regulative aspects, makes possible novel and  flexible behavior without the tedious conditioning necessary for animal learning. Luria views speech as being formed through a series of transformations (substages) rather than through quantitative increases in such things as vocabulary and grammatical rules. In order to test Luria's theory, an experiment involving discrimination was administered to 32 children between the ages of 41 and 78 months. The results generally supported the hypotheses. (WD)",

The functional state of the central nervous system can be influenced by physiological factors which cause fluctuating changes in functions important for learning. Once a stimulus becomes a conditioned signal, it acquires strong power in influencing an infant's behavior. More is known about the relative value of different reinforcing unconditioned stimuli than about the relative value of conditioning stimuli. Further research is needed on the development of central mechanisms responsible for the processing of sensory input and for the structuring and integration of information. It is likely that preverbal forms of information interaction and integration will become the  center of increased research attention.

Children's beliefs in internal control were correlated with ratings of the mother's behaviors when she was in interaction with the child (study A, with 41 children and their mothers), interview data from mothers and fathers on the parent-child relationship (study B, with 40 children and their parents), and a questionnaire which assessed parents' positive and negative reactions to their children's achievement behavior. Findings indicated that various aspects of the parent-child relationship are significant antecedents, especially in the  relationship between mother and child. The more protective, nurtural and loving the mother, the greater was her child's belief in internal control. Parental dominance and rejection appear to discourage girls' beliefs in internal control. A trend was also found for mothers' accelerational attempts to relate positively to their sons' (but not their daughters') beliefs in internal control. On the questionnaire measure, paternal praise generally correlated positively with children's beliefs in internal control, and paternal criticism related negatively to such beliefs. (Author/MS)",

They made significantly fewer errors on the Dailey Language Facility Test. School  characteristics and school success were compared with data from another study.

        "description":"This paper supports the hypothesis that picture vocabulary tests should not be used as interchangeable measures of intelligence for complex, lengthy intelligence tests (WISC and Stanford-Binet). In picture vocabulary tests assessing receptive functions (input), the child recognizes a word by pointing to or stating the number standing for an object. In WISC and Stanford-Binet tests assessing expressive functions (output), the child articulates the definition of a word. Subjects were drawn from three groups: (1) 56 retarded children from a psychodiagnostic laboratory; (2) 41 children from a child guidance clinic; and (3) 41 from multiply handicapped children. They were tested to see if differences in vocabulary input and output scores would vary according to physical setting,  diagnosis, intellectual functioning, and educational achievement. The results showed that input-output differences may be predictive of educational achievement in children of borderline mentality but tend to be influenced by diagnosis, cerebral dysfunction or behavioral disturbance in children of average intelligence. Children's intellectual and educational potential is more precisely evaluated by judging both the input and output of a child's vocabulary. Correlations between picture and WISC vocabulary scores do not justify equivalence of measure and functions, especially with deviant groups of children. (DO)",

        "description":"This paper deals with two experiments whose purposes are to investigate the linguistic competence of young children and their receptivity to adult speech. In the free response experiment, imperative sentences were presented to 1 1/2- to 2 1/2-year-olds. The sentences were minimal (a single noun), telegraphic, or full adult sentences. The youngest children were most responsive to minimal or telegraphic form, while the oldest responded to full sentences. The conclusion is that there is a period when language input and output is telegraphic and a slightly later stage when children understand full adult speech as input but when their output is still telegraphic. They tend not to listen to adult speech beginning with unfamiliar words. In the repitition experiment, grammatical and  ungrammatical sentences were presented for immediate repetition to eighteen 3- and 4-year-olds. Responses contained errors in relation to the complexity of sentence structure and less accurate identification of ungrammatical sentences. The child corrects ungrammatical sentences in ratio to his familiarity with the structure. When he cannot identify a structure, he tends to give a simpler structure rather than a confused version of the difficult one. It is suggested as a result of the two experiments that children listen selectively to adult speech and that repetition is useful in investigating language competence. (DO)",

First a control group of institutionally-reared infants aged 1 to 6 months was observed to determine average age of visually directed reaching, visual exploration, visual accommodation, and the blink response. Then the environment for three experimental groups was modified in three ways. The first group was handled for an extra period of time, the second group was given an enriched visual surround in addition to being placed on their backs and handled for extra time, and the third group had pacifiers mounted on their cribs in addition to receiving the same attention as the second group. The results showed that the rate of development of visual attentiveness,  hand regard, and visually directed reaching was affected by the environmental modifications practiced on the second and third groups. Research on plasticity in other areas of sensorimotor development should be carried out. Enrichment programs and education are a continuous process and should be treated as such. Furthermore, inductive theorizing should be used in the study of child behavior. (JS)",

Teachers in 50 randomly selected day care centers in Los Angeles were observed for four 20-minute periods daily for 10 days. The results indicated the following points: Teachers vary individually in the use of encouragement and restriction, and program formats reflect (through teaching styles) the theories that the adult either is a model for socialization or enforces society's rules. Predictors of program differences are structural characteristics (such as activity, type of settings, number of adults, and age of children) which dictate the amount of teaching involvement and staff attitudes which reflect  the amount of their training. Most child-centered staff members were well trained, although some well trained directors were adult-centered. The size and spacial layout of the center regulate teacher performance. Day care was most effective where warm, child-centered teachers provided many stimulating activities, where the staff was flexible, and where children's needs were met. Studies of broad environment factors and of staff decision policies are needed. Data are tabulated and a bibliography is appended. (JS)",

A program is being conducted to learn to what degree the introduction of systematic programing, while motivation techniques are retained, can reorient essentially noncognitive learning styles and sets in young children. Sequential and organized presentation of stimuli, emotionally supportive teaching attitudes, and flexible teaching styles are important if disadvantaged children are to progress in their cognitive development. Accomplishment of the basic forms of learning tasks requires children to master three processes: (1) discrimination-identification, (2) matching-constructing, and (3) sorting-grouping activities. Small  groups (four to eight children) are taught by two types of teaching techniques: play-game activities and atmosphere or a problem-solving situation. The child moves from simple to more difficult levels of activity and from concrete to abstract reasoning. (MS)",

The results of smiling and vocalization were parallel: (1) both increased over the first year, (2) girls smiled and vocalized more than boys, (3) realistic facial patterns elicited more smiling and vocalization regardless of age. Fret/cry data were included to determine if stimuli  would elicit consistent fear or unpleasant responses. Results indicate (1) a decrease in fret/cry over age, (2) that boys show more fret/cry than girls, and (3) that stimuli fail to elicit consistent or observable fear responses.

Expectation of reinforcement was tested in experiment 1, using 60 kindergartners. Low SEL children rapidly stopped making observing responses when an expected event did not occur, while high SEL children maintained a significant rate of observing responses. In experiment 2, 32 second graders and 24 fourth graders were tested to investigate left-right directional preference. Fourth graders and high SEL second graders performed with more directional responses than did low SEL second graders. Reward preferences and  reinforcement were investigated in 60 kindergartners in experiment 3. Low SEL children had significantly greater preference for consistency than high SEL children. Experiment 5 tested 60 first graders and indicated that the chaotic reinforcement variable alone produces deterioration of performance. Comparatively, low SEL children failed to observe environmental stimuli not previously conditioned to learned responses. Further research on behavior strategies is recommended. Present academic curriculum is inappropriate for the facilitation of learning in low SEL children. (DO)",

Effective achievement performance was associated with permissiveness toward controlling child behavior, but it did not rely on either earlier or later independence training. Mothers who favored early training rewarded efforts, despite quality of performance, and the children aspired to the expected role. The child's attitude, predictive of effective achievement, was that his efforts determined the outcome he received. In boys and girls, belief in personal control of  outcome was associated with early independence training attitudes in a permissive mother. Need achievement in boys was associated with early training by a mother concerned with controlling child behavior; and in girls, it was associated with later training. Over 100 children were subjects of a longitudinal analysis, which indicated achievement and mother-and-child correlates were similar to the cross-sectional analysis.

For example, a child engaged in a grouping task may collect together all like objects even if the group contains varying representations of the object, including (1) the object itself, (2) a three-dimensional likeness of the object, (3) a picture of the object, and (4) a word that symbolizes the object. Research indicated that middle class children generally demonstrate much greater representational competence than disadvantaged black children. The acquisition of representational competence is in part obtained from experiences which create temporal, spatial, or psychological distance between self and object. This process is termed &quot;distancing,&quot; and the  hypothesis offered to explain it is called the &quot;distancing hypothesis.&quot; In short, representational competence is the resultant of experiences creating an awareness of the difference between objects and their symbols and an awareness of ideas from actions. Although some authorities have said the crucial period for obtaining these distancing experiences is the first 2 years of life, recent data suggest that the crucial period is between 2 and 4 years of age.

        "description":"The purpose of this paper was to determine the effect of the school's structure upon three aspects of the student's political socialization: community, regime, and authorities. Age level divisions foster a sense of community in and out of school, and pupil-teacher authority relationships establish attitudes toward authorities and norms of behavior expected in a system (regime). Social-psychological consequences are inferred from these structural attributes. From age cohorts, children establish a relationship among their equals and a society of peers which permit empathy. Through the pupil-teacher relationship, children expect nonfamily authority figures to behave universalistically and benevolently. The structure also promotes the child to develop a sense of personal efficacy.  The implications for the modern political system are as follows: (1) A sense o f community and ability to empathize with peers are essential. (2) The ability to act in terms of relevant categories and universalism are central to norms in a regime which stresses equality before the law and the rule of the majority. (3) Attitudes toward authorities are important in maintaining stability. (4) Personal efficacy of citizens is basic to a popularly controlled system. Research is conclusive in demonstrating that elementary school age children are not apolitical. (JS)",

The reason for these group meetings, called the participant small group method, was to attempt to reduce the conflict between the home environment and school environment of disadvantaged children. This reduction in conflict was to be accomplished by improving the emotional relations of the family and the cognitive-intellectual functioning of the family. In general, all of the mothers seemed quite concerned about their competency as mothers; but because of the  small extent of the program's impact, it seems unlikely that it was very effective in modifying the mothers' behavior.

        "description":"Twenty infants, 12 weeks of age, were subjects in an experiment to test the effects of maternal behavior on their perceptual-cognitive development. Each mother and child were observed in a controlled naturalistic setting, every 10 seconds their various behaviors were recorded, and then the mother was interviewed. During an experimental session the infant was placed in a reclining seat with a matrix panel on which stimuli were presented 18 inches in front of him. The mother sat to the rear and side of the infant. Response decrement was positively correlated with the amount of touching, looking, holding, and smiling the mother exhibited and negatively correlated with the amount of time the mother was reading. Higher frequencies of maternal response were associated with greater  response decrement. Data consistently indicate there is positive correlation between maternal response to infant behavior and the cognitive development of the infant as measured by response decrement. Helplessness or control is a learned motive and has important consequences for subsequent perceptual-cognitive development. Maternal behavior stimulates within the infant the expectancy that his behavior can affect his environment and motivates him to produce and utilize behaviors and skills not reinforced in his past experience.

Each subject was given all three tasks during two sessions with the experimenter. The higher the correlation between the performances of the students on all three tasks, the greater was the possibility of the existence of a formal operations thinking structure. The results indicated the  presence of a low but consistent and significant correlation between tasks PS and task CO. Task CH did not correlate with either PS or CO. It is possible that the CH task contained properties that made it inappropriate for use with this age level of subject. (WD)",

The environment of the disadvantaged child lacks much of the opportunity and stimulation for intellectual growth present in the middle and upper class environments and generally necessary for academic success in school. Compensatory preschool education for the disadvantaged child has been created to alleviate the gap, at least partially. Project Head Start was the first wide-scale attempt to promote the intellectual growth of the disadvantaged preschooler. Some early evaluations of the Head Start program indicated which aspects of any such program contribute the most to substantial intellectual growth; namely,  (1) a warm, supportive, and stimulating teacher; (2) a task-oriented program approach; (3) an academically oriented program format; and (4) an emphasis on verbal development.
