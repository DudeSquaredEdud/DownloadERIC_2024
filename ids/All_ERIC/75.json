        "title":"Active vs. Passive Programming: A Critique of IEP Objectives for Students with the Most Severe Disabilities.",
        "author":["Downing, June"],
        "description":"This study investigated the quality of programming for students (aged 3-20) with severe multiple disabilities. The study sought to determine whether physical disabilities that prevent voluntary movement are a discriminating factor affecting whether active or passive programming is provided. The Individualized Education Programs of 35 students with severe multiple disabilities were evaluated to determine the number of age-inappropriate and nonfunctional objectives, criterion-referenced objectives, and passive versus active objectives. Students were divided into two groups based on their ability or inability to use at least one hand to manipulate objects. Both groups of students engaged in a considerable number of age-inappropriate and nonfunctional objectives, suggesting that  programming efforts for all students need to be more critically evaluated. The students with physical disabilities that prevented voluntary movement were more often engaged in passive forms of interaction with their physical and social environments than the other student group; their percentage of active objectives and criterion-referenced objectives decreased.

        "description":"This paper describes the development and use of language training procedures, referred to as cues-pause-point procedures, that rely on behavioral principles and simple and natural teaching procedures and that are exhibited in many normal parent-child or teacher-student verbal interactions. The procedures have been effective in teaching severely language deficient and language-disordered individuals with a wide variety of speech problems, including immediate and delayed echolalia, perseverative or tangential speech, nonsensical or unrelated speech, and virtually no speech. The procedures teach individuals to provide functional verbal responses to trained verbal input (i.e., to say \"fine\" when asked how are you); they also provide an interactive communication strategy that  increases the likelihood of appropriate responses to untrained or novel verbalizations. The main goal is to produce the appropriate verbal response quickly so that the major training focus can be on maintaining it through a series of fading steps. A case study is presented of a severely mentally handicapped boy who was trained to respond to five stimulus-response pairs in a particular setting and was able to generalize his skill to other settings and to maintain his new communicative strategy.

        "description":"The U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) undertook a study of Gallaudet University's pre-college national mission activities which focus on (1) research, development and evaluation of teacher guides and other educational materials for hearing-impaired students and (2) dissemination of these products and technical assistance to educators of the deaf. The study found inadequacies in Gallaudet's accounting system that makes it impossible to determine exactly what proportion of the pre-college budget is being spent on national mission activities (as opposed to the expenses of operating the model elementary and secondary schools which are also part of the program), but estimated total national mission expenditures at about $9 million annually. Recordkeeping on individual research  projects was found to be sporadic and projects were not well monitored. Strong customer satisfaction was found among recipients and users of pre-college products and services, although it was determined that Gallaudet's marketing strategy, which relies primarily on the bookstore catalog, has resulted in limited dissemination. The GAO recommended improvements in the accounting system, development of written policies and procedures for approving and monitoring research projects, and re-evaluation of the overall pre-college marketing strategy to increase availability of products and services to the hearing-impaired.

Preschool curriculum materials were adapted for use with the mainstreamed hearing-impaired children and a training program was developed for staff in participating schools and centers. An extensive parent education program for parents of both hearing-impaired and nonhandicapped participants was also provided. In evaluations conducted at the end of the program, the hearing-impaired preschoolers  demonstrated increased ability to function and learn in a group setting and had made gains in social-emotional adjustment, auditory language comprehension, and language development. Project CHIME also implemented a comprehensive screening and monitoring system to ensure early identification of potential hearing problems and provide appropriate referrals. More than 2000 preschool children were screened in a total of 54 participating mainstream preschool and day care sites. Appendices provide descriptive case studies and statistical evaluation data.

Chapter 2, \"Finding Some Help,\" defines psychotherapy and five models of emotional disturbance, describes common disorders exhibited by emotionally disturbed children (behavioral, emotional, developmental, adolescent, and somatization disorders), and describes how to locate an appropriate specialist to provide diagnosis and treatment. This chapter concludes with a description of available services, including home intervention, school-based services, community treatment options,  residential treatment centers, and training schools. The third and final chapter, \"Understanding the Law,\" discusses the meaning of common labels (e.g., autism, behavior disordered, delinquent, mentally ill, socially maladjusted), and proceeds to a discussion of federal statutory and case law. A section on school and treatment problems addresses such issues as suspension, corporal punishment, chemical dependency, and custody. Organizations which serve as sources of information for mental health issues conclude the chapter. Each chapter contains question/answer exercises and a bibliography.

Based on classroom observations leading to a list of 20 behaviors considered important for classroom adjustment and learning success (e.g., sitting still in a group, not disturbing others, and working independently), the program consists of 20 units. Designed to be presented on a weekly basis, each unit focuses on a particular behavior and includes the following components: (1) an introductory story; (2) a one-sentence definition or rule that defines or explains the appropriate behavior; (3) a rationale for working on the identified behavior; (4) worksheet objectives and general classroom objectives; and (5) student worksheets containing examples of students experiencing  situations typical of classrooms in which the appropriate behavior would be expected. Students receive points for participating in the social skills group and for their performance on the worksheet. The program was subsequently field tested in both regular and special education classrooms. Now in its published form, the curriculum consists of 50 worksheets, 11 original stories, a teacher's manual with daily lesson plans, and a pre/posttest and placement inventory. (JW)",

Service was initiated shortly before each baby's discharge from the intensive care unit and continued over 18 months. Parents and a multidisciplinary professional staff worked as partners through developmental assessments and formulation of a plan for meeting each baby's needs. Emphasis was placed on educating parents about motor skills, cognitive processes, language, social development, and differences between pre-term and full-term development, in order to increase their self-confidence and reduce their dependency on  professionals. This report provides a program overview, descriptions of services and participants' characteristics, a case study of one participant, and an evaluation of the effectiveness of the intervention program and its results.

The text is presented as answers to a series of questions, including: (1) when and how should I tell my child about the death?; (2) how do I express my grief to my children?; (3) what can a young child understand about death?; (4) how is my child likely to respond emotionally?; (5) what kind of religious explanations should I offer?; (6) should my child be allowed to see the dead body?; (7) would my child be happier staying with a friend or relative?; (8) what if my  child doesn't want to go to daycare or school?; (9) how can I help my child to say goodbye?; (10) should my child attend the funeral?; (11) how can I help my child deal with his feelings of grief?; and (12) how do I know if I should seek professional help for my child?

Language educators and their business education counterparts can work together to internationalize this portion of the curriculum. Through the course, students can become prepared to solve business problems in ways that consider cultural differences as an important variable, and can learn to prevent or minimize written, oral, and nonverbal communication problems in the workplace. Eastern Michigan University has established  such a course combining traditional business communication with intercultural communication. In it, students must write a marketing report including audience analysis, product analysis, development of a sales plan, and implementation and follow-up using insights gained from the internationalized course content.

It was designed by the international studies program director and a marketing professor, taught by a specialist in Latin American history, and had a large number of guest lecturers from many disciplines and businesses. The seminar had two main components, the first communicating key social and behavioral science content critical to handling international business,  and the second consisting of business topics. Each participant completed an independent research project in his major area of interest, addressing the topic in an international context and with a multidisciplinary approach. The program was well received by faculty, guest speakers, and students.

To do so, teachers must prepare students to understand the markets into which they enter as managers. The objective is not to learn a great deal about one culture or market, or to divide the world into foreign and domestic markets, but to promote a cross-cultural perspective on the global economy by training students to observe cultures and ask the right questions. An international business communication course offered at Eastern Michigan University takes a two-part approach to teaching conflict management and negotiation. In the first part, students are taught the seven factors most likely to  change in a business setting across cultures: language, environment and technology, social organization, contexting, authority conception, nonverbal communication and behavior, and temporal conception. In the second part, students are taught to apply those factors to a five-step model for conflict management. While the approach is designed for business training, the concept underlying it can be applied to many disciplines in which cross-cultural interaction is a factor. (MSE)",

        "description":"The current growth in language study for business-related communication should be viewed as a two-fold opportunity: to extend the ideals of a liberal arts education to a broader base of students and at the same time allowing humanities students to gain skills useful in today's world. Just as the study of humanities can help create a more balanced individual, the addition of business and specialty courses to our literary curriculum can help balance liberal arts education. Teachers of literature and business recognizing the value of both fields can cooperate to create business language courses serving this purpose. Institutions offering business language courses often find that they do not diminish enrollments in literature courses and can even enhance them by drawing non-literary  students to advanced language programs. Condescending attitudes and conflict between the two fields must end in order to meet student needs. The result will be individuals well-adapted to live and work in an international environment, able to engender humanistic values to enrich their own lives and the world as a whole. (MSE)",

The unit creates intense and enthusiastic role-playing, uses special terminology, and addresses key concepts of French business. Students put aspects of commercial into practice, think of business in a more comprehensive sense, and consider several sides of a business operation, including capital investment, commercial strategy, company organization, and management of human resources.

The project was undertaken because of a need for appropriate materials at that level. The use of authoring software permitted development of a variety of activity types, including multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, and read-along exercises. The activities developed were on aspects of the French banking system. The steps taken in planning, creating, and evaluating the materials included definition and sequencing of lesson objectives, determination of appropriate exercise types, creation of a preliminary tape and diskette, pilot testing, lesson revision based on feedback, testing of the revised lesson on the entire class, and evaluation and further  modification of the unit. The exercises were developed with consideration for the texts to be used and the students' anticipated response to the activity type. Pilot testing revealed flaws both inherent in the software design and created by the lesson's design. The significant amount of time and effort invested in creating the materials was rewarded by the students' enthusiastic reception of them. (MSE)",

The University of Wisconsin-Madison has established a foreign business internship program co-sponsored by the language department, business school, and a regional chamber of commerce in France. Its candidates are generally seniors who have spent a semester in France. Students are placed with small-to-medium-sized firms for five weeks, during which they conduct a research project on the host company. The program provides American students with experience in a French country, increased French proficiency, and an understanding of international business practices. It also opens the  door for both awareness and cooperative projects on the part of French firms. Experience with the program to date has shown that the French companies have been extremely cooperative. They have also been unprepared to guide an American student, so a study guide was developed to direct interns' attention to certain aspects of the business. The internships have proven to be very valuable to students, and the research projects play a key role in the program's success. (MSE)",

They are enrolled as guest auditors in regularly-scheduled classes and also have special activities arranged for them.

As a result, healthy summer German enrollments have evolved where there were none previously. The Austrian students are given a list of conversation topics and information about potential American partners before their arrival and have some choice in selecting their partners and topics. Students are reassured that they need not be experts on any subject, and are sworn to use only German during the interviews. The Austrian students evaluate their American partners.

Both German majors and business majors enrolled in business German need to be introduced to the balance sheet and income statement. It is possible to devote one or two class sessions to accounting by limiting content to a minimal but solid understanding of a \"T-account\", a simplified balance sheet and income statement, and how they interact. This involves three tasks: making the teacher comfortable in a foreign discipline, providing a limited selection of the most essential vocabulary, and offering a class drill in the form of a game or simulation. Concepts are more readily accepted when presented in the foreign language. It is important to keep in mind that the audience  is mixed and may not be expert in accounting. Key concepts to introduce include the nature of assets, using assets well, degrees of liquidity, variance in accounting for assets, the structure of the T-account, the concept and organization of the balance sheet, the fundamental equation of double-entry accounting, and the need for the income statement. These elements are illustrated in a simulation of a German retail clothing business. (MSE)",

In addition, the study investigated employment opportunities in the public and private sector for individuals with expertise on Germany, focusing on the adequacy of current resources to meet both present and future demands in those areas. Preliminary findings and conclusions of  the study are presented. Among the findings are these: (1) that while there are many excellent academic and research resources and contacts, serious deficiencies in breadth and depth of knowledge exist in certain disciplines; (2) the scope of expertise is often very narrowly defined, if it is considered relevant at all; and (3) shortages are growing in certain kinds of expertise or skill combinations; for example, there is a shrinking supply of qualified German language teachers on the secondary level.

The study examined several aspects of the technique as a language-teaching tool in this context. First, rules governing verbal, nonverbal, and cognitive behaviors exhibited by students were identified  and the behaviors that combine to make the case discussion a unique speech event were examined. Second, a descriptive model of the communicative competence of successful participants was constructed using various linguistic, sociolinguistic, and extralinguistic variables. Third, the analysis was used to design a curriculum for foreign students. The study used an ethnographic approach. (MSE)",

Increasing  awareness of different communicative strategies used by bilingual non-native speakers of English has serious implications for linguistic theory, understanding of culture-specific communicative competence, and the applicability of pragmatic theories. Both the Gricean-based theories of pragmatic inference and those that are dependent on Western nations of &quot;logical thinking&quot; are limited in that they apply identical approaches to both monolingual and bilingual discourse and may not be descriptively or definitionally adequate.

The discussion: (1) contrasts the conditions in British and American higher education that make the British model inappropriate for the United States; (2) explores how the external examiner model nevertheless has applications that address American needs for assessment; (3) review the considerations of reliability and validity in external examiner use of comprehensive and oral examinations; and (4) gives examples of how American institutions are presently using external examiners to evaluate learning in courses, internships, and senior projects, as well as assessing summative learning in  majors.

        "description":"An explanation of the roots of the current movement to reform undergraduate education is presented. It is suggested that the reform movement is a reaction against the dominance of the research university. Several reports about the state of undergraduate education are cited, including &quot;Involvement in Learning,&quot;&quot;To Reclaim a Legacy,&quot; and &quot;Integrity in the College Curriculum.&quot; Forces set in motion by the academic revolution and mass education are identified that contributed to the erosion in undergraduate education, and especially liberal education. The academic revolution brought about an emphasis on research and graduate education, as well as specialization in a discipline by faculty. Four types of activities that characterized alternatives to the academic revolution in  undergraduate education are considered: making more intellectual demands on students, strengthening general education, specifying outcomes and assessing them, and creating academic community. The reports about undergraduate education served to promote a set of values that stood against the academic revolution, which emphasized the research university and graduate education. 40 references.

Enrollment trends for minorities since World War II are briefly traced, and implications of declining minority participation are noted. Possible responses to declining minority enrollments are recommended: increasing efforts in recruiting, improving retention, providing adequate support services, facilitating employment and graduate and professional study, and fostering wider partnerships with schools. Suggestions for  universities and schools include better teacher training programs in the colleges and schools and better opportunities for teacher recognition, career development, and professional satisfaction in the schools. Targets by which to reduce the high school dropout rate nationwide and programs to achieve it are also proposed, along with establishing a meaningful competency level of literacy for school graduates.

Opinions of borrowers concerning the role of student loans in providing access to and choice among higher education institutions were also considered. The data came from a mail survey of a random sample of 2,000 borrowers who were currently paying off their student loans. A 70% response rate was achieved. All recipients borrowed from the Guaranteed Student Loan Program, and one-third also borrowed from the National Direct Student Loan program. It was found that the number of borrowers owing more than $10,000 and paying $150 a month or more was  rising, but these students were earning more money because of their education. Two-thirds of respondents said the availability of loans was very or extremely important in allowing them to continue their education after high school. About 55% said the loans were crucial in allowing them to enroll in the particular institution they attended. A similar majority of borrowers felt that the availability of loans allowed them to stay in school to complete their degrees. 22 references. (SW)",

The procedure has been used in a 13-week program evaluation course in a master's program in community psychology and industrial/organizational psychology. About 2 months before the course begins, administrative units within the university are invited to submit requests for evaluation assistance. At the first class meeting, a list of potential evaluation projects are distributed to students. In most cases teams of two or three students get their first choice of projects. Before the third class meeting, student teams are to meet with their project sponsors to start negotiating the specifics of their evaluations. By the fifth class meeting, teams submit  written evaluation plans to the course instructor and their project sponsors. Projects share at least four characteristics that have contributed to their success: they are client-driven, small-scale, regulated by strict deadlines, and campus-based. Outcomes for 10 sponsors who worked with student teams over 2 years are briefly discussed. (SW)",

        "description":"A small group of Association of American Universities (AAU) institutions was surveyed by the graduate school at the University of Florida in 1987 as part of a review of its own policies on faculty members pursuing graduate degrees and appointment to the graduate faculty. This was intended to give the graduate council a basis for comparison with other universities. Of the 55 questionnaires mailed to the graduate school deans, 40 were returned (with 20 from state universities and 20 from private universities). The questionnaire asked whether a faculty member holding a tenure-accruing position could pursue a graduate degree in the same institution, and if yes, what restrictions applied. It also asked whether there were university criteria for appointment to the graduate faculty.  Results indicate a great difference between state and private universities on the policy of allowing tenure-accruing faculty to pursue graduate degrees in the institution. Restrictions cited include avoiding all possible conflict of interests; approval by the employment unit chairperson and dean, graduate school dean, and vice president for academic affairs; and having a different degree-seeking department from the employment unit. The state and private institutions also differ greatly in terms of the appointment of graduate faculty, with 60% of the state universities having a graduate faculty appointment system and only 30% of the private institutions having one. Specific responses of each university are summarized. (SM)",

        "description":"In order to understand creative decisionmaking in the rapidly changing global marketplace, business executives must view, interpret, and analyze events with new vision. A framework for understanding old thought patterns is provided along with suggestions on ways in which the humanities and social sciences (and other liberal arts) can help the business executive with creative reframing. More and more difficult decisionmaking in nontraditional arenas is required in the global marketplace, and the background of a liberal arts education can be helpful because it includes a variety of esthetic, historical, and cross-cultural insights. A mind-set found in many business executives includes the following assumptions: a knowable reality that can be understood in terms directly applicable  to product development and positioning (with economics and human needs the two primary aspects); a causal and linear model as a template for action; a predictable future; and the ability to make rational decisions and be judged on the rightness or wrongness of these decisions. There are problems with each of these assumptions because the marketplace is moving inexorably away from a single-focus mind-set. Reframing includes underlying dimensions. For business decision-makers, it suggests that reality is not absolute, that reframing is the way paradigms change, that the ability to reframe can be taught, and that creating alternate futures based on different paradigms is central to long-term planning. Models then become metaphors for one frame, not approximations of a final, knowable  reality. Three corporate case studies (Colgate-Palmolive soap paste in Latin America, the Volva workplace, and Rural/Dutch/Shell economic forecasting) using the alternate mind-set are discussed. The importance of a liberal arts education is stressed. (SM)",

The upper quartile measures are global in nature and emphasize the funding of higher education at the state level. A second kind of indicator, the foundational measures, reflect improvements that cannot be tracked in relationship to national measures and are more directly associated with institutional quality. The  indicators include output measures that reveal the status of student learning and input measures that identify the conditions under which the educational system functions. Process measures identify activities the system provides for students. Finally, opinion indicators identify attitudes about Florida's educational systems.

Attention is directed to official and unofficial functions of the institutional research office, lessons learned in the process, and suggestions for ways to minimize frustration and maximize usefulness. Institutions use strategic planning to set goals describing where the institutions wish to be strategically in relation to the competition and to develop action plans to position themselves there. Other features of strategic planning include: a focus on keeping in step with the changing environment; and consideration of rational and economic analysis, politics, and psychological interplay. Twelve lessons learned by the University of Miami in the  last 4 years include: strategic planning is an art rather than a science; planning must be managed; commitment at the top must come early and continually; the plan is a &quot;snapshot&quot; of the planning process; strategic planners look outward as well as inward; and accountability is part of planning. Strategic planning has had a major impact on institutional research at the university; it has led to more research, which produces better planning. 9 references. (SW)",

Tenure rates at four-year institutions nationwide were between 65% and 70%, while the SUS tenure rate was 74% when only tenured or tenured-earning positions were used as the comparison population. Approximately 43% of newly hired, tenure-earning faculty had been granted tenure by their seventh year of employment. Male faculty had a higher tenure rate than female  faculty: 46% compared to 32%. White faculty members had the highest tenure rate (45%), followed by &quot;other minority&quot; (32%), Black (27%), and Hispanic (25%).

During the summer of 1980, a sample of freshmen completed a questionnaire covering academic and personal background. In April of 1981-1984, a detailed questionnaire covered students' experiences during the year just ending. A total of 206 students participated in each of the 4 years. It was found that students' reports of their personal development in each year was strikingly constant from one year to the next. At the same time, however, some variation was apparent in the influence of any given year on students'  reports of their cumulative growth over the 4-year period. The junior and senior years appeared to have a direct effect on reported cumulative growth, whereas the effects of the freshman and sophomore years were all indirect, each year's influence being mediated through the succeeding years. Academic integration appears to be somewhat more influential than social integration in the lower division years, but social integration would seem to grow in influence in the upper division years. 22 references.

Between 200 and 250 freshman actually participate each year. Various forms of value-added testing, measures of social and academic integration, and alumni outcomes measures are used. The program is unique in that general education requirements have changed during the 7 years of the program, and valuable pre- and post-tests have been conducted. To measure the impact of general education, the American Colleges Testing Program College Outcomes Measures Project instrument is used. The Student Involvement Questionnaire was also used to collect information on academic involvement, social involvement, and students' goals and commitment to the institution. Other  components of the assessment system are: the Student Tracking System, which identifies attrition influences; the Student Treatment Study, which identifies student attitudes concerning the university; and placement and alumni studies, including the Alumni Survey.

Estimates were made of the approximate effects of tuition and fees, visitors' expenditures, and student living expenses. During the 1985-1986 academic year, the 10,091 nonresident students enrolled in West Virginia higher education institutions contributed an estimated $72,182,000 in direct economic benefit through tuition and fees, living expenses, and travel expenses of parents and friends. The $72,182,000 flowing through the state's economy generated $86,618,318 in direct and indirect financial benefit to the state, while the state allocation attributed to the education of these nonresident students was $28,668,537. For each one dollar invested by the state in nonresident  students, the state realized a return of $3.02 over the period of one academic year. The direct economic contribution from nonresident student tuition and fees was calculated by multiplying the annual nonresident graduate and undergraduate tuition and fee charges for 1985-1986 by the full-time equivalent (FTE) student enrollment. For each institution, data are provided on tuition and fees charges, estimated contribution to the economy, and living expenses. Benefit to cost comparisons are also shown for the state. 17 references. (SW)",

The programs are identified and the content of the curriculum is described (e.g., degrees offered, textbooks, course topics). Planning topics received the most emphasis in institutional research courses, while topics related to facilities and research methodology received low emphasis. Most institutional research core courses emphasized theoretical concepts, but the correlation coefficient was significant in only a few  cases. As expected, programs with an area of concentration tended to stress theoretical concepts in their core course, while programs within an institutional research concentration were more practitioner-oriented.

Information was gathered from a literature review and from personal observations. One outcome of introducing computers into an academic or administrative unit is the development of alliances depending on prior experience with computers. Personal involvement with computing can be characterized by feelings of frustration. Personal communication channels can change due to the existence and use of computers, and particularly electronic mail. Increased efficiency resulting from computer usage has been an issue, along with the computing skills needed by secretarial and professional staff. Access to a computer can also reduce the need for typing and secretarial  support by the faculty member. The implementation of computers on campuses has made training and selection of support staff more technical and complex. Evaluation of student learning can also be affected by computing. Managerial concerns include purchasing of hardware and software and maintenance costs. The unit within each campus most affected by recent trends in computing is the central data processing or computing center. Consumer behavior theory provides some additional insights concerning computer usage and its effects. 17 references. (SW)",

The independent consultants' executive summary and final report, comprising the bulk of this document, concludes that: (1) CSU's ratios of administrators to faculty, staff, and students were generally lower than those of selected comparison universities; (2) total non-faculty staffing was comparable; (3) at both CSU and selected comparison institutions, the growth rate of administrative positions has exceeded the growth rates for faculty and staff  positions and student enrollment between 1982 and 1987; and (4) CSU devoted a smaller share of its general fund operating budget to administrative salaries than in comparison institutions. Five appendices include information on the Management Personnel Plan, methodology for selecting comparison schools, comparison schools background information, summary of major accreditations of CSU and comparison campuses, and advisory committee members.

The historical background on the proposal for the center is discussed. The proposal is also reviewed in light of the state's &quot;Guidelines and Procedures for the Review of New Campuses and Off-Campus Centers,&quot; which are appended. Attention is directed to the following concerns: adequacy of enrollment projections; other alternatives; effects on other institutions; meeting community needs; reasonable commuting time; physical, social, and demographic characteristics; and access for the disadvantaged. Recommendations include: (1) the request to establish a permanent off-campus center in Contra Costa County  be approved; (2) the Contra Costa Center be planned for an initial enrollment of 1,069 full-time equivalent students; and (3) until the enrollment at the Hayward campus equals or exceeds its current physical capacity, the Contra Costa Center should not be converted to a four-year campus. Appendices that comprise two-thirds of the report include correspondence and analyses concerning the proposal. (SW)",

Three types of state plans have emerged: prepaid tuition, savings bonds, and savings accounts. Proposed plans of four states are reviewed briefly. Plans from other sources are also briefly considered, including short-term and long-term institutional prepayment plans, privately-operated plans through nonprofit organizations and commercial groups, and federal plans such as education savings accounts with favorable tax treatment. The possible impact on families and beneficiaries who might  participate in plans is considered, along with the effects on postsecondary institutions and state government. Benefits, direct costs, and risks of various state saving incentive and prepaid tuition plans are identified, with attention to the possible impact on families and beneficiaries, postsecondary institutions, and state government.

The first questionnaire was completed by 70 departments (out of 95) to determine information about courses that provide academic credit for public service. The second questionnaire was completed by 19 administrative units (a 68% response) and 34 student organizations (a 15% response). It was found that about three-quarters of UC Davis undergraduates were involved in some type of community service activities.

Recurrent education encompasses lifelong learning. The influences of socioeconomic and technological change on recurrent education and employment are addressed. Two approaches to assess participation in recurrent education are considered: an individual/psychological approach and a statistical approach. A research review of participation in recurrent education covers theories of motivation and analysis of valence and expectancy in terms of adult education. Included is an outline of findings of specific studies concerning adults' motives for participation in education, impediments to  recruitment, and the influence of adults' self-evaluation on participation. A model accounting for participation in adult education is presented. Power within the workplace and the economy and implications for recurrent education are also addressed.

Diagnosis and treatment of the underlying pathology is important to avoid dealing with the symptoms alone. The Presidents' Commission has applied tougher sanctions, and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) has added additional enforcement resources, but they are not long-term solutions. Efforts to keep college sports programs free of scandal are being overpowered by economic and social forces. Problems include an overemphasis on winning, over concern with spectators, a tolerance for academic compromises, and a tendency to link athletic  accomplishments with institutional quality and prestige. The media feeds this sports craze, as do economic realities which often tempt people to cut the rule-book corners. Succeeding on the field and balancing the budget results in serious academic compromises. There is a growing relationship between professional sports and intercollegiate sports. Possible alternatives are doing nothing, making an effort to return to amateur student athletics, or acknowledging professionalism in college athletics. It is important to break the tie between money and winning. Possible solutions include cutting the length of the season, providing institutional subsidy for athletics, eliminating athletic scholarships, and providing long-term coaching contracts. (SM)",

It is noted that the research on instructional-preference models supports the idea that matching instructional methods to students' learning style can lead to improved learning. Additional research needs include: determining more about the  learning styles of minority students; clarifying the effects of teaching methods that are incongruent with a student's style; and identifying the connections and interaction between style, developmental stage, disciplinary perspectives, and epistemology.

Specific responsibilities are indicated under the heading of visions, goals, and action; responsibility for operations; and responsibility for people. The different programs available nationwide are identified and organized into four types of models based on educational mission and goals and length: national institutes and internships; administrative conferences;  conventions; and workshops, meetings, and seminars. Other ways to categorize programs include participant's job level, functional area, and content. Uses, benefits, and problems of professional development programs are also considered.

        "description":"This document analyzes the construction of a mythical representation through television, focusing on the British Broadcasting Company's (BBC) television coverage of the violence which took place at the Heysel Stadium in Brussels prior to the 1985 European Cup Final between Juventus and Liverpool. As background for this analysis, a concept of Liverpool--variously interpreted and produced to explain local political, economic, social, and sporting events--is examined. The study directs special attention to the way in which commentators coped with the violent scenes which occurred before the football (soccer) match began. It was found that: (1) much of the commentary seemed to be an emotional response to the unpleasant events that happened; and (2) the particular discourse that  resulted was characterized by dominant images of Liverpool, working class youth, and leisure in British society, and a particularly strident attitude which facilitated the production of the television report. Analysis of the BBC coverage revealed that, far from being an objective, balanced, and transparent view of events, the spectacle served to function as a basis for a sustained attack upon Liverpool. The paper looks in detail at how this came about, examines the concept of myth as an exploratory vehicle in media studies, and points out some difficulties in its use.

        "description":"The development of the television industry in the United States as it emerged in the 1950s is mirrored by tracing the policies and actions of NBC (the National Broadcasting Company) during this period. As the leading radio network and as a subsidiary of RCA (the Radio Corporation of America), NBC was in a uniquely powerful position to direct the structure of the new television industry, which by the mid-1950s was unlike network radio. In the latter, sponsored programs were produced or licensed to a specific sponsor or its advertising agency and the network brokered the time of its affiliates to the sponsor. In television this sponsor or agency role was taken over by the networks, which licensed programs themselves and relegated the advertiser to shared or participating  sponsorship forms. While changes in institutional structures in commercial broadcasting were sometimes accomplished by battles, the victory of the networks by the mid-1950s largely defined the network relations with sponsors, advertising agencies, program producers, affiliates, and federal regulators which still largely obtain today. The shifting production and licensing roles were embedded in larger controversies over program scheduling, production formats, and dramatic forms in early television, and uncertainty and bitter strife existed within the industry. The rise and fall of television's celebrated &quot;Golden Age,&quot; which was doomed by major changes in programming philosophy and formats in the late 1950s, was also a part of this process of network ascendancy in early television.

The research procedures and the results of three questionnaire-type surveys used with several hundred 10- to 15-year-old Icelanders (grades 4-9) in 1968, 1979, and 1985 are then discussed. This discussion covers the students' responses to questions on what country they would move to if they had to  move away from Iceland; reasons for the student's choice were requested only on the 1985 survey. Also discussed are the cultivating effects of television as determined by a comparison of students' television-viewing habits and their choice of country, as well as how their preferences had changed over time, how they perceived the world around them, and the relationship between their world views and their use of the mass media. Tables summarize major findings from each of the surveys, and it is suggested that there has been an increase in the role of television as an agent of socialization and a corresponding diminution in the role of the school. Eleven tables and 29 references are included. (CGD)",

        "description":"Based on an analysis of programs in a British Broadcasting Company (BBC) series transmitted during the 1984-1985 school year, this discussion of the pedagogy of educational television in Great Britain reviews previous analyses of children's television from both a media studies perspective and from within educational psychology, and proposes an alternative mode of investigation that examines the forms of subject positioning used within the programs. This investigation attempts to make connections between theories of discourse developed within film and literary theory and recent accounts of subjectivity provided by critical works in child psychology. The main part of the paper presents an illustrated typology of modes of subject positioning and a comparative analysis identifying a  shift in pedagogic style that has occurred in the BBC series over the past five years. It concludes with a critique of the progressivist or child-centered emphasis of the more recent material, and of its covert models of social regulation. (57 references) (Author/CGD)",

        "description":"This paper begins by identifying and discussing six attributes or characteristics of television interviews, which include the function of the interview, i.e., information or entertainment; the context within which it is presented in the program; the number of interviews and interviewees; the duration of the interview and the degree of its formality; and the kinds of people that appear in television interviews. Several television program formats common in many countries which involve some form of interviewing are then defined and described: (1) game shows; (2) variety shows; (3) talk shows; (4) feature interviews; (5) documentaries; (6) current affairs; and (7) news. Next, four categories of characteristics that can be systematically used to compare different interviews are  discussed, i.e., identity, verbal, nonverbal, and situational codes. Each of these categories is further broken down to provide added means for analysis and understanding of television interviewing, e.g., demographic characteristics, questioning techniques, special codes, and location of the interview. The viability of the analytic scheme is then demonstrated via its application to programming in the United States, Great Britain, West Germany, and Israel. Substantial differences found in the types of interviews used in the four countries are cited, and it is suggested that these differences may be due to such factors as the pattern of media ownership, political pressures, and national character. Analyses of data on various facets of news interviewing in the four countries are presented in  six tables. (CGD)",

Propositions concerning broadcast television and video as cultural discourses are then presented, and an attempt is made to draw links between the two: (1) television is radically heterogeneous; (2) television manufactures invisibility; (3) television is absent; (4) television is powerless; (5) television has to be produced as an object; (6) with video, television enters  the age of mechanical reproduction; (7) videotapes don't talk back; (8) you cannot watch a video for the first time; and (9) video is out of control. It is concluded that video has become the center for the struggle over power in television, and that the aim of television studies should be to intervene in the production of televisual meaning, institutions, and education in order to produce an open, accessible, and democratic media culture that will service the needs of all the people.

        "description":"This discussion of issues that merit investigation in British primary schools focuses on those issues that concern the links between pedagogic positions, the practices these involve, the media education issues that are thus addressed, the consequences for the activities of the learner, and the critical understandings these practices facilitate. It is noted that these issues are informed by two strands of arguments, i.e., the inadequacies of content-oriented provision of media education and the weaknesses of progressive proposals. Discussions of the issues are organized around three significant foci: (1) the children and their activities and responses in connection with any kind of media education provision; (2) teachers' perspectives on their curriculum arrangements, their  concerns with mass media, and their thinking about children's learning; and (3) the classroom in action, including the practical arrangements, classroom negotiations, critical agenda, and a critique of content-bound provision. The development of a progressive model of primary media education based on a review of recent British proposals and recent American work of similar scope is then described, and a characterization of progressive primary media education based on a comparison of the proposals from both cultures is presented. A critique of the progressive model is then given, and the paper concludes by suggesting ways of enhancing this model. (19 references) (CGD)",

F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, &quot;Tender is the Night,&quot; is offered as an example of the kind of adaptation that is an important element in British television programming, and a brief review of the BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) and the Seventh Network, Australia, production of the novel and its exhibition history is provided as background for the  textual analysis that follows. The ensuing discussion (1) raises some general questions about the differences between verbal and visual sign systems and the nature of the changes generated by the shift from words to images; (2) defines and gives examples of a number of strategies believed to be central to the process of adaptation; and (3) analyzes the complexity of the adaptation process by looking carefully at a short section of the television program. A sequence of the scenes in one of the television episodes and an outline by chapter of the sequences in the novel are appended. (5 footnotes) (Author/CGD)",

Members of a London Panel maintained by the Independent Broadcasting Authority's Research Department for the purpose of routine program appreciation measurement were surveyed through the use of television viewing diaries and questionnaires. A total of 448 usable diaries and questionnaires (47% response rate) were returned. Major findings included: (1) the perceived likelihood of victimization for others and for self, and fear of victimization for self, varied with location, demographic characteristics of respondents, their direct  experience with crime, and confidence in their personal ability to defend themselves in the face of an assault, while television viewing patterns were only weak and inconsistent indicators of judgments about crime; (2) no evidence emerged here that perceived risks for others were more strongly linked to media experiences than were perceived risks for self; (3) in the presence of demographic controls only, soap opera viewing emerged more often than any other program type as linked significantly to judgments about crime; and (4) viewing of particular categories of programs seemed to be less relevant to fear of crime than how much television was consumed overall.

Using a theoretical and critical framework, the paper presents an analysis of three television functions: reshaping the powers and pleasures of identities and differences; reworking the relationship between ideology and affect; and rearticulating the social structure and power of difference within an affective democracy. A number of popular films and television shows are discussed to illustrate these points. Other aspects explored in this paper include: (1) in-differences of context and of form; (2) fragmentation and  interruption of discourses constantly appearing on and disappearing from the television screen; (3) inability of television criticism to confront the problems posed by the determination of television apparatuses; (4) postmodernism and hypermodernism; (5) irony, repetition, and excess and the three forms of in-difference they announce; and (6) in-difference of identity or meaning.

The origins and development of the series are described, as well as its position in a long line of television crime/detective stories and the character portrayals of the two women detectives. Several of the episodes are then reviewed to analyze ways in which Cagney and Lacey negotiate controversies such as ethnic disadvantage, the vulnerability of illegal immigrants, class differences, latchkey children, and various feminist issues, including abortion. It is concluded that the series  must be regarded as progressive in that it succeeds in promoting openness and awareness of socially controversial situations with considerable explicit commitment to its positions, but not as radically feminist or radical in any other way.

        "description":"This study examines one aspect of the television medium--television news and its encoding practices--that was expected to be affected by changes instituted when socialists took office in France in 1981. It is noted that this government's legal reform advocated a more decentralized system of governance and a liberalization of the state monopoly on television broadcasting. A comparison is made of the respective encoding practices of two French television channels, and the issue of trivialization is addressed as a more complex affair than mere packaging and presentation, i.e., one that assists in the passing of a fairly constant institutional message. The research methodology involved recording and analyzing a week of simultaneous materials offered by the two channels on their 8 pm  news programs. The results of the analyses showed that: (1) the dominant ideology is present in and represented by both channels; (2) often identical myths are erected; (3) where initially there appears to be a choice in terms of message, ultimately there is not; and (4) the absence of investigative journalism means inevitably that there is only a series of reflections that are institutionally bound. It is concluded that news information remains, as before 1981, the prerogative of the state, and that there is little reason to expect this sovereignty to be relinquished. (3 end notes) (CGD)",

The study examined how perceptions and responses to television differ across social environments and how children's perceptions of, and reactions to, television may affect aggressive behavior differently in different social and cultural environments of the same society. Subjects--first and third graders from two public schools and two kibbutzes--were interviewed three times at one year intervals, and 158 children of the original sample were interviewed in all three waves. Findings of the study showed that among city children there was a significant positive relationship between television violence viewing and  amount of aggressive behavior, although among kibbutz children there was no detectable relationship between amount of exposure to media violence and aggression. It is suggested that a number of factors associated with growing up in a kibbutz mitigate the effect of television violence viewing on the development of aggressive behavior.

        "author":["Lealand, Geoff"],
        "description":"Focusing on the experience of New Zealand, this paper is a response to a 1978 essay which suggested that a study be done to compare the programming patterns of television in the developed countries of Australia and New Zealand. Significant differences between the two nations are presented, including conspicuous discrepancies in television programming, despite similar shared social and cultural characteristics. A need for cooperative research efforts by Australian and New Zealand media scholars is noted, and some limited New Zealand research is summarized, including content analyses and program ratings. Numerous areas for fruitful research are suggested, many of which center on audience reactions and attitudes about viewing Australian, American, and United Kingdom imports, as well  as on other aspects of television programming and scheduling. The production of television genres other than the more costly, less effective indigenous drama programs is advocated as the best means of inculcating a sense of national identity. The need for research to investigate the influence of &quot;cultural imperialism&quot; on Australian and New Zealand television audiences is stressed. An analysis of the national origins of television programs shown in New Zealand is appended. (40 end notes) (CGD)",

        "author":["Livingstone, Sonia"],
        "description":"Two studies used multidimensional scaling to uncover viewers' spontaneous, largely implicit interpretations of Dallas (American) and Coronation Street (British), two soap operas in a genre of social realism that explicitly aims to parallel or directly contribute to the symbolic world of the viewer. The results bear upon the discipline of social psychology and cultural studies, and reveal the importance of gender, power, and morality in viewers' interpretations of the programs. The findings for the two programs were very different in that femininity was seen to be conventional in Dallas, but matriarchal in Coronation Street, and morality and power were seen to play different roles in the two programs. The study was particularly concerned with three categories of people--academic  psychologists, researchers in cultural studies, and the general public--who watch and variously interpret television programs. The differences between, and problems within, the disciplines of social psychology and cultural studies, insofar as they deal with the mass media, illustrate how television contributes to the social reality of the viewer. Further research is necessary in this area. (3 tables, 7 figures, and 43 references). (CGD)",

A review of the way mainstream research has characterized the viewing behavior of the black audience provides background information for the study. Data for this study were collected by a 1984 telephone survey of 161 adult Afro-Americans living in four census tracts in Washington, D.C. selected on the basis of income level and racial composition. After information had been collected, two sets of regression analyses were done on general television viewing, daily and weekly black character viewing, perceived  reality of black character programs, and experience. Television viewing variables and variables measuring subcultural experience and location in the social structure were also identified. The preliminary findings are summarized in five tables: (1) relations between television viewing variables (Pearson's partial correlations were used to test for this relationship); (2) factor loadings for the perceived reality of black character programs; (3) regression models predicting television viewing; (4) regression models predicting daily and weekly black character program viewing; and (5) regression models predicting perceived reality of black character programs factors. Five figures include a path model for general viewing; a path model for black character viewing; a path model for perceived  reality of black character programs; path models for all black and integrated settings; and path models for macho fantasy and urban realism settings.

        "description":"The challenge to public service forms of broadcasting posed by the adoption of neo-liberal communication policy strategies by a number of western European governments has presented the left with a dilemma. Traditionally these public corporations have been characterized as ideological instruments of class domination. Today, however, sections of the left have rallied around the public service ideal arguing that this is the last bulwark against the cultural barbarism of the marketplace. An examination of the development of public service broadcasting in the Republic of Ireland shows that the political economy of the media requires a more informed analysis of the complex relationships that obtain between the corporate state, capital, and public broadcasting, than is to be found at  present in the critical literature. In Ireland today, the state's direct financial control over Radio Telefis Eireann (RTE) serves as an increasingly important instrument of political regulation of media content, reinforcing the effect of the existing censorship legislation. The current political campaign against this legislation and the struggle of the trade unions to defend jobs and services in the public sector media field must be linked to demands for an end to censorship and for an extension of access to communication resources. Television program output statistics for home produced programs and financial information on RTE are appended. (21 end notes, 15 references) (Author/CGD)",

Data were gathered via a documentary analysis of promotional material and other relevant material pertaining to the networks and information systems; discussions with individuals involved with the school usage of such services, e.g., teachers, principals, librarians, and, where possible, students; and discussions with representatives of service providers. Following an executive summary and  a brief introduction, the report includes: (1) a description of the project methodology; (2) a report of the findings of both phases of the project; (3) a brief discussion of the representativeness of the sample used and comments on specific networks; (4) conclusions reached concerning funding, expense, availability, suitability, representativeness, rationales for and against use of networking and information systems in schools, and teacher training; and (5) recommendations on the role of school libraries, standardization, further research needs, extension of current ASCIS services, bulletin board systems, and commercial sponsorships.

A larger percentage of the fall respondents than the spring respondents (30% vs. 19%) indicated that they were uncertain of their goals and needed assistance in developing an educational plan. For both fall and spring respondents, the top four enrollment goals were \"prepare for a new job,\"\"increase self-confidence,\"\"courses for transfer,\"  and \"meet new people.\" Of the 1,868 continuing students who were surveyed in spring 1986, 54% planned to earn a degree, 55% planned to transfer to a four-year institution after leaving CCP, 22% planned to continue working at their current job after leaving CCP, 42% expected to clarify their goals while at CCP, and 43% knew exactly what to do to achieve their goals. Continuing students were most likely to report having made progress toward achieving goals related to preparation for transfer or employment. (EJV)",

In addition, the WSSD offers such special activities as career tours to three different campus sites, career and self-exploration workshops, and weekly brown bag lunches examining personal/emotional issues. The success of Houston Community College Women's Support Services is attributed to institutional commitment, its excellent full-time staff, and its instructional support. (EJV)",

Part I advocates the development of a clearer and more sophisticated definition of the mission of the community college, proposing \"Building Communities\" as a new rallying theme. Part II underscores the obligation of community colleges to serve a diversity of students and highlights the roles of instructional faculty as mentors and scholars. Part III sets forth four academic goals to be pursued within the community college curriculum, i.e., literacy for all students, a core of common learning, preparation for work, and education for lifelong learning. Part IV  offers recommendations for ensuring quality instruction through active and collaborative learning, rewards for teaching excellence, and a new perspective on evaluation. This section also urges community college educators to accept the challenge of using technology effectively to improve learning, reduce attrition, and encourage innovation. Part V considers noninstructional ways of \"building community\" on-campus through orientation programs; student support services; efforts to break down barriers between students based on age, race, or ethnicity; development of global/international awareness; and service projects in the community. The last two parts explore ways community colleges can strengthen their connections with public schools, senior colleges, and employers, and examine the  leadership requirements of the community college of the future.

The program helps fulfill the mission of the college to provide challenge and stimulation to gifted students. An examination of dual enrollment data from 1970-71 through 1985-86 and the transcripts of 376 fall 1982 dual enrollees who later attended MDCC revealed the following: (1) program participants from Dade County high schools took between five and six credits per year at MDCC; (2) in 1985-86, 78% of the grades made by dual enrollment students at MDCC were at least  satisfactory (C or better); (3) in 1985-86, 167 different courses were taken by dual enrollees, with the heaviest concentration in the fine and applied arts; (4) 66% of the program participants in 1985-86 were White, 20% were Hispanic, and 8% were Black; and (5) as of winter 1986-87, 31% of the fall 1982 dual enrollees had graduated from MDCC, 16% were still attending MDCC, and 53% had left the college.

Study methodology involved reviewing the literature; defining and developing a set of criteria for evaluating community-based  education based on the suggestions and ratings of a national panel of experts representing nine regions of the United States; surveying the presidents of 1,272 community colleges to gather information on exemplary programs; and selecting effective programs and prototype colleges. The four prototypes colleges (i.e., Florida Junior College at Jacksonville, Northeastern Junior College, Colorado, Northern Virginia Community College, and Valencia Community College, Florida) received high ratings with respect to involving community leaders in program planning and development; serving as a catalyst in community development; receiving support, sponsorship and/or funding from business, special interest groups, or community organizations; offering courses on a flexible basis; and providing programs  and activities at off-campus learning centers. The report offers information on effective community-based programs, profiles the prototype colleges and concludes by offering 18 descriptors of the community-based college, a checklist of recommendations for developing and establishing effective community-based education programs, and a set of proposals for implementing the recommendations.

In July 1987, 2,290 recent high school graduates were surveyed by ASAP high school representatives to determine the  graduates' characteristics and educational plans. Responses from 99.3% of those surveyed revealed that 76.1% of the students had definite post-high school plans, 15.5% had partial plans, and 7.1% had no plans. When asked specifically about their educational plans, 70.5% of the graduates indicated that they intended to attend a postsecondary credit institution, 25.9% reported no educational plans, and 3.6% planned to attend a non-credit or proprietary institution.

Specifically, the study sought to determine whether the variables of age, sex, race, marital status, licensed vocational nurse (LVN) status, the awarding of credit for the LVN license, other certificates and academic degrees, students' level in the nursing program, and amount/type of prior work experience affected students' perceptions of the need to reform educational and financial aspects of the health care system and their perceptions of the associate degree. Responses from 1,434 students attending 20 associate degree-granting institutions in southern California revealed that there were two distinct  groups of students, \"professional\" and \"technical,\" with separate views of the nursing profession and the health care system. Minority students and students with prior bedside nursing experience had less reformist attitudes, while students with prior baccalaureate degrees had less bedside experience and more reformist attitudes. Based on study findings and an analysis of the current structure of the nursing profession, it was concluded that the efficiency of short-term training and the quality of professionalism and advanced education could be combined in a more equitable system through an articulated educational sequence based on bedside care.

        "description":"When compared with university freshmen, students beginning their collegiate studies at community colleges are less likely to attain a baccalaureate degree. After equating for differences in students' entering abilities, socioeconomic background, employment status, on-campus residence, and pattern of attendance, however, this discrepancy narrows. Because minority students are over-represented in two-year college enrollments, any differential in progress is magnified for them. Reasons for the difference in baccalaureate attainment are difficult to ascertain because of the paucity of consistent information about student aspirations and progress. While there are no reliable national data sets concerning transfer rates and student outcomes, statewide data show that well-articulated  community college and public university systems lead to significant proportions of university enrollments provided by community college transfers. Though information on college effects on the transfer rate is scanty, studies suggest that the community college environment could be made more conducive to student progress if college policies were modified to encourage students to attend full time, obtain on-campus employment, and become more involved with the college. State policies and interinstitutional agreements regarding curriculum, academic support services, and financial aid also have an impact on transfer rates, and could be modified to benefit all community college matriculants.

Following introductory comments tracing the growth in the county's population from 1930, trends in age distribution are used to project short-term changes, including a decrease in the number of young people of traditional college age, an increase in older adults, and steady decreases in the number of high school graduates until the early 1990s. The next section looks at migration patterns, the resulting shift in the county's racial composition, and the  demographics of largely affluent black residents moving into the county. Next, the characteristics of Prince George's County's black population are contrasted with national norms. The final section discusses the implications for college planning of projected declines in high school students, of anticipated low college-going rates among black students, of a decline in the achievement test scores of high school students, and the increase in county residents over 65 years of age.

The 1988-89 agenda identifies 20 major issues facing the colleges and offers concrete solutions for their resolution during the coming years. The policy statements are presented in five major categories: (1) educational excellence, which includes transfer education, vocational education and retraining, basic skills and English as a Second Language, and academic standards and quality; (2) student access and success, which includes efforts to define and determine the scope of student services, recruit the underrepresented, improve the basic skills of the  underprepared, offer services for single parents, and implement meaningful assessment programs; (3) human resources, which includes faculty replacement, teaching incentives, and staff development; (4) finance, which focuses on adequate, predictable, and effective funding, and on facilities and equipment; and (5) developing the community college system, including recommendations concerning state/local delineation of governance, communications, accountability, and management information. Appendixes include summaries of responses from educators to the agenda; a Delphi project conducted to gather input for the agenda; and the major provisions of agendas adopted from 1984 through 1988.

A study was conducted to assess the reading levels of students and the readability levels of textbooks at five selected junior colleges in Alabama during 1987-88. Thirty textbooks from eight content area courses were selected to represent typical textbook readings for core curricula in business, the humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences. The Fry Readability Formula and Graph were used to determine the difficulty levels of the textbooks. The Nelson-Denny Reading Test was used to determine the reading levels of a sample of 377 students. Study findings  included the following: (1) the average reading level of the students in the sample was 12.12 grade, with the levels ranging from 3.0 to 16.9; (2) 54.6% of the students read below the college level (13.0); (3) the average readability level of the textbooks was 13.93, with levels ranging from 9 to 17; (4) 70% of the textbooks used were at the college level; and (5) 67% of the students in the sample had reading levels below the average readability level of the textbooks.

The staff and licensure committee suggested that a &quot;Super Early Childhood License&quot; be developed to better coordinate the numerous licenses now available and new licenses currently being developed, and made recommendations for class size and pupil/teacher ratios. The cost and school facilities committee found that the financial impact of providing additional programming for 4- and 5-year-olds varies  with each option and that such children require classrooms somewhat different from elementary school classrooms. The committee on coordination with existing resources discussed diversity of needs and services, differences in urban/rural settings, transportation, out-of-school resources, families with special needs, parental choice, fiscal management, and developmentally appropriate programs. The School-Age Child Care Committee recommended the development of legislation to support a variety of resources to meet the need for high quality supervision of children, and suggested other support services for consideration.

The kindergarten classroom, once conceived of as a play- and group adjustment-oriented setting, may now also be a classroom with an &quot;academic&quot; approach, characterized by direct teaching of discrete skills with specific expectations for achievement. This type of rigid curriculum is less responsive than others to wide ranges in age and ability and many schools have resorted to retention and extra-year programs for children. The &quot;academic&quot; approach to kindergarten is in contrast to a &quot;child-centered&quot; approach in which activities are based on the goal of moving each child as far forward in his or her development as possible. In child-centered kindergartens, linguistic  competence is a primary goal and is promoted though appropriate language experiences and through conversations with adults and peers. Activities are child-initiated and children are provided large blocks of time in which to finish projects. Advocates of developmental kindergarten programs should emphasize the effectiveness of an active learning. (PCB)",

Participants were 60 children between 3 and 4 years of age who attended child care centers or kindergartens in Dunedin, New Zealand, and 25 staff members of the programs. Interval-type observations of teachers' and children's interactions and activities were conducted. Findings indicated far more similarities than differences between staff behavior in the two types of programs. While center staff did more caregiving with the child and kindergarten staff did more supervision, both supervision and caregiving could be considered part of the caregiving component. Differences were found between children attending the two different types of programs.  Compared to children in kindergarten, children in full-time and combined child care programs talked more with their teachers and were more likely to be close to a staff member. Since amount of contact between children and staff is a very important predictor of a number of measures of development, it should be a matter of concern that children in state-funded kindergartens experienced less interaction with teachers, than did children in the other programs studied.

All families had an income of less than $5,000 per year. The majority of mothers were black and single parent heads of households, and all mothers had less than a high school education and a history of either semiskilled work or no work. Their mean age was 18 years. The intervention was designed to support parent strategies which enhanced the development of the child long after intervention ceased. Weekly contact with mothers and other family members in the home of each child  was the key intervention component. Home visitors were employed to assist each family with issues of child rearing, family relations, employment, and community functioning. Findings of a longitudinal follow-up survey 10 years after the program indicated that it had clearly had a positive impact on participating children and families, with its strongest effects in the domain of social deviance and functioning in the community.

The report concludes with a discussion of issues surrounding child care in higher education and presents policy guidelines for meeting identified needs. Some of these guidelines include: (1) continuing to provide child care to student families; (2) employing a fee  schedule to recover the cost of providing child care for faculty and staff; (3) linking the provision of child care with educational and student services programs; (4) complementing, rather than competing with, private child-care services; and (5) providing leadership to ensure accessible, quality child-care programs.

The first mode represented the most traditional mode of Head Start programming: a five-day per week, half-day, center-based program in which parent participation was encouraged and where home visits occurred at least three times per year. The second mode incorporated elements of center-based and home-based programming. Children participated in center-based activities two days per week and each family received one home visit each week. The third mode represented a home-based  program where home visitors had responsibility for implementing all Head Start services. A total of 174 parent/child dyads participated in the study. Data were collected in two waves over two years. Four measures of learning opportunities were included, multiple sources of measurement were used to assess child outcomes, and four sources of information concerning the parents and the home were utilized in the study. Results suggest that: (1) it is easier to produce parent and home changes through program intervention than it is to produce child changes that are directly attributable to intervention; (2) child changes associated with program modality are marginal; and (3) parent and home changes that appear to be susceptible to intervention are also the best predictors of child posttest  scores. Data is displayed in 29 tables, and 32 references are included. Appendixes provide the child measures, the parent measures, and a staff questionnaire for internal use. (PCB)",

        "description":"The purpose of this article is to briefly describe schema theory and indicate its relevance to early childhood development, with specific reference to children's acquisition of motor skills. Schema theory proposes an explanation of how individuals learn and perform a seemingly endless variety of movements. According to Schmidt (1975), goal directed movement leads to storage of initial conditions, response specifications, performance feedback, and result. These four sources of information combine to produce a motor schema that enables repetition of a movement or performance of a new variation of it. A major prediction of schema theory is that increasing variability in practice on a given task will result in increased transfer to a novel task of the same movement class. Numerous  studies reporting support for the variability hyothesis have been generated using young children as subjects and gross motor skill as the task. These findings have important practical implications for the structure of practice sessions with children. Schema theory predicts that practicing a variety of movement outcomes within the same general skill class will provide a diverse set of experiences upon which a schema may be enhanced. Generally, schema theory supports the practice during the early years of problem-solving within the same class of movements and rules rather than instruction in specific sport skills. (RH)",

        "description":"This paper addresses the issue of how children should be reared from birth to become members of a faith community. The paper begins by seeking answers in psychological theories and research studies of Piaget, Bandura and Sears, Mahler, and Erikson. It is asserted that interactions with primary caregivers are the essential ingredients by means of which young children construct the meaning of faith. Not just what is taught but also the method of teaching will influence a young child's faith construction. True constancy in caregiving is necessary for faith development. A well-nurtured baby can develop a &quot;mother of oneness&quot; within itself which will ward off loneliness and panic and unrealistic expectations of perfection in human relationships, and will preserve faith. Later  generosity as a participant in a faith community has its roots in the caregiving comforts and adjustments of the first years of life. The paper then goes on to describe for caregivers 24 recommended actions which will help nourish the foundations of faith in the infant and toddler years. Finally, the paper suggests six ways in which caregivers can fulfill civic responsibilities related to creating optimal conditions for childrearing. (RH)",

        "description":"Two studies investigated whether young children acquiring verbs at an exceptional rate can use the syntactic structure of familiar and unfamiliar verbs to make conjectures about some aspect of the meanings of those verbs. The preferential looking paradigm (Golinkoff and Hirsh-Pasek, 1981) was used to set up a naturalistic pairing of scene and sentence for the children. Two different scenes were provided on two video screens. Both scenes involved the same physical action, for example \"squatting.\" In one case, the action was presented in a causative manner; in the other, in a noncausative manner. While the videos were playing, the child heard either a transitive or a one-argument intransitive sentence. It was reasoned that if the transitive frame directed subjects' attention to the  causative action, it could then be concluded that syntax functions to orient children to certain events in the world and not to others. Subjects in study 1 were 32 children between 27 and 30 months of age from English-speaking homes. Results suggested that children under the age of 2.5 years are able to make predictions about meaning with the use of syntactic information when actions are familiar and novel. Study 2, involving 32 children between 22 and 26 months of age, revealed that some children had begun to link some syntactic forms and semantic meanings. Results are discussed. (RH)",

Subsequent discussion focuses on empiricist approaches, including Owen's Infant School and Institute for the Development of Character, Froebel's kindergarten, and the role of American transcendentalism. Empirical models of early education related to the education of handicapped and disadvantaged persons are described; these include the pioneer efforts of Jacob-Rodrigues Pereire, Jean-Marc-Gaspard Itard, Edouard Seguin, and Maria  Montessori. The concluding section indicates how the emergence of the field of child study, progressive education, and theories of development influenced kindergarten programs.

Whereas educational theories are particularistic and maximalist, developmental theories are universalist and minimalist. Developmental theory views change in individuals as being a result of multiple influences, while educational theory looks essentially on the influence of practice on individuals. One type of theory can inform the other, but one cannot be derived from the other. Knowledge of child development can help educators understand what young children are capable of knowing, how children come to know what they know, and how they know that what they know is true. But what young children need to know is  not solely determined by what certain children are capable of knowing; it is also determined by what society thinks it is important for children to know. Goals of early childhood education, which are largely unstated, should be made explicit. Efforts to make these goals explicit will be helped by analysis of early childhood education programs that result from traditions different from the American mainstream. Teachers' theories of appropriate practices influence ways in which curricula are implemented. (RH)",

Findings are summarized in sections on processes and effects. The section on processes discusses the level of project implementation and compares the project classrooms to control classrooms. The section on  effects examines the impact of the project on students and their parents. It is concluded that the Early School Years Project is a comprehensive educational program that addresses language development in the early years, and brings about meaningful involvement of parents in their children's learning. In addition, the program has demonstrated an innovative approach to the involvement of parents in the learning process; a framework that emphasizes the importance of planning in implementation, training, and research design; and the need to build a strong and meaningful partnership with parents.

        "description":"The Secretary of Labor's 1988 Task Force on Child Care offers its general findings in this report. The report states that the Federal government is already addressing the child care issue on a large scale. State and local governments are dynamic in their response to the child care challenge and will probably respond even more aggressively in the future. Employers have a direct interest in addressing their employees' child care problems and many have realized the economic benefits that result from attention to the issue. However, many others remain unaware of the impact of dealing with the child care problems of their employees. Child care requirements of parents and families vary substantially. Therefore, child care policy cannot be addressed in an aggregate fashion. Significant  child care problems have been created by real pressures, but there is not an across-the-board availability crisis of national proportions. Five chapters of this report, on workforce trends, groups needing child care, availability, affordability, and quality, examine the scope and nature of the problems of child care in terms generally used in the public discussion. Four chapters provide data on what is being done and by whom in support of parents' needs for child care, and focus on federal funding, state and local initiatives, employer supported day care, and child care and labor-management relations.

        "description":"The shifting structure of production agriculture in Louisiana, characterized by technological change and economic growth, has created problems for farmers, forcing them either to get large, get out of farming, or get off-farm work to survive. A survey of 142 farmers living in parishes surrounding the Baton Rouge metropolitan area indicates off-farm employment has been a principal source of income for Louisiana farm families. Approximately 68% of total family income received was for off-farm income, of which 42% was earned by farm operators and 26% was earned by spouses. Average off-farm income earned by whites was $15,138 compared to $14,133 earned by blacks. Farm operators earned significantly more per hour than spouses mainly due to a gap in skill level and mobility. Most farm  families were employed in relatively low-skilled and low-paying off-farm jobs commensurate with their skills and experience. With Louisiana now posting the highest unemployment rates in the country, opportunities for future off-farm employment are reduced. There is a need for a rural development program that would integrate both farm and non-farm programs and include a broad range of public service programs, from off-farm job creation and human resource development to welfare, social security, and community development programs.

The survey obtained information about current educational attainment; past agricultural curriculum training; resources used by study participants to find employment; employment benefits received; and labor market participation according to first full-time position, starting salary, and total number of weeks unemployed since college graduation. Analyzed and compared by gender, the survey data clearly indicated that structural conditions allocated different occupations and  employment benefits to comparably trained men and women. Although more than 90% of the study participants graduated with degrees from colleges of agriculture, women experienced more occupational segregation than men. Their first full-time jobs after leaving college were concentrated in traditional female occupations such as sales, clerical, and technical positions. Men more frequently obtained managerial and professional positions. The particular education qualifications of women in the study served primarily to allocate them to white-collar, secondary jobs. Future inquiries should address why women graduates are relegated to secondary jobs and why the positions are accepted. (JHZ)",

        "description":"The findings of a questionnaire survey of 702 North Carolina agricultural producers indicated that communication methods historically used by the North Carolina Agricultural Extension Service for information dissemination are accepted by state farmers and continue to be popular. Information delivery methods most frequently preferred are newsletters, meetings, farm visits (agent to farmer), telephone calls, and on-farm tests and demonstrations. Newer extension information delivery techniques such as teleconferencing, video tapes, audio cassettes, cable television, and home study courses were rated quite low. Results indicated that only slight variation existed among preferences of individual commodity groups (field crops, tobacco, peanuts, hogs, beef cattle, dairy, forestry,  poultry, Christmas trees, ornamental horticulture; and fruit and vegetable horticulture). When respondents were requested to project five years into the future as to their expected preferred methods, traditional methods continued to be most popular. Implications suggest that extension should avoid moving too rapidly into newer, impersonal forms of communications to meet informational needs of its agricultural audiences. However, there was an indicated desire to receive information more directly. Thus the continuing utilization of familiar teaching methods, coupled with the introduction/inclusion of newer direct methods of information delivery, will likely be acceptable to agricultural clientele.

Data were collected in 1986 by phone and mail surveys from 162 displaced and 752 active farmers. The farm characteristics of displaced operators mirrored those of the general farming community. No marked differences were found in the proportion of acres owned, rented, or leased to others between former and current farmers. Moderate sized farms--gross farm incomes between $40,000 and $100,000--were most common and represented the largest category of displaced farmers. Off-farm income was the only structural characteristic analyzed which differed markedly  between former and current farms. Current farmers worked nearly twice as many years off the farm on average compared with former farmers, 8.4 and 4.8 years respectively. Analysis of personal characteristics showed displaced farmers significantly younger, more educated, newer to the county, and with larger families than current operators. Discriminant analysis showed that the personal characteristics of farm operators explained less than 10% of the variance. Findings of the study indicated that insight into farm structure or operator's traits offers little benefit toward understanding displaced farmers. (JHZ)",

Telephone interviews in the spring of 1985 obtained 933 useable questionnaires for a response rate of 77%. The study explored the magnitude of financial strain faced by North Dakota farmers, the relationship between farmers' economic stress and their perceived ability to remain in farming, and farmers' mobility intentions in the context of their financial situation. Mobility was defined to encompass both migration and commuting, and mobility intentions were determined by responses to a question which asked farm operators where they would look for jobs if they were to quit farming. Discriminant analysis  was used to explore how effective various measures of financial strain and characteristics of the farm operators were in distinguishing mobility intentions. No significant relationship was found between financial strain and mobility intentions among farmers. The variables which best distinguished between farmers' mobility intentions were residential size and years of residence in community. Cultural, ethnic, and family background considerations may be key variables to investigate in order to better understand the relationship between financial strain and geographic mobility.

Farmers surveyed  viewed the Extension Service as a valuable source of information. Extension was the most important source of production information for 41% of the farmers.

Although most farmers planned to keep operations at about the same level over the next 2 years, 9% indicated plans to leave farming (the majority planning to retire). A majority of farmers thought friends, neighbors, and human service agencies were providing adequate support. Reported levels of personal stress were higher among farmers who reported 200 or more days of on-farm work compared to those who reported fewer  days. Although over 66% reported at least one potential source of retirement income (usually social security benefits), households most dependent on farm income were less likely to have a potential source. Most farm operators reported keeping financial records, primarily income and cash flow statements and balance sheets. The North Carolina Agricultural Extension Service was the most-mentioned information source for farm record-keeping advice. Respondents indicated a strong demand for financial management programs from the North Carolina Agricultural Extension Service. (NEC)",

Existing data appear to indicate that minority children, particularly Mexican American, continue to be placed in special education out of proportion to their numbers in the general population. Although the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (PL 94-142) requires that each child referred to special education receive a comprehensive assessment using valid tests administered in the child's dominant language, current assessment practices lead to mislabelling and misplacing Mexican American students. Lack of trained personnel makes it impossible to provide appropriate services to bilingual special education children as mandated by PL 94-142. The development of instructional  programs is hampered by lack of knowledge about the learning styles and cognitive development in minority group, bilingual children. Comprehensive, evaluated programs taking these factors into account have not been developed or proven effective for minority group handicapped children. A school district's philosophy of bilingual education and the type of language instruction provided will have a major impact on bilingual special education students. Parental involvement in a child's total educational program has recently become a principle intervention strategy and should be used with minority group parents. (JHZ)",

        "description":"Research conducted by Eastern Stream Child Abuse Prevention and Education (ESCAPE) from 1982-1985 clearly identified migrant children as a population at high risk of being maltreated. It is therefore imperative that migrant teachers understand the dynamics of maltreatment and what they, as individuals, can do to prevent it. Child abuse is frequently the end result of the numerous stresses experienced by migrant families: uncertain employment, geographic and social isolation, poor living conditions, poverty, and frequent moves that prevent families from establishing community ties and support systems. In coping with child abuse the teacher must play the roles of observer, listener, home visitor, reporter, and child advocate. If a child discloses that he or she has been or is  presently being maltreated, the teacher should understand how to cope with the information in a manner that will bring about a significant positive change in the child's life. Guidelines include being calm, finding a private place to talk, believing the child, stressing that it is not the child's fault, respecting the child's privacy, being supportive, being truthful, making a report immediately, and being willing to serve as the child's advocate. A list of eight resources for teachers is included. (JHZ)",

        "description":"Child abuse education in the migrant classroom can accomplish five major goals: (1) provide support to the child who has suffered some form of maltreatment; (2) teach children abuse prevention strategies; (3) teach all children to accept those who have special problems; (4) improve children's self-concepts; and (5) encourage the abused child to confide in an adult regarding the maltreatment. Bibliotherapy is an appropriate technique for bringing child abuse education to the classroom. Bibliotherapy--the process of offering guidance through reading--can be used by teachers who have an interest and concern for children supported by a willingness to become familiar with children's literature. To be successful with the use of bibliotherapy the teacher must identify student needs and  match needs to appropriate reading materials. The teacher must decide how books will be used, what guidance will be given during reading, and what follow-up activities will be used. Child abuse education should also address the problem of low self-esteem, one of the primary characteristics shared by the abusive parent and the abused child. Sixteen references are provided, grouped under the headings of self-concept activities, children's books on child abuse, and finding books for children. (JHZ)",

During its first year, the consortium presented special on-site graduate credit courses addressing problems new teachers encountered, served as group facilitators for the new teachers, designed a mentor handbook and program, and enabled visits to top-rated teachers. Areas emerging as major concerns on which to focus the second year of the program included understanding school policies and procedures, managing time effectively, finding instructional materials and resources, learning about the informal organization of the school, interacting successfully  with parents, motivating students, and teaching a wide range of students. Problems endemic to interorganizational collaboration which limited the scope and quality of the consortium's efforts included initial suspicion of one another, unclear expectations, unequal effort, and the difficulty of making induction a priority. Advice for future activities, obtained from reviewing literature of collaborative efforts, included building credibility through visibility, discussing/resolving differences in goal orientation, modifying goals and activities to meet the needs of all participants, communicating frequently, and developing patience.

        "description":"Based on the belief that students should have a better understanding of technology and science and their interaction with society, the course Science and Technology 11 (ST 11), was proposed in 1984 for students in grade 11 in British Columbia (Canada) who did not elect one of the existing science courses. In September 1986, this new STS course was implemented and taught to approximately 6,700 grade 11 students (about 18% of those at that grade level). A recent survey revealed that science teachers comprised 38% of the approximately 125 ST 11 teachers; Social Studies teachers and shop teachers each comprised 18.6% of the group. The ST 11 classes were reported to be almost evenly divided between a mix of academic-nonacademic students and nonacademic alone. This pilot study examined  a number of questions related to the ST 11 effort. Among them were: Do S/T/S courses actually work? Does the reality match expectations as far as the goals of S/T/S education are concerned? Did the already implemented S/T/S courses have any meaningful impact on students with respect to their views on Science-Technology-Environmental-Society (STES) related issues? One of the specific conclusions reached by the study was that the ST 11 course did have an impact in the &quot;desired&quot; direction on the viewpoints/positions of senior high school students concerning the complex topic &quot;science, technology and society.&quot; In general the findings implied that the attainment of S/T/S goals was feasible through the implementation of S/T/S courses within the science curricula.

These 90 young women participated in a 6-week, 12-lesson project designed to reduce anxiety and improve attitudes toward and achievement in mathematics. The approach to mathematics-anxious girls was: (1) help them know when they are nervous and help them identify precise experiences that make them nervous; (2) give them specific tools to counteract irrational fears; (3) provide them with interesting  experiences in basic mathematical operations; and (4) instill in them an understanding of the wide variety of mental activities encompassed in the word \"mathematics.\" The overall aim was to show these students that mathematics is an integral part of their lives and does not have to be intimidating.

In general, the variables that seemed to contribute to all aspects of project success were those related to interpersonal interaction. The IUCR program was conceived as building on dialogue between university and industry scientists; this study uncovered abundant evidence that this design approach was realized in practice. In  summary, participation in IUCR Projects seemed to have had a significant effect on the individual scientists and their respective organizations. Overall, it appears that the theoretical orientation of the university scientists reacted synergistically with the more practical concerns of industrial scientists and yielded both scholarly outcomes and the perception of commercial success.

Researches polled 2,300 senior research and development officers and 500 university leaders and senior state officials. Approximately 500 replies were received This report summarizes the survey findings and the discussion which occurred at the April 1987 regional meetings based on the survey's preliminary results. Specifically, the study was designed to address such issues as: (1) the importance of research and education to the economic competitiveness of the United States; (2) which of  the following factors were believed to have the greatest impact on U.S. competitiveness--human resources, research and development investments, technology transfer, or federal fiscal, monetary, regulatory and trade policy; (3) what changes need to be made to strengthen and improve the nation's research and education system; and (4) the perceptions of three different communities--the business sector, the academic community, and state governments--with regard to research and education policies and the roles of each of these organizations to meet the competitive challenge of today's economy. Survey data and the discussions which occurred at regional meetings showed that there was a great deal of similarity in the perceptions of the three groups compared. The industry, university, and  government leaders participating in the study agreed that science and engineering research and education have in the past, and will continue in the future, to play a crucial role in determining U.S. competitiveness. With regard to the most important factor affecting the nation's future competitiveness, all three groups viewed education as the key. Furthermore, there was general agreement that the area of education of greatest concern is mathematics and science education at the K-12 level. The survey instrument, a list of regional meeting speakers and panelists, and the National Governors' Association Issues Paper are included in three appendixes. (TW)",

        "description":"A training procedure was developed to improve (or to encourage) the construction of a meaningful problem representation by mentally retarded and learning disabled children. Children are taught to use an external visual representation for arithmetic word problems, in which the meaning of the problem is reflected. The construction of this visual pattern is supported by several tools. The tools enable the child to represent the (known) quantities or to manipulate quantities (or sets) to model the action(s) or relationship(s) described in the problem. For the construction of the visual pattern the child is offered a supply of icons, from which visual building blocks can be moved to a worksheet. Other 'soft-keys' make it possible to indicate the desired placement of sets, to erase  (part of) the visual configuation or to indicate that feedback is requested. The user-interface allows the child to touch only the screen. As such, the present state of the problem solving route of the child at any moment during the training session is known and therefore may be interpreted and evaluated. The computer program is structured to such a degree that the progression through the trial is impossible unless all preceding steps have been completed correctly. (Author/PK)",

A total of 588 questionnaires were returned. Findings indicate that the: (1) amount of time spent on marine education; (2) number of marine topics taught; and (3) proportion of teachers who taught marine topics all decreased as distance from the coast increased. These trends were attributed to the level of accessibility to the ocean environment and to local cultural factors and priorities.

Although significant gender differences were not found for the total scores on the GALT, Ross, and Watson-Glaser, a significant gender difference in favor of the males was found for probabilistic reasoning on the GALT. The five formal reasoning modes on the GALT were predictors  of critical thinking as measured by the Ross and the Watson-Glaser. Also, the formal operational modes on the GALT were significant predictors of academic achievement. The results of this study indicated that a significant percentage of students in grades six through twelve were neither logical nor critical thinkers. (Author/TW)",

Four research questions were investigated: (1) What percentage of seventh through twelfth grade students are formal operational thinkers as measured by the Group Assessment of Logical Thinking (GALT)? (2) Are there significant differences in the level of thinking as measured on the GALT among seventh through twelfth grade students? (3) Are there gender differences in logical lthinking ability of seventh through twelfth grade students as measured by the GALT? and (4) What are the underlying  differences among seventh through twelfth grade students classified as formal, transitional, or concrete operational? The 12-item abbreviated form of GALT was selected to measure the reasoning level of the sample. Eleven percent of the sample measured formal operational on the GALT. Significant results in favor of the tenth grade group were found. Significant values were found in favor of the males on the conservation mode, conservation of volume, and probabilistic reasoning and in favor of the females on combinatorial logic. (CW)",

        "description":"During 1987 the ERIC Clearinghouse for Science, Mathematics, and Environmental Education (ERIC/SMEAC) conducted a survey of the state education agencies, asking respondents to summarize their perceptions as to how schools include environmental topics in their curricula by responding to a questionnaire. Also requested was information concerning extent of inclusion, forms of environmental education commonly employed, and agency policy with respect to inclusion. During October 1987, ERIC/SMEAC personnel organized and presented a symposium, &quot;Environmental Education in School Curricula: (How) Does it Fit?&quot; at the annual conference of the North American Association for Environmental Education (NAEE) in Quebec City. Fourteen invited participants (ten from the United States, three from  Canada, one from Australia) presented position statements during a day-long session. This information bulletin provides summaries of both the survey and the symposium. Both the survey and the symposium offer ample evidence that the posed question of how environmental education &quot;fits&quot; into school curricula is more complex than it might appear; a range of possible positions and mechanisms are possible. The evidence above and elsewhere suggests that infusion is the more popular method. There is greater likelihood of finding space for environmental topics in school curricula if they can be associated with existing curricula, rather than creating new separate courses. Excerpts of both the survey respondents' comments and the 14 symposium papers are included in this document. (TW)",

Of the thousands of marine animals and plants, relatively few constitute a real hazard to the diver. Although some species are dangerous and may, in some instances, inflict serious wounds, with a few exceptions marine animals are not aggressive. Most knowledgeable divers feel that it is through the diver's own carelessness that injury results. It is advisable that they be able to recognize animals that are capable of inflicting damage, know how to avoid injury, and be able to administer proper first aid in event of injury inflicted by marine organisms. This discussion characterizes the major groups of marine animals that are known hazards to divers. No attempt has been made to discuss  individual species in detail. Geographically, the discussion concentrates on the tropical waters of Florida, the Caribbean, and the Bahamas; however, reference has also been made to animals of the western coast of the United States and the South Seas (including Australia's Great Barrier Reef). Also included are discussions of marine and freshwater plants and diving in polluted waters. (CW)",

The purpose of this paper was the development of an instrument to identify teachers' conceptions of teaching science and to review literature concerning this topic. The instrument described was designed to be sensitive to significant distinctions in previously identified dimensions of teaching science. Also described is the framework developed to analyze responses and demonstrate the sensitivity of the task to conceptions obtained from student teachers. The framework for the analyses consists of six categories including: (1) the nature of science; (2) learning; (3) learner characteristics; (4) rationale for instruction; (5) preferred instructional  techniques; and (6) conception of teaching science. Having interviewed four students using the instrument, it was determined that the instrument had met its design criteria. Several issues and suggestions for improvement are discussed. (CW)",

This paper considers cognitive mapping research and describes how world maps reflect world images. Cognitive mapping is defined as a process that allows people to acquire, code, store, recall, and manipulate information about the nature of their spatial environment. A history of world mapping and cognitive processes in mapping is presented, and an analysis of how current mental maps of the world are centered, based on a worldwide sample of student sketch maps, is described. Results indicate that sketch maps were either Eurocentric, Sinocentric, or Americentric, and examples of these maps are used to illustrate  differences in images and the centering of countries. The English colonial mentality and Eurocentric image of the world still remain dominant in many places, and this suggests a lag time between political change and its reflection in world images.

Unless halted, worldwide destruction of tropical rain forests by the year 2000 may be the greatest ecological disaster that will  ever occur; because, while only encompassing seven percent of the earth's land surface, rain forests contain one-half of the world's animal and plant species.

The information age has increased the volume of information and the velocity of its transmission, while linking citizens directly to the site of decisions and facilitating direct citizen participation in political decision-making. Potential negative effects include the fact that the high costs of arranging and supporting teledemocracy systems may be so substantial that those who bear the costs will want to establish the agendas, and studies indicate that technology does not reduce apathy. New technologies have resulted in an over abundance of information, which often leads citizens to make decisions based on image rather than  substance. Implications for social studies education include understanding: (1) information processing techniques; (2) information selectivity; and (3) participation attitudes and skills. Social studies educators should collaborate with software designers to develop system interfaces that enhance user search efficiency and provide education that stresses knowledge, information processing, skills, and first-hand experiences. There must be commitment to the vitality of representative government and the belief that citizens can be informed and participate responsibly. (JHP)",

        "description":"This monograph focuses on the issue of the nature and purpose of the social studies curriculum. In the lead article, George Wood maintains that social studies as taught today is irrelevant and strives to produce citizens who are unquestioning supporters of U.S. political and economic institutions. Dr. Wood attributes this state of affairs to the narrowness of the recent debate on the school's role which seems to focus solely on schools as sites of job training. He recommends that the social studies should become relevant by recentering the democratic mission of public schooling in the United States. Students should acquire a sense of political efficacy and public responsibility. The way to accomplish this is to empower teachers, who must also develop this political empowerment.  Four social studies educators respond to Wood's articles. S. Samuel Shermis offers historical insight to support Wood's thesis. Frank L. Schiraldi contends that teachers have not applied what is known about effective instruction, and this contributes to the irrelevancy of social studies education. C. Frederick Risinger stresses that the social studies curriculum is determined by societal imperatives, and currently, economic competitiveness is a national imperative. A national consensus on the need of educating for public participation will encourage teachers to change methods and curriculum. William Muthig states that social studies educators need to respond to the various reports with their own concerns and reach a workable compromise on the role of social studies in the future.  (SM)",

        "description":"An environmental scanning system is structured to identify and evaluate trends, events, and emerging issues. QUEST represents the quick environmental scanning technique, and an ED QUEST process enables an educational organization to clarify its future and define its options. This paper describes how an educational organization can establish an ongoing environmental scanning program to inform an established ED QUEST team. The system requires that a variety of information sources be regularly scanned, abstracted, and evaluated in order to identify emerging issues, trends, and events. Developmental steps include: (1) devising a program structure and a comprehensive taxonomy; (2) identifying and assigning information sources; and (3) finding and training scanners and abstractors.  Once established, this technique becomes a systematic, intensive, and relatively inexpensive method of focusing on strategic areas for which more detailed planning and analysis might be beneficial.

Arts participation by Whites is greatest for all selected activities, except for Black attendance at jazz music activities. For most activities, absolute differences are relatively small, and net differences between Blacks and Whites are more marked for visually oriented art than for performing arts activities. Hispanics participate at rates similar to those of socioeconomically comparable Whites. Differences associated with race are small compared to those associated with educational attainment, income, occupational prestige, and gender; and socioeconomic  factors are principal participation barriers for Blacks and Hispanics. Intergroup differences are smaller for younger than for older respondents and appear to be the result of an increase in the number of years of schooling of younger Black and Hispanic respondents. Suggestions for further research are offered, and an appendix contains tables of the surveys' statistical data. (JHP)",

Teaching professional counselors about working with multicultural communities and the culture of newly immigrant communities allows them to function more effectively. Everyone has a filter or screen that includes stereotypes and prejudices, through which foreigners are viewed. This leads to negative behavior such as prematurely categorizing clients. This eliminates other possible data and results in failure to give legitimacy to the client. Recognition of the cultural identity of the client is a key factor in giving aid, establishing mutual trust, and allowing a more balanced relationship  between the client and the counselor. Preparing professionals to communicate without filters of their own culture, as well as to decode communication from other cultures, is central to the training of professionals in this field. (NL)",

The discussion is based on a review of literature about the Chinese government and a written survey of student opinions at Northern Jiaotong University (Beijing). The Chinese government officially defines bourgeois liberalization as &quot;negating the socialist system in favour of capitalism.&quot; The Chinese media consistently emphasizes that the modernization of China must be done in accordance with the four cardinal principles of: (1) maintaining the socialist position; (2) upholding the peoples' democratic dictatorship; (3) maintaining the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party; and (4) upholding Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong  thought. A student survey indicated an increased usage of the term bourgeois liberalization. Although 57 percent of the students felt bourgeois liberalization ideals are becoming more common because of increased trade with the United States, only seven percent believed that the best way to eradicate bourgeois liberalization is to cease trade or interaction with the United States. Study of bourgeois liberalization provides an opportunity to better understand how one culture has chosen to deal with such a conflict. (Author/SM)",

        "description":"Relying on the social constructionist approach as advanced by Armand L. Mauss (1975), this paper analyzes the construction of a recent U.S. social problem, drug abuse. It is argued that the objective conditions of drug use alone cannot explain why drugs became an issue immediately prior to the 1986 Congressional elections. Explanations for the rise of drug usage as a social problem are to be found primarily in the political realm. Mauss emphasized the similarity between social problems and social movements and defined the five stages of a social problem. This paper examines the extent to which the recently rediscovered drug abuse problem conforms to Mauss' model. Data are based on National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) surveys and the Monitoring the Future project. Data are  presented that show the absence of a rise in the overall consumption of illicit drugs during recent years. Public opinion surrounding the issue and the construction of a social problem are traced. The history of this social movement/problem deviated from the Mauss model at two points. It is argued that the Mauss model should be revised for social problems in which governmental agencies and officials are claims-makers. (SM)",

The census is taken to provide equal representation for everyone, and results provide figures for appointment and the distribution of federal funds. The enumeration of the population was included in the U.S. Constitution in Article I, Section 2. The constitutional order to apportion representation fairly among the states has been followed since 1790 and is the origin of today's decennial census. Congress delegated the authority to conduct the census to the Department of Commerce and permitted it to further delegate this duty to the Bureau of the Census. The role of the Bureau of the Census is to carry out the census count and to unofficially calculate the apportionment. Once seats are assigned to the states, the  task of drawing new districts is the responsibility of the states. In a series of decisions, beginning in 1967, the U.S. Supreme Court restored the equal population rule, and the relationship between census statistics and representation has strengthened during the last two decades.

The programs for kindergarten through the third grade are: (1) &quot;Learning and Working Now and Long Age&quot;; (2) &quot;A Child's Place in Time and Space&quot;; (3) &quot;People Who Make a Difference&quot;; and (4) &quot;Continuity and Change.&quot; State history is taught in the fourth grade. Fifth graders study U.S. history from the  pre-Columbian period through 1850. The sixth-grade program is developed around the ancient world to A.D. 500. The medieval and early modern world through 1789 are presented in grade 7, setting the context for the study of U.S. history from 1783 to 1914 in grade 8. The modern world from 1789 to the present is studied in grade 10. Eleventh grade provides an in-depth study of the United States from 1900 to the present.

        "description":"This paper focuses on the current trends and issues in social studies education based on the literature that passes through the ERIC Clearinghouse for Social Studies/Social Science Education (Indiana). Four trends pertaining to teaching content in history, geography, civics, and science in society have emerged from a review of the literature. Scholars and professional associations have made strong recommendations for restoring history and geography to a central place in the core curriculum. The new \"History-Social Science Framework for California Public Schools\" states that history and geography are the two great integrative studies of the field. Also, there are calls for the renewal of teaching about the civic values of a constitutional democracy and for the addition of content  about science as a powerful social force. Other issues receiving current attention can be viewed in terms of opposing ideas: (1) universalism vs. particularism; (2) content vs. process; and (3) socialization vs. liberation. Advocates of universalism believe all students should learn the same content while proponents for particularism suggest varing content based on student interests. Some educators are placing too much emphasis on the development of high-order cognitive skills while others emphasize content to the point of ignoring those skills. While responsible citizenship in a constitutional democracy involves critical thinking about public policies and issues, a democracy also requires a citizenry with a knowledge of its cultural heritage. It is recommended that the curriculum be  balanced between the positions of particularism and universalism; content and process; and socialization and liberation. (SM)",

Renewed research on children's history learning ability based on schema theory, new trends in Piaget's developmental theory, the narrative approach, or other paradigms may start to provide the knowledge needed to refine and improve teaching practices. For young elementary students, an important purpose of history education is to make the past  seem real, and study of the past can be used to illuminate the present. Instructional methods include: (1) using literature to enhance history instruction; (2) utilizing the sounds and images of videotapes, films, and filmstrips; and (3) using special experiences such as field trips, simulations, craft and model-building experiences, National History Day projects, and oral history projects.

        "description":"A comparative study of constitutions and governments in world history is a key to deeper understanding of the U.S. Constitution. While many countries have constitutions, the United States is among a minority of nations in today's world that has a constitutional government. Many nations' constitutions truly guarantee few protections of individual rights and liberties. Instruction about the U.S. Constitution should focus on the basic constitutional principals in historical, comparative, and global perspectives. Every critical issue of U.S. constitutional history can be reduced to the question of how to balance power and liberty in government. The paradoxical relationship of majority rule with minority rights is a special instance of how to balance power and liberty in a government  that is both strong and limited. In a free government there are inherent tensions between power and liberty, majority rule and minority rights, the claims of the individual, and counter claims of the community. These tensions inevitably raise issues that could result in constitutional changes. In responding to these issues of change, a major responsibility of U.S. citizens is to conserve the constitutional values and principles that have served the nation. (SM)",

        "description":"Student teaching is the most powerful experience in the preservice preparation of teachers. Researchers have noted that during the student teaching experience, the norms of the university are quickly supplanted by the norms of the public school. This research is designed to examine the perspective that student teachers adopt toward teaching social studies in elementary schools. Particular concerns include: (1) the students' definitions of the purpose of social studies; (2) their views of the relative status of social studies in the elementary curriculum; and (3) the students' views of their cooperating teachers. The sample of students interviewed for this study consists of elementary education majors from two universities who had completed student teaching and who had taught at  least one social studies unit. It was found that most of the students recognized the relationship of social studies to citizenship, but they interpreted good citizenship to be synonymous with classroom demeanor and deportment. Most of the students learned through student teaching that social studies is a low priority subject, approached less than enthusiastically by cooperating teachers and not prized by the school. Students' opinions of cooperating teachers were positive, and these teachers were viewed as sources of critical knowledge. Those educators in charge of preservice teachers should give greater attention to student teaching and how social studies is viewed in the schools. Careful attention should be given to the selection of cooperating teachers. (SM)",

Initiated in response to employers' growing interest in child care, the NESCCP aimed to assist businesses by: (1) describing existing employer-supported child care activities throughout the United States; and (2) developing materials to help employers determine whether child care might make sense for their organization and, if so, how to set up an appropriate program. The project was conducted between 1981 and 1983 by the Child Care Information Service of Pasadena, California. Sections of this executive summary focus on the context for employer-supported child care, benefits of  child care for employers, characteristics of employers and their child care programs, tax advantages for employers who support child care, further steps for employers who may wish to become involved in child care, and employer-supported child care options. Four categories of options are described: flexible personnel policies, information programs, financial assistance, and direct services. (RH)",

Part Two discusses the processes of identifying and estimating benefits of child care to companies, and tax considerations. Part Three presents practical guidelines and a systematic model for deciding whether and how to become involved in child care. Several strategies for collecting information are described. Part Four discusses the many ways in which companies can support child care. These include flexible personnel policies, information and referral programs, educational programs for parents, reimbursement programs, support of existing programs, flexible benefit plans, day care centers, family day care  programs, direct services for school-age children, and child care for sick children. Factors relevant to the selection and setting up of an option are considered. Variations in program sponsorship are also examined. Part Five contains a brief summary, discusses the impact of employer-supported child care on society, and presents creative systems for planning and delivering child care supports.

        "description":"A comparative investigation of the place of the sixth grade in public education used a shadow study technique to address three questions: (1) What is a sixth grader's day in school like? (2) In what ways do programs provided for sixth graders differ, depending on where the grade is located in the school system? (3) How does what is known of the nature and needs of sixth graders match up with the program actually provided? Findings indicated that three types of sixth grade exist: (1) the traditional, self-contained, elementary-oriented, single class group taught by one teacher; (2) the departmentalized sixth grade, secondary in nature and form, in which the student group moves from class to class to receive instruction from different specialist teachers; and (3) the teamed sixth  grade, in which instruction in basic subjects is provided by a team of two to five teachers who cooperatively plan the program. Generalizations from the data concern the types of instructional arrangements, the sixth grade in general, and where the sixth grade should be located in the structure of schooling. It was asserted that no justification exists for using full departmentalization in the sixth grade, and that the self-contained elementary-oriented program is equally unwise. The strong socialization drive of sixth-grade students should be used positively in the pursuit of learning. (RH)",

Social competence, as based on exchange theory, was &quot;operationalized&quot; as including high levels of interpersonal positiveness, and accuracy in perceiving one's social status. Also explored was the extent to which satisfaction is a consequence of competence and social status. A total of 50 fifth-graders were interviewed, providing data in four domains: (1) sociometric status; (2) perceived sociometric status; (3) loneliness and social dissatisfaction; and (4) interpersonal positiveness in different social situations. Results indicated that unpopular children were more dissatisfied and lonely, and less interpersonally positive, than average or popular classmates. Further, even  though all the children were fairly accurate perceivers of their social standing, unpopular children overestimated it, while average and popular children underestimated their peer group status. When path analysis was used to test an exchange theory model of social competence and peer relationships, findings indicated that social competence significantly predicted social status which, in turn, significantly predicted social satisfaction.

        "description":"An interview of 64 students in eight 3rd- and 4th-grade classrooms and an assessment of their teachers' control orientation were conducted for the purpose of testing the hypothesis that students of autonomy-granting teachers are better means-ends thinkers than those of controlling teachers. Dimensions of students' classroom socialization of particular interest were task demands and interpersonal competence. Aspects of the task demands dimension included following directions and monitoring one's comprehension. The interpersonal dimension included outcomes such as sharing and being helpful. Student competence was assessed with a modified version of Shure and Spivak's (1972) means-ends problem-solving measure. Teacher control orientation, the dependent variable, was assessed with an  instrument that reflected the extent to which teachers preferred to be controlling or autonomy-granting with students. Results indicated that students' problem-solving ability in the task demands domain was related to teacher control orientation in a way that was consistent with the literature on effective parenting. Results favored an &quot;information internalization&quot; model of classroom socialization. In regards to teacher control orientation, it was concluded that it is unrealistic to expect that one best approach to teaching exists. (RH)",

In fact, the country is facing a crisis in child care. Affordable child care continues to be a major issue for many families. Solutions to the current crisis in child care must, in addition to insuring affordability, assure (1) the quality of programs; (2) adequate compensation for teachers; and (3) availability to all families. Many families are unable to afford the cost of child care; subsidies to these families would allow them access to quality programs. To fight the problem of high turnover rate among child care workers, substantial increases in wages and benefits are necessary. Licensing of early childhood programs is another important issue, and  parents need to work with states to monitor program quality without hindering availability. An integrated approach to dealing with the day care crisis is essential; there can be no trade-offs between quality and affordability. (SKC)",

Factors contributing to the inappropriateness of standardized assessment tools for identification of gifted American Indian students are neglect of subcultural values, abilities, and knowledge in assessment instruments and procedures; use of exclusive training in application of middle class measurement instruments; belief that object measurement is the only way to conduct assessment; inadequate attention to problems of motivation and negative reactions to the examiner; failure to include sufficient numbers of minority students in standardization calculations; and lack of knowledge about  culturally valued talents of American Indian students. Educators must consider whether the child exhibits outstanding powers in one or more abilities valued by the child's culture, measures at a bright average level in national norms in both ability and achievement, demonstrates creativity, and shows leadership potential. Educators must also assess verbal and nonverbal responses, provide adequate time for students to answer, develop questioning procedures to elicit multiple responses on items giving credit for such responses, assess a wide range of abilities, and use a matrix rather than one factor for making decisions.

Characteristics of American Indian students' learning styles which may affect science and math motivation are outlined: seeing and  listening, practicality, caution, and field sensitive orientation. Suggestions for teaching science and math as creative processes and cultural systems of knowledge include: deriving creative content from students' immediate environment; integrating contemporary American Indian issues and concerns with related scientific information; utilizing American Indian culturally based content; establishing learning situations which are experientially based; incorporating creative writing as part of the presentation of science and math content; presenting art as an ideal vehicle for creativity in science and math; and exploring effects of technology on human lifestyles.

        "description":"Children of migrant farmworkers are among the segments of the population most difficult to educate. Data from 1974 indicates the average migrant student had a 40% chance of reaching ninth grade, an 11% chance of reaching 12th grade, and a less than 10% chance of graduating from high school. Factors correlated with students quitting school are failure in classes, dislike of school, having few credits, little involvement in extracurricular activities, poor grades, extensive migration, limited English fluency, and lack of self-assurance and family support. Needs of migrant secondary school students are affective (supportive, positive atmosphere); cognitive (remedial assistance, study skills development, time management, academic and vocational guidance); and technical (appropriate  age/grade placement, credit acceptance, knowledge of graduation requirements). Direct services that secondary schools can offer to assist migrant students include academic assistance (counseling, credit accrual, tutoring, extended day/week/year programs, and special summer programs); career awareness (work experience programs and vocational education); alternative support programs (cooperative projects with community organizations and businesses and high school equivalency programs); and post-secondary programs (College Assistance Migrant Program, College Bound, and Mini-Corps). Suggested regional, state, and national efforts include staff development, model programs, advocacy, information dissemination, and expanded use of existing programs/organizations. (NEC)",

        "description":"Although the existence of small Catholic elementary schools (enrollment: 300 or less) is precarious, these institutions enable students to succeed academically beyond national norms, due to the special learning environment that they provide. The recent Small Schools Survey of Catholic elementary schools indicated that classes in small Catholic schools scored exceptionally well in all of the basic learning areas: reading, mathematics, reference skills. This achievement has important implications for the viability of other very small schools, be they private, religious, or public, and supports other educational research showing that size alone does not indicate the quality of a school. Principals whose small Catholic elementary schools modeled above average academic achievement  reported that the academic advantages of small schools due to low teacher-to-pupil ratios included: use of more varied materials and tasks, higher levels of thinking due to more demanding assignments, increased opportunities for participation, formulation of better study habits, community support and greater opportunities for leadership. Team concept, priorities, skill organization, planning for content subjects, an interdisciplinary approach, and instructional assistance were cited as effective elements in school-wide organization, and knowledge of key concepts and skills, individualization, and room arrangement contributed to effective teaching. Reasons for school failures and ideas for generating support are included. (JMM)",

Three evaluation strategies for school leaders with few resources and limited time are reviewed. The Program Review Committee Approach for Curriculum Evaluation involves establishing a committee which reviews one or two programs each year and makes recommendations, with the approval of the school superintendent, to the school board. The Problem-Solving Approach for School Improvement requires an annual  pre-school year stocktaking at the building level to inventory the strengths and weaknesses of the school; priorities are then set to address deficiencies during the school year. The Discrepancy Approach for Assessing School Needs and Planning has staff members define what they believe are ideal characteristics for their school. The principal then organizes the characteristics into a description against which discrepancies can be compared. This approach keeps a school developing in the direction of the collective vision of its staff. Through systematic evaluation, staff members can work together to improve the quality of their schools.

However, there is no comprehensive evidence to prove that consolidation has met the problems of finance, staff, facilities, and curriculum for which it has been advocated, nor are consolidation's disadvantages and ill-effects of the community usually considered. Partial school reorganization allows a middle-of-the-road response to decreasing enrollments, tight budgets, and increased federal/state demands to provide students in isolated areas equal access to education. Three types of partial reorganization include: (1) Central High School Districts (when two or more school districts combine high school programs but retain separate elementary programs); (2) Cluster  Districts (providing services shared by separate neighboring school districts, allowing access by students of different schools); and (3) Exchange of Students for Tuition (sending students to neighboring school districts for instruction). Personnel, programs, and equipment may also be shared--formally or informally--to provide services to students. Sharing may also be implemented through a state organizational structure. Other helpful approaches include state intervention and state financial aide, multiple teacher certification, application of computer modelling results, community designed reorganizations, and distance education. Thus, full-scale reorganization is not the only solution. (JMM)",

The differences between rural and metropolitan areas are significant, and appropriate preparatory activities in high school can ease the transition. Personal characteristics and values play a big part in a person's ability to adjust to a dramatically different environment. Inventories of personality traits, values, lifestyle, and family orientation can be developed individually, in classroom groups and in discussion with family and friends. Activities to increase assertiveness and to adopt language habits and personal mannerisms appropriate to the city are  important in the preparation process. Assessment of skills, abilities, interests, and previous work experience--as well as completing application forms, writing letters of interest and resumes, and learning about appropriate dress and grooming--will greatly improve the probability of finding a job well suited to the individual. Preparation for adjusting to an urban lifestyle, urban higher education, and realistic budgeting are also important. Rural entrepreneurship may be an option if a move to the city is not desired.

A culturally relevant curriculum provides teachers with resource materials and approaches allowing them to enable students to: develop pride in their culture's contribution to science, learn science from a familiar cultural base, be motivated to consider science as a career, and recognize the importance of science in their life. A joint project between the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science and the Project for Renewed Incentives in Science and Education in Los  Angeles (California) is developing workshops to introduce teachers to culturally relevant materials and specific activities that can be used at different grade levels. Topics include Archeoastronomy, Maya Mathematics and Calendar, Geology, Feeding the World--Productivity of Food Plants, Herbal Medicine/Ethnobotany, Science and Creativity in the Diego Rivera Murals in Detroit, Botany and Mesoamerican Designs, and the Chemistry of Color. As science is stimulated, students typically not attracted to science careers will be more aware, and the differences in participation rate of minorities in science and engineering may increase.

As a sampling of definitions used by different researchers/agencies illustrates, the two categories of definitions of rural--qualitative and quantitative--generally spring from different needs. Agencies and researchers need quantitative measures that can be easily manipulated, sorted, and compared. Others who are closely involved know that their part of rural America is qualitatively different from other rural areas. These two divergent needs, to quantify and to qualify, present a dilemma in terms of access to resources and programs for rural America and for rural education. It is difficult to  capture qualitative measures in ways that readily translate to legislation, policy, or management. Further, rural America's insistence that it is not only different, but has differences within itself, is both its strength and its weakness. The inability to present a unified, powerful rural America to legislators and other policymakers ensures that rural issues, such as education, will continue to suffer from a lack of recognition and resources.

An overview of the 93 model programs categorizes their services as efforts to provide: (1) information on the crisis; (2) direct assistance for legal, financial, or emotional problems created by the crisis; or (3) strategies of economic development, rural advocacy, or job training, designed to change the individual or overall situation. Descriptions of particular programs include the need addressed by the program, the service  delivery strategy, the resources developed, the program outcomes, and the funding sources. Five indexes access the models alphabetically within each state and in terms of program type, sponsoring institution, specific population served, and general topics. Background on information-gathering and the techniques of model selection techniques; a guide for users of the directory; and appendices covering the case summary survey instrument, survey contacts considered by state teams, and total respondents to the survey are included.

This study establishes metro and nonmetro differences in the use of welfare and the degree to which it reduces poverty. Data from the U. S. Census Bureau's March 1987 Current Population Survey are analyzed using multivariate techniques. The study finds that poverty rates are about 1.5 times greater in nonmetro than in metro areas, and that family income in metro areas exceeds that in nonmetro areas by 37 to 46%. Further, data indicate that the severity of nonmetro poverty equals that of poverty in central cities, where about 15% of families have income below the poverty threshold. Nonmetro families, however, have a much lower rate of welfare  receipt, about 5%, as opposed to 10% for families in central cities. Four measures of amelioration all demonstrate that welfare programs in nonmetro areas are less successful in boosting the income of recipients above the poverty level. Multivariate analyses confirm the smaller effects of welfare in nonmetro areas, and they suggest that four variables fully explain the tendency of nonmetro families not to use welfare services: presence of a working head of household, older family heads, home ownership, and absence of programs that supply Aid to Dependent Children for Unemployed Parents (AFDC-UP).

        "description":"This report presents the results of a needs assessment study on comprehensive drug education conducted for a small rural K-8 school. A brief review examines the literature on drug and alcohol abuse among rural youth. Parents, teachers, and students were surveyed to assess their needs, interests, and knowledge of drug and alcohol abuse. Twenty percent of children in grades kindergarten through three and 43% of older children reported having tasted beer while 13% of second graders and 19% of children in grades four through eight had tried cigarettes. All students cited parents as the first source they would go to for information about drugs, although as students increased in age they more frequently cited other sources of information. Ninety percent of parents believed drug  education should occur in the schools. Parents believed educational programs should focus on facts about drugs, their harmful effects on the body, drinking and driving, and the legal ramifications of drug use. The report recommends a parent education program, since parents are cited most frequently as a source of information about drugs and alcohol. Recommended goals for school drug and alcohol education programs include identification of sources of drugs; identification of people who are reliable sources of information; description of the effects of drugs on the body; and demonstration of positive, independent, decision-making skills. The report recommends that a drug education committee select curriculum materials to meet the objectives of the comprehensive drug education program.  (Thirty-five references are listed, and the appendixes contain six questionnaires, a table of results, and a list of recommended curriculum materials.) (DP)",

        "description":"This paper commends qualitative assessment as a significant alternative to standardized testing to determine language proficiency, placement, and instruction for ethnic first and second language adult learners in postsecondary education. Standardized tests and traditional language curriculum and methodology are rigid in instructional scope and sequence, measuring individual learning against a group of first language learners of a particular culture. However, qualitative assessment recognizes that oral and written language learning are impelled by social, cultural, linguistic, and psychological needs and choices prevalent in particular, but diverse language communities. Inquiries into bilingual development that examine family settings, employment, consumer practices and community  residence augment the instructor's perceptions of realistic kinds of literacy learning and usage for ethnic minority adult students. Under the influence of qualitative assessment, individual learning is measured against the performance of group tendencies marked by similar backgrounds and classroom experiences rather than against an idealized and unrelated cultural group. Qualitative assessment places a new emphasis on learner attitudes and expectations ignored by standardized tests. (CS)",

        "description":"Previous research on Mexican Americans in higher education has ignored more prestigious institutions. A survey of 63 of the 79 Chicano graduates of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1979 revealed 2 distinct groups. One group (57%) resembled the traditional profile of Mexican American college students. These students came from low-income or working class families, were first or second generation Americans, were the first college graduates in their families, had often learned Spanish as their first language, and had received little preparation or encouragement for college. They often perceived the university as a hostile or foreign environment. A little over half graduated with grade point averages (GPAs) over 3.0. The nontraditional Chicano students came from  middle-class families, often had parents who were college graduates, had learned English as a first language, had gone to high schools where Anglos were in the majority, and did not view UCLA as a hostile or foreign environment. Compared to the traditional group, nontraditional students had less need for financial assistance, and were less likely to have Mexican American peers. Ninety percent graduated with GPAs over 3.0. The early exposure of nontraditional Chicano students to middle class, Anglo &quot;cultural capital&quot; is a critical factor which enables them to negotiate the university on their own terms. Nontraditional Chicanos do not signal their nonAnglo status. The report includes a data table on selected variables, and 56 references. (SV)",

Naturalistic research methodology is described by one of the writers as &quot;an explicit undertaking to lay aside our ideas and concern ourselves with finding the subjects' perspectives in their non-theoretical lives.&quot; The paper seeks to illustrate the possibility of uncovering common elements in the conduct of naturalistic research. It uses examples from two naturalistic studies, the first located in a small, isolated school in North Queensland, Australia; the other set in a large inner-city school in Vancouver, Canada. The conduct of naturalistic research is influenced by the physical environment, by the community relationships the researcher  establishes and by the expectations held for the outcome of the research. Relationships with students, school staff, parents and administrators are detailed.

        "description":"This report examines trends in local government revenues, expenditures and debt from 1977-82. During the period, local governments were subject to cuts in federal aid, severe economic recession and restrictions on revenues and spending, necessitating a fiscal response. Spending reductions were common, especially in big cities. Rural governments were characterized more by tax and spending increases. While most urban and rural areas were able to reduce property tax burdens by offsetting increases in non-tax revenues, only big cities were able to reduce significantly the overall fiscal burdens for their residents. Real spending reductions were mostly in education. While student enrollment declined 10% during the period, the number of teachers dropped only 1%. Reduced school  construction and lower real teachers' salaries were factors, especially in big cities. In rural areas, local governments rapidly increased their real current spending, apparently to meet higher costs for utilities and health services. Because incomes did not grow as fast as spending, more revenue efforts were required, increasing fiscal stress on taxpayers. Governments in totally rural areas benefited from fiscal capacity growth and increased state aid, allowing them to reduce local government fiscal pressure on taxpayers. Revenue efforts have been rising in rural areas relative to urban areas and revenue efforts in totally rural areas now exceed those of large central cities. If these trends continue, the economic development potential of rural areas may be threatened. (Numerous tables  and figures and 28 references are included.) (TES)",

        "description":"This report contains the findings and recommendations of the California Legislative Analyst concerning the Native American Indian Early Childhood Education program. The program was established in 1972 to increase competence in reading and mathematics among American Indian students in California rural schools by intervening in prekindergarten through grade 4. In the 1986-87 school year, the program served 1,130 students in grades kindergarten through 4 from 23 schools in 11 districts. No prekindergarten projects were funded. Typically, the program provided supplemental services during regular school hours or tutoring after school. In analyzing the State Department of Education's (SDE) report on the program, the Legislative Analyst makes the following findings or criticisms: (1) an  additional 2,400 students could potentially qualify for the program; (2) contrary to SDE policy, participating school districts use 2 to 5% of their state allocation to pay for indirect local administrative costs; (3) the SDE allocates funds based on the project rather than the number of students served, and the SDE favors renewal of current projects to the exclusion of new ones; (4) federally-funded Indian education programs provide some overlapping services to the same client population; (5) the SDE offers no specific evidence of the need for this program; and (6) there have been no evaluations of program effectiveness in the last 10 years. The Legislative Analyst recommends an extension of the program termination date to June 30, 1989, pending the completion of a comprehensive program  evaluation by the SDE and the development of specified model projects that meet program goals.

A project coordinator, a resource teacher, and 34 tutors served 18 elementary schools, 16 middle schools, and 10 high schools in the district. The program achieved its two academic objectives. During the 1986-87 school year, elementary and middle school students mastered an average of eight competencies each in mathematics and language arts. Ninety percent of these students mastered at least four mathematics competencies; 69% mastered at least four language competencies.  Students in grades 6-12 made a mean gain of 1.23 points in grade point average on a scale in which A plus equals 13 and F equals 1. Behavior ratings fell short of the objectives, but 75% of teachers felt that the observed improvement justified the time spent out of class. Eighty-five percent of teachers thought the program was somewhat or very successful in meeting student needs. The Parent Advisory Committee (PAC) held 17 meetings, 3 public hearings, and 3 parent training sessions. The working relationship between the PAC and project administrators was commended in the State Department of Education audit report.

The interviews gather data on attitudes about and experiences of schooling and education, life history, social network, ethnicity, and family and kinship. The case studies indicate that while cultural, symbolic, and structural Appalachian ethnicity is related to a more negative school experience, residence and socioeconomic class are strong mediating factors.  Urban, middle-class Appalachians have a more positive school experience.

        "description":"This document is a summary of presentations and strategies offered at the 1986 National Invitational Conference on Rural Adult Postsecondary Education. The conference, organized by the Action Agenda Project and co-sponsored by the National University Continuing Education Association, explored the educational needs of rural adults and designed strategies to support rural educational efforts. The summary includes mention of economic development projects undertaken by Native Americans who are concerned about the devaluation of their culture by current educational systems. Presentations advocated linking rural education and local economic development more closely, and included several examples of such links. Conference presenters suggested that specific programs are best proposed and  developed by rural communities themselves. An &quot;Agenda for Future Work&quot; includes a list of priorities for responding to rural educational needs, empowering rural learners, and promoting change. Executive summaries of three papers presented at the conference, lists of staff, participating organizations, other publications, and a call to establish a national clearinghouse to support improvement in adult education in rural areas are included in the proceedings.

        "description":"This study of leadership and collaboration in rural adult education begins by outlining the conditions that alter education's role in the community. The stability of land ownership, the relationship between hard work and success and the reliability of traditional methodology can no longer be taken for granted. The educational need for rural adults today is not for more innovative programs, but for focused initiative that produces results on the local, state, and national levels. The paper argues that the most effective and lasting educational programs are created when both the service agency and the community actively and purposefully work together. Coordination enhances efforts by all agencies concerned with rural education. Educational leadership is composed of formal or  informal community leaders who provide credibility and a sense of community needs. Also necessary are agency leaders who provide the actual coordination. The document suggests various educational organizations as possible candidates for community leadership, with the community college discussed as a possible educational coordinator. Linkages among other local agencies are also suggested as a way to secure additional resources, strength, and creativity. The problems of making such linkages are discussed, as is the possibility of regional and statewide links. A pragmatic educational methodology is called for in place of osmotic learning to ensure accessibility to all learning. He says that, while state and national government should create clear and simple means for supporting adult  education, impetus, planning, and execution must begin on the local level. Charts and a list of references are included. (TES)",

        "author":["Emery, Mary"],
        "description":"This paper examines the potential impact of technology on postsecondary rural education, based on the experiences of people currently using technological delivery systems. Migration and economic dislocation of rural communities increases the need for educational services, while state resources generally have decreased. Technological solutions to providing distance education to rural adult learners has become increasingly attractive. Technology, which has reshaped the rural economy, can have the same affect on the structure and content of rural education. But the parameters of this reshaping are still undefined. High technology could be oriented toward a select group of highly motivated remote learners, or toward a variety of educational and training needs within the rural  community. Technology can deliver instruction, but the context in which that instruction takes place also plays a role in its success. Technology can give access to postsecondary education for rural learners, but there are equity and quality issues. Policies that take such issues into account can broaden educational opportunities for a large number of rural learners. This paper takes the position that technology must be viewed not as a solution to the problem of distant learning, but rather as a tool for solving educational problems related to distance (Turner 1986). Policy issues that influence the outcome of high tech delivery are identified and discussed. (Author/TES)",

        "description":"This document discusses the genesis of the Hopi Educational Master Plan Project, a long-range effort at planning a rural school system for a Native American population. The opening of a new junior/senior high school on the Hopi reservation in Northern Arizona raised many issues about the educational needs of the Hopi people. Staff of the Bureau of Indian Affairs/Office of Indian Education Programs and the Hopi Tribe's Department of Education met to develop and carry out a process for obtaining information about what the Hopi people wanted in their educational system in order to create a responsive plan. While the project emphasized the need for formal planning, the planning group worked under the assumption that a large amount of local input would improve the results. Planning  meetings were held in which tribal and village leaders discussed the educational goals of the reservation. Despite the local input, the Hopi Tribal Council was reluctant to approve the plan and sent it back to a committee. The results of the project illustrated the importance of patience and the need for ongoing training about education and schools for people who were unused to decision making on anything but a local level. The master plan project was valuable in introducing and maintaining discussion of educational issues on the reservation. The report includes a seven-item reference list. (TES)",

Of the 331 freshmen, sophomores, and juniors enrolled, adequate data were available for 246 (74.3%). academic delay, substance abuse, social-emotional problems, school history, school behavior, and arrests. A student-by-student risk analysis indicates that 52.3% of the student population is at high risk, and 91.6% is at either high, or moderate, risk. Most of these students are at high-risk in more than one critical risk category. Detailed weightings for critical risk factors are described in an  attachment. These data and the delay in transferring critical IIS programs to other schools indicate that the decision to close the school will not serve the best interest of the target students, their families, and the tribes they represent.

        "description":"This study assessed the educational status of 284 students displaced by the closure of the Intermountain Inter-Tribal School (IIS), a majority of whose students had been referred because they were difficult to serve. Educational status was gauged by the holding power of the schools to which the students were sent, dropout and expulsion rates, and academic status relative to promotion. Nearly half of the high risk group were not in school by May 1985, one year after the closing of the IIS; figures for medium- and low-risk groups were 23.9% and 16.7% respectively. Data indicate that 59% of the displaced students failed to make academic progress sufficient to justify grade promotion or graduation. A survey of agency personnel indicates a generally negative perception of the quality  of services available at schools to which IIS students were sent. The study revealed no evidence that anything was done at any of the remaining schools to upgrade facilities and services to meet the special needs of the displaced students. The data from this survey fail to justify the rationale used for closing the IIS. Students were worse off because of the closure. Appendices include information about tribal membership, instruments used in the study, and the report of a preliminary follow-up study dated October 1984. (SKW)",

Two experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, subjects estimated: (1) the mean of a random sample of ten scores consisting of nine unknown scores and a known score that was divergent from the population mean; and (2) the mean of the nine unknown scores. The modal answer (about 40% of the responses) for both sample means was the population mean. The results extend the work of Tversky and Kahneman (1971) by demonstrating that subjects hold a passive, descriptive view of random sampling rather than an active balancing  model. This result was explored further in in-depth interviews (Experiment 2), wherein subjects solved the problem while explaining their reasoning. The interview data replicated Experiment 1 and further showed (a) that subjects' solutions were fairly stable--when presented with alternative solutions including the correct one, few subjects changed their answers; (b) little evidence of a balancing mechanism; and (c) that acceptance of both means as 400 is largely a result of the perceived unpredictability of \"random samples.\" (Author/AA)",

It is hoped as deeper explanations and relationships are explored, children learn analytic, critical, and creative skills for later application to phenomena encountered in life. A concern of elementary science teaching is motivating learning or discovery of scientific concepts. The instructional issue is getting school children to apply systematic thinking. The theoretical issue deals with what becomes defined as a problem realm for students as they interact with authoritative sources. This study was conducted on three classroom lessons on detecting problems that centered around a videotape stimulus. The object was to gain insight into ways teachers could organize the conjunction  of everyday experience and the scientific and how that integration may have served to define what a problem is and what a solution is for the children. The investigation showed different types of systematicity being introduced that appeared to convey different definitions of what constituted a science problem. Children need to go beyond surface explanations of events to develop adequate understandings of concepts for use in problem solving. Related diagrams are included. (RT)",

        "description":"One approach to the study of problem solving is to observe how people with different skills (novices and experts) solve problems by collecting and analyzing protocols and formulating models to obtain solution processes. Individual differences are subsequently explained by the differences in the knowledge possessed, as embodied by the sets of production rules or programs. The intention of the models was to derive the knowledge of the skilled solver from the knowledge of the unskilled solver. Inferences about the transition have not been straightforward. An alternative approach is to determine what students acquire from studying, to represent the knowledge underlying the generation of the solution procedures for the skilled and less skilled students. This paper summarizes a study  of: (1) how students learn to solve simple mechanics problems; (2) what is learned when they study worked-out examples in the text; and (3) how they use what has been learned from the examples while solving problems. It was found that successful students learned the material in a different way than less successful. The good students' quality of explanations was better in that example statements were related to principles and concepts introduced in the text. (Author/RT)",

        "description":"Many believe that throughout history, science and technology have been major factors in shaping American society and the way of life. By changing the ways in which one interacts with another, science and technoiogy may affect the way one defines the general welfare, the way in which one views the realm of government, and the nature of the rights one exercises as an American citizen. Several areas of technology are experiencing rapid development and promise to have profound effects. The centrality of science and technology to American society argues that Congress and the courts will be asked to reexamine constitutional principles in the context of scientific knowledge and technical capabilities. This paper reviews the principles of the United States Constitution and highlights  some of the ways advanced technology will test the basic premises of American government. Discussed are the following topics: (1) \"The Centrality of Information\"; (2) \"The Principles of Constitutional Governance\"; and (3) \"The Bill of Rights and Civil War Amendments.\" Also included are questions which are addressed, subtopics, conclusions, and acknowledgements.

An eight-item bipolar scale which reflected the major goals of science for the 1960s and 1980s was developed as the study instrument. The sample population consisted of all middle and secondary school science teachers in the state of Delaware (N=307); analysis was based on the 113 questionnaires that were returned with complete information. The results indicated that the majority of respondents believed that science instruction should emphasize both  sets of goals. When only those responses indicating a preferred goals orientation were considered, teachers facored the 1980s goals. Also teachers favoring 1980s goals felt stronger in their conviction than teachers preferring the 1960s goals. Implications and limitations of the study are discussed and a copy of the survey is appended. (RT)",

A random sample of biology departments that offer post-baccalaureate degrees were sent questionnaires (30% of 232 responded) that focused on four areas: current departmental practices, anticipated changes in faculty curricular specialization, attracting students to the major, and departmental experiences with self-evaluation. These departments had relatively equal distributions of faculty expertise in molecular, cellular, organismic, and ecological/environmental biology. Most faculty were involved in research and half obtained off-campus grant support. About two-thirds of the departments anticipated expansion in molecular biology or areas requiring molecular techniques. Most programs offered a non-majors course  emphasizing the excitement, fun and relevance of biology; few students seemed to take biology for elective or personal reasons. Almost all departments have undertaken self-study and found the process productive. This publication includes a copy of the questionnaire and tables of the responses to each item as appendices.

Whereas the supply of new knowledge appears unlimited, the demand for new knowledge is much greater. In the years to come, more knowledge will be needed to cope with world problems. Knowledge is a most important resource along with the scientists and engineers who produce it. Many believe that increasing the supply of knowledge requires solving the problems of education and devoting the necessary resources to basic research. This publication contains seven chapters, a director's statement, highlights, awards, operational and organizational news, and a conclusion. The first chapter gives perspectives for the 1990s. Chapter 2, on human resources and  education, outlines precollege education, undergraduate and graduate education, other activities, and public outreach. Chapter 3 explains disciplinary research in fields including the sciences, mathematics, and small businesses. Chapter 4 deals with basic research of centers and groups, and instrumentation.

Programs sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) need advanced technology and the technologies they generate are exceptionally diverse. The large storehouse of technology built over almost a quarter-century of space research and more than half a century of aeronautical research constitutes a national resource of knowledge for new uses. This publication is intended to heighten public awareness of the technology available for use and its potential for economic and social benefit to the United States. Section 1 outlines NASA's mainline effort and the major problems that generate these new technologies, as well as projected space operations for the 1980s.

The terms, Pacific Rim and Pacific Basin, are used. interchangeably; however, the &quot;Rim&quot; refers to those nations bordering the Pacific Ocean, while &quot;Basin&quot; includes all the island nations. Due to unprecedented growth in trade and finance, many of the Pacific Rim nations are achieving increasing global significance. Three reasons for including the Asian Pacific Rim in elementary and secondary schools social studies curriculum are: (1) economic interdependence of the United States with countries of the Pacific Rim; (2) military and political importance of the Pacific  Rim; and (3) growing rates of immigration from the Asian Pacific countries to the United States. Useful strategies for teaching about the Pacific Rim include emphasizing the diversity of Pacific Rim cultures and using studies of modernization and change in Pacific societies to provide insights into global change. The study of Asian Pacific culture not only enhances understanding of these people but also fosters a sense of appreciation for social diversity found in the United States. A list of resources is included. (SM)",

Currently, curriculums tend to be predominately modern, while students prefer postmodern education theories. Academic institutions can respond to this cultural change by establishing integrated and interdisciplinary honors programs. This paper examines: (1) selected characteristics of modern curriculums; (2) selected characteristics of postmodern students; and (3) the use of the social construction model to synthesize western cultural changes. Specific applications of this model in the Union County College (Cranford, New Jersey) Honors Program are described in terms of: (1) curriculum design; (2) courses; (3) faculty participation; and (4) student, faculty, and  course materials interactions. An appendix includes selected quotations and a list of essential differences between modernism and postmodernism. (JHP)",

        "description":"Low levels of student achievement and school quality persist in developing countries. This document reviews the importance of school quality in increasing literacy and influencing economic growth in developing nations. Improvements are discussed in terms of: (1) school quality and economic development; (2) defining school quality; (3) improving school quality; and (4) increasing school efficiency. Evidence suggests that low school quality accounts for low literacy levels and achievement among children in developing nations and that little progress has occurred in improving school quality in the poorest countries since 1970. Definitions of school quality should focus on characteristics that influence student achievement and on efforts that encourage more efficient management and  effective local school staff. Little research has been conducted about the influence of teaching practices and classroom organization on achievement levels, but access to textbooks and writing materials and teacher quality consistently influence student achievement. Methods for studying the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of management practices in terms of increased school quality are reviewed, and investments that can be reduced without causing detrimental effects are identified. Tables and a 94-item bibliography are included. (Author/JHP)",

For most individuals, music learning is developmental and requires continuing effort spread over a period of time. It has cognitive, psychomotor, and affective domains. The cognitive or intellectual component of music includes music history and a body of knowledge in music theory. The musical elements of rhythm, harmony, melody, form, style,  and dynamics are the fundamentals of music theory. The psychomotor aspect of music learning involves sensory stimulation and perceptual processes; and the cognitive and psychomotor elements in the music learning process are transformed into affective learning experiences. As music is essentially an aural phenomenon, the ears play a major role in music processing. From the ear, musical impulses are picked up and transmitted via a neurological network to the brain. To help students develop musical skill and insight, music must be experienced. Musicianship can be developed to some degree by almost all persons through engaging in musical experiences. (SM)",

        "description":"In a time of heightened concern for useful integrated studies in U.S. history, Merl Eppse's work is at the forefront of quality material. Unfortunately it has been largely ignored. Merl Eppse was one of the first educators to write a U.S. history textbook that presented the history of U.S. blacks in an integrated manner. He was the head of the Department of History and Political Science at Tennessee A &amp; I State University in Nashville (TN). He wrote three published books about U.S. history with an emphasis on blacks. Eppse's first book, &quot;A Guide to the Study of the Negro in American History,&quot; (1937) was designed to accompany Eppse's forthcoming history text, &quot;The Negro, Too, in American History,&quot; (1938). In 1939, Eppse co-authored &quot;An Elementary History of America with  Contributions of the Negro Race,&quot; with A. P. Foster. One reason that Eppse's work could have remained unknown is that the books were published during World War II when the war effort was so all encompassing that many outstanding works were ignored. The second reason is that the topic was ahead of its time. Despite concern for proper inclusion of minorities in U.S. history textbooks, this exclusion still occurs. Eppse's work is so well integrated that it can easily serve as a model for U.S. history textbooks for today's schools. (SM)",

        "description":"In order to obtain information on the status of geographical knowledge possessed by University of South Dakota (Vermillion) students, a geography survey designed to determine specific knowledge about the locations of bodies of water, countries, and cities was conducted. One map was used for identifying cities, while the second was used for identifying bodies of water and countries. The survey was administered to 660 students. If 70 percent is regarded as a passing grade at the college/university level, then the students in this study failed in their knowledge of locations of water bodies, countries, and cities. The highest mean correct response was 67 percent for locations of water bodies. The location of countries was a distant second with a mean response rate of 40 percent.  Locations of cities was the lowest of the three categories with a mean response of 32 percent. The study indicates a statistically significant difference between those students who have had a geography class in high school and those who have not. However, the mean of correct responses of locations of water bodies for those who have had a geography class is 71 percent barely a passing score. For those having had a geography class the mean scores for locating countries and cities is only 43 percent and 35 percent respectively. Data are illustrated in tables. The geography survey which was administered in the study is appended. (SM)",

Chapter 2 considers the status of economics education in schools and argues for a combination of economics education infusion into existing grades K-12 courses, along with a required high school course. Chapter 3 discusses economics instruction in terms of a model that centers on economic reasoning for effective citizenship and suggests teaching economics based on learning theory research and on  established teaching practices. Chapter 4 examines: (1) evaluative materials selection techniques for teachers; (2) the economics content of social studies textbooks; (3) reviews of economics textbooks; and (4) other classroom materials, such as videocassettes and teacher's guides.

Special events, units, specific courses, or the infusion of LRE into already-established  courses can be used to implement LRE into the curriculum. The characteristics of an effective LRE program include: (1) extensive student interaction; (2) course content that involves a balanced treatment of issues; (3) the use of outside resource persons; (4) strong school administrative support; and (5) systematic staff development.

Four characteristics of a sound secondary school economics course include: (1) an emphasis on basic concepts and principles; (2) teaching strategies that elicit active student learning; (3) the connection of concepts and principles to other school subjects and citizenship roles; and (4) the application of knowledge to public issues and problems.

Each student as well as the supervisor has data on her/his own focus which can be shared with the group. Dealing with this data becomes the focus of a second phase of data gathering: data about how the group processes are working in meeting goals, whether jointly set as co-researchers or in relation to individually specific situations. Finally, there is the data about what is being learned about  action research, which is the focus of the supervisors in their joint project. The point of collecting the data is to further the communicative action of members of the group and to promote greater articulation and understanding of the specific interests and tasks of student teaching. Brief case histories of students, focusing on classroom management and discipline as their projects, are used to demonstrate how the discussion of data assisted group members to build and articulate their own theories.

Their supervisors read and then wrote feedback comments in the journals. The comments were, for the most part, supportive and encouraging. The reflective statements gathered within the dialogue journal inquiry model lent support to the idea of a developmental conceptualization of teachers' concerns. Four levels of concerns, progressing from \"self\" to \"students\", were  apparent. Appendices contain excerpts from the student teachers' journals, including supervisor comments.

These reports gave impetus to widespread efforts to improve education. This paper presents an analysis of the content and impact of the reform reports, reviewing earlier reform efforts, assessing the primary ways in which the reports agreed and differed, delineating how various levels of government responded to the reform effort, and suggesting the reports' implications for education. An appendix provides detailed summaries of each of seven reform reports. (Author)",

Various assumptions that underlie the development of such programs are identified, and a description is given of how various operating programs carry out these assumptions in practice. Policymakers are urged to consider where opposition will be encountered and support will be found as they plan their strategy for implementation.

The first chapter deals with classroom events--instructional episodes that are problematic either in their conceptions or their implementation. Chapter two deals with interactions with individual students or a small group of students who persistently were disruptive or refused to work. The third chapter examines neophytes' relationships with mentor  teachers or other experienced teachers who attempted to provide assistance. Each case contains four parts: the academic background and previous experience of the trainee; a description of the classroom, school, and students; a narration of a classroom event or interaction; and some reflective thoughts about the account by experienced teachers or scholars.

The Commission systematically selected transcripts from 15,973 students from 1,180 state high schools responding to a program undertaken to elicit transcripts from every public regular and continuation high school, public adult school, and California Community College offering a high school diploma program. Regular admission evaluators submitted the transcripts to the same admission analysis that they would have undertaken for first-time freshmen applying for fall 1986 admission. The reviews covered course work  completed, scholastic achievement, and entrance examination scores; the latter included scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test and the American College Test. Characteristics of eligible and ineligible graduates and the context of eligibility are discussed. Results indicate that 14.1% of these graduates were eligible at the University of California and that 27.5% were eligible at the State University. The respective proportions represent 1.6% more and 5.8% less than the master guidelines of the institutions. (TJH)",

Product criteria are as important as are process criteria, and studies that can be shown to meet these product criteria will fulfill important functions within the emergent paradigm.

Hypothetical purchases of ground beef were selected for the study as such purchases have the desirable property of quantifying both the price and quality. A total of 150 students at the University of Iowa rated the desirability of each of a series of ground beef purchases described by the cost and the quality (the percentage of fat or lean meat) of the beef. The subjects rated 24 purchases containing complete information and 24 containing incomplete information. The missing information component involved provision of information only on the price or only on the quality. The students were placed in positive or negative framing conditions involving  characterization of the meat by lean content and by fat content, respectively. Data from the students' ratings of purchases indicate that: purchases are evaluated more favorably when information is framed positively, consumers place great confidence in their estimates and treat them as if they were veridical when they are asked to estimate missing values, and consumers' judgments are affected by the way objective information is framed and by the extent to which they are encouraged to use their previous experiences to infer the value of missing information.

The research was conducted in an urban high school with a total enrollment of 1,628. The sample consisted of 315 tenth graders who had taken the HSPT in April of 1986. Seven hypotheses were tested with respect to mobility, school, and home factors that may affect student achievement and influence student performance on the HSPT. Student transcripts provided some of the study data. The results indicate that: (1) mobility has little effect on achievement when other school and home  factors are held constant; and (2) a large set of complex social conditions affects student performance including language proficiency, behavior, and attendance.

This MDA is perhaps most pronounced in item banking, where each examinee responds to a different subtest of items from a large item pool and where both person and item parameter estimates are needed. The Rasch model is emphasized, and its non-parametric counterpart (the Mokken scale) is considered. The possibility of tailoring test items in combination with their estimation is discussed; however, most methods for the estimation of item parameters are inadequate under tailoring. Without special measures, only marginal maximum likelihood produces adequate item parameter estimates under item tailoring. Fischer's approximate minimum-chi-square method for estimation of item parameters for the Rasch model is  discussed, which efficiently produces item parameters. (TJH)",

In response to a second mailing to 230 of the non-respondents, 97 additional responses were received. Scales incorporated into the study included the Mandated Tests Scale, Paperwork Scale, Burnout Scale, Pupil Control Ideology, and Locus of Control.

Fifty-one psychological and demographic predictor variables were added to the regression equation to account for  variance in the Emotional Exhaustion Factor of the Teacher Burnout Scale. Results indicate that: (1) paperwork is a factor in burnout of Texas teachers; (2) educators are not totally opposed to the mandated testing of their students, but all teachers are concerned about the misuses of testing; and (3) mandated testing and the associated paperwork may reduce teaching effectiveness and contribute to burnout.

The third set  included published research on the macro-structural correlates of homicide and rape that revealed parallel results using states, metropolitan areas, and cities. Findings support a &quot;state effect,&quot; despite the internal heterogeneity. American states may be appropriate units for macro-sociological research, since their distinctive social characteristics cut across rural/urban and metropolitan/non-metropolitan areas, and their heterogeneity is not a serious impediment.

The CTS is a brief instrument designed to measure three aspects of parent-to-child behavior: (1) reasoning; (2) psychological aggression; and (3) physical aggression. The psychological and physical aggression indexes are intended to measure the incidence rate and severity of emotional and physical maltreatment of a child. The scales consist of lists of responses by parents to problems they have with their children. The lists are organized around the principle that acts are the primary indicator of child maltreatment. The physical abuse index measures overall violence, physical abuse, very severe violence, severe violence, and minor violence. Six items are included in the CTS to measure  psychological aggression. Although extensive data illustrate the construct validity of the CTS, it appears that the internal consistency reliability is minimal and that concurrent validity studies are needed. The CTS measures are moderately reliable and are not confounded with social desirability response sets. Alternative child abuse measures (officially reported cases, national incidence studies, prediction instruments, and medical diagnosis) are considered. A copy of the CTS is appended. (TJH)",

It is intended to measure the extent to which family members use reasoning, verbal aggression, and physical aggression. Focus is on: (1) bringing together and evaluating criticisms of the CTS so that users can be informed of problems and limitations of the instrument; (2) describing revisions and supplementary questions that were introduced in the 1985 National Family Violence Resurvey to deal with some of the criticisms; and (3) presenting new data on the factor structure, reliability, and validity of the CTS based on the 1985 Resurvey and on data reported by several other investigators who have used the CTS. The most unique aspect  of the CTS is the measurement of physical violence in the family (child and spouse abuse); the CTS has the most serious deficiencies in this area. Evidence of a stable factor structure, moderate reliability, and concurrent validity; and strong evidence supporting construct validity suggest that the CTS is the best available instrument for measuring intra-family violence.

The range of issues available for research opened to investigation would be greatly expanded if it were possible to aggregate national survey data to produce state-level statistics for variables such as approval of violence and gender role attitudes. If such data were to be available, they could be used to investigate issues such as whether state-to-state differences in the degree of approval of violence explain part of the huge differences among states in the rate of violent crimes. The validity analyses reported in this paper were conducted using data from the 1975 National Family Violence Survey, the 1985 National Family  Violence Resurvey, and the 1972-84 cumulative General Social Survey. Analyses provide information on concurrent validity, construct validity, validity of specific variables, and multi-indicator indexes.

Findings are presented on the internal consistency of the ISSB, including its dimensionality and the relation of the scale to the other aspects of social support such as structural social support network characteristics. Results show that the ISSB has reliability for use with community-based minority groups, is a reasonable measure of social support, and has very good internal consistency. However, its validity was not supported. Cognitive/informational support and  appraisal/emotional support were the most robust dimensions of the ISSB. For black adults, support that results from the self-affirming and self-validating messages inherent in these types of supportive interaction seem to be important. The findings are compared to those of previous researchers such as M. Barrera et al (1983) and J. P. Stokes and D. G. Wilson (1984).

The semiotic models addressed are J. Deely's (1983, 1986) sensation-based Umwelt model and U. Eco's (1976, 1979, 1984) Model Q. The criticism that semiotic models lead to solipsism is dealt with through Gibson's rejection of perception as based solely on sensation. In his theory of visual perception, Gibson considers the environment to be the surfaces that separate substances from the medium in which animals live. But environments also&quot;afford&quot; things, such as shelter and locomotion. The processes of perceiving affordances and abduction, as described by Deely, allow semiotics to escape solipsism.

The following indicators of economic change are used: (1) money income consistent with a Census definition; (2) money income net of direct taxes--i.e., disposable income; and (3) disposable income plus government in-kind transfers. It was found that the period 1980 to 1984 differs from earlier periods by displaying an accelerated trend to greater inequality. Gains achieved by those at the top of the income distribution are more attributable to a redistribution of resources than to economic growth. These results are borne out regardless of the measure of economic status or the unit of observation chosen. Benefits went  disproportionately to those at the top of the distribution of resources, and burdens fell disproportionately on those with lower incomes. A breakdown of the 1980 to 1984 period into periods before and after 1982 suggests that the recession has been more disequalizing than the recovery. But the recovery did not reverse the trend, only mitigated it. Data are presented on eight tables. Appendices present the results of a microsimulation model and analyze inflators. (BJV)",

In anticipation of these developments, there is renewed interest in formal educational attainment and basic academic skills. A concerted national effort to address the current crisis in basic skills development would advance the nation's goals in several important ways. This paper attempts to show how inadequate basic skills are intertwined with problems of youth employment and with dropping out of school, out-of-wedlock parenting, welfare dependency, and the decline in work-force productivity. The first section examines relationships among macroeconomic trends, individual earnings, family-formation patterns, and educational achievement. The  second explores the basic skills crisis, presenting evidence that inadequate skills are an underlying cause of poverty and economic dependency, and identifying the intergenerational causes and consequences of inadequate basic skills. The third section presents a conceptual framework for thinking about the problem, describes effective programs, outlines a system for improving the quality of current programs and the accountability of the institutions involved, and identifies weaknesses in the nation's current educational and training institutions and systems. The final section suggests an agenda for future action. Appendices discuss the Armed Forces Qualification Test, the results of various literacy tests administered to individuals at different levels of educational attainment, and the  effects of basic skills on earnings.

Time series data show that black men, who traditionally earn much less than whites, realized major gains in relative earnings between the mid-1960s and mid-1970s, but since the mid-1970s their position relative to white men has been stable. Male labor supply indicators are examined to assess the size of the labor supply changes and the possible effects of sample censoring on published earning medians. Also examined is Butler and Heckman's labor supply-sample censoring hypothesis, which suggests that growth in government transfer payment programs since 1964 has been responsible for an apparent gain in black relative earnings. The following  conclusions were reached: (1) little support was found for the testable implications of the sample censoring hypothesis; and (2) labor supply reductions had only a modest effect on the published earnings medians in 1985. Most of the gain in relative earnings realized by black men since 1965 was due to factors other than labor supply reductions. Data are presented on four tables.

But at the same time fertility is declining, international migration to the West is accelerating. Legal immigration to the United States rose from about 300,000 per year in the early 1960s to more than 570,000 per year in the early 1980s; the United States is now accepting nearly twice as many immigrants and refugees as all other nations combined. Immigration from Third World countries contributes to population growth in the following ways: (1) the addition of the immigrants themselves; and (2) immigrant fertility, which is often higher than native fertility. A stationary population,  characterized by a fixed size and an unchanging age-sex structure, is forming in the United States; the indigenous population is diminishing, and a new population of immigrants and their descendants is emerging. This is evidenced by America's Hispanic population, which is growing three times faster than the total population. The potential for further change in the ethnic, racial, and linguistic balances of national populations is perhaps greater in Europe than in the United States. Concerns have been raised that immigrants are failing to adapt to the culture of their new home: increasingly immigrants are the focus of tension and the targets of abuse and violence.

        "description":"In European cities, ethnic minorities concentrate in physically and socially dilapidated areas, according to two different patterns. In the traditional pattern, ethnic minorities (who are among the lowest socioeconomic status groups) concentrate in the old and dilapidated buildings in inner city areas. Because inner city areas are becoming gentrified, a new pattern is developing now in France, Great Britain, and West Germany: ethnic minorities and other low socioeconomic status groups concentrate in suburban public housing estates built in the 1960s but already dilapidated. This new situation creates specific difficulties, including educational problems. Due to the centralized school system, France had no specific educational provision for ethnic minorities. In the 1980s, some  experiments in providing for these groups were launched, most of them in schools in dilapidated housing areas. It was taken for granted that ethnic minority school children, because of language barriers, needed extra help. A striking result is that ethnic minority children now often have higher levels of academic achievement than the other children, who are now the ones who need extra help. An explanation for this may lie in the family structure: in these areas, the &quot;white&quot; population is of very low socioeconomic status, stable families are rare, and parents have low expectations of their children's academic performance. On the other hand, ethnic minority families are more stable and expect their children to do well in school. A list of references is included. (BJV)",

The total number of blacks enrolled declined by 2.5 percent from 1980 to 1985; the number of black men enrolled in four-year colleges fell 4.5 percent, and the number in junior colleges fell by 1 percent. Of all racial and ethnic groups of both genders, only black men had a drop in enrollment during the first half of the 1980s. Black males were the group least likely to apply to college, the least likely to be accepted, and the least likely, if accepted, to enroll. Even among those who did  enroll, a high and increasing number of black men failed to advance through college at a normal rate or to complete their degrees. Between 1978 and 1986, the percentage unable to finish a year of credits in a year on campus, and the percentage dropping out of college, rose substantially. Fewer black males were awarded Bachelor's degrees in 1985 than in 1978; the number receiving degrees dropped by one-sixth, with the largest decline occurring between 1980 and 1985. In addition to the immediate implications for the men themselves, the declining access of black males to higher education will have long-term economic, political, and social consequences for society.

Between 1975 and 1984 White and Hispanic students comprised a decreasing proportion of high school graduates but an increasing proportion of college students. The opposite held true for Blacks. Examination  of the largest schools in Atlanta revealed that the four colleges that were integrated by race had a minimum of 80 percent White enrollment. The total number of degrees awarded to Whites and Hispanics rose from 1975 to 1984, but fell for Black students after 1978. The number of degrees awarded by traditionally Black colleges in Atlanta also fell. There is no serious attempt to desegregate higher education in Georgia, in spite of the fact that Georgia is under court order to desegregate its institutions of higher education. Data are presented on 24 tables. (BJV)",

        "description":"The myth of Asians as &quot;the model minority&quot; may hide the instructional needs of Asians and mislead policymakers. There is growing concern that Asians' low verbal scores are masked by their higher than average math scores and high school grade point averages. Principals and key staff at 12 (out of 20) schools identified as having successful compensatory education programs responded to a questionnaire concerning Cambodian, Chinese, Filipino, Korean, Laotian, Hmong, and Vietnamese students who were classified as limited English proficient (LEP). The survey results were interpreted in light of evaluation criteria for compensatory education programs in the state of California, and the responses of the California State Superintendent to the First Term Report of the Advisory Council on  Asian/Pacific Islander Affairs. Findings include the following: (1) Asian students appear to benefit from schoolwork despite a lack of qualified bilingual staff and instructional materials in the primary language; (2) Asian students' success can be attributed to parents' support and cultural emphasis on traits that lead to achievement; and (3) the attributes of the survey schools that qualified them as having outstanding programs may compensate for other deficiencies. Asian/Pacific Islander students at the 12 survey schools should improve their performance if the recommendations of the State Superintendent and his Advisory Council are followed. Six tables of statistical data and a list of 21 references are included. (FMW)",

Results of the LEP projections include the following: (1) the numbers  of LEPs declined slightly during the 1980s, but will either increase or return to their previous levels by 2000; (2) the 5- to 9-year-old group is increasing more than the 10- to 14-year-old group; (3) California and Texas will show overall gains in the number of LEPs, while New York remains the same; (4) the numbers of younger Spanish and Asians are increasing; and (5) the Spanish are concentrated in California, Texas, and New York.

The two conceptual frameworks of criticism represented within the literature assume the following: (1) the institution of public education is faulty; or (2) problems are caused by either participant inadequacies or by technical difficulties in implementation. Either conceptual framework may be involved in commentary. Quantitative research is more usually associated with the conceptual framework that attributes problems to factors outside the control of the school.

The United States has made some progress in improving the lives of minorities, but America is presently moving backward--not forward--in its efforts to achieve the full participation of minority citizens in the life and prosperity of the nation. Statistics on American minorities are provided. Past federal programs that have benefited minorities are reviewed. A national commitment must be made toward the goal of enabling America's minorities to attain a quality of life as high as that of the white majority. The following strategies for success are identified: (1) institutions of higher learning should strengthen their  efforts to increase minority recruitment, retention, and graduation; (2) national leaders should identify and implement policies to stimulate economic growth and restore national solvency; (3) elected officials should lead efforts to assure minority advancement; (4) private and voluntary organizations should initiate new, and expand existing, programs designed to increase minority participation and achievement; (5) each major sector of our society should contribute to a new vision of affirmative action around which a broad national consensus can be formed; (6) minority public officials, institutions, and voluntary organizations should expand their leadership roles; and (7) education leaders should improve coordination and cooperation among all levels and systems.

But, in spite of pervasive differences in achievement and attitudes, the variables of race and school district explain, at best, only one-fourth of the variation in achievement and attitudes. Individual differences within groups are much greater than differences between groups. As eighth graders, School District 151 black students scored more than one grade level  above black students from other comparable school districts in both reading and mathematics; however, in high school, no differences either in academic achievement in high school nor in educational aspirations appeared between these students. White students from School District 151 were at a very slight disadvantage compared to white students from other districts. Black students did not exhibit less of a feeling of control over their environment than white students. Black students scored slightly higher in self-esteem, and were more likely to aspire to a college education than white students. School District 151 students did not have more favorable interracial attitudes than other students, but they were more likely to favor school desegregation. Data are presented on 12 tables.

        "description":"This paper examines the racial attitudes of 5,770 black and white Georgia high school students, comparing the attitudes of students in desegregated and segregated schools. It was found that generally positive racial attitudes exist among all groups of students. On all but one question used in the racial attitudes scale at least 60 percent of the students gave tolerant responses; on seven of eight questions, fewer than 14 percent gave responses indicating prejudice. In light of the Georgia tradition of white supremacy it was surprising to find segregated whites much more tolerant than desegregated ones; these apparently stem from a general improvement in racial attitudes that may be occurring throughout the South. Findings of this report support the following general conclusions:  (1) white females are more tolerant than white males; (2) whites with white collar fathers are more tolerant; (3) whites with good grades are more tolerant; (4) for both blacks and whites, students in desegregated urban schools are more tolerant than students attending rural schools; and (5) blacks are generally more tolerant than whites. In desegregated schools, younger students are significantly less tolerant than older ones. White intolerance did not increase in schools with higher proportions of blacks. Interracial contact and cross-racial friendships were found to be the strongest correlates of racial tolerance. Data are presented on 11 tables. A six-page list of references is included. (BJV)",

From a review of the literature on school desegregation from 1960 to 1975, it is possible to trace significant alterations in perspectives on desegregation and their resulting conceptual manifestations. The de facto-de jure distinction, for example, utilized heavily in the 1960s to calm urban fears, has undergone a shift: the domain of de jure has been greatly expanded. Battles over token desegregation have been replaced by struggles over metropolitan desegregation, and equality of educational opportunity has undergone a number of reconceptualizations. This report is divided into the following  sections: (1) Introduction; (2) Frameworks: General Perspectives on School Desegregation; (3) Litigation, Legislation, and Enforcement; (4) Extent and Causes of Educational Inequality; (5) Remedial Efforts and Counter Forces in Implementation; and (6) Research on Outcomes of Desegregation.

The first paper, \"What Does Educational Research Tell Us About School Desegregation?\" (Gail E. Thomas; Frank Brown) provides a critique of past desegregation research and offers a set of alternative research questions and issues to guide future inquiries. The second paper, \"The Impact of Desegregation on Going to College and Getting a Good Job\" (James M. McPartland; Jomills H. Braddock II) focuses on  the need for desegregation research to examine how school desegregation may help overcome structural barriers that exclude minorities from equal opportunities for success as adults.

McPartland) broadens the theme of the previous paper to include the need to expand research methods in order to permit comparisons of institutions and organizations. Each paper provides an abstract and includes a list of references. (Author/BJV)",

        "description":"City-as-School (CAS) is an alternative high school linking students to various out-of-school learning experiences throughout New York City. In 1985, the CAS was awarded a National Diffusion Network (NDN) four-year replication grant, given to exemplary programs to enable them to disseminate their model to other interested schools and districts throughout the country. The 1986-87 school year represented CAS's second full year of replication activities. In contrast to 1985-86, when CAS/NDN team members attended several general educational conferences, in 1986-87 initial awareness sessions took place only at alternative schools and NDN conferences, or at state governors' conferences that CAS was officially invited to attend. Eight districts around the country were selected for  1986-87 training as replicators, and will begin replication activities in fall 1987. The project's follow-up support, technical assistance, and in-service training objectives were achieved. CAS addressed the recommendations made in last year's Office of Educational Assessment report with the result that increased staffing and the addition of a full-time director have given the replication program a tighter structure with clearer objectives; also, the addition of replicator districts in New Jersey, Alaska, and Washington, D.C., has given the project a broader, more balanced geographical spread. Recommendations for next year are offered. (BJV)",

Data were drawn from Denver (Colorado) Public Schools (DPS), a multiethnic urban school system of over 60,000 students of whom 58,400 are enrolled in grades K through 12. Each year, students at all grade levels are administered the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS) for the elementary grades and the Tests of Academic Progress (TAP) for high school grades. Composite ITBS or TAP scores served as the dependent variable for the analysis. Student mobility was defined by student enrollment patterns in the period from September 1985 through March 1987 when they were tested with the ITBS or TAP for the 1986-87 academic year. Three groups of continuing students and two groups of newly entered students  were analyzed. Findings include the following: (1) the percentage of students classified as mobile decreases as grade level increases; (2) achievement levels of the more stable groups were consistently higher than those of students in the more mobile groups; and (3) attempts to control for student socioeconomic status did not alter the correlation between mobility and achievement.

Solutions are the following: (1) direct funding for the deprived; (2) massive compensatory education programs; (3) a realistic minimum wage; (4) emphasis on rewards, not blame; (5) end dependence on local property taxes; and (6) federal guarantee of equal distribution of funding. U.S. Representative William  Goodling's (Rep.-PA) response includes the following: (1) local control assures accountability of decision making; (2) the Federal Government's role is to ensure equal education for special populations, and to disseminate information; (3) distribution of state spending is dependent on each state's needs; (4) private business should be even more involved in education; and (5) Congress has reauthorized all federal elementary and secondary education programs. The response of former Texas Governor Mark White, a Democrat, includes the following: (1) attention must be given to how funding is spent on the local level; (2) Congress has been handicapped by the Reagan Administration's lack of cooperation; and (3) Kozol's proposal for direct funding for the disadvantaged should be supported.

        "description":"The 1986-87 Teaching Enrichment Activities to Minorities (TEAM) Project provided special education to identified minority students who exhibited characteristics that might make them eligible for placement into an advanced academic program. The 1986-87 TEAM Project operated in 16 elementary schools and served approximately 550 pupils. An evaluation of the program revealed the following: (1) 12 of the 16 TEAM schools used the appropriate criteria for admitting students to the project, while four of the schools failed to do this; (2) all TEAM teachers developed appropriate lesson plans and instructional activities; (3) project students, taken as a group, achieved gains in their reading comprehension, mathematics computation, mathematics application Stanford Achievement Tests scores,  and Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test scores above and beyond those expected from spending a typical year in school; and (4) of the 56 TEAM pupils referred for admission to an advanced placement program, 28 had been tested and 21 had been accepted. Data are presented on six tables. A list of unofficial recommendations is appended. (BJV)",

Nearly all of these districts (97 percent) had State oversight visits (compliance reviews and program audits) from Fall 1982 to Spring 1986. A recent survey of these oversight visits revealed the following: (1) urban districts and large districts (10,000 or more students) had more visits than rural or small districts (less than 2,500 students); (2) 92 percent of school districts with Chapter 1 programs had at least one State monitoring review, and 84 percent had at least one State audit; (3) on average, school districts had 2.3 State monitoring reviews and 2.1 State audits; and (4) each of the 13 Chapter  1 program areas were included in over 80 percent of the districts, and seven of the areas had been reviewed in over 90 percent of the districts. Areas more likely to be reviewed in urban than rural districts, and areas more likely to be reviewed in large than small districts are identified. The most recent State audit was conducted either by a State Education Agency official, or by an accountant under contract with the school district. Over half of the districts reported that their most recent State audit was conducted as a district-wide audit, rather than as an audit specific to the Chapter 1 program. Survey methodology and data reliability are discussed. Data are presented on seven tables. Appendices define Chapter 1 program areas and present the survey instrument. (BJV)",

        "description":"This report analyzes data from the April 1984 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) on households comprised of both Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) recipients and nonrecipients. Of the 3.7 million AFDC households, 32 percent consisted of AFDC recipients and their relatives, as opposed to only recipients. Analysis of the recipients' relationships with the nonrecipients showed two basic household structures: one consisting of two generations; the other, three generations. The following characteristics were found for two-generation households: (1) they usually consist of older AFDC mothers, 73 percent of whom were over age 25 and 32 percent of whom were over 39, who headed the households; (2) in 86 percent, an AFDC recipient was the person in whose name  the dwelling was leased; (3) most of the persons not on AFDC were children of the AFDC family head, and were over 18 and thus ineligible for AFDC. The following characteristics were found for three-generation households: (1) they consist of young AFDC mothers, 53 percent of whom were under age 25 and 40 percent of whom were under 21, living with their parents; (2) in less than a fourth of these, the dwelling was in the name of an AFDC recipient; and (3) most of the non-AFDC relatives were the parents or siblings of the AFDC family head. In 80 percent of three-generation households, nonrecipients had a higher per capita income than recipients. In two-generation households the overall income of AFDC recipients and non-recipients were similar. Data are presented on 10 tables and figures.  Appendices provide additional data, detail the objectives, scope, methodology, and data limitations of the report, and demonstrate sampling errors for key SIPP estimates. (BJV)",

        "description":"The primary goal of the School Improvement Project (SIP), administered by the central office of New York City (New York) Public Schools, is to improve academic achievement through school-based planning. A planning committee representing the various school constituencies is responsible for developing and implementing a comprehensive plan to effect changes in administrative style, basic skills instruction, school climate, student assessment, and teacher expectations. During successive years in the project, schools are encouraged to depend less on project direction and support, and to become increasingly self-sustaining. During 1983-84 the Project's goals were the following: (1) to implement improvement plans in 13 second-year (&quot;D&quot;) schools; (2) to begin independent  institutionalization of improvement planning in four third-year (&quot;C&quot;) schools; (3) to maintain institutionalization in eight fourth-year (&quot;B&quot;) and four fifth-year (&quot;A&quot;) schools; and (4) to continue training project and school staff. After five years of Project implementation, some patterns have begun to emerge identifying school factors that promote or impede success. The most critical factor has been the principal's commitment and backing. Strong, effective committees and school-wide cooperation are also critical factors. Principals, chairpersons, and committees seem to have come to a consensus regarding the definition of school improvement success or failure and their own investment in the process. That the principal can accept and support constituency planning without being threatened  by it is a critical criterion. (Author/BJV)",

The School Breakfast Program was created by Congress in 1966 to provide a breakfast on school days for low income children who would otherwise have none. Children (N=1,023) in grades 3, 4, 5, and 6 in six elementary schools in Lawrence, Massachusetts, were chosen for a one-year study on the effects of Breakfast Program participation. Rates of change were calculated for test scores on the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills (CBTS), absence, and tardiness for Program participant and non-participant groups before and after implementation. Participant and non-participant groups were compared with regard to  demographic variables from school records, and on their CBTS score, tardiness, and absence rates of change. Results were the following: (1) participants and non-participants did not differ with respect to sex, ethnicity, or number of children per family; (2) participants improved their CBTS score; (3) absenteeism of both participants and non-participants increased, but there was less increase for participants; and (4) tardiness decreased for participants and increased for non-participants. Limitations of the study include the following: (1) access to data was limited to those available from school records; and (2) not knowing which of the study subjects habitually did not eat breakfast prior to the implementation of the Program. Sixteen pages duplicating accompanying explanatory slides  are included. (FMW)",

The study's primary purpose was to collect national data on the instructional content and processes of occupational education programs at the high school level. The resultant national database includes observations of 893 classrooms in 120 high schools that were selected by using a stratified random sampling procedure. It was concluded that although vocational classrooms offer frequent and varied opportunities for reinforcing and enhancing students' basic skills, far too many of these opportunities are lost. Generally, when basic skills are part of the instruction occurring in  vocational classrooms, teachers use more traditional instructional methods. The use of competency-based strategies and procedures is quite prevalent in vocational classrooms nationally. No significant differences were found in vocational classrooms in comprehensive, area vocational, and vocational specialty schools. Neither were any significant differences found between the instructional materials and activities used by degreed and nondegreed vocational teachers. (Over half of this report consists of detailed discussions of responses to each of the study's 26 questions. The survey instruments and record layouts for the three project data files--schools, teachers, and classrooms--are appended.) (MN)",

Analysis of the data collected showed that (1) superintendents were ambivalent regarding the mission of public school systems in serving as providers of adult education, with the philosophical support for public school adult education that does exist often tempered by concerns for funding; (2) superintendents  approached mild agreement on the role of educational entitlements in serving as providers of adult education; and (3) superintendents agree more on the issue of benefits as a result of adult education than on mission and funding.

It begins with a brief description of what these special problems are. Chapters 2-5 analyze different responses by pilot projects in Europe to these problems. Because their actions were normally an integral part of their broader response to social/economic changes or new demands, the projects are arranged here according to the broad fields of activity in which their gender equality action was located. Chapter 2 addresses forging closer links between schools and the economic world, including the development and implementation of more varied forms of work experience, use of the world of work as a learning resource, and initiatives to foster a  more proactive and &quot;enterpreneurial&quot; spirit among young people and in the schools. Chapter 3 looks at projects' action to meet new needs in the field of guidance and counseling. Chapter 4 discusses action designed to combat failure and provide fairer opportunities to lower-attaining and disadvantaged young people. Chapter 5 deals with action to help teachers cope with the new tasks and new roles they have to fulfil. Chapter 6 sets out the conclusions drawn from this experience for the further development of gender equality policies and action in education and training. Appendices include a list of pilot projects and brief descriptions of some innovative programs. (YLB)",

        "description":"Continuing education professionals have long been interested in telecommunications media because of their potential value in extending instruction to distant students. The first mass medium to offer a timely means of distance instruction was open-broadcast radio. During the 1920s and 1930s, 13 United States colleges offered credit courses over the airwaves. Yet radio did not live up to its seemingly great potential; by 1940, instructional college programs had vanished. The State University of Iowa (currently the University of Iowa) offered perhaps the best university program of that area. Research into the program at Iowa shows that it started with great enthusiasm and eventually enrolled almost 100 students from many distant points in combined radio-correspondence courses.  However, as time went on, the technical limitations of radio, the lack of well-defined target populations, and the failure to create an adequate faculty reward system eventually spelled the doom of the system. Thus, as has been the case with other technical advances in education, the potential of radio was oversold, badly marketed, and eventually unrealized. (KC)",

Part I presents findings and recommendations from Commission work on the impact of new technologies on jobs, the problems of displaced workers, and workers' increasing need for basic skills. Part II describes the major activities of the Commission in three major areas. First, discussion of its &quot;Changes in the Workplace&quot; work plan focuses on the Commission's completed investigation of the effects of computers on employment and publication of a policy statement and staff report. These other activities in this area are also discussed: completion of research reports on the impact of computers on jobs and on the experiences of displaced workers and the adoption of a project on the employment effects  of the internationalization of the economy. Second, activity centered around the Commission's congressionally mandated review of the Job Training Partnership Act is highlighted. Next, a series of hearings and site visits are described, which provided information about local areas' employment problems and successful strategies for dealing with them. Part III summarizes the Commission's formal meetings. Appendixes include summaries of sponsored research, the Commission's comments on the reports of the National Council on Vocational Education, and a listing of references for the findings and recommendations in the report.

        "description":"A study documented and assessed changes in patterns of service delivery that followed the implementation of the Job Training Partnership Act of 1982 (JTPA). It focused specifically on the kinds of training activities and services that have been implemented and the degree to which they have been coordinated with related programs. Two complementary approaches were used: review of the JTPA implementation research literature and conduct of &quot;panel studies.&quot; Data were collected from 45 prime sponsors during the last full year of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) and 45 JTPA service delivery areas (SDAs). Comparisons of activities funded under CETA and JTPA revealed that the typical prime sponsor/SDA spent fewer funds per client under JTPA, the typical SDA spent  larger proportions of its funding on class-sized vocational skills training and on-the-job training under JTPA than under CETA, and there have not been appreciable changes in the kinds of training offered. The most striking study results in the area of coordination involved the absence of change in coordination that has followed the transition from CETA to JTPA. A number of important issues were raised: causes and results of reductions in participant costs, a decline in service to youth, absence of progress in implementing customized training courses, and lack of increases in coordination.

Understanding the causes of and exploring possible treatments for Alzheimer's disease has been another of the institute's high-priority areas. Institute-sponsored research on the mechanisms of aging has focused on molecular genetics. Another important area in which the NIA has actively supported research is that of the ways in which psychological and social processes interact with physical processes in older age. The following are some highlights of recent NIA-supported research: transplanted brain cells enhance memory and reverse learning  deficits in animals, increased calcium concentrations boost learning in aged rats, high blood pressure is linked to memory impairment, increased periods of chronic illness accompany longer lifespans, living alone does not lead to isolation for many older people, early retirement is influenced by type of occupation, older people hear better using touch, and human factors research offers practical approaches to everyday problems of older people.

Two major national data sets were used to study these outcomes: the High School and Beyond (HSB) survey and the National Longitudinal Survey New Youth Cohort (NLS). Three measures of curriculum were used: vocational profiles based on student transcripts; self-reporting of academic, vocational, and general curriculum; and a  curriculum index of coursework, self-report track, remedial courses taken, and honors courses taken. A large number of control variables were included in the analyses. Results of the study indicate small negative effects of vocational curriculum on basic skills, educational expectation, occupational expectation, perceived ability to complete college, grades, and hours per week spent on homework. Findings regarding postsecondary schooling are mixed. Vocational curriculum in high school does not appear to have strong effects on the other outcomes studied. Limited evidence showed that vocational education is associated with reduced use of marijuana and other drugs, as is academic curriculum. (KC)",

Born in 1829, Della-Vos received a degree in physical and mathematical sciences from Moscow University in 1853. He began his teaching career in 1854 as a teacher of Russian and eventually began teaching advanced mathematics in 1858. In 1860 he was sent to Paris to study the theoretical and practical aspects of machine tool building. He also spent time in London studying farm machinery. After returning to Russia in 1864, Della-Vos was made a professor of mechanics at the Petrovsky Academy. In 1867 he was made director of a Moscow vocational school, and in 1868 he was made director of the Moscow Imperial Technical Academy. His plans for the inclusion of theoretical content in  workshop and laboratory courses were unique in their simplicity and detailed organization. His inclusion of manual training at the postsecondary level became famous worldwide. He spent much of his time in the 1870s exhibiting the technical academy's products and inspecting the best technical schools abroad. He died in 1890 after an illness that began in 1879.

The idea of partnerships between the Calgary school and business communities was first discussed in 1984, and the first five such partnerships began in mid-1985. The Partnerships Program was evaluated in 1986-87. At that time, three of the five initial partnerships were still active and successful, one remained in a planning mode, and the other one had been terminated. The evaluation indicated that planning and implementation of all of the partnerships were well documented and well organized. There were, however, problems related to lack of clear program authority and a slower  than anticipated initiation of partnership activities in some cases. Those partnerships with more frequent contact and more partners tended to be more successful. Students tended to be aware of their partner; however, they were not always sure which activities were partnership related nor were they clear about the partnership's purpose. All of the intended goals of the partnerships studied appeared to have been met, and few negative impacts of the partnerships were identified.

(A strategy is the planning and management of an operation.) The strategies are decision making, group  process, and individual growth/extended learnings. Outlines provide analyses of how the strategies can be developed in the classroom. Steps, teacher/advisor role, and methods/techniques are detailed. The next section identifies how leadership can be developed through integration of Future Homemakers of America (FHA) into the classroom. The role of organizations is discussed, a lesson plan to introduce FHA is presented, and organizational structure is described. Suggestions are offered for developing the three strategies through FHA. Other information on FHA is also provided. (YLB)",

        "description":"A study focused on the appropriate balance between academic and vocational education for those who intend to work rather than attend college after graduation. Two hypotheses were tested: (1) a high school curriculum that completely specializes in vocational education and ignores basic skills training will not be as effective as the one that provides both, and (2) for the non-college-bound student, vocational and academic education are complements rather than substitutes. This study used a subsample of the High School and Beyond data--students who graduated from high school in 1980 and did not attend college full time between June 1980 and February 1982. A preliminary analysis of the data was based on the cross tabulations of the three indicators of economic productivity--wage  rate, number of months employed between 1980 and 1982, and earnings in 1981--by the number of vocational and academic courses taken. These tabulations suggest that vocational and academic courses may be complementary. An econometric specification of the model based on this observation allowed estimation of the degree of complementarity and the degree of decreasing returns from vocational and academic course work. Results showed that taking additional vocational courses is associated with small cutbacks in academic courses taken, but substantially high wage rates, employment, and earnings in the 18 months following graduation. It was concluded that a modest level of vocational course work produced greater benefit than total academic specialization, but taking more than three or four  vocational courses sharply diminishes this benefit.

        "description":"Part I of this paper reviews research on effects of vocational course work on dropout rates, probabilities of employment, earnings, productivity, and basic skills. The review is organized around 10 questions. Answers to these questions include: (1) vocational education lowers dropout rates; (2) economic benefits are substantial; (3) economic benefits depend on getting a training-related job; (4) less than half of vocational graduates get training-related jobs; (5) occupationally specific skills are not used because of lack of emphasis on placement, insufficient employer involvement, and training for jobs not in demand; (6) basic skills cannot substitute for occupational skills; (7) obsolescence is less important than not using and forgetting skills; (8) studying occupationally  specific skills does not necessarily lower achievement in academic areas; (9) three or four courses in an occupational specialty are optimal; and (10) occupationally specific skills are best learned on the job. Part II presents recommendations for improving vocational education's contribution to successful labor market transition of disadvantaged youth. Recommendations include the following: (1) vocational teachers should take responsibility for and devote time to student placement; (2) well-informed career choice precedes entry into intensive occupational training; (3) basic skills should not be neglected; (4) training should be offered only in demand occupations; and (5) state aid should be allocated by a formula that rewards success in serving students.

Three outcomes--average quarterly wages, average number of quarters employed, and average wages during employed quarters--were studied for various categories of disadvantaged persons (economically disadvantaged youth, ex-offenders, and Vietnam-era veterans; handicapped persons who had completed rehabilitation; general assistance recipients; and Social Security Disability Insurance recipients). TJTC vouchering and certification were examined separately. More TJTC-vouchered and -certified individuals became employed, but their wages were relatively lower than in the comparison group. Of the targeted groups analyzed, only the handicapped group had  consistently positive impacts for both vouchering and certification. Certified individuals tended to have more turnover than did their noncertified counterparts. The econometric technique used to correct for selectivity in the vouchering study suggests that white males who are vouchered tend to be the least employable whereas &quot;creaming&quot; is evident for white females and nonwhites.

Data were collected from two databases and a set of case studies. Although most employers report having heard of TJTC, only a small number of firms were actually participating in the program. TJTC did not appear to change hiring practices, and employers systematically underestimated the expected productivity of TJTC-eligible persons and thus often incorrectly believed that they were lowering hiring standards by hiring these workers. Although most employers were surprised by how well TJTC-eligible workers performed on the job, they did not revise their opinions about the average productivity of these workers. The TJTC could be improved by increasing the  effectiveness of TJTC referral services, tightening eligibility determination, increasing funding for administration, and limiting eligibility to referrals by client-centered agencies. (Appendixes include a brief description of the first wave of the employer survey, the employer questionnaire, the Poisson model of TJTC participation, the case study interview form, and the TJTC questionnaire administered by the interviewer.)

The rate at which TJTC-eligible persons penetrated the labor market and the resultant displacement of persons not eligible were examined in terms of TJTC-related variables, personal characteristics, and state employment characteristics. It was discovered that although TJTC eligibility helped eligible youth find employment during the TJTC's initial years, this advantage has since vanished. The TJTC vouchering of disadvantaged youth did not appear to result in any labor market displacement of nondisadvantaged youth. In fact, the TJTC appeared to have the effect of creating jobs. The overall job creation effects of TJTC range from 200,000  to 300,000 additional jobs. However, most of the additional employment accrued to those not eligible. The vouchering employment creation effect among noneligible persons occurred for females, whereas the employment enhancement that occurs for eligible persons due to certification was stronger for males.

Data collected during a 1982 nationwide telephone survey of 3,500 employers were used as the basis for statistical models of voluntary and involuntary job separations and job promotions. Four major conclusions resulted from the modeling process developed. First, on-the-job training is negatively related to quits and employer-initiated separations and is positively related to promotions. Second, education does not seem to be related to employment separation but is positively related to promotion. Third, employment outcomes are more dependent on firm and job characteristics than on worker characteristics. Fourth, individual job search and employer recruitment and selection behavior  directs &quot;better&quot; workers (more human capital) into good jobs. These four conclusions produce a heuristic model according to which (1) hiring processes (consisting of individual job search and employer recruitment and selection processes) result in a sorting of workers into jobs and firms and (2) the training policies and characteristics of those jobs and firms tend to determine the outcomes of the employment relationships that are formed. Overall, the study findings seem to highlight supply-side interventions. (MN)",

        "description":"This report contains four studies related to preparation of youth for employment after leaving school. The first study, \"Learning as a Product of Exposure and Readiness\" (Hotchkiss), examined the effects of curriculum on the learning of basic skills using an interaction model. The data collected revealed statistically significant interactions among indicators of learning readiness and indicators of exposure, but the patterns of interaction did not conform to those predicted by the theoretical model. The second study, \"Supply and Demand Effects on Part-Time Work of High School Students\" (Hotchkiss), investigated the potential effects of a number of work variables on four work outcomes during high school: hours worked per week, wage, labor force participation, and unemployment. It  was found that wage is not the primary determinant of labor supply; rather, a set of attitudes used to reflect nonmonetary rewards of work influence hours and labor force participation. The third study, \"Impact of Curriculum on the Noncollege-bound Youths' Labor Market Outcomes\" (Kang, Bishop), focused on the effects of high school curriculum and performance on the post-high school employment experience of noncollege-bound youth. Taking additional vocational courses was strongly associated with success in the labor market immediately after high school, and the total amount of academic and vocational course work was moderately associated with greater labor market success. The fourth study, \"Time Profile of Youths' Labor Market Outcomes: An Analysis of High School and Beyond Data\" (Kang),  extended the third study by adding high school employment variables as predictors of post-high school employment. Work experience in high school, vocational education, and instruction in basic skills all improved students' post-high school earnings. A five-page reference list concludes the document. (MN)",

Section 2 focuses on the financial resources available to support the work of the committees and dislocated worker assistance services. They include federal/state funds, employer/union contractual funds, and funds for training and reemployment services that have been earmarked by many companies experiencing major reorganization. Section 3 presents a series of steps in a typical sequence for  formation of a committee. It recommends the accomplishment of several steps during each meeting, so that the entire process can be completed in three or four short meetings. Section 4 outlines the essential elements of a committee and the specific duties (roles and responsibilities) of the chair and members. The final section addresses the first steps in developing a program plan and identifying services. A resource and contact list is appended. (YLB)",

        "description":"The purpose of this guide is to provide local policymakers and program managers with an approach for using performance standards as a tool for reviewing and improving performance in Job Training Partnership Act programs at the local level. The guide is keyed to the Department of Labor adjustment methodology for activities beginning July 1, 1988. Section I discusses the evolution of performance standards and their supporting rationale. Section II details a systematic approach to obtaining comprehensive baseline data on local performance, an analysis of the performance of specific activities and contractors within the service delivery area (SDA), an analysis of performance trends, and a comparison with other SDAs. Section III describes two approaches for improving performance: the  Oversight Response, which identifies probable causes of poor performance, and the Planning Response, which provides tools to examine new strategies and approaches that will improve performance. Section IV summarizes the key issues related to planning and managing with performance standards. Sample reports, charts, and worksheets are provided as needed. Many of the reports and worksheets in the guide require routine, yet time-consuming, computations using local participant and financial data. A software option (not available here) is available for microcomputer users to speed up the analysis. (YLB)",

        "description":"A study examined the participation of handicapped individuals in apprenticeship programs. Data for this state-of-the-art review were gathered from an extensive review of the existing literature, interviews, mail and telephone surveys, site visitations, and structured meetings. It was found that the number of handicapped persons participating in apprenticeship represents less than 2 percent (and very probably less than 1 percent) of the total apprentice population. Education and rehabilitation professionals tend to relate the factors facilitating or acting as barriers to disabled persons' participation in apprenticeship to systemic features of the apprenticeship system. On the other hand, representatives of apprenticeship tend to see these same factors more in terms of the  characteristics of individuals and requirements of the trades. The information (both statistical and descriptive) available on handicapped persons' participation in apprenticeship is limited, anecdotal, and related primarily to special projects. Four successful apprentice programs including disabled persons were documented. A strong effort in public relations is needed to inform employers, union leaders, parents, and the general public of opportunities for handicapped persons in apprenticeship. Fifty references are cited. (Appendixes include lists of key federal and state agencies and national and international organizations concerned with apprenticeship and education and training for handicapped persons.) (MN)",

        "author":["Burfisher, Mary E."],
        "description":"United States exports may not necessarily increase when the dollar falls on the world market. Conventional thinking is that a weaker dollar means more demand for U.S. products because they become less expensive than goods from countries with stronger currencies. However, developing countries whose export revenues are denominated in the weakening dollar can lose income because the weaker dollars they earn on their exported goods buy less on the world market. When the dollar slumps, therefore, U.S. farm product sales to some developing countries may also drop. An analysis of the effects of changes in currency exchange rates from 1980 to early 1987 on the capacity of 14 developing countries to buy imports showed that 7 of the 14 have seen a deterioration in import-buying power  because of the dollar's drop since 1985. Four developing countries have shown modest improvements. The three top U.S. farm markets among the 14 developing countries--Korea, Taiwan, and Mexico--have not been affected by recent currency fluctuations. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"After nearly half a decade of low income and debt service problems, farm financial conditions began to improve in the mid-1980s. Higher livestock returns, lower production costs, rising land prices, increased lender stability, and fewer tax-driven incentives to borrow and invest are among the factors that eased farm financial stress in 1987. Real net income in 1987 was more than 75 percent higher than during the recession years from 1980 to 1983. Cash income of livestock farmers, who fared better than crop farmers, climbed about $9 billion between 1985 and 1987. However, 1 out of 10 commercial farms (those producing $40,000 or more in 1 year) still faced the risk of loan default going into 1988. Those most at risk are livestock farmers with high debt, cash grain farmers with  moderate debt, and cash grain farmers with low debt and crop failure. Although it is too early to assess the economic effects of the 1988 drought, it is apparent that agriculture's recent financial improvement will lessen its financial repercussions. In particular, cash flow and balance sheet gains that accrued in 1987 are providing farmers with more of a financial cushion than existed in 1985-1986. (MN)",

        "description":"Because of shifts in consumer tastes and preferences, demographics, technology, government regulation, and the expanding interdependence of world markets, the United States fruit and vegetable processing industries must operate in a constantly changing and uncertain economic environment. U.S. per capita use of processed fruits and vegetables is growing, thanks to improved distribution and availability, introduction of new product forms, better storage facilities, increased advertising and promotion, and increasing health consciousness among Americans. Increases in income will likely lead to increased purchases of fresh vegetables (versus processed) but will likely result in more use of processed fruit products. Changes in production have largely accompanied changes in consumer  demand, and the use of forward contracts to guarantee supply has further shifted control from the food production to the food processing subsector. Increasing consumer pressures have led to more strenuous enforcement of such government regulations as labeling laws, pesticide laws, and grading standards. The growing internationalization of the U.S. fruit and vegetable processing industries has increased the importance of uncertain macroeconomic and trade policies for these industries.

        "description":"The Food Security Act of 1985 authorizes the U.S. Department of Agriculture to issue generic certificates in lieu of cash payments due to program participants and merchants of agricultural products under provisions of several programs. The certificates may be used to acquire stocks held as collateral on government loans or owned by the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). These certificates offer producers and merchants advantages when they are exchanged for crops held under loan or owned by the CCC, and they have freed up stocks that might not have been marketed. Although the costs of using certificates likely exceeded the costs of issuing those payments in cash during fiscal 1987, generic certificate costs are projected to range between 93 and 99 percent of cash costs during  fiscal year 1989. As of March 31, 1988, about $17.9 billion worth of certificates had been issued, with about $1.7 billion worth having been redeemed as of May 31, 1988. Approximately 72 percent of the exchanges have been for corn, 20 percent for wheat, and the remainder for various other commodities held under loan or owned by the CCC. One concern that has been raised is that, by freeing up government-owned stocks, certificates may dampen prices and thus increase deficiency payments. (MW)",

Farming-dependent counties (where farming contributes at least 20 percent of the county's total earnings in 1980-84), offer limited nonfarm employment opportunities. These operators earn high farm incomes but face large debts. Declining land values have lowered their equity positions. Government payments provide a larger share of their incomes than for farms in other areas because these farmers specialize in producing crops included in farm commodity programs. Farms in counties not so dependent on agriculture are smaller, produce a greater quantity and variety of crops, rely less on farming for income, and have better equity positions. Average farmland values in these counties are higher  because farming competes with other business, residential, and recreational land uses. A change in government agricultural policy, especially in the direction of overall reduction in payments or direct payments to low-income farmers, would have a great negative impact on farm-dependent counties.

Some farm workers worked on the farm as their primary job, whereas others primarily worked off the farm. Farm work was an occasional form of employment for an additional group of workers, primarily students and homemakers who were unemployed or not in the labor force most of the year. Most agricultural work force households do not depend totally on farm work for income. Thus, farm income cannot be completely equated with household income. Farm workers primarily employed in farm work headed about 29 percent of all agricultural work force households. Over one-third of all farm  workers, or 5 million people, lived in these households, including almost half of all farm operators, 35 percent of all hired farm workers, and only 20 percent of all unpaid farm workers. Only 23 percent of those living in agricultural work force households actually lived on a farm.

Any effective regulations to ban or restrict agricultural chemical or land use practices in order to improve water quality will affect the farm economy. Some farmers will benefit; some will not. Most agricultural pollutants reach surface waterways in runoff; some leach through soil into ground water. Because surface water systems and ground water systems are interrelated, farm management practices need to focus on water quality in both systems. Modifying farm management practices may raise production costs in some areas. Farmers can reduce runoff losses by reducing input use, implementing soil conservation practices, and changing land use. Also at issue is who should pay  for improving water quality: farmers, governments, consumers, or those who benefit from improved water quality. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"This paper results from the collaborative work of Research for Better Schools, Inc., with the state staffs of Pennsylvania and Maryland on the problem of students at risk. It highlights the ways in which the problem is being defined, the data sets that are being used to suggest the magnitude of the problem, and the studies that are being used to suggest the interrelationships of various aspects of the problem. These three sets of definitions of students at risk are discussed: (1) students who are at risk of not achieving the goals of education in order to become productive members of American society; (2) students who exhibit behaviors that educators see as interfering with the educational process, including truancy, using drugs and alcohol, becoming pregnant, etc.; and (3)  students whose family or community background may place them at risk. Studies that suggest the interrelationship of families' characteristics, student behaviors, and school success are described, focusing on the National Assessment of Educational Progress and the High School and Beyond studies. The Maryland and Pennslvania approaches to the problem are described. The paper concludes that the decision to recast the problem of students at risk as questions directly related to the mission of schooling encourages state and local educational leaders to reexamine current program processes and structures of schools.

        "description":"Some educational practices have contributed to the apathy of students. These include a perceptual view of behavior, the view that self-worth equals achievement, norm-referenced evaluation, and success as ability and effort. Four strategies which have the potential for allowing students to experience success from reasonable levels of effort include: (1) individual goal-setting structures that allow students to define their own criteria for success; (2) outcome-based instruction and evaluation which make it possible for slower students to experience success without having to compete with faster students; (3) attribution retraining which can help apathetic students view failure as a lack of effort rather than a lack of ability; and (4) cooperative learning activities which help  students realize that personal effort can contribute to group as well as individual goals. Educators must confront the discrepancies between the actual and stated goals of education. Students have the power to choose how much effort to expend on any task. If the goal is to differentiate students according to their ability, then slower students will choose to reject school by avoiding effort. For those students who are forced to choose between rejecting schooling or rejecting their sense of self-worth, time is short. (ABL)",

Subjects included exchange participants (N=154) and non-participant control group members (N=112) who were nominated by the exchange group. The California Psychological Inventory was administered to both groups prior to the exchange, once again at its conclusion, and a third time 4 months later. Results showed that the exchange group increased in flexibility and independence and became less conventional as compared to the control group. Exchange participants who were the first member of their immediate family to travel abroad and those who personally paid a high percentage of their trip expenses experienced the most personality change.  Significant personality differences did not persist over time, although certain differences between exchange group antecedent subpopulations which were present at the time of the posttest persisted 4 months after the conclusion of the exchange. Other differences not apparent at the time of the posttest became discernible 4 months later. Certain personality changes associated with overseas experiences were immediately apparent while other changes became evident only after a period of time had passed. Some changes disappeared over time. (Author/ABL)",

The report is divided into three sections. The first section discusses the incidence of bullying in Norway, the United Kingdom, and Ireland. The second section discusses personal and background characteristics of both bullies and victims. Characteristics associated with bullies are identified, including parents' use of power-assertive disciplinary techniques, parents' marital problems, and children's temperament and popularity.  Characteristics associated with victims are identified, including smaller size than peers, lack of social skills likely to mitigate bullying, passivity, and ineffectiveness, although &quot;provocative&quot; victims did not share these characteristics. The third section on approaches to prevention and treatment includes discussions of strengthening the relationship between teacher and family, fostering an advantageous classroom group relationship, and treatment of the bullying situation. The appendices include the conference program, a list of participants, and outlines of papers on management strategies and disruptive behavior. (ABL)",

In contrast, few studies have focused on the attributions formulated by counselors regarding their clients' difficulties. Attributional approaches to counseling suggest that both client and counselor attributions can affect the course of counseling. This study investigated the relationships between counselor attributions for client presentations and counselor intervention choice. Intake counselors (N=15) were asked to formulate attributions for client presenting problems, and then to choose an ideal treatment intervention. Clients evaluated for the study were students (N=113) who presented for counseling at a large university counseling center. Results  suggest that the attributional dimensions of controllability, stability, and globality were related to intervention choice. These findings raise the question about the possible relationships between counselor and counselor attributions for client problems. A second issue concerns the counselor expectations that might be generated by the treatment assignment made for a client. (Author/ABL)",

The availability and accuracy of data on the magnitude of the problem in developed and developing countries is summarized. Difficulties in defining the problem of child abuse are discussed, noting that definitions vary between and within countries. The conference's definition of child abuse is stated: child abuse is defined as the intended or unintended act or omission by an  adult, society or country, which adversely affects a child's health, physical growth, or psychosocial development. Definitions of child neglect, passive child abuse, and child exploitation are also discussed. Explanatory models of child abuse are described, focusing on a multivariate approach within a sociopolitical setting. Primary and secondary prevention activities are discussed; the need for greater public awareness of the different forms of child abuse, and the extent to which it occurs in different social circumstances is highlighted. Five recommendations of the conference are stated. The conference program is included. (ABL)",

If coping strategies are inadequate, depression can result. Four categories of stress include time, anticipatory, situational, and encounter stress. It is important to recognize unsuccessful defense mechanisms employed by children to try to deal with anxiety-provoking situations. These include repression, regression, projection, displacement, reaction formation, rationalization, denial, and identification. It is the child's individual perception that sets the tone and amount of stress in response to a particular event. A variety of techniques have been proven effective in helping children deal with stress, including yoga, deep muscle relaxation, and  guided visual imagery. Adults should be aware of the stress in children's lives, and should assist in the development of positive coping strategems.

A computer-aided instruction program using microcomputers for alcohol education was developed entitled \"If You Drink: An Alcohol Education Program\" (IYD). The IYD program consists of five modules: the alcohol quiz, the breath analyzer, the teen test, the party, and alcohol and drugs. Two field studies analyzing the effectiveness of the program were conducted. In the first study 18 undergraduate students overwhelmingly agreed that the IYD program held their interest. In the second study, a display of the IYD program during alcohol awareness week was in use almost continually. The program produced small positive changes in attitudes  towards alcohol, but no negative changes. The program shows promise as an introduction to more extensive alcohol education efforts. (ABL)",

This study examined expectations about premarital residential independence among young adults. Data were obtained from 28,240 high school seniors who participated in the High School and Beyond study of the class of 1980. Students were asked at what age they expected to get married and at what age they expected to live in their own home or apartment. Those who gave an expected age at residence younger than an expected age at marriage were defined as expecting independent residence before marriage. The results revealed that approximately 70% of young adults surveyed expected to move out of their parental home before marriage,  suggesting that new norms are emerging which fit into patterns of independence in the transition to adulthood. There was substantial variation in factors affecting expectations about premarital residential independence. Young men more than young women, those with more parental resources, those who expected to marry at older ages, and those who did not have ethnic and religious ties that linked them to their parental home until marriage expected to live independently. Religious, racial, and ethnic differences interacted in complex ways with gender and socioeconomic status to influence expectations about premarital residential independence. (Author/NB)",

The study used three experimental schools and three control schools. Teachers in the three experimental schools were provided orientation, training, and supervision in the use of materials from the Building Self-Esteem Program. Annual evaluations were conducted in February using measures of general and academic self-esteem together with measures of the learning environment. The results showed that significant improvements could be achieved in the general climate of the school, in the manner in which adults related to children, in the behaviors displayed by the students, in the  quality of the interpersonal relationships among the staff, and in the level of student self-esteem. There was general agreement in all three experimental schools that there were more cooperation; less anti-social behavior; fewer students being referred for disciplinary action; less absenteeism; more students involved in school activities; more positive leadership; and more highly motivated students in the classroom. Teacher self-esteem proved to be a very important factor in the effort to build student self-esteem. Teachers in the experimental schools reported feeling more competent as teachers and gained more satisfaction through their teaching. (Author/NB)",

This study assessed the extent to which shyness was experienced by college students (N=1,120) in their daily lives and compared trends in such experiences across groups over a 9-year period. Each year from 1979 to 1987, with the exception of 1986, students completed a survey on shyness assessing their cognitive, affective, and situational reactions to the experiences of shyness in their daily lives. The results indicated that almost one-half of the students surveyed considered themselves to be shy. This pattern of results also seemed to remain stable over the 9-year period. Slightly over 55% of students indicated that shyness was a personal problem for them. Situations most  often associated with eliciting feelings of shyness included those involving strangers, authorities, and members of the opposite sex. The results suggest that shyness is a rather pervasive phenomenon that is considered problematic and undesirable by most individuals who consider themselves shy. Most shy respondents, however, believed that their shyness could be overcome and were willing to work seriously to overcome it. A number of treatment programs are available to help individuals overcome shyness, most of which are designed to improve the individual's interpersonal skills. (NB)",

Stability of gender stereotypes was found for many traits. However, between 1978 and 1986 there were increases in the ratings for women on masculine traits and in the number of masculine traits ascribed equally to women and men. These results reflect a more androgynous view of females in 1986 than in 1978, with this  view held somewhat more strongly by women than by men. There was no corresponding increase in the ascription of feminine traits to men, indicating fewer changes in perceptions of men than of women.

Delivery of mental health services to the rural elderly is described as a statewide priority in Iowa, with the need for such services enhanced by the current farm crisis. The project described relies on the cooperation and support of both public and private entities and integrates a variety of health, mental health, and human service agencies in the planning and delivery of services to elderly persons with mental illness, as well as appropriate referrals for those in need of medical and  social services. Five referral sources are identified and described: (1) psychosocial screening at local sites, such as congregate meals; (2) referrals through the county case management team and its associated agencies; (3) training of nontraditional referrals sources, known as Gatekeepers, such as rural mail carriers, to locate and refer high-risk elderly; (4) mental health outreach specialists who serve as liaisons between the elderly outreach program and elderly service agencies; and (5) contact with discharge planning departments of mental health and health care institutions.

The interpretation of interview validity data is shown to be hampered by the heterogeneity of constructs and measurement methods in the interview. It is noted that summaries of interview validity data are further complicated by the heterogeneity of occupations providing interview data. Despite these problems, the quantitative review draws several conclusions from the cumulated literature and details areas where knowledge is lacking. Conclusions are categorized as things known about the employment interview, things probably known about the employment interview, and things not known  about the employment interview.

        "description":"The assumption that the more able student can recognize a correct answer in a multiple choice situation more quickly than the less able student leads to the prediction that higher scores would be associated with shorter test-taking time. Research investigating this prediction have yielded mixed results, suggesting the need to examine other factors. This study evaluated the influence of Type A behavior on test-taking time and performance, predicting that Type As would complete examinations sooner than would Type Bs. At the beginning of the semester, 50 college students enrolled in an introductory psychology class completed the Jenkins Activity Survey for Health Predictions to determine their Type A (N=22) or Type B (N=28) classification. Test-taking time and performance measures  were collected throughout the semester. Personality type and gender served as between-subject factors; six tests taken during the semester served as the within-subjects factor. Data analysis yielded significance for the gender, tests, and gender x personality type factors. Females scored higher than males; scores of Type B females were significantly higher than scores of other groups, while scores of Type B males were significantly lower than scores of other groups. The results failed to yield any support for the prediction that Type As would complete examinations sooner than Type Bs. The findings suggest that test-taking time is not related to this personality dimension. (NB)",

        "description":"There is an ongoing debate as to whether alcoholism counselors who are non-alcoholics can be as effective with alcoholic clients as counselors who are themselves recovering from alcoholism. This study compared the impact of the recovering alcoholic counselor and the non-alcoholic counselor on alcoholic clients' perceived belongingness with treatment peers, as well as on length of stay in treatment and relapse rate in a residential treatment center. Two hundred chronic, recidivistic adult male alcoholics admitted to a 90-day all-male residential treatment program over a 4-year period were randomly assigned to one of four counselors: male alcoholic, female alcoholic, male non-alcoholic, or female non-alcoholic. Based on results of structured interviews conducted at 2-week intervals  during their stay, clients were categorized at the end of treatment into either the isolate, dyad, cluster, or variant grouping. Treatment outcome was measured by length of stay in the program and rate of relapse during the program. Counselor gender did not seem to be an important factor with respect to client-perceived emotional attachment, length of stay, or relapse rate. The results suggest that a counselor's recovering status does not seem to have any more impact on the clients' perception of belongingness among their peers or on length of stay or relapse rate than that of non-alcoholic counselors.

        "description":"This study examined how factors such as income, gender, and hierarchical level help to determine employee's level of attitudinal and behavioral commitment to their employers in the United States and Canada. Employers at 28 Canadian firms and 15 U.S. firms were asked to choose female respondents and match them with male respondents in positions of similar job complexity and responsibility. Subjects chosen were managers with supervisory, budget, hiring, and other such responsibilities. The final sample of 306 Canadian and 157 U.S. respondents completed the Organizational Commitment Questionnaire. While cross-cultural differences were found to be limited, intra-cultural differences in behavioral commitment were apparent between subgroups within the individual countries. Data  indicated that behavioral commitment based on gender differed in both countries, while income and hierarchical effects resulted in differences in behavioral commitment between groups only in Canada. The only significant difference between the countries was found in the respondents' level of behavioral commitment for high income earners. Since attitudinal commitment was apparently not affected by gender, income, hierarchical level, and inequality, it can be concluded that considering this dimension in studies of this type is pointless.

Cognitive variables can also be used to assess career success, career mobility, and career satisfaction. This study examined demographics, job properties, and personal attributes as well as the relationship between career strategies and career success. The sample was obtained from 14 major corporation located in metropolitan Los Angeles, California and employing more than 1,000 people locally. Personnel officers at the firms distributed questionnaires to managers who were supervising others and had both hiring and budget responsibility; had been identified by their organizations as talented; and were considered realistically likely to be promoted within the next 3  years. The final sample of 96 male and 98 female managers completed a career development questionnaire on demographics, job properties and personal attributes, career strategies, and success. The data revealed that demographics were the best predictor set when trying to explain a person's career success and mobility. None of the predictor sets explained career satisfaction. The usefulness of career strategies when studying career is brought into question by the weak relationship between career strategies, career success, and career mobility. (Author/NB)",

It defines at-risk students as young people who in danger of not completing school and notes that in Rhode Island over 25% of students who enter school fail to graduate from high school. It stresses the need for schools and communities to focus on the early identification and treatment of at-risk youth. Section I of the guide describes the role of the guide, which is to focus on ways schools can reduce the number of students who are at risk through timely interventions at an early grade, prevention programs that reduce the number of potentially at-risk students, and mobilization of community agencies in cooperation with the school district. Section II identifies characteristics  of the at-risk student under the headings of academic, school/social, home/social, and personal/social characteristics. Section III presents considerations for action, suggesting that schools examine school characteristics, review current practices, and learn about successful approaches in the area. Section IV addresses the question of what can be done to help at-risk youth at the elementary, middle school, and high school levels; and reviews specific academic, advocacy, and structural or support strategies that can provide a starting point for a school-designed approach to helping at-risk youth. Section V concentrates on local action, including how to devise and implement a local district or school plan. (NB)",

Chapter 1 reviews the literature and outlines the study rationale; chapter 2 describes sample characteristics; and chapter 3 outlines the methodology. Chapter 4 compares the adjustment scores of adolescents from divorcing and intact families, reporting no differences between groups. Chapter 5 examines happiness, conflict, and parent-child relationships in both groups. Chapter 6 examines divorcing families only. Chapter 7 reports no measurable differences  between the developmental levels of the adolescents from divorced families and those from intact families. Chapter 8 describes an independent measure of adolescent adjustment and maturity based on parents' appraisal of their children. In part 2 of the report, qualitative evidence is presented to illustrate and interpret statistical findings. Chapters 9 and 10 present case histories and chapter 11 draws together themes from the interview material, relating them to statistical results. In part 3, chapter 12 summarizes the results and suggests ways in which the findings may be used by parents and policymakers. Thirty-eight tables/figures and 93 references are provided.

Issues examined included the representation of minorities in the ADAMHA work force, especially at management and policymaking levels; numerical goals and timetables for hiring, promoting, and reassigning minorities; recruitment strategies and activities to increase the representation of minorities; the ADAMHA merit promotion plan; the representation of minorities and women on the ADAMHA grant review committees; and plans and actions concerning the preparation of ADAMHA's fiscal year 1988 affirmative action plan. Data were obtained from ADAMHA  and Public Health Service documents, and were discussed with responsible officials in the offices. Also discussed was ADAMHA's fiscal year 1988 affirmative action plan. An official in the Office of Federal Sector Programs in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) was contacted and pertinent directives issued to federal agencies were reviewed to obtain information on federal affirmative action planning for fiscal year 1988. The study found that ADAMHA was not in total compliance with EEOC affirmative action requirements and with some elements of the ADAMHA merit promotion plan. Recommendations to correct the deficiencies found were made to the Secretary of Health of Human Services. (NB)",

The investigation revealed that the grant was not effectively managed and many of the grant's objectives were not met. OJJDP's former Deputy Administrator was closely involved with the formation of the Partnership, federal funds were used to provide assistance for the Partnership's formation, and the grant award deviated from OJJDP's internal policy for awarding noncompetitive grants.

All motor vehicle thefts reported to the National Crime Survey from 1973 through 1985 were examined. Between 1973 and 1985, there were 12,338,000 motor vehicles thefts in the United States, and 7,097,000 attempted thefts. The number of motor vehicles stolen declined 33% during the 1973-1985 period, from 9 to 6 per 1,000 registered vehicles. Motor vehicle thefts, whether completed or attempted, most often took place at night; vehicles were most often parked near the victim's home, in noncommercial parking lots, or on the street. A household  member was present in about nine percent of all motor vehicle thefts, and in three percent the offender either threatened or physically attacked the victim. Stolen motor vehicles were recovered in 62% of the incidents. Almost 9 in 10 completed motor vehicle thefts were reported to the police. Blacks, Hispanics, households headed by persons under age 25, people living in multiple-dwelling units, residents of central cities, and low-income households were among those most likely to be victimized by motor vehicle theft. Those least likely to experience a motor vehicle theft included individuals age 55 and older, people who owned their own homes, and those living in rural areas. (NB)",

Data were obtained from the National Medical Care Expenditure Survey interviews conducted with 14,000 randomly selected households at 6 times over an 18-month period during 1977 and 1978. Data were analyzed to determine annual expenses for personal health services and mean health care expense per person by selected demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. The data showed that inpatient hospital and physician care consumed almost 60% of expenditures during 1977. Persons with expense spent $594 on the average for health services, with the  family and private insurance together assuming almost two-thirds of the cost. On an individual basis, females of all ages incurred a higher percentage of out-of-pocket expense than did males. Mean expense per person with personal health care expenditures was also higher than the $594 national average for blacks, for those with family incomes below $12,000, and for persons living in the Northeast and the West. Between 1970 and 1977, increases in health care expenditures after adjustment for health care price inflation were particularly noticeable for the population age 55 and older and for the inpatient component of services.

        "description":"All states have laws mandating that certain individuals report suspected occurrences of child abuse. Mandatory reporting statutes, their administration, and their judicial interpretation have created many ethical, legal, and clinical dilemmas. The abrogation of the confidentiality in the therapeutic relationship is probably the foremost ethical dilemma created by the mandated reporting statutes. There may be specific problems involved when reporting instances of sexual molestation. Reports of physical or sexual abuse which lead to judicial proceedings are less frequent today than in the past, but the potential social injury to the family is still enormous. Few studies have compared the number of reports made with the number of cases of actual physical or sexual abuse in a given  jurisdiction. There is no documented causal connection between mandatory reporting and a decrease in the amount of child abuse itself. In spite of the resulting ethical and clinical problems, mandatory reporting laws are valuable. What may be needed are revisions in the laws, a better and more uniform definition of what is reportable as suspected sexual abuse, uniform criteria to guide human services professionals in dealing with parents, and the establishment of minimal child welfare standards and decision-making guidelines. (A five-page bibliography is included. Tables list 20 reasons why human services professionals may avoid reporting sexual abuse and provide some guidelines for decision-making when reporting child sexual abuse.) (NB)",

This study examined college students' levels of self-esteem as a function of their own versus their parents' appraisals of parental nurturance and parental authority. Subjects were 128 college students and both of their parents. Students completed a global self-esteem scale, a mother's nurturance scale, a father's nurturance scale, a mother's Parental Authority Questionnaire (PAQ), a father's PAQ, and a demographic information sheet. Each parent completed a nurturance scale and a PAQ. The results revealed that both mother's and father's nurturance (as perceived by the students) were strongly related to self-esteem. Based upon  students' appraisals, parental authoritativeness was directly related to self-esteem while parental authoritarianism was inversely related to self-esteem. Students' assessments of parental nurturance and authority were more strongly related to self-esteem than were the parents' assessments of these variables. Results of regression analyses suggest that parental authority may be an important source of parental nurturance information. (Author/NB)",

Research has just begun to identify and analyze the health and mental health effects of sexual assault on victims, and studies are investigating the social and individual motivations of perpetrators. This document contains a colloquium lecture on the issue of sexual violence which looks at the victims of sexual assault and the offenders. It discusses social attitudes toward sexual assault, concluding that most sexual assaults are implicitly condoned by society. It considers the social functions of sexual violence, asserting that sexual assault is a socialized behavior and a means by which male supremacy is enforced and perpetuated. Strategies for resistance are  suggested, and the organized efforts of women in the last 10 years are noted as having changed rape laws in every state, created rape crisis centers in every major city, established the National Center for Prevention and Control of Rape, and ended secrecy and raised consciousness about rape. Several implications of sexual violence for women's psychological development are explored. A series of questions, answers, and highlights of a discussion session which followed the colloquium lecture are included in the paper. (Author/NB)",

Observers' ratings of videotaped spouse-to-spouse, parent-to-child, and child-to-parent behaviors during both dyadic and triadic problem-solving settings were obtained at three waves of data collection. The results revealed that, compared to mothers in nondivorced families, remarried mothers were significantly less positive, more negative, and less controlling in dyadic mother-child interactions even after 26 months of remarriage. In contrast, children of remarried mothers closely resembled children in nondivorced families in their behaviors  toward their mothers. Data on the stepfather-stepchild relationship showed little evidence that the stepfather adopted a more active and positive parental role over time. The positive and negative behaviors of stepfathers and stepchildren paralleled each other at all three waves of data collection. The hypothesis that interactions between nondivorced family members would be moe consistent than would interactions between remarried family members was partially supported. Children in newly forming stepfamilies experienced greater inconsistencies than did children in nondivorced families. Inconsistencies observed may be an index of continued role ambiguity even 2.5 years after remarriage. (NB)",

Relationships between the target child, who was between 9 and 13 years of age at the beginning of the 2.5 year study, and a target sibling within 5 years of the target child's age were assessed through interviews with the mother, father, and target child using an expanded version of Schaefer and Edgerton's Sibling Inventory of Behavior, and through behavioral observation of the sibling pair in a play situation, a family problem-solving situation, and at the dinner table.  The results revealed that, at least according to family members, boys in remarried families exhibited far more negative behavior and offered much less support to their siblings than any other group. Girls in remarried families did not appear to differ from girls in other family groups, and may have even offered increased support to their siblings over the course of the first year of adjustment to remarriage. Over time, observed interactions of siblings took on a more negative quality for children in remarried families. Some of these changes may have been reflective of developmental change in sibling relations as the children entered adolescence. (NB)",

Boys in remarried families exhibited high levels of problematic behavior throughout the course of the study, while girls in remarried families showed some improvement. Levels of competent behavior were highest for children from nondivorced homes, and lowest for children from remarried homes. Girls were viewed as more competent than boys throughout this age range.

        "description":"This research investigates the development of analogy, in particular, the study of the development of systematicity in analogy. Systematicity refers to the mapping of systems of mutually constraining relations, such as causal chains or chains of implication. A preference for systematic mappings is a central aspect of analogical processing in adults (Gentner, 1980, 1983). This research asks two questions: (1) does systematicity make analogical mapping easier; and (2) if so, when developmentally do children become able to utilize systematicity. Children aged 5-7 and 8-10 acted out stories with toy characters. Then they were asked to act out the same stories with new characters. Two variables were manipulated: systematicity, or the degree of explicit causal structure in the original  stories, and the transparency of the object-mappings. Transparency was manipulated by varying the similarity between the original characters and the corresponding new characters; it was included in order to vary the difficulty of the transfer task. If children can utilize systematicity, then their transfer accuracy should be greater for systematic stories. The results show (1) as expected, transparency strongly influenced transfer accuracy: for both age groups, transfer accuracy dropped sharply as the object correspondences became less transparent; (2) for the older group, there was also a strong effect of systematicity and an interaction between the two variables. Given a systematic story, nine-year-olds could transfer it accurately regardless of the transparency of the object  correspondences. (Author)",

Using a database developed for a previous study (Goodman and Goodman, 1978), this research examined pronoun usage in three basal texts by evaluating the miscue patterns of 24 second graders, 32 fourth graders, and 32 sixth graders. These students represented eight populations made up of four English dialect groups from Tennessee, Maine, Mississippi, and Hawaii, and four bilingual groups from Arizona (Navajo), Michigan (Arab), Texas (Spanish), and Hawaii (Samoan). Analysis of readers' miscue patterns indicated that they established pronoun referents in the personal texts they created as they  read. Results showed that pronouns were read without miscues over 90% of the time. Key findings included the following: (1) many text pronouns were read with few or no miscues, though others revealed identical substitutions by several subjects, indicating their shift to a different referent; (2) pronouns were substituted for other text words in rough proportion to their occurrence in the text; (3) readers tended to substitute pronouns with other pronouns from the same grammatical case, thus maintaining syntactic function and anticipating where pronouns would occur in noun positions; (4) non-pronoun substitutions occurred in few categories, indicating that readers expected pronouns in certain text positions; (5) determiners were frequently interchanged with possessives, indicating the  maintenance and possible intensification of cohesive relationships; (6) miscue patterns involving conjunctions and pronouns indicated the reader's manipulation of the surface structure using different options than the author.

        "description":"Using a large, preexisting miscue analysis database, a study explored the influence of specific text characteristics on reader/text interaction. Subjects--24 second, 32 fourth, and 32 sixth graders--read three texts. Four specific questions were addressed: What relevant miscue patterns do the readers of each text and of the combined three texts demonstrate? How do these patterns relate to syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic views of determiners' referential functions? What do these patterns show about how readers process the relational aspects of noun phrases? Are these patterns consistent with a transactional, psycholinguistically based theory of reading? The distribution and miscue patterns of the major determiners of English and the deictics &quot;this,&quot;&quot;that,&quot;&quot;these,&quot; and &quot;those&quot;  were examined, as were the following miscues regarding the occurrence of &quot;the&quot; and &quot;a/an&quot;: (1) articles for articles, (2) article/quantifier, (3) article/possessive, (4) article/deictic, (5) article/pronoun, (6) article/conjunction, (7) article/preposition, (8) omissions and a insertions, and (9) other. Overall, results indicated that the general functions of the determiners and their specific functions in particular text sequences strongly constrained miscues. In addition, miscue patterns revealed the readers' effective control of the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic rules for the use of determiners and how determiners relate to noun phrases.

In the first study, 461 third and fourth graders were pulled out of their reading classes for part or all of the reading period over a 12-week period and CIRC was implemented. In the second study, conducted over 24 weeks, 450 third and fourth graders were pulled out of their scheduled resource and remedial classes and CIRC was implemented at times other than normal language arts periods. Results of both investigations supported the effectiveness of CIRC on: (1) students' reading and writing achievement; (2) vocabulary; (3) the major components of reading proficiency--decoding, comprehension, and vocabulary; (4)  language expression measures, both on standardized tests and writing samples; and (5) informal reading inventories for partner reading and partner word practice activities. However, results differed with respect to mainstreamed learning disabled students. The effects on reading and spelling scores were not statistically significant in the first study, but the second study indicated substantial effects on reading vocabulary and comprehension. Moreover, the second study revealed substantial positive results of CIRC on reading comprehension, language mechanics, language expression, and oral reading, whereas the first study found no effects.

        "description":"To determine whether a comprehensive, cooperative learning approach can be used effectively in elementary reading and writing instruction, a study evaluated the Cooperative Integrated Reading and Composition (CIRC) program. Experimental subjects, 11 third- and fourth-grade CIRC classes, worked in heterogeneous learning teams for all reading, language arts, and writing activities over a 12-week period. The control group consisted of 10 regular third- and fourth-grade classes. Overall, results supported the effectiveness of the CIRC program on all target objectives except language mechanics and writing ideas. Findings ascribed the effects on (1) spelling to the partner spelling practice; (2) writing organization and language expression to the integrated language arts/writing  component; and (3) reading vocabulary and reading comprehension to basal-related activities such as the teaching of story grammars, partner reading, and mastery-oriented story comprehension practice. Thus, analyses showed that student achievement in reading and writing can be increased if state-of-the-art principles of classroom organization, motivation, and instruction are used in the context of a cooperative learning program. Results also indicated that standardized measures of skills such as reading comprehension and reading vocabulary can be affected by treatments that simultaneously address student motivation, classroom management, curriculum, and metacognitive activities.

Forty-seven students were divided according to treatment and were given the same pool of 125 paragraphs about geology and weather to read, and were given pretests and posttests. Treatments were as follows: (1) strategy training--tactics for identifying the topic and main idea of paragraphs, as well as metacognitive strategies for checking main idea hypotheses; (2) classification training--instruction and practice in classifying words, phrases, and sentences under appropriate topics; (3) a combination of classification and strategy training; and (4) practice only (control group). All instruction was carried  out via the computer. The results indicated significant effects of strategy training on the students' ability to identify the main idea in paragraphs about the training content and in paragraphs about new content. Classification training showed positive effects on paragraphs about the training content, but the effect did not transfer to new content. Results suggest that comprehension strategies and metacognitive strategies can effectively improve remedial readers' abilities to identify the main idea of expository paragraphs. (NKA)",

The population consisted of students who were mostly (at least 80%) native born, English dominant, and from bilingual speaking and most biliterate homes. Related pedagogical process variables were also analyzed. Findings, based on 164 ethnographic observations in the two schools included: (1) that reading of English and of the ethnic tongue occurred to a similar extent; (2) that reading in both languages occurred more frequently than other language activities; (3) that in many cases, both languages were used; (4) that oral reading strategies predominated;  and (5) that basal readers were the prevailing approach in both English and ethnic tongue reading. Exploratory analyses suggested that significant relationships do exist among reading and process variables and identified four independent dimensions of the initial reading acquisition process: English reading, class size, experiential approach, and grade level.

        "description":"Writing does more than demonstrate the interpretive process active in the mind of a student, it influences and directs the interpretive process in writing. Writing to read allows the expressive dimension to find an overt, secure place in the interpretive framework of a student's learning. By examining a student's theoretical explanation of her response to Andrea Lee's &quot;Sarah Phillips,&quot; a short novel about a young black woman growing up in the 1970s, this process is clearly revealed. The student's marginal comments, reflections, and drafts changed the way the student saw her own responses to the text by helping her to find the &quot;speculative instruments&quot; with which to name her developing interpretations. In this way, writing can transform reading by making it a conscious symbolic  process of discovering strategies and forms. As readers confront experience in texts, they exercise the primary act of mind by symbolizing it--writing illustrates and contributes to the transformational character of that symbolization. Standing alone, neither reading to write nor writing to read completes this creative process of interpretation. Teachers should nurture the interconnectedness of reading and writing with their responses to students' works, illustrating and modeling this symbiosis with responses focusing on interpretation rather than structure.

The premise investigated was that memory for the central facts of a passage will be enhanced by the presence of related information as theorized in the encoding elaboration model (developed by Anderson and Reder in 1979). This model states that comprehension and memorability are dependent on the process of elaboration that takes place during reading. Subjects, 64 sixth grade students from three classes at one elementary school, participated in two experimental sessions and were instructed to read to remember (the selection was about Abraham Lincoln), and be able to write the information contained in the passage. The reading-study session lasted for 20 minutes. Then the passage was collected  and the subjects were instructed to write everything they could remember. The recall session lasted 15 minutes. Three days later, in an unannounced session, the subjects were asked to recall everything they had learned from the passage and write everything they could remember. The subjects were given 20 minutes to write. The immediate and delayed recalls were scored for the presence or absence of the 18 central facts. The results fulfilled the expectations of the model and indicated a strong support for the hypothesis that memory for the central facts of a passage is enhanced by the presence of related information. Examination of the immediate and delayed mean recall levels showed a reduced attrition rate for central facts supported by details compared to unsupported central facts.

        "description":"The problems of validity and fairness involved in multiple-choice critical thinking tests can be lessened by using verbal reports of examinees' thinking during the process of developing such tests in order to retain only those items which rely on critical thinking skills to obtain the correct answer. Multiple-choice testing can lead to unfair treatment of students, but disqualifying these tests can result in less powerful assessments of critical thinking. Differences in background beliefs can lead to invalid and unfair assessments of critical thinking ability using these tests. A methodology to lessen these problems was developed using high school students taking trial versions of exams and thinking aloud as they took the test. The examinees' verbal reports were analyzed for  critical thinking skills and assigned a numerical score. A high correlation between critical thinking scores and performance scores represents a high correspondence between thinking critically and choosing the correct answer. Items with a low correlation were revised. Although only a brief sketch of this methodology could be presented in this paper, the relevance of verbal reports of thinking to test construction has been suggested by several testing specialists. Using verbal reports may be time consuming, but the ideal of critical thinking is worth the effort. Otherwise, only the worn-out and educationally indefensible emphasis on memorization of factual information, rote recall, and pat answers is left. (Twenty-eight references are appended.) (RS)",

        "description":"A study examined whether the process of gathering verbal reports of subjects' thinking while taking multiple-choice critical thinking tests could be used to infer the reasoning process used and identify test items which do not require critical thinking skills. Four factors can render an inference of a subject's critical thinking skills untrustworthy: (1) the degree of informal reasoning sophistication of the subject; (2) the background empirical beliefs of the subject; (3) the assumptions which the subject brings to test items; and (4) the political and religious ideologies of the subject. Subjects, 343 senior high school students from four high schools, were divided into five groups for taking a multiple choice test. One group took the test in the normal manner while the other  four groups gave verbal reports of their thinking for each question. Examiners asked subjects in these four groups leading questions to investigate whether the thinking processes of the subjects would be altered. Subjects were given a performance score equal to the number of correct answers and a &quot;thinking score&quot; which indicated the quality of thinking displayed in the verbal reports. Results indicated that there were no statistically significant differences in the performance scores of the five groups nor in the thinking scores of the four groups that used verbal reports.

        "description":"Neuropsychological research can provide a basis for learning how to interpret test data to help solve the problem of how to teach children who fail to read. Insights from brain research can be joined with diagnostic efforts and cognitive, language-based models of reading processes in order to move toward individual assessment and away from &quot;group&quot; or &quot;subtype&quot; classifications. Individual case studies are a promising research strategy for researchers and practitioners who attempt to blend neuropsychology with efforts in remedial reading, but additional research methodologies using advanced psychological measures that link psychological behaviors to organic brain functioning need to be employed as well. A case study demonstrated the dependence of diagnostic processes, remedial  strategies, and the outcome on a reading specialist's understanding of how the brain contributes to reading and how this knowledge can be used in remediation. A remedial reading program was designed for the subject of the case study, a third-grader reading at the 1.5 grade level, based on his performance on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R) and various qualitative neuropsychological measures. The subject's reading level increased almost 3 years in 3 months of intervention, and his reading fluency and confidence increased. (Two figures are included and 36 references are attached.) (RS)",

        "description":"Project Literacy United States (PLUS) is a national service project initiated in December 1985 with the key goals of mobilizing and organizing community resources to deal with illiteracy on a local level and to raise awareness of the widespread illiteracy problem. Using concepts from the Navy's intensive reading immersion program, Memphis-Project Literacy's Westside High School intensive reading immersion program demonstrated that community partnerships can be established and mobilized to improve the basic skills of its young adults while enhancing the quality of their lives. The program incorporated special instructional techniques innovations, and incentives to increase the motivation and achievement of &quot;at risk&quot; youth. The program included an eye exam and hearing test; meals;  group affiliation activities; communication with and participation of parents/guardians; business and community organization involvement; prompt feedback on student performance; and well-qualified and caring teachers. The Memphis-PLUS program was successful in: (1) raising student reading grade level; (2) providing a quality educational experience within school premises which helped to develop the student's individual potential while teaching self-discipline and perseverance; (3) creating an atmosphere of positive interpersonal relationships; (4) contributing significantly to each student's mental, emotional, and physical well-being; (5) demonstrating the success of a partnership approach uniting school, home, and community; (6) communicating to the community the needs of &quot;at-risk&quot;  adolescents; and (7) providing cultural opportunities for the students.

Educators automatically tend to assume that all religious objections to curricula are clear-cut attempts at censorship. This confrontational attitude on the part of educators can lead to alienation of minority religious groups, resulting in a weakening of the public schools. While the actual judicial decisions in the latest series of textbook controversies failed to support Evangelical thinking, the end result of Evangelical legal activism may have been more positive for their viewpoints, alerting educators, school boards, and textbook publishers to the needs and opinions of a newly vocal and politically active minority. Important aspects of the Evangelical  position have received support from a variety of nonevangelical sources. (Twenty-five references are attached.) (SR)",

Research indicates that children should learn phonics early, that children should be taught only the most important and regular of letter-to-sound relationships, and that children should read words within texts very early in their reading program. Research also tends to favor explicit phonics over implicit phonics, but little evidence of well designed phonics programs has been found. Current research projects include studies on: (1) formulating guidelines for phonics instruction; (2) evaluating existing reading programs; (3) conducting classroom experiments on phonics; (4) developing a model phonics program; and (5) developing and  evaluating a phonics program for reading-disabled children.

The report seeks to improve understanding of what students need to know to employ language as a tool for problem-solving and communication, and how states and local school districts might measure whether or not their students are reaching such a level of critical literacy. First the report sketches a vision of literacy for future generations that is tied not to the printed page, but rather to a formal style of language that depends on structures, procedures, and strategies  for effective use of language in thinking and communicating. Next, an approach is presented for achieving this level of critical literacy. Finally, the report (1) recommends that the professional judgments of classroom teachers be used to enhance more traditional, and often incomplete or misleading, assessments of student literacy; and (2) considers barriers to and benefits of the proposal to incorporate teacher judgments in the indicator system. Ten figures and one table of data are included, and 66 references are attached. (MS)",

        "description":"Two trends have emerged in recent years in the diagnosis of remedial readers, which--when applied with caution--may be of reasonable value to the clinician and the teacher. One of these trends has been the promotion of informal assessments, and an accompanying plethora of commercial informal reading inventories (IRIs). These instruments are designed to replace any that might be made by the teachers and clinicians who use them, and thus they should be examined carefully and customized to minimize their significant limitations. IRIs are often used to place readers in materials of appropriate difficulty. Some reports in the ERIC database suggest it is harmful to place children in unnecessarily low reading groups; others show that many experienced teachers identify materials that  will insure success for the remedial reader. Another trend is the use of computerized diagnosis of a reader. While such information would be useful as a part of data collection, it should not be a major factor in placement and instructional decisions, which require precise individual assessments. (SR)",

        "description":"The role of literacy in the revitalization of societies is particularly meaningful in the context of the Southern African Development Coordination Conference (SADCC), a group of nine countries (Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe) surrounding or surrounded by the Republic of South Africa (RSA). This region is approaching a &quot;moment of disjunction&quot;--a historical moment when an existing mythologic and the accompanying social order die and a new mythologic and social order emerge. The existing social order of apartheid in the RSA must be reconstituted. Several strategies are required to implement that change--diplomatic, economic, military, and cultural. The objectives of the cultural strategy should be to create both nationalism  and Pan-Africanism, objectives which can only be met with universal literacy. At the societal level, universal literacy will increase the possibility of modernization and democratization. Furthermore, once individual societies are revitalized through universal literacy, a genuine Pan-Africanism could emerge--not merely of the bureaucratic elite but of all the people. Multiple literacies should be taught to African adults: literacy in the mother tongue; literacy in the regional lingua franca; and literacy in a metropolitan language. The universalization of literacy will hasten the destruction of apartheid and help to create a society which can live together in harmony. (MM)",

A study reexamined the reading rate issue in light of additional information regarding the test-taking experience provided directly by the test takers themselves. The purpose of the study was to determine the effects of two reading rate measurement techniques on rate and comprehension of college readers and to obtain feedback from the readers concerning the two techniques. Subjects, 173 freshman level reading and study skills students at a large southeastern university, completed two rate measurement techniques, a time-limit procedure and a passage-completion procedure, and were asked for their opinions on which exercise they  felt provided a better measure of their reading rate and should be used in tests measuring reading rate. Responses indicated a greater preference for the passage-completion rate measurement techniques and that students felt it gave a better measure of actual reading rater performance, and recommended it for testing.

        "description":"A study proposed a sequenced process for inferring word meaning from context in order to investigate experimentally where, within the process, differences between learners of varying skill occur, and to discover the kinds of information students need in order to acquire vocabulary most effectively. Six five-step tasks, each designed around an artificial word, were administered individually to 30 urban fifth graders, 15 with high vocabulary ability and 15 with low. These tasks were at the level of contexts typically encountered in school reading, thereby yielding a realistic picture of where difficulties in processing ordinarily occur. Scores obtained from each step of the task each represented an aspect of the meaning acquisition process: selection of constraints from context;  testing a meaning choice within constraints; use of two contexts to constrain meaning choices; evaluation of a meaning choice given the use of two contexts; use of additional contexts to refine word meaning; identification of word meaning given contexts that contain direct meaning clues; and discrimination between sentences that use and those that misuse the newly learned words. Findings indicated that the low ability group misunderstood the relationship between word and context; that both groups demonstrated a semantic interference when considering two contexts simultaneously; and that the process is a complex one. Teacher modeling of important concepts and strategies may be well-suited to improve children's context skills. (Twenty-eight references are attached.) (SR)",

Students who wrote essays scored lower on immediate topic knowledge posttests, while the students who used study methods other than essay writing had the greatest gains on the immediate posttest, but also the greatest falling off at the 4-week posttest. The second study focused on the relationship between what writers do during different writing tasks and recall. Ninth and eleventh graders (N=110) read two passages from the first study and engaged in four writing-to-study tasks. Findings indicated that the writing conditions led to greater recall  of content than the non-writing condition, and that the more the content was manipulated during writing, the better it was recalled. Together, both studies indicate that tasks such as question answering and notetaking involve a superficial manipulation of content and lead to extensive but short-lived learning, while the analytic writing tasks involve a greater depth of processing and lead to longer term learning of a smaller band of information.

Observations common to all of the studies are discussed under the following categories: (1) common features, such as the limitations created by the physical set-up of the labs and teachers' general satisfaction with the software; (2) younger versus older students, with younger students exhibiting the least facility with the keyboard and various machine functions while older students are able to take advantage  of more of the functions offered by word processing; (3) regular classrooms versus labs, where computers in the regular classroom may create a physically congested environment and require a longer initial start-up time than would a lab situation; and (4) special education, specifically how WP can benefit students in this setting. Generally, the studies indicated that the type and/or degree of success students attain using WP is governed by the context in which it is used. The most important contextual variables identified in the studies were age, equipment availability, and location. (Lists of software publishers and related reading are appended.) (JD)",

        "description":"Based on the thesis that cycles of concern for an integrated, holistic approach to English language instruction have periodically emerged in reaction to historical forces that are essentially fragmenting in their effects, this thematic report explores events in 20th-century American educational theory, research, and practice that deal with English language education. Two fundamental and enduring facts about English education in the schools which the report examines are the subordination of writing to reading and the other language skills and the separation of language skills from one another--particularly the isolation of reading from writing. Using perspectives drawn from American educational and social history, the report identifies five forces--the democratization of  schooling, the professionalization of educators, technological change, the pragmatic character of American culture, and liberationist ideologies--and probes their analytically separable but interacting influences on English language education. Following a summary of the evidence of the assertions that writing has been dominated by reading in schools and that writing and reading have been separated for most of their histories, the report provides illustrations of the prevailing opinion that integration in language education is the proper approach, giving rise to cycles of reform aimed at such integration. It then gives an overview of the 19th century emergence of English as an identifiable subject of the school curriculum, and addresses the ways in which the forces cited promoted both  separation and integration of the teaching of writing and reading.

        "description":"Both writers and readers experience auditory imagery of intonations, accents, and hesitations in written language, and some aspects of this &quot;written language prosody&quot; are made partially overt through punctuation. Two studies explored the relationship between written language prosody and punctuation. The first study asked people to read aloud and the second study asked them to repunctuate (insert punctuation marks in passages from which punctuation had been removed) written passages. Subjects for both studies were a group of college students and a group of adult education students. Analysis of the reading aloud task revealed that subjects who read aloud nearly always produced intonation units whose length lay within the normal range for ordinary spoken language. Further, the  degree to which their segmentations matched the punctuation of a piece of writing provided an index of the degree to which that writing prosodically resembles speech. Findings of the repunctuation task indicated that those subjects came closer than oral readers to matching the punctuation of the original authors. This suggests that because writers and silent readers are able to process large chunks of information at a time and written language provides syntactic as well as punctuational clues to prosodic boundaries, original authors and repunctuators produce longer intonation units than do oral readers. Differences between open and closed punctuation styles and grammatical sites where people tend to insert or delete punctuation contrary to arbitrary &quot;rules&quot; may also be analyzed in light  of these findings.

According to H. P. Grice, there are two kinds of meaning: the semantic, abstract one, and the one intended by the speaker which must be recognized by the receiver of the message. Heath's research, carried out in two communities in the Carolinas, one black and one white, revealed: that an understanding of students' backgrounds can help them to be reached; and that a cultural heritage can be  translated into the terms of a school's standards rather than being completely eradicated. At the college level, problems arise not only from the cultural differences of a heterogeneous student populace, but also from different conceptions of the function, the usage, and the beauty of language. When teachers of writing try to make students write correctly, the teacher may change a whole complex of beliefs, values and habits of mind, perhaps affecting profoundly the students' sense of identity. A better method might be to let the teacher be taught to a certain extent, to accept as much as to offer, to educate better writers by becoming a more receptive reader. (RAE)",

        "author":["Miranda, Patricia"],
        "description":"In 1985 the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled that a Costa Rican statute requiring journalists to be licensed violates the American Convention on Human Rights and, by extension, all human rights conventions. Though press freedom advocates hailed it as a major triumph for freedom of expression, the court's ruling was only advisory and has not stopped Costa Rica or other Latin American countries from maintaining such licensing laws. Debate over the licensing of journalists continues, however. The Inter-American Press Association has called upon the legislatures of signatory countries of the Inter-American Convention of Human Rights to repeal their licensing laws in light of the Inter-American Court's decision. While opponents do not dispute the fact that the &quot;colegios&quot;  (professional associations which journalists are required to join) can promote the betterment of the journalism profession, they do object to the compulsory nature of the membership. Despite the stated motive of protection of journalists and of the public, such laws constitute a prior restraint, preventing journalists from exercising their right to freedom of expression and limiting the right of the public to receive information and ideas.

In order to ascertain current beliefs and practices of conferencing in the composition classroom, a study surveyed 100 full-time instructors of writing at 11 different colleges, examining: (1) attitudes teachers have regarding the effectiveness of their current approach in teaching writing; (2) student attentiveness; (3) attitudes to the writing conference; (4) amount of class or out-of-class time devoted to the conference; (5) the effectiveness of such a conference; (6) the reasons instructors have for initiating  such a conference; (7) favored locations for conducting a conference; and (8) the questions most frequently asked by instructors during a writing conference. In general, results indicated that while most teachers believe conferencing with students is more valuable than providing written comments on essays, and have conferences several times a term, almost none use it as a primary method of instruction. Reasons for this include lack of time, uncertainty about how to integrate conferences into their classrooms, and satisfaction with current methods used. (SR)",

(2) Do graduate student teachers bring to their teaching a perspective which is different from that of the faculty and therefore valuable? and (3) How might graduate student teachers view their political position and their role as teachers if there were such a community of support? Although traditional modes of training such as preservice orientations and class visits by faculty are helpful, the addition of peer support in the form of class visits by peers, peer mentors,  and peer involvement in writing program decisions could help immeasurably in creating communities where graduate students know that their work is creative, important, and rewarding. Peer involvement in training programs can provide a valuable and meaningful addition to an already successful program. (MHC)",

A study observed eight primary-grade students over a 2-year period and focused on the interrelationships between children's creation of written text worlds and their use of or response to forces outside those worlds but within the situation context of the classroom. The children, from a language arts class, were first observed and then descriptive data, audiotapes of the children's talk, photocopies of their drawn and written products, and notes on observed behaviors, was compiled. Findings showed (1) the observed children's text worlds were, as a group, gradually less governed  by drawing and any accompanying talk: the group moved from a tendency to comment on pictures, to a tendency to observe scenes, and finally to act within dynamic worlds; and (2) their composing behaviors suggested that their use of writing became progressively more involved with their ongoing social and their wider experienced worlds: the children specifically shared and discussed their written messages and the relationship of those messages to the wider world rather than only to their pictures.

        "description":"If teachers are to help students develop higher-order reading, thinking, and writing skills, then researchers must begin by articulating the ways of knowing that are central to particular domains. A study was elaborated to provide initial information about the ways in which people talk about &quot;knowing&quot; in academic subjects as they appear in the scholarly literature, in the pedagogical literature, and in teachers' understandings of what counts as knowing in their classrooms. The first part of the study is an extensive literature review. In the second part of the study, subjects, 48 biology, American history, and American literature high school and college teachers, completed background questionnaires and two hour-long interviews. The interviews focused on the teachers' general  conceptions of teaching and learning and the goals of instruction in a unit of study from a current course in their discipline. Results indicated that the teachers favored a relatively traditional approach to instruction, with lectures and teacher-led discussion playing the dominant role, and with student centered activities appearing less frequently. These results parallel other research in suggesting that classroom emphasis tends to be on specific content at the expense of the rules of argument and evidence unique to each discipline.

The increases for almost all nuclear weapons indicate the Administration of the United States saw its major responsibility as one of providing a strong military, one centered on the development and deployment of nuclear weapons. Children today must live with the knowledge that at any instant the entire human race might be annihilated. Authors have been including this topic among the subjects dealt with in children's literature, such as Dr. Seuss's \"The Butter Battle Book.\" Other picture books that can be read as allegories of the current arms race are \"Drummer Hoff\" by Barbara and Ed Emberley, Louis Armstrong's\"How to Turn War into Peace,\" and Toshi Maruki's \"Hiroshima's Flash.\" Judy Blume's book, \"Tiger Eyes,\" offers a subtle statement on the frightening reality of the arms race and the delicate balance between world peace and world obliteration. Older children will find John Hersey's \"Hiroshima\" and Masuji Ibuse's \"Black Rain,\" which recount the actual bombing of Hiroshima and its after effects, presenting blunt and detailed descriptions. There are also a number of books available which are intended to help parents introduce to their children and explore with them the realities of nuclear war--books which expose children to these realities without plunging them into a state of despair, but rather show them positive activities to help prevent the negative possibilities.

The slogan of every writing across the curriculum program should be that grammar changes from discipline to discipline. These variations occur at every level of text structure, from syntax through global discourse structure, and they occur in ways that are miscellaneous and unpredictable. The dominant grammatical feature of student-produced texts is that these texts make points, but where and how points can be made, and even what counts as a point worth making, changes from  discipline to discipline. The metaphors that are commonly used to describe learning are linear and based on natural development and growth. Better metaphors are ones involving an &quot;outsider&quot; trying to get into an &quot;interpretive&quot; community. If new students are thought of as novices and if the goal of writing instruction is to make them socialized members of a community of knowers, learners, and teacher, then a better understanding can be had of teaching the social activity that is called writing. If writing is best learned in the disciplines, then maybe it is there that all writing teachers ought to be. (Eleven references are attached.) (RS)",

Activities in the second section are designed to stimulate an appreciation and understanding of literature. Specific activities in this section can be used to help students understand the distinction between plot and  theme, focus their responses to a reading, link their own experiences to those of a protagonist, write poems in the voice of a particular character, understand and write character sketches, learn about Greek myths and monsters, and plan and carry out classroom protests. Activities in the third section, intended to help students improve the conception and clarity of their prose through prewriting and writing, include student self-evaluation and goal-setting, describing favorite assignments in a letter to parents, writing about world events that have touched their lives, and keeping track of multiple plot lines as they write their own interactive books.

The application of the principles of critical literacy, as outlined by Paulo Freire, may provide some assistance. In this course learners are asked to address problems in their environment and correct them through audience-intensive, purposeful writing assignments. Problems encountered in teaching such a course to First World learners include: (1) the difficulty American learners have in imagining oppression and seeing it in their own surroundings; (2) self-development as a component of self-empowerment; and (3) the principles of turning the classroom over to the learners themselves. Writers and teachers must come to view their work  as an act of soul, a meeting of the inner and outer psychological worlds. In this way teaching and writing are both political acts and acts of psychic growth. (RAE)",

Chapter 1 explains the background and purpose of the document; the research done prior to the construction of the new curriculum is reviewed in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 examines English curricula at four other Michigan high schools. Chapter 4 describes the adopted General English curriculum and the reasoning that went into its formulation, stating four criteria to be met: (1) the curriculum must be appropriate for students of high and low skill levels; (2) it must allow for students transferring  to the college-bound program part-way through high school; (3) it must place great emphasis on motivation; and (4) it must include types of language skills useful and needed in everyday adult life. Four areas of concentration are identified for each year of high school, drawn from grammar and mechanics, literature and reading, composition, life skills, and media study. Chapter 5 outlines goals and objectives for each grade level of General English. Suggestions for research and a summary are contained in Chapter 6.

A survey of 19 colleges and universities in New York revealed that institutions with a majority of students scoring above 500 on the verbal SAT prefer to use literature in freshman composition, while those whose students on average score below 500 prefer other approaches, generally emphasizing basic writing skills. Only two of the respondents indicated that the use of literature in freshman composition was controversial. Although findings suggest that college composition could become central to the production of graduates who  can not only read and write but also know something about the world, focusing on literature as a vehicle for composition misses the fact that using literature in this way is not always appropriate. An opportunity exists for college composition courses to develop writing and reading skills while offering a unique overview of the realities of the world-at-large, a truly across-the-curriculum notion.

The assignment involved two masterpieces of American rhetoric; Nicholas Street's &quot;The American States Acting Over the Part of the Children of Israel in the Wilderness and Thereby Impeding Their Entrance into Canaan's Rest,&quot; written in 1777, and Henry Ward Beecher's &quot;The Battle Set in Array,&quot; written in 1861, just days after the bombing of Fort Sumter. Rhetorically these two examples of words that worked, are carried out by the preachers' use of the Exodus theme of the Old Testament.  The preachers succeeded in their task through an artful mixing of Biblical language with the language of their times. Subjects, freshman composition students, were asked to do a number of writings based on these two sermons. Their main assignment was to write a paper detailing and evaluating how one of these two preachers drew analogies back to the Exodus theme and the likely success such an analogy would have in impelling congregants to political action. Results showed that students tended to use half-borrowings of words, overuse quotations and quotation marks, and waver in point of view. (RAE)",

        "description":"Observing the composing processes of students working over real time in naturalistic settings, two exploratory studies asked: (1) What skills and assumptions do freshman and advanced writers invoke when they are searching for information to be used in writing? (2) What strategies and goals do students bring to a typical writing-from-sources task like the research paper? and (3) How do particular classroom contexts influence student performance? The research paper was used as a vehicle. The first study observed the way eight freshman and eight advanced writers planned and searched for information, revealing two differing purposes: content-driven (a fact-finding mission) and issue-driven (arguing for a position). The second study examined how students perform the many tasks  involved in writing research papers. Eight students at Carnegie-Mellon University, randomly selected from courses requiring research papers, kept a daily process log of all paper-related activities from the time they received the writing assignment to the time they finished writing. The resulting material (over 500 pages) revealed two strategies in use. Low-investment strategies centered around the rote reproduction of other authors' ideas for the teacher-as-examiner. High-investment strategies centered around the transformation of source material to produce original conclusions. The teacher's role in influencing these strategies was a powerful one: high-investment writing was fostered by providing intermediate feedback, focusing on high level goals, providing an audience other than the  teacher, and getting writers started early.

Television commercials such as the one quoted in the title use a common rhetorical method: present an ideal state; imply that the viewer has not attained this state; offer a magical object which will connect the viewer with the desired state; and tell the viewer how to evoke that magic. This same structure is often used in sermons, and in both cases, emphasis is placed on the importance of the mediator and the powerlessness of the listener. By using beautiful, idealized images that have no connection with the product being sold, commercials lead viewers to aspire to high ideals but provide them with means that will surely fail in the quest to attain those ideals. This may  result in alienating people from the very values being exploited in the commercials, laying the groundwork for despair, hatred, resentment and apathy.

        "description":"During the mid-nineteenth century, merchants in Cincinnati (Ohio) gained access to the latest telegraphic news through the Merchants' Exchange, which became a vital link in a communications network that served as the nervous system of the nation's economy. The Cincinnati Merchants' Exchange was founded in 1843 by the Young Men's Mercantile Library Association in order to have a meeting place for the members of the library, and to create a merchants' exchange similar to those operating in other urban areas. On August 20, 1847, the first telegraph line to Cincinnati terminated in the College Building where the Merchants' Exchange was housed. After the telegraph reduced the risk in farm commodities trade which relied on a system of commission merchants, western cities became the  points at which final sales were made and Cincinnati was a major point for such transactions. The telephone and the ticker produced a second revolution in business practices which decentralized business communications and in the process undermined the exchange. The exchange was a transitional market institution that for a time helped meet the commercial-information needs of the city, but was not destined to become a specialized exchange with futures trading like the Chicago Board of Trade. And its life, as well as its death, was largely dictated by communications technology. (Seventy-one notes are attached.) (RAE)",

Average age was 27.5 years, and average length of stay in the United States was 2 years 9 months. Subjects completed questionnaires assessing four aspects of intercultural communication competence: personal attributes (self-disclosure, self-awareness, and social relaxation); communication skills (message and social skills, flexibility, and interaction management); psychological adaptation (frustration, stress, alienation, and ambiguity); and cultural awareness (social values, customs, norms, and systems).  After completing the questionnaire, subjects were asked to suggest two American friends, roommates, instructors, or other persons who knew them well. This group of &quot;raters&quot; evaluated the international students' levels of intercultural communication competence by completing Intercultural Behavioral Assessment Indices (composed of display of respect, interaction posture, orientation to knowledge, empathy, relational role behavior, interaction management, and tolerance of ambiguity measures). Booklets were returned for 129 of the subjects. Results revealed significant correlations among measures of personal attributes, communication skills, psychological adaptation, and cultural awareness. Also, the linear combination of the dimension of Intercultural Behavioral Assessment Indices was  positively and significantly related to the linear combination of personal attributes, communication skills, psychological adaptation, and cultural awareness dimensions.

Evaluations that have the potential for generating a quality education combine some form of student rating on a form developed at least in part by the instructor, given at a point in the semester where it will have the greatest benefit, tied to the confidentiality of the results, and coupled with significant input from professionals and colleagues. All players in this game have rights, needs, and  responsibilities. In any communication environment, feedback is essential; for the communication to continue, the feedback process must be mutual.

        "description":"At the present time the social sciences implicitly or explicitly start from a normative vision which has a dialectical objective: a reasoning that is at once theoretical and practical, or that is both a political and a scientific discourse. A focus on Jurgen Habermas' theory of communicative action provides possibilities of shifting the frontier to interactive planning that explicitly takes up the problem of the relationship between authority and society. The theories and concepts of other European thinkers like Althusser, Gramsci, Lukacs, Weber, and Foucault, are also important for an understanding of the Western European intellectual climate. Habermas's theory envisions a number of new, collective decision-making forms. It must be seen as a directive for a new political praxis,  a criterion against which the organization of both the political and the social life can be tested and judged. However, the political relevance of this third paradigm (emerging from criticism of the modernization and dependency paradigms) as a realistic counter-strategy has a chance to succeed only if an organic bond can be forged internationally between the grass-roots movement in the West and in the Third World. 'Networking' may be a crucial step towards its materialization. As a step towards this, the participants at a 1986 conference on Communication, Development and Human Rights held in Rome, recommended that transnational networks of communication, solidarity, and support be developed between local and national groups and organizations to give some protection to vulnerable groups.

        "description":"By focusing on concepts of power, culture, and ideology in light of new socio-cultural and anthropological interpretations with regard to their use in international, intercultural, and cross-cultural communication research, an outline for the framework of a more hermeneutic-interpretive approach to the study of communication and socio-cultural change can be developed. Culture is not only a visible, non-natural environment of individual and organized subjects, but also and primarily his, her, or their normative context. In the patterning of their social existence, people continually make, principally unconsciously, choices that are directed by the applicable intracultural values and options. The social reality can then be seen as a reality constituted and cultivated on the basis  of particular values, a reality in which the value system and the social system are completely interwoven and imbued with the activity of each other. In other words, in the study of concrete cases, it is necessary to be attentive to the following aspects: (1) the characteristics and dimensions of the cultural reference framework (i.e. the world view, the ethos, and their symbolic representation); (2) the interaction and interrelation with the environment of power and interest; and (3) the 'ideological apparatuses' by which the cultural reference framework is produced and through which it is at the same time disseminated.

        "description":"Although originally developed in terms of interpersonal systems, the coorientational strategy model can be modified and used for research on the communication of collectivities. The proposed changes to the coorientational framework would permit examination of constructs of greater verisimilitude to theoretical reasoning of the behavior and cognition of members of groups and collectivities, as well as enable more flexible analyses of constructs associated with groups larger than the dyad. To test these proposed changes, subjects, 1,233 residents of a predominantly rural area of the northeastern United States and a comparable area in Ontario, Canada, were interviewed on their perceptions and knowledge of the topical concern of acid rain. Results suggest that while the  coorientational framework has been readily adapted by researchers investigating groups and collectivities, the interpersonal nature of the model's origin has not been modified to take account of the nature of the relationship of the individual to the collective. The applicability of the model to current public opinion research is also readily apparent. Results also suggest that the perceptual accuracy may not lie solely within the realm of the perceiver, but, as common sense would dictate, the communicator has a fairly large role in affecting accuracy.

First, a focus group sample of 16 communication directors at the NFPs generated survey questions. Then, a second sample of directors at each organization responded to a 20-minute telephone interview. Respondents answered questions covering general aspects of the agency's public relations operations, the agency's largest promotional effort of 1987, and the evaluation methods used in their campaigns. Findings revealed that the majority of NFPs did not use community  resources. Results also revealed a lack of knowledge on communication concepts, campaigns, and campaign evaluation.

The human exemplar of an argument's substance, e.g. Jesus Christ as exemplar of Christianity, is the paradigm for this theory in which the arguer's identity is seen both as equal in importance to and inseparable from the argument's contents. Just as Ludwig Wittgenstein contends that linguistic activity occurs within a form of life, the exhortative theory shows that argumentation is an activity inextricably bound to human conduct. Paradigms such as storytelling, jurisprudence, and scientific method have been used to describe argument, but these attempts to universalize do not allow for the diversity of forms of argument. The exhortative  theory does not supplant current theories of argumentation but adds to them. (Forty-five references are attached.) (MHC)",

        "description":"Communication scholars should be skilled in the use of focus groups in communication research and in interpreting the data this approach generates. The focus group is a discussion group that concentrates on a particular topic or topics and typically consists of eight to 12 participants. The group is facilitated by a moderator who follows a relatively unstructured interview guide and plays a key role in the success of the group. Focus groups can provide: (1) data which is not obtainable through paper and pencil self-report measures or observational measures; and (2) the opportunity to obtain data which is not necessarily germane to any particular group or setting. This provides qualitative information to expose underlying attitudes, opinions, and behavior patterns. The advantages  of focus groups are the release of inhibition by the participants, the generation of a wide range of responses, and the creation of a valuable source of exploratory information when little is known beforehand about the researcher's topic of interest. The disadvantages are the interviewee's responses toward the interview situation itself, the concept of social desirability, and biased results. In three specific applications of focus group methodology (two doctoral dissertations and an organizational communication consulting project) and much other communication research, the focus group appears to be the &quot;best,&quot; if not the only way, of obtaining the data to achieve the research objective.

The Personal Report of Communication Fear (a 14-item self-report inventory) was used to measure levels of CA. Davey's Communication Apprehension Behavior Inventory was used to record teacher perception of CA among subjects. Academic achievement measures consisted of the total battery scaled score on the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills, and intelligence data (IQ) were derived from the Test of Cognitive Skills, which was administered in conjunction with the achievement battery. Results  indicated that the best predictor of CA included only two variables--intelligence and teacher perception of CA--with the latter sharing little variance with achievement. A predictor model based on both intelligence and teacher perception of CA was found to be only slightly better than one based on intelligence alone. Intelligence correlated significantly with achievement, and CA correlated with teacher perception of CA. Teacher perception of CA correlated negatively with achievement and IQ. CA was not found to correlate significantly with either achievement or intelligence. (Two tables of data are included, and 35 references are attached.) (MM)",

Studies have shown that high school students using dramatic enactment experienced more instances of higher order thinking, more topic-specific emotions, decreased apprehension, and less topic-irrelevant thought than students in the non-dramatic mode. Drama has varied applications in the classroom, including improvisation; role-playing; readers' theater; choral readings; and writing and producing radio programs, television screenplays, or documentaries. In using drama in the classroom, the teacher becomes a facilitator rather than an authority or the source of knowledge. As collaborator and guide, the teacher sets the topic and starts  things in motion, but the students' choices determine the course the lesson will take. With practice, teachers of English will discover that the use of drama techniques in the classroom can become a vital part of their teaching repertoire. (MS)",

Arguing for the nullification of the Federal Government, Calhoun's rhetoric evoked the mythic elements of absolute good and evil, conspiracy, and heroes and redemption. Political myths such as these channel audiences' actions, particularly through the use of uncontested terms, and can therefore become grounds for action as well  as belief.

        "description":"If principals are responsible for implementing educational reforms, then criteria for effective leadership skills should be developed. This paper considers criteria for identifying effective principals and proposes a training and appraisal system. The paper discusses five domains that identify effective principals: (1) vision, (2) organization/collaboration, (3) people skills, (4) communication skills, and (5) hardiness. Vision implies that the principal sees the school realistically and in terms of improvement. Collaborative organization and leadership depend upon the \"unit\" of principal and teachers. People skills concern the ability to manage people--principals must be expert at working with diverse groups and individuals. Effective communication communicates not only  information but also trust and understanding. Principals must also know whether oral or written communication is more effective in a given situation. The quality of \"hardiness\" involves a stress-resistant attitude; such leaders are open to change, feel involved, and sense control over events. The proposed Administrator Improvement Model (AIM) is instructionally designed to develop effective leadership skills. Training involves classroom activities, role-playing situations, and self- and peer evaluation/coaching. Workshops focus on the five identified effectiveness domains. The attitudes identified in the model encourage self, staff, and community to achieve goals through group problem solving. The model proposes that principals can transfer learned skills and attitudes related to  effective leadership into making their jobs easier, more productive, and more rewarding. Three charts illustrating the model are appended. (CJH)",

Principals in schools of all types also have important roles in assessing school needs and planning for school improvement. Other results imply that the jobs of principals in public schools involve more interaction with higher levels of authority than do the jobs of  principals in private schools. In contrast to public school principals, principals in private and Catholic schools may have more scope to make personnel and other administrative decisions and hence view these aspects of their jobs as more important than their public school counterparts. Differences among the jobs of principals in elementary, middle/junior, and high schools are described, as are differences in schools of different sizes. Differences associated with location (urban, suburban, rural) were usually not large or particularly meaningful. Implications of the job analysis for training and performance measurement are discussed. (Author/TE)",

        "description":"In 1986 the Danforth Foundation Program for the Preparation of School Principals was launched at Georgia State University, the University of Alabama, and Ohio State University. All participants have attempted to address the foundation's primary objectives: (1) to work with faculty to develop alternative preparation programs in collaboration with practicing school administrators; (2) to develop future principals' knowledge, attitudes, and skills through nontraditional methods; and (3) to enable aspiring principals to gain practical skills prior to employment. Additionally, each participating university operates on certain assumptions: (1) aspiring administrators are accountable for their own learning; (2) collegial behavior and support for personal learning accountability are  crucial to administrative success; (3) individual planning and goal setting are essential; (4) alternative instructional activities are necessary to meet individual needs; and (5) ongoing relationships with practicing administrators as mentors must be pursued. This paper focuses on the final assumption, mentoring. Following a brief literature review, the paper addresses specific potential values and responsibilities involved with mentoring in administrator preparation. Finally, some Danforth Foundation implementation approaches at Ohio State University during 1987-88 are discussed. Shortcomings are analyzed and recommendations provided.

        "description":"Chicago Public Schools, spending more than its $1.5 billion a year budget, has defined its first obligation as producing graduates who can read well. This study assesses how well the school system is succeeding by examining roughly 39,500 students who were ninth graders in fall 1980 and should have graduated in spring 1984. Statistics were used to chart students' progress over 4 years as some dropped out or transferred to other school systems and others graduated with either very good or marginal reading skills. While results graphically depict the system's successes and failures, the study's main priority is using the information to develop improvement plans for Chicago schools. The study investigates (1) the percentage of 1980-81 ninth graders who graduated from high school;  (2) the percentage of these students who also could read at average or above average levels; and (3) how the high school completion rate and the percent of well-prepared (reading) graduates differ among Chicago's 62 4-year high schools. The remainder of the report explains research methods, presents results, and explains policy implications and reform recommendations. Compared to a national high school completion rate of 73 percent, Chicago's rate is 47 percent. Whereas the national pecentage for well-prepared graduates is 36 percent, the Chicago rate is 15 percent. These results are shocking. Schools in the majority of Chicago neighborhoods are abject failures or viewed as dumping grounds for uneducable children. A &quot;Quality Schools Agenda&quot; is advised to overcome four key barriers to  reforming Chicago's schools. Included are numerous tables and 12 references. (MLH)",

          "Fitzpatrick, Jody"],
        "description":"In 1966, James Coleman's massive American schooling survey concluded that family background was principally associated with the existing inequities in cognitive achievement. Coleman's conclusion about schooling's minimal influence on academic performance violated an educational consciousness viewing school as the &quot;great equalizer.&quot; Two decades after the Coleman Report, this paper explores schools' compensation for class-related inequalities by reviewing the effectiveness of federal egalitarian educational programs and by describing one state study of the relationship between various environmental variables and pupil achievement. Part I addresses three assumptions underlying the rationale for compensatory education in the early 1960s: (1) the total environment profoundly  influences measured intelligence and school achievement; (2) schools are part of the total environment; and (3) improved schooling for disadvantaged children could compensate for inadequacies in measured intelligence and scholastic achievement caused by environmental deficiencies. After reviewing research since 1966, the paper focuses on the issue of sustaining effects. Apparently, a &quot;fade out&quot; of early gains is a continuing problem. Part II describes a Colorado survey for third-, sixth-, ninth-, and eleventh-grade levels using regression analysis techniques. Results suggest that school-related variables do influence achievement, but their impact is restricted to the lower grades--perhaps due to a strengthening of peer and community mores during adolescence. Similar to Coleman, the  current survey finds family variables more related to achievement than are school variables. Included are 80 references. (MLH)",

        "description":"In the issue-attention cycle identified by political scientists, the imagination and energy of public leaders progress from alarmed discovery of a problem, to euphoric resource mobilization and a search for solutions, to institutionalization of responses. Next come the harsh realities of expensive answers and slow progress, causing a hasty retreat and an attention shift to the latest hot issue fueled by yet another alarmed discovery. According to this paper, the dropout issue is basking in the early, hopeful stages of the cycle. The paper describes the alarmed attention currently focused on school dropouts and outlines what is known about attempts to prevent early school leaving. Most citizens find current dropout rates, especially for urban schools, shocking. Other factors  bringing the dropout issue to national prominence include the standards-raising movement's effects on student persistence, the unsatisfactory collection and reporting of dropout statistics, lack of progress in equalizing educational opportunity, and growing concern over the nation's competitiveness and labor force quality. Research has successfully described the dropout phenomenon, but has failed to prescribe either a concrete program or conditional sets of activities to combat the problem. Known factors concerning family background, academic ability and performance, social integration, early adult transitions, and the consequences of dropping out are briefly discussed. Implications for dropout prevention are also explored, along with the need to extend the public's attention span and tap  community networks. Some resources, with names, addresses, and telephone numbers are provided. (MLH)",

        "description":"Dramatic changes in the direction of federal educational policy have occurred since the Reagan administration took office in 1980. This document examines the changes that are taking place and will continue to occur in the emerging policy stance of this administration toward educational research. The thesis is that a form of the &quot;new federalism&quot; in educational policy is in the process of becoming institutionalized, and that a bipartisan consensus has emerged in support of a diminished federal role and an expanded state role in education. This trend toward devolution is likely to dominate educational policy development for the remainder of this century. The implications of these recent shifts in federal education policy for educational research are explored through two basic  arguments. The first is that the federal educational research policy agenda evolves from two complementary bases: (1) the stated agenda (research and development emphases articulated by the administration); and (2) the derivative agenda (emphases occasioned by non-research-related policy actions including overarching social policies, substantive educational interests, and the effects of federal policy shifts on policy development at the state and local level. The second argument is that the changes in the federal educational research agenda will have significant implications for both the educational research community and the future of educational research. The gainers will include the census function, outcomes assessment, and dissemination, while losers are basic and applied research and  regional laboratories and research and development centers. Twenty-nine references are included. (TE)",

The participants included one college faculty member, a research assistant, three volunteer fifth-grade teachers, and their classes. The focus of the program was integration of writing, reading, and study skills emphasizing the development of research skills. The physical environment and a lack of financial resources presented obstacles to implementation. Also, teachers had to be willing to try an interdisciplinary approach to the curriculum. The students' lack of experience at independent  research became a difficulty that had to be overcome. Individual self-instructional learning modules were developed. A core group of children was trained to be peer teachers. The outcomes reported include positive growth in collegiality among the teachers, development of a sense of community by the children, and an expansion of the concept of collaboration by the Lehman participants.

        "description":"As defined in chapter I of this guide for policymakers, strategic planning is the method by which an organization identifies relevant trends in its environment, analyzes their potential implications, and projects an integrated strategy to address these future events and their contingencies. This process differs from formalized planning, based on internal organizational goals and priorities and viewing external forces as obstacles or incentives to their achievement. Strategic planning's benefits for education, as for business, can be measured in terms of savings, improved public image, responsivenesss to social needs, and effective performance of an important mission. Chapter II helps policymakers identify major trends concerning demographics, economics, technology and lifestyle,  and politics and values. Implications for U.S. schooling are also analyzed. Chapter III illustrates a nine-step strategic planning process involving (1) a planning focus; (2) a trend statement; (3) a trend analysis; (4) a need for action statement; (5) a resource audit; (6) an action priority; (7) an organizational response; (8) a strategic plan; and (9) a restatement of mission. Chapter IV provides &quot;starter&quot; exercises on two topics: the computer revolution and the growth of language minorities. Chapter V concludes the paper by outlining planning elements in the policy arena, such as foresight, goal-setting, budgeting, management and evaluation, and leadership. (MLH)",

        "author":["Bishop, John"],
        "description":"Wage rates and earnings can mislead public and private decisionmakers about the social benefits of certain kinds of education and training investments. This confusion arises because (1) workers and employers prefer employment contracts that downplay productivity differences among workers doing the same job; and (2) important dimensions of educational and training accomplishment (skill, knowledge, and competencies) are often not signaled to potential employers and therefore have limited influence on job allocations. This situation results in significant productivity differentials among workers receiving the same pay for the same job. Some differentials are related to inefficiently signaled educational and training accomplishments (or academic achievement). This paper develops a  simple signaling/implicit contract model of the labor market. True productivity depends on general intellectual achievement and educational credentials, but since the former is unobservable, pay is based on credentials and supervisory assessments of doubtful reliability. The labor market tends to overcompensate credentials and undercompensate academic achievement. Next, the paper refutes an assumed equality between simple wage and individual marginal revenue products. A hypothesis equating productivity with wage effects of general intellectual achievement is also refuted. Finally, the paper develops a method of estimating academic achievement's true impact on productivity and applies it to data on 31,399 workers' productivity. The analysis strongly supports signaling theory. The tendency  to underreward academic achievement may help explain why American high school students devote less time and energy to learning than do their counterparts abroad. Included are 19 endnotes, 71 references, 3 tables, and a worker evaluation questionnaire. (Author/MLH)",

        "description":"Increasing dropout rates, marked decline in college preparatory enrollment, and reports of students' growing dissatisfaction with school prompted this exploration of the dimensions underlying teaching and the ways that microeconomics might positively influence teaching effectiveness. The literature review supports 10 advantages offered by student evaluations of teaching (SETS) in complementing student achievement as a schooling effectiveness measure. The Fox SETS studies show that teachers' enthusiasm accounts for twice the student achievement that lecture content does. This study's analysis was based on a sample of 60 teacher aggregates of 3,961 student questionnaires gathered over 2 years from the same high school. Factor analysis of 52 variables revealed \"student-caring\"  versus \"task-driven\" as key research-based, teaching dimensions. The resulting \"managerial grid\" for teachers offered graphic perspectives of interrelationships not afforded by conventional frameworks. Using \"student satisfaction with teacher performance\" as the dependent variable, allocative efficiency was probed using planar and other quantitative techniques. Results show that \"student-caring\" has substantially more influence on satisfaction than does \"task-driven.\" Teachers are implicitly paid considerably less for caring than for task-driven behaviors. Reallocating salaries to produce teaching that interests students poses formidable technical and political problems. However, more caring for students, not necessarily more money allocated to it, should also produce higher percentages  of satisfied students. The managerial grid should help define and achieve more appropriate teaching styles. Included are 128 endnotes. (Author/MLH)",

        "description":"The recommendation to require state certification of chief school business officers (CSBO's) is an attempt to strengthen the public schools' business function, to raise the CSBO's status, and to underscore the relationships between the business and program sides of school district operations. Although the CSBO has traditionally been viewed as the school bookkeeper, this position's duties and functions have grown exponentially during the past decades as school business activities have expanded in complexity. Also, recent state reform movements have created a new interest in more effective and efficient education resources management. Prior to discussing CSBO certification, the paper first describes the new job definition and workplace characteristics from which a set of  competencies and standards can be established. Then the paper examines arguments for and against CSBO certification in California and examines certification activities in other states. Finally, some conclusions and recommendations are offered for California. Clearly, steps are needed to strengthen the competencies and skills of CSBO's. Certification should be institututed as a first step. Also, individual assessment, rather than course or program approval, should be used for the certification process. The certificate should have a continuing education requirement. Further analysis is needed for CSBO certification in smaller districts where the superintendent doubles as the CSBO. Included is an appendix describing certification requirements for selected states. (MLH)",

        "description":"The school principalship has undergone change in the past decade. Principals are expected to make daily decisions in the best interests of students within their school systems. Secondary school principals are socialized to choose between idealized (or desired) tasks and conventional (or actual) tasks associated with their job. A literature review discloses that discipline, feedback, efficiency versus effectiveness, and individual personality needs versus institutional role requirements are very real problems for today's administrator. This paper describes a survey of high school principals randomly chosen from 615 Oklahoma school districts; 350 questionnaires were mailed out, with a 58 percent response (N=200). Correctional analysis and analysis of variance were used to prove  that no conflict exists between what Oklahoma secondary principals actually do and what they think should be done. Also, neither school size nor recent attendance at a higher education institution has any bearing on secondary administrators' actual and desired task priority. There is no difference between current and desired task priorities when compared to similar 1977 studies. While more research is needed, the present study should help higher education institutions understand secondary principals' tasks and principals understand the effects of their everday decisions.

Administrators are faced with the difficult task of deciding which incentives will make regular school attendance more meaningful to students, and which penalties may make truancy and class cutting less attractive. Responses from six urban high schools studied from 1983 to 1985 indicate that the most important ingredients in reducing absenteeism are the following: (1) a computerized system of monitoring and recording absences; (2) political alliances with teachers and parents committed to reducing truancy; (3) consistency in imposing penalties for repeat offenders; (4) creation and support of intervention programs; and (5)  patience and the will to persevere through early implementation problems. Summaries of the programs to reduce truant behavior are cited for three high schools in Portland, Oregon; one in Eugene, Oregon; and two in Louisville, Kentucky. (MLF)",

From this perspective, the school as an ideological state apparatus at once has a cohesive function, yet it allows scope for different interpretations of curriculum aims, and hence for change. The study is accordingly concerned with overriding school objectives and certain determinants of teaching content relating to the transmission by schools of views of society and knowledge, as embodied in citizenship education. After a background discussion of this theoretical perspective, the study begins  with a historical review of the school reforms of 1918-19 and the civic curriculum code. The determinants of the content of citizenship education are analyzed next, followed by a discussion of the patriarchal, scientific-rational, and democratic premises of the civic curriculum code.

        "description":"As this paper demonstrates, studying abortive educational reforms reveals a great deal about the complex political dynamics involved in making (and unmaking) key policy decisions. Using case studies of France and West Germany, the paper argues that the state in advanced industrial countries tends to maximize the political gains derived from designing and appearing to implement reforms while minimizing political costs. This situation is attributed to the erosion of the state's legitimacy and to the vulnerability of the state's authority where education is concerned. The case of West Germany centers on attempting to introduce a comprehensive postelementary education system in lieu of the traditional three-tiered system. The case of the Fifth Republic of France (since 1958) is more  difficult and diffuse, with projects aimed in various directions over the years. The central tendency was to overcome or reduce the internal stratification in secondary schooling. This paper explains each case, advances the theoretical argument concerned with state authority, and shows how the two cases support the design of educational reforms as a much less hazardous and more advantageous proposition than their implementation. France and West Germany hold no monopoly on the politics of nonreform in education; reforms elsewhere are also withering on the vine as rhetoric enlarges and financial capability decreases.

Results of the questionnaire are discussed in a case study format for each school, interspersed with a series of tables showing selected items from the Effective Schools Characteristics. The ensuing discussion of these findings in both schools  focuses on the following factors: the need for specificity in determining what is needed to implement an innovation; the need for appropriate strategies, such as inservice training, resource support, feedback mechanisms, and participation, to implement the innovation; and organizational climate, or staff perceptions of the motivating purposes behind organizational processes. The findings suggest that implementing changes in secondary schools is often the result of both planned and unplanned activities. References are included, and the the staff assessment questionnaire is appended, along with reliability estimates, a breakdown of the results, and assorted archival materials from the schools. (TE)",

The U.S. Department of Education currently operates four TACs, which each provide assistance in a specified region of the country. The TACs are funded at an overall level of $3.6 million a year, down from a high of $8.5 million in 1980-81. The study found that, despite variations across TACs, they have generally selected technical assistance strategies that are consistent with their program goals, with some major exceptions. Other findings indicate that state and local  education agencies have significant needs for the assistance provided by TACs. In general, these TACs were found to achieve satisfactory results in their assistance with evaluation and program improvement; the most important result was the interest and enthusiasm they generated among local Chapter 1 personnel. However, support for TACs by the Department of Education was found to be inadequate. Accordingly, the report concludes with a recommendation that the Department of Education redirect the TAC mission toward increasing the capacity of state education agencies to promote and implement Chapter 1 improvement.

        "description":"This booklet describes the results of &quot;Project Education Reform,&quot; a partnership involving the U.S. Department of Education, 8 state governors, and 16 school districts--2 in each participating state--representing a cross-section of the nation. It was generally agreed that a good basis for needed educational changes were the 13 recommendations contained in &quot;Time for Results,&quot; the 1986 report of the National Governor's Association. Each of the 16 school districts was asked to select at least 3 of the 13 areas in which they would create innovative programs and carry out reforms. Methods considered for improving schools included: designing plans for student evaluation, developing ways to evaluate principals, and involving parents more actively in their children's education. The first  part of this report is an overview of the project that discusses the background, lists the 13 recommendations, summarizes the reforms in each district, and then discusses the superintendent's role in reform: building trust, developing plans for reform, communicating the plans, and carrying them out. Also discussed are barriers to reform, such as lack of time and competing priorities, money constraints, state and federal laws and regulations, too great reliance on tests, problems with teachers' unions, problems with size in large districts, negative community attitudes, negative staff attitudes, inadequate facilities, and lack of leadership continuity. The overview concludes with a discussion of the federal/state/district partnership and the results of the project in general. Site reports  from each of the 16 school districts follows. The districts are: Arkansas (Little Rock and Springdale), Colorado (Mapleton and Montrose), Missouri (Columbia and Independence), New Hampshire (Timberland and White Mountains Regional School Districts), New Jersey (Paramus and Union), South Carolina (Orangeburg and Spartanburg), Tennessee (Memphis and Oak Ridge), and Utah (Provo and Salt Lake City). The report concludes with 15 recommendations from the participating superintendents. (TE)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of the Future Problem Solving Program on gifted students' ability to solve futuristic problems. Two specific research questions were asked. The first question dealt with the effects of the Future Problem Solving Program on subjects' total score on an ill-structured problem. Question two asked which components of the Future Problem Solving process differed across groups. Subjects were fourth- and fifth-grade gifted children in a suburban school district (Southeast Texas). Thirty-three students assigned to treatment had participated in the Future Problem Solving Program for at least 6 months, while the 28 control subjects were non-participants in this program. All subjects attended a Mock Future Problem Solving Bowl and  completed a problem booklet similar to those used in the program. Results of analysis indicated a significant effect for treatment on total score. In addition, there were significant differences among four of the six components across groups. There was a significant overall effect for the Future Problem Solving Program on the solution of futuristic problems similar to those used in the program. With the knowledge that the subjects did not differ in their performance on two components of the process, \"best solution\" and \"plan for acceptance\", the conclusion was drawn that it is possible that experimental subjects, who had knowledge of the evaluation procedures, concentrated more on components that had a higher possible score than these two components.

Most secondary and some elementary schools in Japan have acquired computers to enhance the processes of learning and teaching. In schools for the handicapped, computers are also being utilized, especially in programs for hearing and visually impaired students. A shortage of special education courseware has been a problem, and provincial education centers and individual teachers are developing appropriate courseware. Hardware developments include the design of special input-output devices designed to meet handicapped students' needs. Training is necessary to help teachers understand the technology and the role changes  brought about by computers. Workshops are sponsored by the National Institute of Special Education to train special educators in the use of computers. Japan has several commercial electronic networks and bulletin boards that link scattered projects, but a need is felt for a network solely intended for special educators. Appended to the paper are statistical data on the numbers of special schools and numbers of handicapped students by handicapping condition, by type of school, and by grade level. (JDD)",

This report analyzes data produced in the 1986-87 screening procedure, involving approximately 3,400 students. The report begins with a review of procedural changes that were designed to make the screening more effective and efficient than earlier study cycles. Then the results of the most recent screening are examined, with the finding that scores on the Otis-Lennon Mental Abilities Test and Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices were better predictors of giftedness than parent or teacher recommendations and better than the testing of siblings of pupils previously identified as gifted. The data analysis reviewed the following specific issues: (1) errors in calculating or recording  data; (2) male and female performances on the screening procedures; (3) effectiveness of the screening of French immersion pupils; (4) effectiveness of the screening of pupils with gifted siblings; (5) effectiveness of the Teacher Checklist as an initial screen; and (6) effectiveness of peer nomination as an initial screen. The report concludes with recommendations to further increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the screening procedures. (JDD)",

A total of 229 Oregon speech-language pathologists was surveyed, with a response rate of 55% (n=125). Responses showed that 22% had completed a course devoted specifically to adolescent development, and slightly more than half reported some preservice clinical experience with adolescents. The language screening tools most often used by the respondents were informal or clinician-made tests, followed by standardized norm-referenced screening tests. The five language diagnostic procedures most often used were: (1) teacher conferencing and recommendations; (2)&quot;Clinical Evaluation of Language Functions&quot;; (3) informal/systematic observation; (4) semantic, syntactic, and morphologic language sample analysis; and (5) &quot;Test of Adolescent Language.&quot; The respondents most often employed the itinerant scheduling model and the one-to-one or small group method for intervention. The use of the intervention approaches of role playing, experiential learning, and curriculum adaptation was nearly equally distributed among respondents. (JDD)",

Assessment and evaluation are defined, and key provisions of Public Law 94-142 and Public Law 99-457 are outlined. Several issues to be considered in establishing effective assessment/service delivery systems include: the nature of the population, the need for knowledgeable professionals, the need for material resources, and the need to plan for future environments. Several existing evaluation models and programs are briefly reviewed, followed by a description of the evaluation model at the Trace Center. At the Trace Center's Communication Aids and Systems Clinic, a team works with the client, the family, and others to  select the most appropriate communication system for an individual. The evaluation process consists of referral, screening, case review, evaluation, implementation, and follow-up. Another Trace Center program with an evaluation component, the Communication Development Program, uses a similar evaluation process, though team input is sought from other sources and environmentally-based services are emphasized. Recommendations in developing an effective assessment process and a 26-item reference list conclude the paper. (JDD)",

The survey identified approximately 850,000 people receiving community-based, publicly-funded personal maintenance, hygiene, mobility, or household assistance services, with physically disabled individuals being the most often served. The report explores the growth in the need for personal assistance services, explains the World Institute on Disability's rationale for studying this situation, and identifies the potential user population. Background information describes several federal and state programs providing personal assistance services. Survey data includes such information as number of programs per state, year of implementation, goals, state agencies administering the  programs, and their funding sources. Analysis of program structure focuses on eligibility, services, hours of service availability, maximum service amounts allowed, direct service providers, determination of services allowed, and medical supervision. Also examined is program conformity to the Independent Living Model, in which the personal services attendant is managed by the user and no medical supervision is required. The study analyzes service recipients and program expenditures, and compares the availability of attendant services across the United States. The report concludes with an analysis of the need versus adequacy of the system to meet that need and makes several recommendations. (JDD)",

        "description":"This executive summary reviews results of a survey of 154 publicly-funded programs providing personal assistance services to disabled individuals. Introductory chapters identify the need for a national personal assistance program and policy, the concept of personal assistance and attendant services, the potential user population, and U.S. sources of funding. Key findings are reported in a section on survey results, focusing on the areas of program goals, number of programs per state, program age, administering agencies, funding sources, eligibility, services, hours of service availability, maximum amount of service allowed, types of service providers (individual providers, contract agency providers, and government agency providers), determination of services allowed, medical  supervision, degree of program conformity to the Independent Living Model, program utilization and expenditures, availability of services across the United States, and the estimated need versus adequacy of the system to meet that need. Tables include, among others, &quot;Programs with the Highest Independent Living Orientation,&quot;&quot;Comparison Across States of Expenditures and Total Clients of Attendant Service Programs,&quot; and &quot;Comparison of Home Care Survey Estimates of Need for Assistance with Number Actually Being Served.&quot; The report concludes with 17 recommendations to guide the development of national policy on personal assistance services.

Teacher education programs need to focus on the skills required by teachers to utilize these assistants appropriately and effectively. This paper outlines one method for incorporating an instructional module into an undergraduate teacher curriculum. The training module's components include: rationale for utilization of auxiliary personnel, legal and ethical constraints upon use, description of roles and responsibilities of teachers and auxiliary personnel, issues in training auxiliary personnel, and methods for supervising paraprofessionals. It is recommended that the competencies be achieved through an intact  instructional module delivered primarily in one course, and guidelines are provided for appropriate placement of the module in the curriculum. Student competencies upon completion of the module are listed. The instructional methodology utilizes student reading materials, lecture presentations, class discussions, class assignments, and assessment of student knowledge. (JDD)",

        "description":"The monograph describes various aspects of data collection, analysis and data-based decision-making for the regular or special education classroom teacher. Direct and repeated measurement of student progress and program effectiveness is advocated. Four fundamental steps are outlined: (1) identify instructional objectives and collect data on student performance; (2) display the data graphically; (3) examine the data and identify trends; and (4) use basic data decision rules to guide instructional decisions. The concept of &quot;stages of learning&quot; is introduced in relation to use of percent and rate data. Use of correct-to-error ratios and trials-at-criterion standards for setting performance goals is presented. Strategies for determining objectively when and how to change instruction  are discussed. Instructional modification involves changing one or more of four basic program elements: general setting events, antecedent events, subsequent events, and the contingency arrangement. Finally, guidelines for implementing data-based instruction and making data-based decisions with students who are low achieving, exceptional and at-risk for dropping out are offered. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"The literature and theories of the role of self-assessment in the metacognitive development of children with learning handicaps is reviewed. Self-assessment is seen to be a prerequisite for metacognitive growth. The literature on purposes of self-assessment and ways to assess a student's actual use of self-assessment indicates that learning handicapped students tend to be passive learners; that self-report to determine students' self-assessment abilities is unreliable; that the use of rating scales for pre-judging by the student is included among methods of assessing students' self-assessment; that self-assessment can be inferred from student comments about difficulty level, and that specific self-assessment includes giving students devices to self-assess during a task. The  literature suggests that self-assessment has different types including \"sizing up\" the task before beginning, gauging one's skill and likelihood of success before beginning, assessment during task performance, self-judging about the decisions in the self-assessment, and self-monitoring as the on-going watching of one's self. A theory of metacognition is described which includes the three parameters of person variables (such as age, sex, developmental skills, self-esteem), task variables (such as meaningfulness, task format, level of complexity), and strategy variables (specific strategy knowledge,, relational strategy knowledge, and metamemory).

Efforts of public and voluntary agencies to apply the statement are documented. An article by Sue Lehr illustrates the need for family support services from a parent's perspective. Following the article, the purpose  of family support, its costs, and its funding sources are reviewed. Legislation and innovative programs providing family support are described, including the Michigan Family Subsidy Act and programs in Wisconsin, Montana, Maryland (Calvert County), and New York (Syracuse).

The 26 invited participants used a series of formal presentations and small and large group sessions to identify issues, set priorities for action, and develop preliminary recommendations. Formal presentations include: &quot;Issues and Priorities in Pediatric Therapy Research&quot; (Martha Piper); &quot;Issues in Education&quot; (Barbara Connolly); and &quot;The Practice of Physical Therapy with Children, Adolescents and Their Families&quot; (Alice Shea). Group discussions following each presentation are summarized. Several high priority issues in pediatric physical therapy are identified and discussed: manpower shortage, identification of the scientific basis of practice, translation of the  scientific basis into practice, measurement, curriculum, spectrum of practice, and communication and coordination of services. Strategies for implementing change in the priority areas are outlined. Several short presentations describe the roles of the following agencies in support of physical therapy in pediatrics: Maternal and Child Health Training of the Bureau of Health Care Delivery and Assistance, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; United Cerebral Palsy Research and Educational Foundation; and American Physical Therapy Association. An appendix contains a copy of a survey sent to 80 physical therapists concerning their priorities for maternal and child health, along with a summary of results. (JDD)",

A classroom observation checklist provides a basis for formulating program or classroom goals in the following areas: individualized education programs (IEPs), staff and student scheduling, data collection on student performance, age appropriateness of classroom environment, instructional methods in school and community  settings, student work placements, peer tutors, transition planning, and amount of instructional time. Succeeding sections offer a list of practical administrative decisions which can improve the school environment for severely disabled students, as well as a comprehensive list of critical accomplishments for use in generating professional development goals in such areas as management of classroom tasks and resources, supported employment, and integration of students in school and community.

The 45-session intervention focused on teaching him to attend, increasing his responsiveness to people, effecting discriminative responses to a variety of controlled auditory and visual stimuli, increasing the extent and rate of his vocal and nonvocal behavior, and increasing the control of his behavior by verbal commands. Principles of behavior modification were used in such activities as \"tickling,\" various games in which the child's verbalizations maintain the action, and responding to his name and simple commands. The intervention resulted in an increase in the frequency and variety of his  verbal and nonverbal behavior; his behavior is more under appropriate stimulus control; and people are more frequently sources of discriminative and reinforcing stimuli for him. He laughs, makes some sounds similar to those of others, responds to his name, pays attention, does simple tasks, and is generally more alert and responsive. (DB)",

Intervention consisted of 1.5 hour sessions four times a week over an 8-month period. The intervention focused on increasing nonvocal imitation, vocal imitation, verbal labeling, and verbal discrimination. Development of nonvocal imitation required physical guidance and immediate rewards. Then vocal imitation of sounds in gradually increasing complexity was encouraged through shaping and immediate reinforcement. Verbal labeling began with responding to symbols and pictures progressing to labeling with a sound an object or person. The child learned to label about a dozen pictures and objects. Verbal discrimination was developed by having the child respond  appropriately to a variety of commands differing in the object to be obtained or placed. After the intervention the child was able to imitate words with up to four phonemes, to copy letters and figures, and to follow more complex verbal commands. (DB)",

A three-level approach is suggested, with concentrated central expertise, regional resource points, and a network of individuals at the local level. The technology involved takes many forms, including special therapeutic technology, special education technology, personal assistive devices which facilitate education, and special adaptations to regular education technology. The program should provide support in the following areas: summative information, integrative information, specialized evaluation teams, training, equipment demonstrations, low-technology and high-technology approaches, an equipment loan  program, and a software library. Other factors to consider in designing the support program are: the special needs of rural areas, an ongoing needs analysis process, ongoing program evaluation activities, links with existing resources, and possible sources of funding.

        "description":"A federally funded research project investigated the relationship between academic learning time (ALT) and achievement of 43 educable mentally retarded, emotionally disturbed, and learning-disabled students, aged 7-13, in grades 1-5. The project's final report, titled &quot;An Analysis of the Impact of Instructional Time within Different Service Delivery Systems on the Academic Achievement of Mildly Handicapped Children,&quot; is briefly summarized in this one-page abstract. The relationship of ALT to student achievement in reading and mathematics was examined; specific strategies were suggested to increase the students' ALT; and teachers' subsequent use of the strategies was evaluated in terms of success in increasing ALT and academic achievement. Results showed, among other findings,  that when direct instruction is provided, students are much more likely to be exhibiting on-task behaviors, and that direct instruction appeared to occur with the greatest frequency in resource room settings. A teacher's manual developed by the project suggests specific strategies to increase ALT and student achievement, such as increasing student attention to academic tasks, and providing more academic activities in which students experience high task success. Policy implications include options such as reallocating the time for various classroom activities and lengthening the school day or year. (JDD)",

Formula types were evaluated according to the criteria of equity, administrative efficiency, adequacy, objectivity, and flexibility. Findings indicated: the flat grant formula appears to be efficient and objective but has few advantages for the special education program unless funded at a high level; the minimum foundation program is advantageous from a general education perspective but is not sufficiently sensitive, nor provides  enough flexibility nor meets the needs of smaller districts; the percentage equalizing formula has the potential for overcoming problems of the minimum foundation program if cost based and funded at a substantial state percentage; the percentage matching formula can provide flexibility, variation with need and price, and neutrality toward placement though low-fiscal capacity local agencies may be disadvantaged; and full state funding of the excess cost of special education is the most advantageous formula for special education, but may not be politically or fiscally feasible.

Results of evaluation of various administrative arrangements indicate that differences between regular and self-contained special education classroom environments are not typically as large as differences in classroom  characteristics such as curriculum, teacher-student ratio, and teacher qualifications. The project also reviewed those variables related to the design of instruction and the educational environment encompassing factors related to both academic achievement and social outcomes. It is concluded that the amount of time a student is integrated is but one variable which may, or may not, have an impact on student achievement and/or social growth. (DB)",

Self-monitoring involved counting and recording the number of work units completed during each time period. Self-solicitation of feedback involved charting whether they had worked faster or slower than a specified standard and then discussing the chart with a trainer. Self-monitoring alone improved productivity for some workers on some tasks, but some workers' performance declined over time. With self-solicitation, productivity  levels increased and remained at higher levels than during self-monitoring only. Results demonstrated: that severely retarded workers can accurately monitor their own work, that providing feedback took little of the trainer's time, and that work quality was generally maintained. Recommendations for trainers include establishing a measurement system for acquiring accurate data on work performance, creating a self-monitoring system manageable by individuals, establishing a system for self-evaluation and self-solicitation of feedback, and periodically checking the accuracy of self-monitoring.

The study sample included 938 regular class students and 1,098 learning-disabled students, all in 10th grade. Their performance scores on item clusters on the State Student Assessment Test II were analyzed and compared, and results showed that learning-disabled students demonstrated competence on fewer communications and mathematics skills than their regular class peers. In addition, an employer survey was administered to 279 corporation personnel managers. Ninety-two percent of employers indicated that reading, writing, and  solving number problems, in that order, were important in the jobs available for high-school graduates. The study's teaching implications support continued reliance on basic skill instruction and development of instructional goals for more complex skills deemed useful by employers. For policymakers, continued emphasis on programming to narrow the gap between the demonstrated skills of learning-disabled students and their regular class peers is recommended. (JDD)",

Ten case studies and analysis across cases revealed that (1) teachers were least consistent in their organization of learning activities, possibly due in part to changes of district policy and teaching assignment; (2) the trend was toward more instruction in reading and language arts; (3) teachers' use of English language materials increased and use of native language materials decreased during a portion of the study;  (4) observer ratings of teacher performance were higher during the second part of the study; (5) teachers increased use of English and decreased use of the students' native language; (6) the teachers' pattern of language alternation was fairly stable; (7) teachers tended to stress language alternation for instructional development as they increased their oral use of English, allocated more instructional time to reading and language arts, and became more clearly focused on academic matters; and (8) curriculum intent and sense of efficacy appeared stable.

Part I involved the study of 58 classrooms and 232 students at six sites representing different ethnolinguistic (Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Cantonese, and Navajo) and multilinguistic groups. The classrooms were nominated for their success as settings for bilingual instruction. The instructional features  identified as significant in this portion of the study include (1) congruence of instructional intent, (2) use of active teaching behaviors, (3) use of the students' native language and English for instruction, (4) integration of English language development with basic skills development, and (5) use of information from the students' home culture. Part II of the study verified the prevalence of those features in a second sample of 89 classrooms and 356 students at eight sites, including new sites representing Filipino, Vietnamese, and Hispanic ethnolinguistic groups.

Verification was carried out through meetings with  teachers of LEP students, teacher educators, administrators of bilingual education programs, and others interested in the instruction of LEP students. The participating practitioners indicated that the framework for bilingual instruction developed in the study was a potentially useful tool for conceptualizing, observing, analyzing, and evaluating instruction. They also saw two areas for change in school district policies regarding bilingual education: discouragement of language alternation and over-frequent testing. (MSE)",

Data were collected over a 2-year period from an Israeli woman who was born in Hungary and immigrated to Israel at 6 years of age. Her primary language was Hebrew, although she used Hungarian on a daily basis (principally with her parents). A paradigm elicitation method was used; the subject was asked to produce regular and irregular nominal paradigms in the rich inflectional system of Hungarian. Examination of the data revealed interesting structural deviations in the subject's first language which may be termed errors. These errors were changes in the  rule component of the language, specifically, rule simplification, rule loss, and rule reordering. Illustrative examples of these errors are presented. Paradigmatic coherence appears to play a significant role in the attrition of first language systems. (CB)",

The rhetorical communication process model, adapted for ESL students, gives detailed attention to the encoding and decoding processes of mainstream English-speakers and allows the ESL speaker to plan phonological, grammatical, and semantic strategies to meet the mainstream listener's decoding expectations. The course based on the model emphasizes methods of researching, outlining, practicing, and evaluating speech presentations for personal and career purposes. It includes techniques for job interview interactions and for work-related informative and persuasive speaking experiences. The course consists of both speech communication  and ESL components. Classroom instruction for the latter component combines rhetorical analyses of ESL/mainstream job site communication interactions with recent information on vocational ESL and utilizes a videotaped functional-notional interaction and a pre-interview interaction skills exercise to assess students' writing, message clarification, and feedback evaluation skills. Other exercises are designed to assist the student in being perceived as suitable for the job being sought. Sample exercises are included. (MSE)",

The study differed from others in its examination of reading conceptions and comprehension in both the first and second languages. Results suggest that both first language reading ability and second language proficiency have significant effects on second language reading ability. However, for the native Spanish speakers, first language reading ability accounted for a greater proportion of the variance in second language reading ability than did second language proficiency, while for the native English speakers, the influence appears to be reversed. Results concerning metacognitive skills were suggestive but not  conclusive. Some second language readers may need relatively more help with basic reading skills or second language skills to succeed in second language reading, and formal metacognitive instruction for monitoring or regulating comprehension or for developing effective and efficient reading strategies is advisable.

Opponents see the amendment as an effort not so much to promote English as to exclude certain non-English speaking immigrants, notably Hispanics and Asians, from our society. Adopting the amendment will not facilitate the adoption of English but may deter English learning by isolating non-English speakers further from  the American mainstream. (Author/MSE)",

        "description":"The South Pacific Commission's English reading curriculum, designed to accompany and reinforce the Tate English oral skills series, is critiqued in terms of curriculum design and implementation in schools in the Micronesian region. The construction and emphases of the classroom and teacher materials are described, and an analysis is given of the texts' readability, complexity, content, and layout in comparison with those of a major basal reading series used in the United States. Deviations from the publisher's recommendations for textbook use and the instructional impact of these changes are severe. Substantial problems are also found in the design of the materials and in their recommended application in the overall language program. Suggestions are made for overall  reorganization of the English reading program, improved and more accessible teacher preparation in the use of the required program and general language teaching methodology, and increased regional attention to the effectiveness of the English reading program.

Based on a review of proposals, evaluations, and tests of all districts in Micronesia and Hawaii in the 1982-83 program year, these conclusions are drawn about program evaluation: (1) little program evaluation was undertaken; (2) student assessment was by far the most serious problem; (3) two evaluation design problems are occurring, the use of control group design and the use of summative rather than formative evaluation of new programs; (4) one seemingly good evaluation was seriously flawed by a lack of objectivity; (5) evaluation of Micronesian projects is underbudgeted; and (6) additional technical assistance for contract development and  administration is needed.

The discussion begins with a review of the rationale and assumptions of similar programs in the continental United States. The concerns of those programs are: native language role and distribution, the need for language skills assessment upon entry, periodic assessment for outplacement, and the feasibility of assessment programs and adequate recordkeeping. The two distinct linguistic contexts of the Micronesian region, dual-language and single-language prevalent, are then described and their implications for entry and exit assessment are examined. The classic entry-exit criteria concerns can not be applied in  the Micronesian context because of the pressing need to make bilingual education programs available to all students and because of the desirability of preserving and developing the region's indigenous languages and culture.

The total number of respondents in 1984 was about 3,300; in 1985 the responses of about 1,740 students to a somewhat expanded instrument were included. The study gathered demographic, descriptive, and behavioral information about the intent, content, and (where applicable) the impact of the international experience on the student. The report describes the study's objectives, summarizes the results of the questionnaire, compares profiles of eight types of  traveling students, reports the self-assessed impact of students' prior international experience, notes patterns in these results, and in previous traveling student cohorts, and draws conclusions for policy. Based on the survey's results, U.S. institutions should reconsider existing policy on a variety of issues, including allocation of program and financial aid resources for study abroad, orientation and advising services for traveling students, language training, international opportunities for students in the sciences and professions, program length, location of study opportunities, and relative attractiveness of international opportunities to women and men.

These techniques include the practice teaching of limited and coherent groups of skills, one group at a time, scaled-down practice teaching situations, maximum relevant feedback to each trainee, and the opportunity to reteach the same lesson. The model consists of four parts: rationale or theoretical background, observation of skilled teachers, trial teaching, and experience as a pupil of peers' teaching. The trainee is given a chance to practice teaching with each skill, using this procedure: (1) the trainer gives a lecture and demonstration of the skill; (2) trainees view a relevant film; (3) each trainee demonstrates instruction using  this skill; (4) video feedback and peer critiques are provided; (5) each trainee attempts to reteach that area; (6) video feedback and critique are given on the second trial; (7) each participant analyzes and compares the two trials; and (8) the group of participants compiles a language activity pack at the end of the course. Trainees taught by this method have reported a favorable response to it, despite some negative reaction to videotaping and viewing, and varying responses to individual elements of the method. (MSE)",

Research in the 1970s found, generally, that Spanish-speaking people were indeed undergoing linguistic and cultural assimilation. However, widespread use of Spanish by the government in education and social welfare programs is feared to have reversed earlier assimilation. Austin (Texas) neighborhoods visited in one 1971 study were revisited in 1982. Three factors with potential for affecting assimilation (mobility, family size, and income) were investigated. Comparison of the Mexican American community in Austin in 1971 and 1982, during which there was dramatic change in Spanish usage by government agencies, found little change  in Spanish usage with coworkers, in commercial or professional activities, or with friends and neighbors. Increased public use of Spanish has created cultural and linguistic paradoxes and has resulted in a new interaction of the two languages for intimate and formal speech, but has not reversed earlier patterns of assimilation.

        "description":"Linguists have recognized the need for appropriateness, sincerity, non-obviousness, and cooperation between speakers in naturally occurring conversation. It is assumed that the speakers listen to each other and in some sense \"care\" about one another at the time of interaction. In the second language classroom such a sense of mutual concern may not exist. The concept of communicative competence has created a lively, communication-oriented style of language instruction, but a crucial difference between natural talk and classroom conversation has been overlooked. In natural talk, speakers enter the discourse because they want to and stay in it because they have some common ground with the other speaker. Language classrooms often lack such motivation, even when the activity meets the  requirements of good communicative teaching. A comparison of experiences as ethnographic participant-observers in beginning French and German classes illustrates that a sense of classroom community is a crucial prerequisite to meaningful language practice. Teachers can provide a classroom environment conducive to eye contact in all exchanges, frequent use of student names, use of meaningful questions, reinforcement of all target language use, and reduction of individual competition.

Data on students' Spanish and English reading and oral language skills, mathematics skills in both languages, and perceptions of the classroom environment were gathered for three years. The results were mixed, demonstrating that students can definitely benefit from second language learning in the curriculum but that care should be taken to ensure that native language skills and progress not be compromised. Teacher performance  emerged as a crucial variable in the program studied, and careful monitoring of student outcomes in relation to teacher performance is advised. Overall, despite some early problems with student perceptions of difficulty and friction, participant satisfaction was high. (MSE)",

The course meets for three hours once a week, and focuses on three content or skill areas: language improvement, cultural issues, and teaching strategies. Each student must prepare at least four microteaching presentations to be videotaped and evaluated by the students, instructor, and outside experts. The program centralizes information and skill training for this group, but is intended only to enhance and not replace departmental training. It emphasizes small group work and benefits from interdepartmental cooperation. The program's major limitation is the lack of followup from the seminar. While observation of the trainees would be valuable for teacher certification and  program improvement, it would also take considerable time. An additional drawback is that the seminar does not carry credit, but must be taken in addition to a full-time graduate program and any other student work. The seminar has been found to be effective in improving oral communication and teaching skills among international teaching assistants, thereby contributing to improved teaching. (MSE)",

One assumption is that an effective instructional faculty and development program must reflect the culture and values of the institution. A second assumption about the instructional and faculty development program is that it should be applied to the problems that faculty encounter in their daily teaching lives. A discipline-specific philosophy is followed to assist departments in their efforts. CIDR analyzes instructional needs, provides alternatives, assists with  implementation strategies, and assesses results. Viewing CIDR as a small service firm led to the following ideas about its functions: to meet the needs of clients, to provide quality encounters between CIDR staff and instructors, to establish high visibility, and to monitor client satisfaction.

To achieve the goal to provide state-of-the-art computer rentals for students, faculty, and staff, a local area network has been used to share software, printers, campus mainframes, and lab management control. Descriptions are provided of the main lab, the control desk, and additional equipment. Information is provided on hardware such as Sixteen Apple Macintosh Plus's, 10 Kaypro PC 10's, and three Apple 2e's. It is noted that  demand has pushed the computer lounge to the limit of its computer access capacity. The result is that users are forced to sign a waiting list or make reservations far in advance. Additions to existing equipment has enabled the computer lounge to grow from a user base of 3,000-plus students to 4,000-plus students. Included is the computer lounge budget showing 2 school years.

        "description":"The future of Greek letter organizations on campus and the effects of demographic trends and societal changes are considered. In the last decade, Greek membership has increased despite the decrease in students between the ages of 18 and 24 entering college full-time. Greek chapters are primarily at four-year institutions and their members are mainly the traditional age full-time students. In 1984 more than 55% of students in higher education were at community colleges, and nearly 43% were enrolled part-time. There has also been a decline in freshmen entering college directly from high school. Demographic trends also affect residence halls, which in turn affect Greek membership. Greek chapters are suffering from a lack of alumni to provide guidance, financial support, and  networking. Topics of concern include: the influence of little sister/little brother organizations as adjuncts to collegiate sororities and fraternities; the use of gender education to improve the image of Greek chapters; the academic aspects of student life; and the problems of substance and alcohol abuse among Greek chapter members.

Two nationwide surveys were conducted, one of plaintiffs and one of university counsel. Six major lawsuits against colleges and universities were investigated by interviewing the plaintiffs and persons in their support networks, defendant faculty and administrators, and attorneys and judges. In addition, all academic employment-discrimination cases litigated in federal courts between 1972 and 1984 were reviewed to determine the win/loss record and the types and nature of the claims. From these data, conclusions are presented about the individual and institutional consequences of this litigation, and suggestions are offered to  academic leaders. The following topics are addressed: trends in academic discrimination litigation; consequences for plaintiffs; career consequences; consequences for institutions and their leaders; and implications for academic leaders, including criteria for making the litigation decision and alternatives to litigation.

The study affirmed the value of the academic life felt by the respondents and revealed the capacity of the two primary tasks of teaching and research to commit individuals to the academic cause and thereby infuse life with meaning. The results of this study are examined in relationship to other studies of academic life and works concerning a sense of calling in life, intrinsic versus extrinsic orientation, idealism, and the source of happiness in life. The conditions in higher education that undermine these feelings are reviewed: part-time work among college faculty, a weakening of the intellectual core of academic work (the simplification of academic work that  empties it of advanced content), and the lack of material rewards. Basic reform in higher education is called for to reverse these conditions. (KM)",

Warning institutions of higher education about possible problems in the economy will place them in a better position to react if necessary. The economic environment is discussed in terms of productivity (goods and services consumed by households, those provided by governments, capital investment, and net export); the twin deficits (the trade and federal budget deficits); and the future (the best case scenario and alternatives to the best case). The effects on higher education include general economic strains at the federal and state levels as well as on institutions of higher education. Proactive policies and higher education are considered in terms of  high technology and science, mid-level technology and industrial extension, foreign studies and modern languages, and the need for balance. Though there are few signs of immediate recession in the economy, there is still a need to reduce the federal deficit, bring down the trade deficit, and increase savings so the public and private infrastructure can be rebuilt. In this prospective environment, capital markets are especially volatile, and colleges should be cautious when borrowing. Endowment management will need special vigilance. Capital preservation will be the emerging standard for the 1990s. (SM)",

The scope of the higher education enterprise and its 1988-89 budget is discussed, including information on areas of increased funding and new policy initiatives and capital outlay funding. Budget issues that have long-term policy implications for consideration are: reform of community college finance; student financial aid; long-range facilities planning; cooperative intersegmental programs; and faculty development. The Governor's budget will continue to maintain the system of public and private higher education for which it is known, funding such responsibilities as enrollment growth, salaries, price increases, student financial aid, and capital outlay. Tables provide information on  general funds for the major expenditure categories in the state budget; expenditures for public postsecondary education; full-time equivalent enrollment in the University of California and the California State University; percentage changes in state general funds and enrollment for all public segments of California education; funds proposed for capital outlay at California's public colleges and universities; total state and local capital outlay expenditures at the University of California, California State University, and the California Community Colleges; and intersegmental programs contained in the 1988-89 proposed budget.

Both components involve partnerships between K-12 districts and institutions of higher education, with special emphasis placed on underrepresented students. This evaluation of the projects that have been funded under this program consists of the following sections: executive summary; history and background (program origins and goals, administration, program components and collaboration, funding history, and evaluation); curriculum development projects (project selection criteria, project impact, teacher  participation, local objectives, curriculum revision, continuing activities); diagnostic testing projects (project selection criteria, project locations and emphases, Mathematics Diagnostic Testing Project, High School Diagnostic Testing Program in Composition, writing exam for eleventh graders, project funding, project evaluation); conclusions; and recommendations. The curriculum development projects had a mixed record of success, as some were outstanding, some effective, and some ineffective, while the diagnostic testing project demonstrated considerable success. It was recommended that the program be continued at its present funding level, with cost-of-living adjustments, and with concomitant recommendations for annual reporting and a second comprehensive program evaluation.

Following a discussion of the definition of eligibility (eligibility on the basis of grade point average was used, with the successful completion of college entrance examinations also required in some cases), major findings are reported in the following areas: (1) overall estimate compared to Master Plan guidelines (14.1% were eligible for admission, compared to the estimate of 12.5%); (2) large  differences in eligibility that persist among ethnic groups; and (3) differences in eligibility between urban and rural areas. Charts display differences by sex, ethnic group and urban versus rural areas. Differential eligibility rates by ethnicity and by region are discussed as statewide issues, while overall estimates and resulting enrollment pressures are discussed as university policy issues.

The methodology, findings, and conclusions of each report are provided separately, and the reports themselves are appended, along with the survey instruments. A synopsis of the two reports shows several similarities in their findings: (1) a cluster of factors in both reports concerning students' financial needs and corresponding needs for extensive employment and a lower courseload; (2) changing majors; (3) difficulty in getting required classes; (4) taking courses for personal interest rather than for degree requirements; and (5) needing better or more timely advising. Two recommendations are made:  that the California Student Aid Commission carefully consider the implications of these studies in determining whether changes are needed in California's student aid programs; and that both universities should continue to try to reduce the negative causes of delayed graduation and should take action to improve academic advising and access to required courses.

        "description":"Barriers to administrative advancement for women in academe are discussed. A study of perceived managerial style and leadership skill of women two-year college presidents was designed to fill a gap in research during an era of significant advancement opportunities for women. Leadership in higher education in the United States is gradually changing; in the period from 1975-1984, there has been a 93% increase in the number of women chief executive officers. Still, in 1985, less than 10% of presidential appointments were women. Leadership image is one of the major problems facing women trying to rise to the top level of their professions, since role models are few. In college and university administration, women administrators do &quot;women's work,&quot; and they rarely serve as deans of  business, engineering, or technology. Problems include such specific on-the-job factors as differential reward systems, discrimination in pay or promotion, and lack of support for professional growth. Other findings include: the higher the rank, the fewer the women; the higher the prestige of administrative jobs, the fewer the women; and women are promoted more often in smaller steps, while men are promoted less often but make greater leaps.

The Arizona model is adapted to architectural education, and the special opportunities and challenges to be addressed by architectural educators who wish to document the quality and outcomes of their undergraduate programs are discussed. The Arizona model rests in the philosophical underpinnings that an undergraduate education should (1) help students acquire both general and specialized knowledge, (2) cultivate intellectual skills, (3) foster sound intellectual habits of mind, and (4) concern itself with student  development. Major principles to inform the assessment design include faculty leadership, use of existing data, a multidimensional view of quality, multiple sources of information, and multiple methods of assessment. Assessment in professional schools and for schools of architecture is discussed. The field of architecture faces special challenges and opportunities in assessing the nature, quality, and effects of its programs. It must confront and solve the issues of assessment purpose, benefits, politics, method, coordination, and support facing all fields. Architecture faculty must design their own assessment thinking, strategies, and techniques due to the paucity of sources of guidance. (SM)",

The questionnaire listed 25 economics professors and asked what the students had heard about the professors in five dimensions: hard to get an A or B from; easy to get a D or F from; requires hard work; intimidates students in class; and seems to care about students. Students were also asked which professor they would like to have, which they would least like to have, and which they would select assuming they wanted to work hard and learn a lot. Finally, they were asked which professor they had for which class, and whether they would recommend him/her to a  friend. Results included the following: (1) the reputation of some professors is not the same for all students; (2) one-fourth of the professors are expected to be easier by students who choose them; (3) most students do not express an opinion about the professor they would choose; and (4) most students who had not had a given professor had as much information about that professor as students who had taken a course with him/her.

Part II looks at a single system image in terms of the image; implementing the single system image; and issues for knowledge-based implementation. Part III discusses a new paradigm. It notes the paradigm for campus information systems turns from a mainframe-centered Ptolemaic model to a user-centered  Copernican model, thus making it necessary to redefine responsibilities.

The introduction briefly summarizes the purposes and rationale for the study as well as the data collection process. The major finding--a predominant concern with training that dealt with computers--is also noted. Section two provides an overview of the assumptions that underlie training in the instructional uses of technology. Examples of training efforts are used to illustrate how these assumptions influence the design and provision of training. The next section  discusses the roles of the various training providers and gives annotated descriptions of local school district technology projects, statewide technology training programs, regional technology training and support programs, and national demonstration projects on how new technology can contribute to learning, development and education. The report concludes with a discussion of some research questions that should be addressed in order to systematically examine the assumptions around which training practices are built, and to assess how training and support activities affect the instructional use of information technologies in the classroom. An annotated bibliography, selected references, and a list of persons interviewed are included. A chart summarizing state government efforts to promote  instructional computing is appended. (DJR)",

The three major goals of education are identified as preparing individuals with the computer skills needed for the job market, improving skill instruction, and increasing the productivity of teaching. It is noted that interest in using technology in schools at all levels is widespread, as evidenced by statistics on microcomputer acquisition and use, and special meetings to explore potential uses of technology. The importance of the computer as a tool for the improvement of instruction in the basics is discussed, and current programs in  The Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI) are briefly described. These projects include the MATH/TECH program for seventh through twelfth grade classroom application; Project Quill, which uses the microcomputer to help teachers teach writing to third through sixth grade students; a series of school-based technology demonstration sites using technology in the fields of science, mathematics, reading, and writing; the use of educational television to teach science through programs such as the \"Voyage of the Mimi\" and \"3-2-1 Contact\"; and the establishment of a Center for Technology at Harvard University to focus on key issues in education and technology.

Instructional technology offers the field of education an unprecedented opportunity to emphasize learning, increase teacher productivity and make more effective schools. Educators must face the reality that educational reform and technology are going to require a new way of looking at teachers, the teaching profession, and instructional methods. It is going to require a rethinking of the structure of the educational system to include more instruction outside the traditional four wall classroom, allowing more education in the home and in community centers. Computers will be able to assist in remedial work and higher skill work,  and in record keeping and monitoring of student progress which will free the teacher for other tasks. Technology will require a higher level of skills of teachers; they will need to know the tools (e.g., microcomputers, videodiscs, cable television and slow scan television) and how to use these tools effectively for such tasks as remedial work, building word vocabulary, or tutoring possibilities. Technology must be integrated into the educational program, and its use for both technological goals and educational goals must be maximized. This will require making necessary changes and adjustments to improve the current model or make a new one. Finally, educators need to be opportunity oriented, not problem prone, in focusing on technology in education. The result will be a more productive,  more efficient and more effective educational system delivering learning to all areas of the population. (DJR)",

The key to the expansion of education over the coming decades will be the computer, which, in every kind of setting from schools to the home to the library to the community, will enhance individualized instruction. This will present challenges not only in our own country, but in the international arena as well. When faced with such challenges this nation will turn to higher education for practical solutions. In accordance with the Reagan Administration's desire to promote less federal control and more state, local, and institutional autonomy in education, there will be no massive federal aid program to provide software and/or hardware for universities,  although currently funded programs--student loans and grants for innovative projects from the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE)--will help higher education to participate in the technology revolution. The specific contributions of higher education might be: (l) research that assists business and industry to advance the technological frontier; (2) education and training of scientific and technical manpower needed by business and industry; (3) preparation of all citizens to live in a technological society in which decisions are increasingly based on scientific and technological considerations; and (4) research on how best to use technology to advance education at all levels. The advantages of electronic learning can give greater access to education and more  extensive educational opportunities, and enhance the relationship between teachers and students. A great educational system can further expand by developing a more knowledgeable population and informed worker and consumer. An expanded and better educated population can assist American productivity at home and American leadership in the world. (DJR)",

One change is the gathering momentum of faculty members and administrators to become computer users. Another is the vast amount of individual and institutional effort invested in plans for integrating computing into the curriculum. Implementation issues that have presented problems for many institutions unwilling to learn from the experience of others are concerned with specific computer usage, faculty training, appropriate software, maintenance of equipment, cost effectiveness, and the actual process of integration. Today's campus leaders need to look at general classes of computing applications, such as their use for academic research, their role in  instruction, and their ability to enhance productivity for faculty, staff, and students, and to integrate computing into the curriculum in ways that recognize all three of these dimensions and their interdependence. Although other issues such as computer equity, standardization, and industry support of campus development activities need to be addressed, it would be unwise for colleges to wait around for \"ultimate answers.\" They would be better off pursuing an alternative that puts in place now broadly useful, affordable machines chosen for their ability to do identified work. Both campuses and the information-technology industry share the common goal of expanding the use of computing technology. To do this, all parties should acknowledge the cultural gap between academe and industry and  listen to each other. (DJR)",

The need to standardize hardware and software thus becomes an important issue. The first step in selecting a microcomputer standard is the selection of a search committee to determine the specific set of microcomputer needs on the campus. This committee should represent and consider the interests of four areas of concern: administrative, end user, technical, and training. In the second step, the selection of software, the end users, technical staff, and trainers need to concentrate on the best fit in the campus environment. Issues to be considered include flexibility, future needs, DOS  compatibility, types of training to be done, and the reputation of the vendor. Technical representatives on the committee will play a major role in the third phase, the selection of hardware. Technical factors to be considered will range from processor speed and display clarity to possibilities for upgrading the system. Ways to facilitate the fourth phase, implementation, range from getting end users involved in pre-installation planning, through running computer systems parallel with manual and exiting automated systems in the beginning and installing microcomputers in phases wherever possible, to taking ergonomic considerations into account when planning workstations.

The following questions were addressed: (1) which ITV programs are used and how do teachers rate them? (2) which subject areas used ITV most frequently? (3) what instructional procedures are used by teachers in presenting ITV to their classes? and (4) what programming needs do teachers see for the next three years? Results indicated that, overall, elementary teachers are the most frequent users of ITV; subject areas where ITV is used most are social studies, reading,  health education, science, language arts, and mathematics; teachers most frequently used ITV as a supplement to classroom instruction; most teachers used a series they had previously used and made use of a program guide with the series; teachers usually discuss the program with the class before and after viewing it; and suggested program needs closely follow present usage.

These two different conceptualizations of the transformational role of noncomputer cognitive technologies (such as written language) in human intelligence and cognitive change are sketched, and the different implications to be drawn from these conceptualizations are considered in relation to human thinking and the educational processes. Several examples of software as cognitive technologies are analyzed, and the advantages of the reorganizer approach are detailed. It is argued that since the cognitive technologies we invent can serve as instruments of cultural redefinition (shaping who we are by what we do), the selecting of values for  educational goals becomes important. Finally, it is suggested that the urgency of updating educational aims and methods recommends an activist research paradigm for simultaneously creating and studying changes in the processes and outcomes of human learning with new cognitive and educational technologies.

A major focus of the discussion is the effectiveness of the Mimi materials for classroom use, i.e., four microcomputer modules with manuals and a book version of the television show with classroom activity suggestions and additional factual information. The effects of the organizational features of the individual school systems on the adoption and diffusion of these materials are also discussed, using the  notions of multi-entry levels of technology and embedded context analysis to help describe and understand the factors affecting classroom change mediated by the introduction of technology. It was found that teachers were able to tolerate a wide range of conditions for working with the Mimi package, and that the teachers' work in the classroom seemed to be as much influenced by the technology as the technological applications were shaped by the teachers. Finally, it was also found that the school systems significantly influenced and defined the project goals for the teachers, so that individual experimentations by teachers in the classrooms had different impacts depending on the context of the wider systems in which they occurred.

It was found that videodisc use was important in both large group and small group instruction, that elementary school classrooms make extensive use of visual information resources, and that videodiscs can be used to meet this information need. Both students and teachers found the videodiscs--which permitted student and  teacher control over the pacing, access, and replay of information--to be a stimulating alternative to regular classroom instruction. However, it was also found that, contrary to assumptions held in the videodisc industry, teachers are neither simply consumers of existing videodiscs nor are they designers and programmers who possess the knowledge, time, and energy to redesign and retrofit videodiscs. It is suggested that teachers could, nonetheless, make valuable contributions to the videodisc design process. Four explanatory footnotes are provided. (27 references) (EW)",

        "description":"This report considers the progress of the introduction of computer-aided learning (CAL) into the curriculum, with particular emphasis on the situation in the Netherlands. It is argued that the major obstacle to further integration of computers into the curriculum is the rigidity of existing organizational and class structures, and it is suggested that further integration should be concentrated in those subject areas that have been known to be problem areas, such as mathematics or the mother tongue. In those areas, however, greater flexibility in the curriculum will be necessary in order to give CAL the chance to prove its usefulness. The effectiveness and the cost effectiveness of CAL are considered, and it is suggested that it is both CAL as a medium and the surrounding  organizational aspects that are responsible for the positive results. A four-phase model for the research, development, and implementation of educational software programs is presented, and the way this approach will be used in the Dutch situation is described. The text is supplemented by two tables, three figures, and a list of nine questions for discussion. (38 references) (EW)",

        "description":"This study used the sense-making approach of message-q/ing to examine how individuals arrive at an understanding of new technology, in this case, word processing. Subjects were 10 computer naive undergraduate students learning to use word processing as part of a course requirement. Using the WordStar program manual, subjects employed the message-q/ing technique by noting the points in their reading where they would like to, or feel the need to, ask a question, and briefly explain how receiving an answer to their question would have helped their movement through the situation. It was assumed that examining these signal stops (questions or gaps) and the accompanying uses could provide insight into how individuals using such training materials were &quot;making sense&quot; out of, or  constructing an understanding of the materials. It was found that 41% of the questions occurred at 12 places where two or more of the subjects identified signal stops of gaps, suggesting consistent patterns where individuals experienced gaps in their understanding of the training manual. At eight of the 12 places, it was found that the subject or topic requiring clarification was the same. It is suggested that this technique could be used by training manual designers to specifically identify and analyze users' questions and information uses in order to compare the sense-making patterns of actual users to those assumed by the designer of the manual.

Subjects were fifth grade students from nine classes, who were divided into three treatment groups in a nonrandom fashion: (1) computer-assisted group, which used computer software designed to help students improve spatial problem solving skills for one hour per week; (2) worksheet group, which used worksheets and seatwork exercises designed to enhance spatial problem solving skills for one hour per week; and (3) control group, which had no special instruction in problem solving. Students were pre- and posttested with the New Jersey Test of Reasoning Skills, the Sequencing and Analogies subtests of the Test of Cognitive Skills, and a seven-item noncommercial spatial test. A  Cognitive Skills Index (IQ score) for each student obtained in fourth grade was also used in the analysis. Results of multivariate tests indicated that the effects of group and sex were not significant, but the effect of schools was statistically significant. However, no significant differences were found between the three treatment groups, although all groups showed a gain from pretest to posttest. It is suggested that the use of computer-assisted instruction is less effective as a stand alone teaching method than it would be as a supplement to teacher instruction.

Subjects were secondary students in three general physics, four biology, three chemistry, and one history class taught under the systems approach, and an equal number taught using traditional methods. Pretests and posttests were used to identify subjects' ability, content-specific knowledge, and knowledge of systems thinking. The results indicated that students in the more advanced courses  (biology and chemistry) performed better on the systems thinking and computer-based activities. The physical science students performed well on the measurement-related problems, but did less well on the general problem solving or modelling-oriented exercises. Accordingly, these students were the least likely to generalize the systems skills beyond their course. The results raise questions about the applicability of the approach for different subjects and groups of students, and the question of why the impact of the innovation was more apparent in biology and chemistry must be considered.

        "description":"The similarities and differences in the responses student writers received from peer groups communicating face-to-face and by electronic mail were examined in this study. Subjects were 20 English/language arts teacher education students at the University of Virginia, who were divided into four groups with each group randomized to a treatment order (face-to-face or electronic mail first) and topic order. Comparisons were made on the number, tone, and content of writers' comments; writers' reasons for revisions; quality of final compositions; and writers' preference for a mode of communication when forced to select a single mode. Analyses of data obtained from the peer response sessions, follow-up interviews, and the students' compositions indicated that: (1) writers received equal  numbers of comments in the two modes of communication; (2) positive comments addressing specific, substantive features of writers' text predominated in both modes, although writers received greater numbers of these comments in face-to-face sessions; (3) few differences were found in writers' reasons for revisions, but they identified the advice of peers with equal frequency for both kinds of sessions; and (4) the final compositions were of comparable quality. It was concluded that electronic mail sessions may function best as a complement to rather than a substitute for face-to-face sessions. Implications are drawn for a prototype in which an electronic mail environment could provide the tools necessary for teacher education students to learn to write and to teach writing, and data for  the study are presented in three tables.

This model emphasizes the complexity and multidimensional nature of the system of variables in which such interaction is embedded. For this study, the association between gender and various usage and attitude variables was predicted by the model and tested with data from a representative survey of urban grade 11 students involving over 3,000 students from major urban areas in all 10 Canadian provinces. Analyses of the data reveal consistent gender differences in access to and usage of computers in each of three usage categories--recreational, home non-recreational, and school--as well as in  attitudinal variables associated with computer use in each of the usage categories. The theoretical importance of the study is found in the support the study gives to the multidimensional manifold model as a descriptor of the complex system surrounding adolescents' computer-related activities and opinions. The results indicate that it is inappropriate to make statements about what influences male and female adolescents to use or reject computers without considering the context of the usage.

The 58 libraries that responded to the survey provided information on 60 director searches and 176 assistant/associate director (AD)-level searches over the past 10 years. Analysis of these responses shows that there has been a pronounced change in the recruitment and selection of directors, and that there is a sharp distinction between procedures for directors  and for AD-level positions.

The PPP is designed to put self-help tools into the hands of library staff responsible for developing plans and procedures for preserving library materials. A study team of six librarians carried out the study, and an additional 29 staff members participated in gathering and analyzing data for this study, which was intended to develop a 5-year preservation plan. Recommendations for five major areas are presented in this report: Collections Conditions; Environmental Conditions; Organization and Procedures; Resources/Instruction; and  Disaster Planning. These recommendations focus on improving the environmental conditions of book storage, extending the capacity to repair and reformat damaged books, developing education/awareness programs for staff and users, and increasing preservation resources. Appended are the charges to the study team and to the task forces responsible for the five particular areas of concern, and a list of documents produced by the study. (CGD)",

Defined as comprising library skills and computer literacy, information literacy is discussed in relationship to school media centers, which have become key places for integrating skills and resources with subjects across the curriculum, and allowing students to develop proficiency in inquiry. This study summarizes information technologies useful in schools and reviews international information literacy programs to provide insights into ways that administrators, teachers, and  library media specialists can work together to prepare students to meet the challenges of the information age. Included in the discussion are (1) definitions and characteristics of information literacy; (2) the library media center as information center; (3) integrating information skills with the curriculum; (4) information technologies in schools; and (5) means of achieving information literacy. It is concluded that competent use of information can offer beneficial results to society-at-large, and that, conversely, information illiteracy can cause harm to individuals and to society.

        "description":"Arguing that providing instruction in the use of common indexes and abstract services is one of the most repetitious, most important, yet most time-consuming activities of the college reference librarian, this guide notes reasons why students fail to take full advantage of currently available guides to the use of common indexes and abstract services. These reasons include such common faults as illegibility, wordiness, and the use of jargon. Ways in which good printed guides can help reduce repetitious tasks and supply a vital supplement to group and individual instruction are then described. Offered here is a new series of 17 point-of-use guides which were created at the Oscar A. Silverman Undergraduate Library, State University of New York at Buffalo, to overcome the  aforementioned objections and to teach undergraduate students how to access basic information sources. Suggested as models of legibility and user-friendliness, these guides exclude extraneous information, supplying the minimal amount of information required to make effective use of a printed index. Instructions in their use are free of specialized vocabulary and guide the user in a step-by-step fashion. The introduction offers advice on instructional uses for such guides and on the mechanical details of their production. The 17 guides constitute the major part of the document. (Author/CGD)",

        "description":"This report analyzes the economic effects of the reproduction of intellectual property, i.e., books, journals, computer software, and audiovisual materials. A general economic model is presented in which direct appropriability (the marginal cost of copying is constant) and indirect appropriability (the marginal cost of copying is rising) appear as particular outcomes arising from particular assumptions regarding the marginal costs of copying. The model focuses on two aspects of private copying: the extent to which originals and copies are substitutes for consumers, and the technology for making copies from originals. Variants of the basic model, each of which is defined by a characterization of copying technology and substitutability, are examined in three cases. The model is  then applied to the problem of determining the royalties to be charged for making copies. The analysis in this report indicates that the effects of private copying differ considerably depending on the assumptions regarding the substitutability between originals and copies and the relative costs of producing copies and originals, which has important implications for the appropriate public policy to pursue regarding such copying.

        "description":"A survey of a random sample of students from five tertiary institutions in Melbourne was conducted in 1986 to determine the nature and extent of their usage of their own university or college and other libraries. Questionnaires were mailed to 1,996 students, of whom 999 responded. The questionnaire sought information on: (1) students' backgrounds; (2) the types of libraries used; (3) the frequency of that usage; (4) the primary reasons for using academic and public libraries; (5) the resources and services used in these libraries; (6) the degree of satisfaction with services offered; and (7) the nature and extent of course-related usage of public libraries. Other comments were also solicited. A complex network of information sources used by students in fulfilling their course  needs emerged from the study. Academic libraries were found to constitute the primary information source, with other sources, including public libraries, playing supplementary roles. It is noted that some of the traditional assumptions of the relative roles of different types of libraries are challenged by the data, and the final chapter explores some implications of these findings for planning library services in Victoria. Tabulated data are presented in 120 tables, and appendixes contain copies of the questionnaire and cover letter, a follow-up letter, additional cover letters, and respondents' comments.

        "description":"The object of this study was to assess the value of teaching online searching techniques to undergraduate students for the completion of a specific assignment in a human biology course, both as a research tool and as a means of supplementing the limited holdings of primary medical literature in a small college library. Students were divided into two groups, with one group using the online version of Index Medicus to obtain citations for the assigned paper, while the other group used the paper version of the index. For a second paper, the groups' use of online or paper versions was reversed. Responses to a questionnaire completed by the students indicated that they were satisfied with the results of their online searches, that online searching permitted them to find citations that  were highly focused on their topics, and that they were able to find the citations faster than by hand. Faculty found no difference in the quality of the papers based on the use of online or printed versions of the Index Medicus, but found that, as usual, the second research paper was better than the first one for students in both groups. Although students believed that online searching should be taught, they also strongly supported the teaching of the print versions of the online resources. A further evaluation of the use of online searching is now underway, using a CD-ROM version of Index Medicus, in order to determine whether such an online version can provide students with more opportunities to undertake online searching at no additional cost, and without the need for as much  assistance from the reference librarian.

Begun in 1985, the pilot project was an attempt to start the cooperative system by working with a small number of states. Twenty states initially responded to a letter sent to the chief officer in each state library agency explaining the project and inviting participation. Of these, 17 worked actively with the project for many months, and 15 were committed to sending data in 1986; 13 other states have expressed an interest in  joining the system in the future. All states are sending data in IBM compatible, machine-readable form, and a standard record layout has been prepared for use by all participants. At the time of this report, CES had successfully transferred data sent by four states to the mainframe and begun analysis. This report also summarizes previous efforts at coordinating state and federal data collection from public libraries, explains what was proposed and what was done in the pilot project, and makes suggestions for the future regarding the timing, management, and content issues that need to be settled before the cooperative system is fully operational. The text is supplemented by 27 attachments, consisting of documents and correspondence which illustrate the process used and the items discussed.  (12 bibliographic references) (EW)",

        "description":"A follow-up study was conducted in 1987 to assess the use and effectiveness of &quot;Minimum Library Use Skills: Standards, Test, and Bibliography&quot; (MLUS), which had been distributed to all members of the Wisconsin Association of Academic Librarians in 1985. Some copies of this publication had been sold, and it is also available in ERIC microfiche. A questionnaire was sent to the instruction librarians of 106 academic libraries (22 responses returned) in Wisconsin to determine whether they had used MLUS, and a similar questionnaire was sent to 490 high school library media specialists (30 responses returned) to determine whether they had used MLUS or &quot;Wisconsin Library Media Skills Guide&quot; (WLMSG). Responses to the survey indicated that there was a perceived need for standardized  library skills in both academic and high school libraries, and it is suggested that there is also a need for greater cooperation between the two groups in developing their bibliographic instruction programs. Less than 7% of the responding high schools reported using MLUS. Although WLMSG does address many of the competencies outlined in the more recent MLUS, it is suggested that needs would be better served if high school librarians were aware of what academic librarians were expecting of their college bound students, and conversely, academic librarians would better serve their students if they knew what backgrounds these students had. Copies of both survey instruments are appended. (EW)",

This survey found that: (1) there had been limited progress over the past decade and little evidence that public library services for older adults had kept pace with the increase in the number of persons aged 65 and older in the nation; (2) about two-thirds of the public libraries gave low priority to program development for older adults when compared to other age groups; (3) funds for these services made up no more than 2% of the budgets  of these public libraries; (4) staffing constituted less than 3% of the available workforce; (5) on average, less than 7% of the nation's elders were reached by public library service as defined by this survey; (6) the majority of public libraries had older adult volunteers and employees, although the proportion of the latter was decreasing; (7) the majority of the libraries worked with other community agencies in the aging network; and (8) services for older adults were not generally considered distinct program entities and there was no administrative structure for their overall coordination.

An introductory overview of transborder data flow (TDFs) is followed by a discussion of how TDFs have been dealt with by both the United States and Canada to date; a brief history of the most recent free-trade negotiations between the two countries; and an analysis of the foundations of the agreement on two levels that relate directly to TDFs--its possible impact on trade in services and its potential impact on foreign direct investment in Canada. The paper concludes with speculations about the long-term effects of free trade in the areas of trade in services and foreign direct investment as they  pertain to TDFs. (65 endnotes) (CGD)",

The goal of this project is to prepare the space station technical and managerial structure for likely changes in the creation, capture, transfer, and utilization of knowledge about the space station which might be useful to personnel involved in any aspect of SSP. Probable shifts in information system attributes are delineated, such as hardware capabilities, database techniques, knowledge representation formats, and user interface functionalities that are likely to occur over the total period of space station development. The next section describes the major types of SSP information stations that will be developed over the next several  decades. The following six sections analyze leading edge developments external to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that are apt to influence the development of these information systems, with particular emphasis on their documentation capabilities. Two final sections summarize the implications for NASA of these external developments. The functional requirements for the Technical and Management Information System and the Software Support Environment are appended. (182 references) (CGD)",

The basis of the network--the development, continuation, and linking of machine-readable databases and physical access points into the information resources of the state's libraries--is detailed and the shared resources provided in cataloging/interlibrary loan services, reference/database services, and circulation/interlibrary loan services are considered. Major aspects of the program are described, including funding, governance, needs, goals, and evaluation. Three major recommendations are discussed in detail: (1) the  development of access points into informational resources, and development and linking of databases to provide greater access opportunities to resources; (2) the facilitation of document request and document delivery procedures; and (3) the development of an ongoing education program on resource sharing. An appendix lists points to consider when developing cooperative arrangements among libraries, and details the operational guidelines of the Network Advisory Committee of the Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners.

        "description":"A study was conducted of remedial education programs in community and junior colleges and technical institutes in Texas to produce baseline data on the current range of remedial education practices and to assess the outcomes achieved. Every two-year college in the state (N=62) participated in the study, providing information on policies and practices related to assessment and placement, descriptions of the remedial programs, policies relating to remedial education course credit, program evaluation, and program strengthens and weaknesses. Study findings included the following: (1) all but three colleges assessed new students in reading, writing, and mathematics, typically reviewing national achievement test scores at the time of registration and administering standardized tests to  those students without test scores; (2) 27 colleges indicated that they did not use any specific procedure to determine assessment criteria, and only 15 colleges reported having conducted a systematic study to determine cut-off scores; (3) of those students assessed in reading and writing across the colleges, an average of 40% performed at a level that identified them as needing remediation; (4) of the students diagnosed as needing remediation, 52% enrolled in remedial courses in reading, 64% enrolled in remedial writing courses, and 63% enrolled in remedial math courses; and (5) all but two colleges offered remedial courses in reading, writing, and mathematics.

        "description":"An argument is put forth for restructuring the community college curriculum around recurring constructs common to all disciplines. First, introductory comments review various perceptions of essential learning, offering support for the position of constructivists and proponents of writing across the curriculum that learning is an activity and a process, rather than a body of knowledge. Next, the role of writing in the learning process is discussed, suggesting that writing assignments in any course require students to make connections and construct meaning. After summarizing the constructivist view of learning and language acquisition and applying it to academic learning, the paper identifies two constructs that are common to all disciplines: perceiving differences and dividing,  and perceiving similarities and connecting. Next, the relationship between writing and other constructs of thinking is examined, using examples provided by faculty attending a series of interdisciplinary writing seminars at Raritan Valley Community College. Additional examples of organizing perception and experience into coherent constructs through metaphor are provided, followed by a discussion of the implications of a constructivist approach for curricular change.

        "author":["Conroy, France H."],
        "description":"Arguing that the traditionally central position of genuine liberal learning in the college curriculum has been seriously eroded, this paper recommends that Confucian principles be incorporated into general education and faculty development to reinstill the element of \"learning to be human\" into the freshman and sophomore years. Part 1 suggests that instrumentalism has become the untempered ethos of the community college, and urges community college faculty to re-educate and revitalize themselves through certain strands within the Confucian tradition. A profile of the students attending non-elite colleges is presented, decrying a lack of openness to self-transformation, growth, or change; and a tendency toward pragmatism, careerism, consumerism, and self-interest. This section  also addresses the problem of a dominant pedagogy which actually reinforces educational goals centerd on money and status. Part 2 offers an overview of the process and major concepts of Confucianism, including jen (humanity or human-ness) and li (ritual action). The teachings of three students of Confucianism, Mencius (371-289 BC), Wang Yang-ming (1472-1529), and Liang Shu-Ming (1893- ), are reviewed with particular emphasis on their development of non-elitist and existential lines within the philosophy. In addition, Professor Tu Wei-Ming's current interpretation of Confucianism is also explored. In part 3, appropriate components of a Confucian-based pedagogy are suggested, including affective, aesthetic, moral, religious, and intellectual dimensions. Finally, in part 4, a discussion of  the application of these principles in a team-taught core interdisciplinary program at Burlington County College (New Jersey) is presented. Sixty-nine footnotes are provided. (EJV)",

First, introductory comments review the state regulations implemented in 1983 to govern general education at all New Jersey community colleges. Next, the paper explains the original charge and final recommendations of BCC's Committee on General Education. These recommendations resulted in the revision of all BCC degree and certificate programs in accordance with a new system of general education requirements. After contrasting general education at BCC before and after 1983, the paper discusses the organization of the current program within five categories: communications, humanities, social sciences, natural sciences and mathematics, and health and  physical education. Next, the paper explains that the committee originally recommended the development of five core courses to fulfill general education requirements in these areas, but when confronted with strong faculty opposition to the core course plan, they developed a list of existing courses that could be taken to meet the requirements instead. After presenting this list, the paper summarizes the major changes that have taken place in the general education program in the past five years. The next sections consider the effects of the curricular changes on enrollment and registration patterns. Finally, unresolved problems and concerns are identified. (EJV)",

After underscoring the importance of the computer in today's society, the paper identifies and discusses the following considerations in curriculum design: (1) the mission of the college to fulfill both career preparation and transfer functions; (2) the influence exerted by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), which has published guidelines for computer science, information systems, vocational-technical, and health computing curricula; (3) the needs of the business/industrial community; (4) the needs and interests of students; and (5) state mandates. In light of these considerations, several  conclusions about curriculum design are presented. First, programs should be designed to be viable for several years, given a two-year lag time for program development and rapid changes in technology. Second, no one curriculum will satisfy the needs of all students and the community. Third, the associate of science degree program in computer science cannot differ radically from the first two years of four-year college programs. And fourth, strong mathematics and science backgrounds are advantageous for computer science majors. A sample curriculum, based on ACM guidelines, and sample course descriptions are provided. (EJV)",

The RVCC experience in international education has evolved out of the perceived needs of the college community and the interests and expertise of faculty and administrators.

Cooperative learning techniques that have been identified by researchers include Teams-Games-Tournaments (TGT), Jigsaw, Learning Together, and Group Investigation. Ten basic steps for successful implementation have been identified. Cooperative learning is of particular interest for social studies teachers, because it promotes student  motivation and encourages group processes and positive social and academic interaction among students.

This paper addresses the university teacher education interest in enhancing supervisory effectiveness and the teacher education faculty during the initial planning stages and the development, demonstration, and dissemination years of the project. A description is given of the context of the collaborating school district. A directive from the superintendent to the principals in the district to investigate different models of supervision resulted in two years of self-study of supervisory effectiveness. This led to the school district's interest in joining with the teacher education faculty to mutually develop a program which would address supervision issues.  Successful practices are described and the way in which the project addresses some of the Holmes Group goals is summarized. (JD)",

One of the options considered was providing alternative routes of entry into the teaching profession. The Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) evaluated one alternative, the Teacher Trainee program, in order to determine, among other things, how the caliber of teacher trainees compared to that of other beginning teachers. It was suggested that, based on the findings of the study, the Legislature might wish to provide additional incentives for school districts to use this option as a means of increasing the supply of qualified teachers. The first chapter of this report provides background  information on the Teacher Training program. Chapter 2 contains an analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the CTC study. In Chapter 3, an outline is presented of options for expanding the program. (JD)",

Six questions were addressed: (1) How restrictive are state policies beyond coursework for entering the teaching profession? (2) How do states vary on restrictions for entry to the teaching profession? (3) Are there regional patterns of policy restrictiveness? (4) What do the findings suggest about the relation of political groups and structure to policy restrictiveness? (5) Are there patterns of state characteristics associated with restructive policies, and do these vary by region? and (6) What do the findings suggest about the professionalization of teaching? Results revealed that states with the most restrictive policies are those where the  policymaking process is dominated by a unified political elite, where the proportion of black students in the public schools is high, and where valuation of education is low. In most states, the application of restrictiveness across policy measures was inconsistent. Finally, professional educators are not associated with policy restrictiveness. (Author/JD)",

This last factor has lead to the development of an Outcomes-Driven Development Model (ODDM) which has made such high  academic achievement possible. The ODDM broadens the definitions of student outcomes to include far more than standardized tests, and identifies the major subsystems of the school which must be intentionally aligned in pursuit of high student achievement. This paper provides descriptions of the implementation of each of these elements in the JCSD program. (JD)",

The purpose of the study was to suggest how survey research can be used to examine teachers' perceptions of their performance in context and in comparison to their own values and to the values of administrators, as well as in comparison to administrators' assessments of teacher performance. Making such comparisons is seen as one way to identify what needs exist for instructional support in a particular district or school. Comparing teaching performance and values makes it possible to identify areas of agreement and discrepancy on what teaching performance is and what is valued by the  school administration. Findings of the survey revealed that in some cases, things that teachers felt they did well were in skill areas that were not highly valued by administrators. A discussion is presented on how such areas of discrepancy can serve as focal points for the formulation of staff development policies and programs. (JD)",

It is stated that \"the institutionalisation of 'action-research' and 'teachers as researchers' as approaches to teacher education within academic institutions raises a number of critical issues for tutors and supervisors to reflect about. If we are to facilitate reflective practice as a form of educational inquiry in schools then we must treat teacher education as a reflective practice also.\" Some of the issues to be faced  by teacher educators in promoting reflective practice and action research on the part of teachers are illustrated by detailed descriptions of three reform projects: (1) The Humanities Curriculum Project, under the direction of Lawrence Stenhouse (1967); (2) The Ford Teaching Project (1973-75); and (3) The \"Teacher-Student Interaction and Quality of Learning Project, (1981-83).

        "description":"This paper considers the discord that may arise in a teacher's thinking when there is a conflict between new technical innovations and the generally accepted aims and culture of teaching itself. Teachers share common ideas about what they do and why it is valuable; there tends to be agreement about what the collectively approved actions of teachers say about important matters in their, and their students', lives. While teachers' thinking and innovation are related (innovation is the remedy of dysfunction and teacher thinking is a way of diagnosing it), innovation introduced from the outside may cause troubling problems for the teacher. The conflict between what is considered \"good teaching\" and what the innovation demands then surfaces. Such a conflict is illustrated by a  description of the introduction of new computer technology into the classroom of an experienced English teacher. A discussion is presented on the philosophical question of the dichotomy between what a teacher considers just or fair for students, and the rewards offered by the bureaucracy for teaching computer literacy.

        "description":"The problem of meeting the demands of a rapidy expanding educational system is a common one to many developing nations. A major component of the problem lies in the fact that many of the teachers presently in the schools lack the necessary educational background that would permit them to enroll in advanced level programs in order to upgrade their qualifications. The problem has been addressed by various mature age entry programs in which students without the usual academic credentials may qualify for university entrance. This paper describes the Bachelor of Education Program in Primary Education at the University of Botswana, and looks at some of the entering characteristics of those students who constitute the first three intakes into the program and who have by now completed  it. The major focus of the paper documents the academic performance of those students during the program and makes tentative comparisons of their performance with those of students in a non-mature entry program. Entry characteristics are examined for predictors of success in the program. The paper concludes with a discussion of implications for this and similar mature age entry programs. (JD)",

The effect of teacher characteristics on the exam scores was found to be significant. Classes which did poorly on the exams were more likely to have had teachers with weak backgrounds. Conversely, classes in which the average exam score was 4+ (out of 5) were far more likely to have had teachers with strong backgrounds. In addition, classes in which teachers were inexperienced in teaching at the AP level tended to do less well while classes of teachers who had more than 10 years of experience teaching advanced placement classes did much better than average. Regression  analysis showed the interaction of the ranking of the teacher's undergraduate university and the teacher's undergraduate grade-point average in the AP subject to have a significant effect on student score.

The evaluation reported here consists of three major activities: (1) a statistical analysis of a district-wide data base, including demographic PRI use, and achievement data on more than 31,000 students; (2) structured interviews with principals and teachers in six schools in the district; and (3) an analysis of curricular match among PRI, California Achievement Test (CAT), and school reading curricula. Results indicate  that: (1) the use of the PRI was highest for the early grades and significantly lower in Grades 7 and 8; (2) the average student in Grades 1-6 took five to six mastery tests before Spring CAT testing; (3) the frequency of PRI use was not a significant determinant of reading or language arts achievement gains; (4) quality PRI use was associated with achievement gains in reading or language arts; (5) PRI instructional materials contain many good items, but require extra work to implement; (6) effective classroom management strategies are critical in using the system well; and (7) the TRACER reporting system is burdensome and error-filled.

The SMRT was administered to 1,979 third and 1,810 fourth graders in the fall of 1986 and the spring of 1987. The students were from nine Comprehensive Assessment Report (CAR) elementary schools in the three Community School Districts. Improvement in the students' scores supports the test's validity.

        "description":"In 1932, F. C. Bartlett first used the concept of &quot;schema&quot; borrowing it from Head, to suggest a unitary structure whose elements interacted in a complex way. This structure, which aimed to insure the continuity of the cognizing organism, was at the same time the expression of the functional principle responsible for the mutual interdependence among an organism, a human being, and the environment. Current research on cognitive processes frequently refers to the concept of &quot;schema&quot;, but interprets it as a formal structure that can be defined by its content and reduced to its several elements. The &quot;schema&quot; concept, as held by Bartlett, underwent a radical change as a result of R. C. Oldfield's transposition of the original definition into the human information processing conceptual  frame. U. Neisser and R. A. Schmidt interpreted the concept of &quot;schema&quot; so that it acquired a rule-like character as well as an anticipatory function. Only within the ecologically oriented interpretation of the cognitive processes does a true reappraisal of the meaning of &quot;schema&quot; as originally forwarded by Bartlett surface. The theoretical flavor of Bartlett's research exists in the ecological approach to the study of cognition. (TJH)",

National indicators are limited in breadth and depth and are neither sensitive to differences across states nor detailed and specific enough to be useful to states. For indicators to contribute to the goals of local educational improvement, local agencies must define their own indicators, and district policymakers must pass on similar discretion to their schools. For a system of indicators to be useful for educational improvement, it must provide adequate measures of those aspects of schooling deemed important and amenable to change through policymaking. A useful system of indicators requires measures of the content and quality of instruction and analyses and presentation of data directed to specific policy  issues. The following organizational factors help policymakers use data to make decisions: (1) a climate that supports planning and use of data; (2) commitment to improvement by district leaders; (3) stakeholder involvement in designing the data system; (4) technical expertise and data system support; and (5) an action system and resource for change. Indicators should match curricular goals and reflect the content and quality of instruction. Analyses of existing data should provide insight beyond aggregate measures; and school staff should be involved in specification, collection, analysis, and interpretation of data. (TJH)",

The subjects were 139 1985 spring and summer graduates of the Master of Education program at a large public urban university and 106 current enrollees. Because there were few minority students, a disproportionate number was chosen for study. There were weak associations between entrance requirements and indicators of success, particularly among minorities. Although students reported that certain professors gave lower grades to minority students, overall, the pattern was not statistically significant.  Although entrance requirements are not the primary indicators of grades among students admitted to this graduate program, minority students are less likely to meet entrance requirements, a discriminatory situation with implications for the education of minority students.

Professional orientation is characterized by a person's emphasis on growth/change, knowledge-based skill, decision-making autonomy, reference-group orientation, goal achievement, and loyalty to clients/professional associates. Central to this social-ecological perspective is the &quot;goodness of fit&quot; between the person's needs and the setting's demands. The sample included 242 classroom assistants, 473 teachers or head teachers, and 116 administrators or supervisors. A five-page questionnaire was  developed to measure the structural components of program size, legal structure, and type as well as the professional orientation of the centers and each person. Results confirm that persons are clearly influenced by the professional orientation of their work environment. However, further analysis is needed to understand the interaction effects of different combinations of the structural components if the results would be similar when controlling for the persons' role.

Three distinct groups of achievers (high, middle, and low) on a national standardized achievement test for physicians were identified. The number of functional distractors was identified for each sample condition and each item. Results suggest, as have theoretical analyses, that more functional distractors are desirable. However, with higher achieving students the number of functional distractors, and consequently the number of options, had no effect. The time and effort devoted to additional option item development is  probably not worth the gains in item discrimination and reliability for high and middle achieving examinees. The three-option format is efficient to construct, and it results in better domain-referenced measures of achievement. (SLD)",

In September 1986, 26 teachers from kindergarten through grade 12 were selected to participate in the ESA project. Goals were drafted and modified by project participants. It was proposed that participating teachers would select from four to eight goals for documentation. Near the end of the school year, each teacher met with the principal to reach agreement on the degree to which each set of Student Achievement Outcome goals  had been met. Experiences of the project indicate the possibility of developing an effective and equitable system of teacher evaluation along these lines. The Goal Assessment/Documentation Forms are appended, which guided the work of the teachers, three principals, and two instructional supervisors involved in the study. (SLD)",

Actual achievement is part of the answer, but the measurement of learning ability must occur independently of the assessment of prior knowledge. Intellectual capacities and situational and motivational factors have a bearing on learning-to-learn, but most research has focused on learning strategies. Differing methods proposed for the teaching of learning strategies are reviewed. Special curricula for learning-to-learn cannot generally be recommended, but may be useful for certain learners. It is usually considered necessary to instruct students to regulate and control their own learning processes in order to  reach autodidactic learning. Only recently has the question of learning-to-learn begun to receive research attention. A 10-page list of references and two flowcharts are presented. (SLD)",

The NTE is composed of two segments: (1) a Core Battery covering the communication skills and general knowledge skills; and (2) a test of professional knowledge about teaching. The processes used to establish passing scores for teacher tests, recommended study scores, scores established by the states, and implications of the passing scores are discussed. Each state determined the level of performance expected of a minimally qualified applicant for certification through establishment of a &quot;study score&quot; that a minimally qualified individual would obtain if a test were perfectly valid. The computed passing score takes errors of measurement into account. Twelve of  14 states using the NTE Core Battery adjusted passing scores below study scores. Passing scores ranged from 630 to 657, averaging 8 points below study scores. The average passing score on the professional knowledge examination of the NTE is 47 of 104 items, which is scarcely higher than chance. Practical considerations of candidate availability seem to preclude higher standards, but there is an apparent conflict between the stated goals of teacher certification testing programs and current passing standards.

        "description":"This paper discusses the role of perceived self-efficacy during self-regulated learning, the process whereby students' cognitions manifest themselves in behaviors systematically oriented toward the attainment of academic learning goals. The conceptual focus derives from A. Bandura's social cognitive learning theory. A model of cognitive skill learning is presented. At the outset of learning tasks, students vary in their self-efficacy for learning, or beliefs about their capabilities to effectively apply their knowledge and skills to learn academic content. As students work on tasks, they derive cues from task engagement variables that signal how well they are learning and that they use to assess efficacy for continued learning. Research is summarized showing the effects on  self-efficacy and achievement behaviors of task engagement (social, instructional) variables. Empirical evidence supports the idea that self-efficacy is a useful predictor of motivation and learning. The paper concludes with suggestions of ways to foster maintenance and generalization of self-regulated learning and with educational implications of the research findings. Seven pages of references are provided, and a figure of the self-efficacy model is appended. (SLD)",

The population model used in this study contains one exogenous variable; three endogenous variables; and eight indicator variables, two for each latent variable. Conditions of model misspecification included errors of omission of structural paths and simultaneous errors of omission and inclusion. All misspecifications were examined with sample sizes of 100 or 200. In general, the effects of omitting a path from one exogenous variable to another were less serious than were those of omitting a path from one endogenous variable to another. Adding a path from one endogenous variable to another endogenous variable affected the  estimation of parameters and standard errors less than any other misspecification. Overall, however, few blanket recommendations as to classes of errors most specifically affecting robustness of parameter estimates could be made. This study confirms that LISREL-type modeling should be undertaken only when there is guiding substantive theory. (SLD)",

Against a longitudinal mapping of student experiences, questions about standards or exit tests are addressed. Existing research on dropouts provided the empirical basis for the model. The central features of the model are the academic and social systems of the school. Individual student characteristics also enter the model and reinforce its longitudinal character. Existing research provides data on student characteristics common to dropouts, in-school performance and behaviors prior to leaving, attitudes about school and leave, and a limited range of out-of-school activities. These findings are integrated into the model. Based on the application of the model, it appears that: (1) dropping out is the result  of a lengthy process; (2) minimum competency graduation tests may play a pivotal role; (3) some such tests are notorious for failing a disproportionate number of minority students; (4) the attitude of school staff toward low achieving students is also crucial; and (5) research statistics on minimum competency tests is spotty.

Each issue is addressed via its theoretical context, key constructs, appropriate references to the literature, methodological aspects, and concrete examples of the feasibility of resolving the issue. ICAI systems use artificial intelligence and cognitive science to reach a range of subject matters. Several computer programs are discussed. The key components of ICAI systems include a knowledge base, a student model, and instructional techniques for teaching declarative or procedural knowledge. Research that has contributed to the development of ICAI includes research  into both formative and summative evaluation, measurement of student achievement outcomes, measurement of individual differences among students, and process measurement and analysis.

        "description":"Reported research and analysis concerning competency tests required for high school graduation and concerning dropping out of school point to ambiguous hypotheses about the effects of graduation tests on early school leaving. A review of the literature indicates the existence of data on the process nature of dropping out, the centrality of academics in dropping out, and the complexity of dropout behavior. Research efforts on the impact on student attrition rates of minimum competency tests as graduation criteria confront problems in the widespread unavailability, spotty nature, and incomparability of records kept on dropouts. Moreover, there appear to be significant differences across competency tests used for this purpose. In general, it appears that: (1) the effects of  graduation tests are marginal across the general student population; (2) minorities have experienced high failure rates on initial examinations and re-tests; and (3) different testing systems are likely to have different effects on school continuation decisions. An analysis of data from 50 states illustrates the need for generally available adequate statistics describing the effects of graduation tests and standards changes on school completion behavior.

        "description":"The methodological implications of using instructional information combined with the usual test item responses are discussed as they affect the linkage of achievement measurement and instruction. Models that expand those of standard Item Response Theory (IRT) are illustrated using achievement data from the United States sample of the Second International Mathematics Study (SIMS) (4,129 eighth-grade students). In the SIMS, opportunity-to-learn (OTL) responses were obtained from teachers and students corresponding to each item. The subjects' responses concerned whether or not the required mathematics curriculum was covered during the present school year and, if not, whether it had been covered in previous years. Focus was on the means by which modeling captures the fact that the  measurement relationship between the items and the latent trait may vary across student groups. This question is formulated as a problem of assessing item bias or instructional sensitivity in the items when item-specific OTL information is available. Approaches using traditional IRT methodology, the weakness of the item bias approach, a new method of assessing item bias that generalizes IRT modeling to allow for item specific variation in measurement relations across student groups with varying instructional background, and application of traditional and new methods to the SIMS data were addressed.

        "description":"The use of new extension of standard Item Response Theory (IRT) modeling of dichotomous items to include external variables is proposed. External variables may appear both as categorical grouping variables and as continuous variables; this requires the formulation of a model for the relationships between the external variables and the response items. The methodology is illustrated in the context of educational achievement test data from the Second International Mathematics Study (SIMS). Students' responses to algebra items administered at the end of the eighth grade are related to external variables in the form of background variables measured at the beginning of the eighth grade. The resulting structural model--multiple indicators and multiple causes--(MIMIC) addresses the  estimation of IRT item measurement parameters, assessment of the strengths of hypothesized antecedents to the student's latent trait level, detection of item bias (differential item performance), and testing and relaxation of IRT requirements of unidimensionality and conditional independence. The model also encompasses the LISREL formulation of K. G. Joreskog. With the SIMS data, the model proved useful particularly where there was an interest in post-test responses and where pre-test data were available. (TJH)",

The interim report, which is intended to provide an analytic and demographic framework from which to view the actual operations of local Chapter 1 programs, describes the background and purpose of ECIA and summarizes a wide range of information about those members of the population whom Chapter 1 is intended to benefit. The three goals of this report are the following: (1) examine all students who could be or have been called &quot;educationally deprived&quot;; (2) discuss impact of trends in childhood poverty on Federal  aid programs; and (3) analyze program beneficiaries. A range of possible changes in Chapter 1 provisions are suggested that would alter local school and student selection practices and focus the program more specifically either on achievement or on poverty, or on both. Notes to the two excerpted chapters are included. (PS)",

        "description":"This paper examines the research on how student-to-instructor ratio effects influence schooling, with particular attention to how the research relates to low-achieving children. It also summarizes the conclusions of several existing reviews of literature on: the effects on schooling outcomes of class or instructional group size; and scheduled, instructional, or engagement time. Findings include the following: (1) Reduced class size appeared to be most efficacious with low-ability or disadvantaged students when reductions were in the range typically associated with programs administered under Chapter 1 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981. (2) Such reductions can lead to better student and teacher attitudes and morale and to an enrichment of the core  curriculum. (3) Increases in allocated, instructional, and engaged time lead to increases in learning. (4) Allocated time shows a lesser relation to achievement than more proximal time measures. (5) The greater amount of allocated time given to Chapter 1 students may serve to lessen an advantage that more able students possess because they generally spend more time engaged in appropriate tasks. (6) Reductions in class size and increases in time can only produce positive effects if the following also is true: teachers are adaptable and have the skills and motivation to capitalize on these instructions; the material taught and tested fits together; and the strategy for accomplishing the reduced student-instructor ratio creates fewer barriers to learning than it breaks down.

        "description":"Past studies of compensatory education programs in mathematics show that they have not addressed mathematical concerns, have not had clear program goals, have had a narrow view of what constitutes evaluation, and have taught little that would improve students' mathematical abilities. In the future, compensatory programs for mathematics should address the following six issues: (1) the fragmentation of mathematics and the need to show the interconnectedness of ideas; (2) learning as passive absorption; (3) deskilling of teachers; (4) differential opportunity; (5) workbooks/tests as technology; and (6) change as ritual. In developing a contemporary mathematics program, one must consider that the roles and work of student and teacher are complementary and the emphasis should be on  creating knowledge rather than just absorbing the history of other people's knowledge. The teacher's goal should be to support, promote, encourage, and in every way facilitate the creation of knowledge by students. The report also discusses how conflicting ideas about individual differences affect the development of compensatory mathematics programs. A list of references is included. (PS)",

It recommends studies to explore the funding of programs designed to improve schools as educational organizations, rather than programs that are targeted to the individual student. Compensatory programs should be developed that: (1) do not put the blame for school failure on the student; (2) help children from poor homes achieve literacy; (3) promote adequate levels of achievement in literacy; and (4) make the school the appropriate (and perhaps the essential) unit for improving instruction in reading and writing. In support of the paper's arguments, a view of  demographic trends in students, homes, teachers, and schools is given and policy implications for compensatory reading programs are considered. There is also a brief discussion of a framework for developing a curriculum of literacy. Current curricula for &quot;regular&quot; and &quot;compensatory&quot; students are described.

        "description":"This paper discusses ways that students can better be taught to think. It argues that poor/low-achieving students served by Chapter 1 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 could genuinely profit from instruction on thinking and that, for maximum impact, such instruction should be introduced as a course in itself, separate from the regular curricula. The paper also discusses some of the major issues and options to consider before adopting a course on thinking skills for any students. This discussion focuses on and criticizes six useful and successful existing programs on thinking skills, and then describes a new program called &quot;Odyssey: A Curriculum for Thinking&quot; (M. Adams, 1986). This program, jointly developed by Bolt, Beranek and Newman, Harvard University,  and the Venezuelan Ministry of Education, was conducted solely in Venezuelan &quot;barrio&quot; schools serving students of low economic status and minimal parental education. In the discussion of all seven programs, particular attention is paid to the distinction between macrological and micrological approaches, and to the special needs of Chapter 1 students. The paper is organized into the following sections; (1) the current status of curricula on thinking; (2) what works and why; (3) the Odyssey program, including an outline of the lessons and an evaluation; and (4) conclusions.

        "description":"This paper reviews research on school effects and teacher effects on student achievement. In general, academic learning is influenced by the amount of time that students spend engaged in appropriate academic activities. Students learn more efficiently when their teachers instruct them actively by structuring new information and helping them relate it to what they already know, and then monitoring their performance and providing corrective feedback through recitation, drill, practice, and application activities. Schools that foster progress in academic achievement tend to be those that place a high priority on achieving and adopt high but realistic expectations, coordinated instructional efforts, and periodic assessments of progress. Elements that lead to success in the  traditional whole-class instruction approach are discussed at length. Adaptations of those elements for grade level, subject matter, and student socioeconomic status/ability/affect are pointed out. Research on the following topics is also discussed: (1) conceptual change teaching; (2) teaching cognitive strategies; (3) mastery learning; (4) individualized/adaptive instruction; (5) computerized instruction; and (6) effective instruction in special education and resource room situations.

A function assumed by several conference participants was to act as reactor to papers written for a particular session. Critiqued in this report are five papers presented at the session. The papers bring out two salient points. First, the papers taken together state essentially that the way reading and math is being handled in most Chapter 1 programs is ultimately dysfunctional for the target children, but that the addition of a separate thinking skills program would be welcome. Second, two of the papers indicate that the  research designed to develop generic principles of instruction does not yield specific prescriptions for teaching but rather has generated a set of concepts which are useful in deliberating about teaching decisions in particular contexts. The report goes on to discuss the following issues pointed out by the assessment papers: (1) goals for Chapter 1 students; (2) characteristics of the learners; (3) subject matter; (4) the role of the teacher; and (5) milieu. Though the papers offer no simple solutions, they raise critical questions about such topics as minimum standards, individual differences, test-driven instructional strategies, and equity and excellence.

        "description":"This conference reaction paper tracks some of the common themes that run through five papers presented at the same conference at the session on curricular and instructional issues in compensatory education with special reference to Chapter 1 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981. The reaction paper attempts to interpret the diverse lines on inquiry represented in the five research papers and establish a general framework for thinking about compensatory education programs. It focuses on basic conditions that seem to account for how instructional effects are achieved. The five papers make a case that the conventional wisdom of instructional design for compensatory education is wrong. Mastery-type plans with their emphasis on small steps through the content may  prepare students to do well on standardized achievement tests, but the validity of that criterion for judging what students know and are able to do is questionable. Compensatory students are getting higher scores on standardized tests, but their ability to do schoolwork independently is not improving. These papers suggest that the instructional designs typical of compensatory education fragment the educational experiences of students and, thus, fail to provide them with the coherent mental representations necessary to do schoolwork. This effect appears to be especially pronounced when students are grouped apart from their peers for remedial instruction. These conclusions point to a need for redirection at the level of curriculum and instruction. That redirection is likely to require a  fundamental change in how Chapter 1 is designed and administered. A list of references is included. (PS)",

        "description":"Strategies to involve parents in the schooling of their children, especially parents of economically or educationally disadvantaged youngsters, are generally either advisory or collaborative. Advisory strategies structure parental involvement through councils at the school or district level. Collaborative strategies pursue various methods for enhancing home/school cooperation, with either school-based or home-based methods. This paper discusses these two strategies and their rationales. Studies of the involvement techniques indicate that school-based strategies have limited direct value for low income parents, whereas home-based strategies such as parent tutoring, seem to yield positive outcomes for all participants. In developing policy, the paper considers the following three  broad questions about parent involvement: (1) Does it work? (2) Should it be a policy priority? And, (3) is it a feasible target for policy? The success of parent involvement efforts depend to a large extent on teachers' and administrators' believing that they will succeed. The paper concludes with guidelines for parent involvement policies. Recommended are policies which have an element of pressure, based on the incentives, values, and priorities that influence the behavior of teachers and administrators.

The second section of the paper presents an analysis of assumptions that have guided policymaking. It also points out some of the  consequences of these assumptions, which are, in part, grounded in suspect beliefs about how children learn or fail to learn.

It focuses on what happens to students in Chapter 1 programs and how their experiences affect their growth in academic achievement. The paper begins with a brief background description of services provided by Chapter 1, the extent of the program, and the disappointing results of federally funded compensatory education programs as revealed especially in the Sustaining Effects Study (Carter, 1984) which evaluated Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the predecessors of Chapter 1. Next, the paper discusses grouping, instructional, and interactional processes that occur  in Chapter 1 classes and their relationship to achievement. Finally it examines the process through which students are designated as eligible for Chapter 1 services. Among the findings are the following: (1) The greater success of Chapter 1 in first grade may be because Chapter 1 students receive more instructional time and higher quality instruction in first grade than later. (2) Since many students receive Chapter 1 services for only one year, their participation in compensatory education may not be sufficient to produce long-term benefits. (3) Since only the lowest achievers are retained in Chapter 1 programs across grades, long-range effects are not likely to appear because achievement is generally small with this population of students, regardless of the kind of instruction they  receive. (4) Very low-achieving students may be more vulnerable to the negative effects of low teacher expectancies and labeling. A list of references is included. (PS)",

This reaction report focuses on the relationship between compensatory education and regular education in response to papers prepared for the conference by Allington and Johnston, Hallinan, and Griffin. Research by others who have analyzed aspects of these issues is also considered. Comments are based on a series of studies concerning the implementation of educational reforms affecting low income, minority, handicapped, and female children. These studies were guided by a model for understanding the educational system called  the &quot;service quality model.&quot; The model emphasizes the importance of analyzing practices at multiple levels of the educational system that affect service quality. Some key features of the model are briefly described. Next, the following issues are analyzed by drawing on the service quality model and on the specific research cited at the beginning of the paper: (1) program coordination; (2) Chapter 1 programs as within-class ability groups; (3) staff development; (4) effective schools research and compensatory education; and (5) the current status of children at risk. The paper argues that Chapter 1 has had limited impact not only because the categorical program strategy has significant shortcomings, but because any reform strategy confronts deep-seated organizational, political, and  psychological dynamics that frustrate change.

These recommendations are the following: (1) funds should be concentrated in schools in neighborhoods with high percentages of children living in poverty, and funds should not be cut off from these schools when achievement increases; (2) the allocation of funds should be school-based in high poverty areas; (3) families should be involved in activities that enhance the educational capacity of the home and reduce home-school dissonances; (4) Chapter 1 funds  should be set aside to support projects which evaluate and add to the knowledge of educational disadvantagement; (5) schools should be allowed to use Chapter 1 funds for training, technical assistance, and capacity building; (6) Chapter 1 services should enrich students' understanding of school subjects, rather than providing only remediation of basic skills. A list of the papers and the panel members is included. (VM)",

The sample represents about 20 percent of national enrollment in public schools in 1968 and close to half of all minority enrollment. Data are presented to support an analysis of the relationships between desegregation plans, levels of integration, and enrollment trends. Nationwide patterns in enrollment and desegregation efforts are summarized. The findings include the following: (1) segregation declined in 117 of the 125 districts; (2) eight districts were more segregated in 1984 or 1985 than in 1968, but five of these had not implemented a plan; (3) plans that used pairing and clustering, particularly in combination with rezoning,  resulted in more desegregation than other types of plans; (4) white enrollment showed a pronounced decline; (5) some of the decline in white enrollment was associated with plans that used bussing; (6) in spite of these declines, 74 districts increased the exposure of minorities to white pupils; and (7) in six districts white enrollment increased. Demographic and statistical data are presented in tables and appendices include a bibliography of desegregation plan documents consulted for this study listed alphabetically by state and district.

Since 1983, school reform has been at the top of the national agenda; however, there is a disturbing gap between rhetoric and results. After travelling to some of the nation's largest cities and interviewing administrators and teachers, Carnegie Foundation representatives determined the following priorities for improving urban schools: (1) affirm that every student can succeed; (2) build an effective governance arrangement for urban schools that ends excessively centralized, bureaucratic control; (3) introduce at every school a comprehensive system of renewal that emphasizes preschool and early education, breaks schools into smaller units, defines curricular goals, ensures flexible scheduling, and improves  facilities; and (4) create a network of support beyond the school that empowers parents, and involves community, business and government participation. A new National Urban Schools Program is proposed which would: (1) incrementally increase funding of Head Start so that all eligible children are served by the year 2000; (2) increase the appropriation for federal child nutrition programs; (3) each year increase the funding for Chapter 1 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act by 5 percent; (4) add to the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act a provision enabling poor parents to place their children in afternoon and summer enrichment programs; (5) make summer fellowships available for teachers; (6) make available to school districts low interest loans to improve school  facilities; (7) encourage schools to introduce new curriculum or scheduling arrangements; and (8) encourage cooperation between schools and postsecondary institutions.

A more restrictive definition of compensatory education is used in this current report, whereby only programs in which a specific target population is named and in which district discretion in spending state funds is restricted qualified for inclusion. An appropriate State Department of Education official from each of the 23 states BARG included as having an SCE program was interviewed to determine any changes since the prior year's report, and data was also collected from 10 more states for a total of 33 contacted. Based on the tighter definition, it was determined that as of the 1984-85 school year,  16 SCE programs existed nationwide.

A major focus is how these frameworks differ from those of Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, the program which Chapter 1 superseded. The formal framework of Chapter 1 includes statutory provisions, federal regulations, Education Department guidelines, and congressional interpretations that are published and disseminated widely throughout the 14,000 participating school districts. Informal frameworks are Education Department correspondence and written instruments and instructions that the programs generate. The frameworks are discussed in the  following three categories: (1) federal management and oversight; (2) state management and oversight; and (3) local implementation. In general the legal provisions were found to be consistent on all levels after technical amendments and other adjustments are considered. There has been some success in the efforts to reduce the length, prescriptiveness, and complexity of the legal framework. Some inconsistency was found in ensuring service equivalence, but the solution for this lies with administrators and the fairness with which personnel is assigned. (VM)",

The following variables are examined for elementary schools: (1) school climate; (2) compensatory education related characteristics; (3) demographic characteristics; (4) student mobility; and (5) reading and math achievement. The following variables are examined for high schools: (1) school climate, specifically school misbehavior; (2) participation in Title I; (3) demographic characteristics; (4) reading and math achievement; and (5) dropout rates. Students enrolled in elementary and high schools with high concentrations of poverty are more likely to be Black or Hispanic, speak a language other than English, and have low achievement. The principals of these schools are more  likely to report that student behavior is problematic than principals in low concentration of poverty schools. Students in high poverty concentration schools generally have lower achievement than those in low concentration schools even after taking into account student and family characteristics. However, achievement appears to increase at the same rate in both types of schools. Other than for students in the early grades, attending a school with a high concentration of poverty will not necessarily put a student further behind in achievement than his or her peers in low concentration schools; however, students in high concentration schools will continue to fall behind their peers in schools with relatively few students living in poverty.

Examination of data from the 1976-79 Sustaining Effects Study of Title I revealed the following major conclusions: (1) small positive gains in reading achievement are related to participation in Title I programs; (2) the estimated impact of Title I on children's achievement is sensitive to the definition of a control group; and (3) teacher judgment may be included in the selection and achievement process. The results of the analysis do not clarify the issue examined; results are dependent upon the formulation of the control group: one formulation used in the study showed positive results of Title I on achievement while the  other three used generally showed no effects. There are the following possible explanations for this inconsistency: (1) the specification of the process by which students are selected for Title I services is critical; and (2) the measurement of program participation ignores variety in the services provided and in the intensity of participation.

Among the conclusions were the following: (1) the general lack of substantive influence of parents on program decisions is due, in part, to constraints inherent in local project operations; (2) the drop in the number of formal parent councils that occurred when Title I was replaced by Chapter 1 did not translate into an equally drastic reduction in parent participation; (3) state factors had only a  minimal influence on local parent involvement activities, but local factors appear to be much more influential; (4) under Title I many districts ran programs designed to engage parents in their children's learning, and this practice has continued under Chapter 1; and (5) districts were much more likely to involve parents as tutors with their own children at home than they were to bring parents into the classroom to assist in the instructional process.

Yet Chapter 1 participation rates have always been lower for nonpublic school children than they have for public school children. School size and problems of definition are two factors that account for this difference. This study, which examined the 39 larger districts in Massachusetts, explores the resulting variability after taking size and definitional problems into account. Among the conclusions are the following: (1) the absolute size of the Chapter 1 grant to a district appears to be a strong predictor of nonpublic school participation; (2) there is a strong correlation within districts  between participation rates for public and nonpublic schools; (3) the same criteria for determining eligibility for Chapter 1 programs are used for students enrolled in public and nonpublic schools; (4) coordinators and nonpublic school principals viewed the relationship between the Chapter 1 program and the nonpublic schools as excellent; (5) having too few eligible students within a school was a problem faced more by out-of-district than within-district nonpublic schools; (6) the best measure of participation rate is the number of participants as a percentage of low-achieving Chapter 1 attendance area residents in participating schools. The characteristics of Chapter 1 students attending public and nonpublic schools are discussed. Tables and figures illustrate the data. Data sources are  listed in an appendix. (BJV)",

Concentration grants are intended to provide additional assistance to areas with especially high numbers or proportions of educationally disadvantaged children. Under the current concentration grant formula, only LEAs in counties with more than 5,000 formula (primarily, poor) children, or where such children constitute more than 20 percent of the school-age population, may receive concentration grants. Two different versions of H.R. 5, legislation to amend and extend Chapter 1, were passed by the houses of Congress in 1987, and this bill currently awaits final  conference committee action. Each version of H.R. 5 would substantially revise the Chapter 1 concentration grant formula. This report provides background information on the concept of Chapter 1 concentration grants, and an analysis of the distribution of concentration grants under the current law as compared to the two H.R. 5 formulas.

Although employers look for a high school diploma, they appear to be less interested in grades or competency than in previous work experience. For most entry-level work, employers want an employee competent in the basic skills; they generally do not seek more advanced reading, writing and thinking skills. In fact, work-related social skills and habits are as important to  employers as the basic skills: workers should present themselves well; be enthusiastic, responsible, cooperative, disciplined, flexible, and willing to learn; and show a general understanding of the workplace and business world. However, workers with these attributes are scarcer than those with the required core of academic skills. While schools should certainly develop higher order academic skills in all students, they should also ensure that students learn all the basic social and academic skills needed for an entry level job.

        "description":"The importance of parent participation in a child's education is undisputed, and low-income urban parents can and want to help with their children's schooling, both at home and at school, as much as do middle class parents. However, most poor urban children live in single-parent, female-headed households--often Black or Hispanic--and many school officials tend to decide in advance that single and working parents cannot be approached or relied upon. Since parents' involvement in school activities can be related to the flexibility of leave policies on their jobs employers should be encouraged to allow flextime to enable working parents to observe their children in the classroom or attend meetings. Home-based learning is one of the most efficient ways for parents to spend their  time; when teachers help parents help their children, these parents' activities can be as effective as those of parents with more education and leisure, whom teachers expect to help their children. Suggestions are offered for improving both school-based participation and home-based learning. A list of references is included. (BJV)",

The first, &quot;Using the Nominal Group Technique To Determine Priorities for Vocational Education Research,&quot; (Richard L. Lynch, and others) describes a conference of 23 key thinkers representing business and industry, public policy, and educational research. The Nominal Group Technique was used to develop consensus on broad categories that should have implications for future vocational education research. These categories are competencies, content, and instructional methods; equity and access; vocational education data; policy; communications, marketing, and public relations; and delivery systems and levels. In the study described in &quot;Future Research Priorities as Identified by Major Providers of  Vocational Education Research,&quot; (B. June Schmidt, and others) 49 providers of research and development (R&amp;D) were identified; 63 percent completed questionnaires from which were compiled organizational mission statements, existing R&amp;D, important findings and conclusions, and priorities for future research. Tables and appendices provide (1) the mission statements; (2) 122 priority areas categorized in six groups (program development and improvement, policy studies, effectiveness, basic skills development, collaborative relationships, and personnel development); and (3) status of existing R&amp;D projects. The third paper, &quot;A Summary of Trends and Issues with Implications for Research and Development in Vocational Education,&quot; (by faculty of Virginia Polytechnic Inst.), reviews societal  characteristics and trends, economic trends, and technological change and lists implications and recommendations for vocational education research.

Most of the youths have previously been institutionalized, and many are retarded and have other handicaps such as learning disabilities, epilepsy, and speech and language disorders. All students qualify for special education services and attend a high school program serving students who are emotionally disturbed. Students are placed into job sites by a vocational trainer, taking into account student preferences, geographic accessibility, and student behavior. Students are first placed in nonpaid positions, then moved into paid positions when they have completed two nonpaid training positions and are within two years of graduation. Although  most students learn to do work tasks quickly, training focuses on the acquisition of associated work skills necessary to maintain the work placement. Trainers work with the students during the initial phases of training/placement, then gradually withdraw until students can work independently. Many of the 15 placements have been successful, although 8 students were fired for inappropriate behavior. The program has been functioning for five years and has demonstrated that students with serious emotional disturbances can be prepared for competitive employment in community work experience placements.

However, memory and thinking in daily life are not separate from, but are part of, doing. This study is based on a theoretical framework that encompasses an integrated account of mind in action. This \"activity theory\" holds that neither mind as such nor behavior as such can be taken as the principal category of analysis in psychology. The starting point and primary object of analysis is the actual process of interaction in which humans engage the world and each other. This study used observation of assemblers carrying out their jobs of filling milk cases in a dairy plant under normal working conditions. Descriptions resulting from these observations enabled the creation of job simulations  to observe performance under more constrained conditions. The observation of workers and later of secondary school students in simulated situations showed that the workers acquired nonliteral least-physical-effort strategies simply through doing. Many reached optimal performance without teaching. The study found that in some circumstances, the operations of the hand are functionally equivalent--the head takes over for the hand. The study suggests that practical thinking is orderly, that it exhibits certain common characteristics in a variety of life activities, and that it is amenable to scientific understanding. (KC)",

The research was carried out over a 6-month period from April to October 1987. The research strategy involved three stages: a review of the literature on continuing education funding, a survey of 1986 continuing education expenditures in Ontario school boards, and six case studies of continuing education programs in a sample of Ontario school boards. An analysis of the data gathered found five key issues and five subordinate issues. Key issues are as follows: (1) the average expenditure per continuing education average daily enrollment in 1986 for the province as a whole was  $2,816; (2) it is unlikely that current differences in rates of pay between continuing education and day school teachers will remain, especially in the case of credit classes for which certificated teachers are required; (3) expenditures per pupil for continuing education programs are less than those for day school programs in large part due to the lower levels of service being provided; (4) adult continuing education is the &quot;frontier&quot; of educational development and is in a state of disarray; and (5) the lack of provincial funding for all general interest courses deprives some groups of this service and the opportunity to enhance the skills and health of Ontario residents.

The technical institutes in question are postsecondary institutions that offer both day school and adult extension programs. The study focused on the actual process of curriculum design and decision making rather than on the changing content of vocational education or administrative structures. A survey instrument was sent to 497 individuals from the following 10 key decision-making groups: the Minnesota State Board of Vocational-Technical Education; state board staff; technical institute directors, assistant directors, adult directors, curriculum specialists, financial aid coordinators, counselors, and instructors;  and employers of technical institute graduates. Eighty-two percent of the surveys were returned. The greatest disagreement was between technical institute instructors and directors, employers and state board staff, and employers and technical institute directors. However, even the groups that disagreed the most still managed to agree 80 percent of the time. A detailed scenario for postsecondary vocational education curricula in Minnesota in the year 2000 was developed on the basis of the data obtained during the survey. The paper concludes with a scenario listing things that were deemed likely and unlikely to happen in the following areas: needs assessment, program access, articulation, program purpose, content identification, student evaluation, program format, lesson structuring,  learning resources, and program evaluation.

These negotiations can range from students offering nondisruptive behavior in exchange for a relaxation of academic standards to students offering certain behaviors in exchange for a release from involvement in certain problem-solving or decision-making tasks. Despite the pervasiveness of the problem, vocational teachers can renegotiate vocational instruction in a way that will increase the likelihood of their being able to engage students in the development of analytical and critical thinking skills. First, problem solving, decision making, and analytical thinking should be made an explicit part of  instruction. This can be accomplished by infusing basic skills instruction into vocational course work and having students participate in group management of entrepreneurial projects. Vocational teachers must be given detailed training in the importance of analytical thinking and problem solving along with training in methods of teaching these skills to students. On the institutional level, it is important that vocational educators and policymakers make a joint commitment to providing vocational instructors with the time and resources necessary to prepare for and implement more academically integrated instruction. This could include hiring more classroom aides and/or curriculum specialists and developing entrepreneurial projects or relevant curriculum resource centers.

Electronic mail even permits communications with other persons and institutions throughout the world. Microcomputers, especially when coupled with the capabilities of word processing software, graphics packages, and course authoring templates, can dramatically  speed up and improve the course development and instructional materials production process. Computer-assisted and computer-managed instruction have both proved extremely successful at universities throughout the world, including the British Open University, Miami-Dade Community College (Florida), and North Island College (Canada). Courseware can easily be distributed via computer in the form of computer-assisted learning lessons rather than in printed form. Computer conferencing is another computer-mediated communications system that has proved extremely valuable in distance programs throughout the world. Microcomputers can also be used by distance learners to register for courses, request instructional materials, or complete various administrative forms (such as changes of address). The  paper contains a brief foreword, written in German, by Helmut Fritsch. (MN)",

        "description":"This document is intended to stimulate the development of a statewide system to support the improvement of teaching in Maine's secondary vocational schools. It is arranged in three parts. Part 1 assesses the professional demands on Maine's vocational teachers in the following competency areas: understanding students, managing the laboratory environment, manipulating knowledge, and using productive teaching strategies and teaching decisions. Part 2 builds on the principles established in part 1 to construct the framework for a model for developing teaching skills, knowledge, and judgment. In the third part of the document, nine suggestions are made for providing beginning vocational teachers with appropriate preteaching experiences, for beginning teaching, and for continuing  teachers' professional development. The following are among the suggestions made: (1) provide mandatory preteaching institutes at regional sites for new entrants to the profession who have had no introduction to teaching; (2) use experienced vocational teachers and specialists to conduct the institutes; (3) train administrators, veteran teachers, and specialists in the principles of mentoring and make them available for individualized mentorships and small group seminars for at least two years; (4) involve all secondary vocational educators in training designed to create a common language of teaching for the state's vocational schools and use it in professional development activities; and (5) make instructional development in the vocational setting a major and continuous focus of regional  resource networks, state educational administrative bodies, and professional associations.

Some of those organizations, especially museums, are using volunteer service agreements to attract and hold volunteers and to enhance their experiences while increasing their usefulness to the museum. Volunteer service agreements spell out what is expected of volunteers in terms of knowledge, experience, amount of work time, attendance at training courses, and other items, while also spelling out the obligations of the museum to provide insurance, learning opportunities, training, and so forth. Volunteer managers should seek input from volunteers when setting up  and developing programs to meet their training and continuing education needs. Continuing education programs should be self-directed as far as possible and should have built-in evaluation processes. Volunteer service agreements allow volunteers to take greater responsibility for their own learning with concommitant enthusiasm and dedication to the museum, while allowing volunteer managers to grow in their jobs; such agreements align the activities of both with the mission of the museum.

        "description":"Following a review of literature that uncovered conflicting evidence about the effectiveness of formal and informal methods of finding a job, a study was conducted to test the hypothesis that informal methods (such as personal contacts) were more effective for young adults. Data were collected on a group of Southern rural, poverty-level, fifth- and sixth-grade youths in 1969 (N=1,503), again in 1975 when the youths were expected to be high school juniors or seniors (N=926), and again in 1979 when the youths were three or four years past high school (N=544). Questions asked related to the youths' occupational aspirations in the early years and in high school and to how those aspirations had turned out a few years past high school. An attempt was made to determine life satisfaction  and correlate it with job held and method of obtaining the job, whether formal or informal. Groups studied were white and black males and white and black females. Results of the data analysis were mixed, but the hypothesis that informal job search methods were more effective was not supported. The groups tended to vary among informal and formal methods of job search and life satisfaction with no clear pattern emerging. One thread that seemed to wind through the data, however, was that more white youths than blacks had access to the types of informal contacts that resulted in jobs with higher satisfaction. Suggestions were made for research to study various methods of job search, rather than just those classified as formal or informal. (KC)",

Chapter 1 defines technological change, describes changes in information technologies, discusses the measurement and characteristics of technological change, and explores the economic and social context of technological change and possible employment effects. It describes women's employment situations and explains why differential effects are expected for women workers. Chapter 2 discusses selected examples of technological change in communications and information processing and considers especially its effects on women's employment levels and on the content and quality of work.  Chapter 3 analyzes the current and future effects of technological change on the levels of employment and the structure of occupations and considers changes in worker supply and demand. It reviews Bureau of Labor Statistics projections, presents estimates of the most plausible worst case, and examines recent and projected shifts in the demand for various occupations. Chapter 4 analyzes the current and likely future effects of technological change on employment quality and explores the roles of managers and workers in implementing new technologies and improving employment quality. Chapter 5 offers recommendations to facilitate the mutual adaptation of technology and employment.

From this search, 10 usable surveys were found and analyzed. The survey data indicate that (1) drug testing is a common, but not universal private sector practice, more likely among larger firms; (2) firms are more likely to test applicants than employees; (3) more firms plan to implement drug testing in the future; (4) some firms do not provide confirmatory tests  to employees or applicants who initially test positive; (5) some firms retest employees or applicants using the same type of test as that used initially; and (6) some firms do not tell applicants that the reason they were not hired was because of a positive drug test.

It investigated how industrialized countries raise and manage their armed forces. Experts offered arguments on the purported advantages and disadvantages of a force comprised of volunteers only, as opposed to a mixed force of draftees and volunteers. In contrast to earlier studies that estimated higher costs for a draft, this study found that a draft would result in budgetary savings. The draft force would be much less effective because it would have 26 percent fewer careerists and 51 percent more personnel in the first 2 years of service than the current volunteer force. The draft would result in a larger pool of reservists. Another  finding was that such steps as increasing the force size could be taken to counteract the loss of force effectiveness, but these measures would lower estimated budgetary savings. Updating data from previous studies showed that the costs (resources lost to the civilian economy) of a draft could range from $3 to $9 billion annually. Countries that draft were found to have experienced significant ground combat and have larger standing forces, proportionately more manpower in their armies, shorter terms of service, and more developed reserve structures than insular countries that rely on volunteers to meet manpower requirements.

        "description":"This report describes an approach for developing conditional projections of the U.S. farm structure. The traditional approach to projecting the distribution of farms by size uses a Markov model with stationary (constant) transition probabilities. Although a useful tool for extrapolation of current trends, the stationary Markov approach cannot model the impacts on farm structure of varying economic and social causal forces. Data are now available for developing Markov models with nonstationary transition probabilities. In this document, a simple nonstationary Markov model of U.S. farm structure is described and estimated and its performance in predicting actual changes in farm numbers and sizes through 1986 is assessed. The nonstationary Markov model makes fuller use of the  information available and generates a path of structural change that seems closer to what actually occurred after 1978. (Author/KC)",

The simulations suggested that changes in monetary and fiscal policy have significantly different effects in different parts of the country. The magnitude of the employment impact on  nonmetropolitan areas depended on assumptions about industrial composition and worker compensation. (Four data tables are appended.) (YLB)",

The report also provides general information on all farms producing cotton. The data on which the report is based are from the 1986 Farm Costs and Returns Survey. Some of the conclusions drawn from the study are the following: (1) specialized commercial cotton farms--those with at least 50 percent of the value of their production from cotton and with at least $40,000 in total production--had relatively high net returns compared with other specialized field crop farms in 1986; (2) specialized cotton farms experienced more financial stress than most other types of farms; (3) low yields, yield quality problems in several areas, and low cotton  prices were partly to blame for this financial stress; (4) large farms with sales of $250,000 or more had the most favorable returns and cost structures; (5) U.S. cotton production is concentrated in three areas that account for more than 90 percent of total production--the Delta, the Southern Plains, and the West; and (6) specialized cotton farms in the Southern Plains had the lowest returns and the highest incidence of financial stress among the major cotton regions.

        "description":"The new General Educational Development test demands that students read critically. Teaching critical reading presents a twofold challenge to teachers. First, they must help students expand their knowledge in content areas. They must also teach students the skills involved in reading critically. Because the skills entailed in critical reading are not skills that a teacher can demonstrate, the method of providing learning activities once reading has been completed is not appropriate. One effective method of teaching critical reading is that developed by Harold Herber. Supported by more than 20 years of research, the method emphasizes preparation for and guidance during reading rather than postreading activities. During the preparation stage, the teacher prepares students to  receive new information. This serves to motivate students and provide them with a frame of reference into which to receive ideas. Then, during guided reading, students learn to use the processes necessary to obtain meaning from what they read by participating in a simulation of the reading process. Students use a teacher-prepared reading guide that consists of literal and critical statements for students to verify or dispute as they read. Students work in groups of three to five, and teachers check the students' work. Unlike traditional methods of reading instruction in which most discussion takes place after the material has been read, here the discussion takes place before reading and before they have encountered difficulty in comprehending.

These factors include Japanese industrial pressure and philosophy, technological advancements, a shortage of skilled workers, and a mismatch between available jobs and trained workers. Suggestions to improve the vocational education curricula are customized training and generalized training. Two sample curriculum designs have been developed that employ the present trends of generalized training in vocational education--Core Curriculum and Principles of Technology. Improved vocational education strategies could play a key role in improving economic and industrial problems in the United States for several reasons: (1) such programmatic  changes could provide better preparation for manual and skilled labor; (2) vocational education has a direct effect on the labor force and economy; and (3) jobs requiring vocational training top the list of occupations with pressing placement demands. A recent study has measured students' opinions of their current vocational/technical education and determined their beliefs about the importance of current trends in vocational education. Findings indicate that students perceive a need for considerable change. On items pertaining to trends, there is strong support for more interdisciplinary and communication skills training. (YLB)",

The section then describes the types of activity in which pupils were involved, training and supervision available, and advice given on recruitment and job applications. It looks at employers' views on the value of work experience to the pupils. Finally, the role of the school and employers' satisfaction in general are considered. Section 2--the pupils' views--is divided into two parts. The first focuses on pupils' perceptions of and  reactions to the project as they emerged from interviews. The second part provides a brief summary of what they perceived, both before and after their placements, as useful aspects of work experience. Section 3 draws together the views of both the employers and the pupils and discusses the value of the project. The interview schedules are appended. (YLB)",

It tests the hypothesis that those who become parents differ in their views of work even prior to the pregnancy that produces the first birth and that parenthood produces changes in career orientation over and above those existing earlier. The study also examines the average job characteristics of employed mothers and fathers to assess changes in these around the first  birth. The results of the study show that mothers differ from nonmothers in several key respects prior to the pregnancy and that the first birth results in further changes. For men, no evidence of initial differences between those who become fathers and those who do not is found, and effects of parenthood are shown only for general career expectations. The results give some indication that new fathers become less focused on their careers in the years around the birth of their first child. (KC)",

In the study, the term &quot;engineering technical workforce&quot; was defined as all staff primarily performing engineering functions between the levels of tradesperson and professional engineer or surveyor. The study involved a review of literature, interviews with Technical and Further Education and Training Authority staff and engineering workers, and two national surveys that obtained data from more than 2,000 persons throughout Australia. Data were analyzed through cluster analysis. Ninety-nine primary clusters were identified; these merged into intermediate clusters and then four major clusters: engineering systems and  administration, civil engineering and surveying, drafting and design, and electrical and electronic engineering. The job function profile and background characteristics of each occupational cluster were drawn. The study found that the duties important to most workers were written communication, oral communication, general administration, the use of calculators and computers, and engineering drawing. The study showed that there are two primary levels of technical engineering workers: associates and technicians, with associates having completed more education and technicians having more on-the-job training. Recommendations for changes to course organization and content were made as a result of the study. (KC)",

        "description":"A soldier's occupation is a very stressful one, especially for junior enlisted soldiers who have little control over their highly-regimented work lives. This prospective study examined the relationship between soldier occupational stress and health and well-being 8 to 10 months later. Through an ongoing, longitudinal study of attitudes, health, and cohesion in Army units, extensive survey data were collected on lower enlisted soldiers. The 2,288 respondents with complete data on relevant variables at two time points in 1985 and 1986 were included in the analyses. The sample was divided into low, medium, and high occupational stress groups based on hours worked per week, days spent in the field away from home, and availability of free time. Illness outcome was represented by the  number of doctor visits over the previous year and by an 18-item general well-being scale. Personality commitment and subjective/objective social support were considered as possible moderators of occupational stress. Analyses of covariance, controlling for Time 1 illness and psychological well-being, revealed a significant interaction effect for stress by commitment on Time 2 illness, and a significant 3-way interaction among stress, commitment, and subjective social support on Time 2 well-being. These results suggest that soliders who characteristically view their jobs as important and meaningful are less at-risk for stress-related illness, an effect sometimes enhanced by a subjective sense of available social supports.

        "description":"On December 12, 1985, a charter airline carrying 248 United States soldiers crashed and burned after a refueling stop in Gander, Newfoundland, killing all on board. After the crash, family assistance workers were appointed to help the surviving family members of each dead soldier. This study attempted to: (1) identify the major areas of stress for disaster family assistance workers; (2) examine the relation between exposure to these stressors and health; and (3) locate risk factors, or resistance resources that might moderate ill effects of exposure. A survey instrument assessed duration and intensity of family helping activities, illness indicators, psychiatric symptoms, psychological well-being, and social and personality variables at 6 months after the crash and again at the  1-year point for 131 family assistance officers. The results indicated a dose-response effect between exposure measured at Time 1 and illness levels at Time 2, an increase in symptoms, and a change in psychological well-being over time. Social support was a moderator of the exposure-symptoms relation, and both social support and personality hardiness were moderators with respect to Time 2 illness and change in psychological well-being. Other evidence suggests that prior experience with death and grief, and having volunteered for the family helper role also reduced the risk of developing ill effects. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"The United States Army battalion that suffered the heaviest losses (189 soldiers killed) in the December, 1985 military charter airline crash was studied longitudinally over the 6-month period following the disaster. Extensive interview and observational data were collected at approximately monthly intervals. The purpose of the study was to determine the various factors involved in the recovery process, the integration of replacements, and the return of the unit to a healthy readiness posture. Four psychosocial phases of unit recovery were evident, each lasting about 4 to 6 weeks (numb dedication, angry betrayal, stoic determination, integration/cohesion). A replacement plan that intermixed newcomers with veterans facilitated integration and unit recovery. Although individual  reactions varied somewhat, the generalized response of the unit to the trauma can be considered a military disaster \"stress response syndrome\" that characterizes the reactions of a cohesive group to a major technological disaster. This model of response aids in understanding and permits some anticipation of the kinds of problems other units might confront after similar traumatic events. The findings suggest several interventions with potential to facilitate the individual and group recovery process. (Author)",

A study was conducted to investigate the relationship between causal attribution of health problems and health-related behavior. College students (N=57) completed the Preventability Scale by estimating the extent to which a number of problems could have been prevented by the victim of the problem. Their estimates, reported in terms of the percentage of cases that they considered to be preventable, constituted the dependent variable. Subjects also completed the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control scales and a self-report questionnaire of health-related  behaviors. The independent variable was the frequency with which subjects engaged in such health-related behaviors as exercise, diet control, smoking, and thrill seeking. The results showed that subjects differed significantly regarding their estimates of preventability of heart attack depending upon how much jogging and other exercise they did. People who jogged often though heart attacks and hypertension were more preventable than did subjects who jogged less often or not at all. The findings have implications for cognitive behavior modification and cooperation with prescribed lifestyle changes. (Author/NB)",

It appears that home health care is one method of providing needed basic assistance to the rural elderly population in a cost-efficient manner. This study was conducted to examine the impact of a geriatric care staff-training program on two problem areas frequently present in the home health care worker environment: worker stress management and the incontinent client. Data were collected from 158 rural/small town home health care trainees and analyzed using a separate-simple pretest-posttest evaluation design. The results indicated that there was a statistically significant increase in knowledge between pretest and  posttest scores in the areas of both worker stress management and the incontinent client. Posttest data also suggest that the program had a positive impact on trainee attitudes concerning stress management and the incontinent client.

A study was conducted to examine the experiences of older persons waiting to relocate to subsidized age-segregated apartments. Subjects were interviewed twice over a 1-year period. At the initial interview, 63 older adults completed the Philadelphia Geriatric Center Multi-level Assessment Instrument (PGC MAI) and an open-ended questionnaire assessing attitudes toward their present home and toward relocation. One year later, when approximately one-half of the subjects had moved, 54 of the original subjects were reinterviewed using the same instruments and a second open-ended questionnaire which explored  the meaning and importance of their home to them. While the moving process was perceived to be stressful by 60% of the relocated group and 28% of the non-relocated group, respondents employed complex appraisal and coping strategies with a very high rate of success. For the total sample, the results revealed no significant differences between time 1 and time 2 scores on the PGC MAI. Respondents who were still anticipating relocation showed slight longitudinal declines on the majority of the PGC MAI variables, but no significant decrements in functioning. Respondents who had relocated reported significant increases in environmental satisfaction over time. (NB)",

Retirement brings with it many changing roles. Changes may occur in family roles, such as becoming a grandparent, and in friendships, social networks, and community involvement. Retirement often means a change in economic status. Some retirees feel free from financial stress while others experience limited income or resources. Older adults can often take advantage of affordable senior housing and discounts offered by  transportation systems, restaurants, and entertainment establishments. Older adults may also experience changing behaviors in mind and body, changes in physical health and fitness, and changes in interests and opportunities. Not all of the changes will be positive, but older adults can deal with them and with their new freedoms, experiences, rewards, and challenges if they are prepared to meet them. (NB)",

        "description":"The Older American Act Amendments of 1987 (Public Law 100-175) contain no major overhaul of the Act, but new provisions do significantly expand certain service components of the state and area agency on aging program under title III to address the special needs of certain populations, including the frail elderly living at home, residents of long-term care facilities, persons at risk of abuse or neglect, and low-income elderly. Other amendments address issues related to the administration of Older Americans Act programs. In addition to reauthorizing and amending the Older Americans Act programs, Public Law 100-175 includes other provisions affecting the elderly by: (1) authorizing the President to call a White House Conference on Aging in 1991; (2) authorizing adult day care  centers for the elderly and the chronically impaired disabled to receive funds for meals under the National School Lunch Act; (3) requiring the Secretary of Labor to develop a consumer price index for older persons; (4) authorizing the National Institute on Aging to conduct clinical trials testing the efficacy of certain drugs on treatment of Alzheimer's disease; and (5) authorizing the Public Health Service to conduct demonstration projects on home health services for low-income persons in need of skilled medical or health services. This document presents an overview of the amendments, descriptions of selected provisions of the amendments, and the text of the Older Americans Act Amendments of 1987. (NB)",

        "description":"This booklet was written to help readers understand how the Retirement Equity Act of 1984 makes it easier for both women and men to collect retirement benefits under private pension plans. Since women have had special problems in the pension area, it emphasizes how the retirement law works to their advantage by preventing loss of coverage during leaves of absence, providing the chance to build up credits toward a pension at an earlier age, and actually increasing benefits through marital provisions. Because the provisions of the legislation are best understood within the context of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), provisions of ERISA are briefly reviewed. Provisions of the Retirement Equity Act of 1984 are listed and elaborated on, with special  emphasis on their impact on women. Discussed are: (1) ways that the Act benefits workers in general and women in particular; (2) benefits for spouses and former spouses; (3) special rules for some vested former employees; (4) lump sum payments; (5) effective dates of the Act; (6) information about pension plans; (7) a study of women and pensions; (8) pensions as only a part of retirement income; (9) planning for retirement; and (10) facts on women and pensions. A glossary of terms and a list of names and addresses for regional offices of the Women's Bureau are included. (NB)",

It presents a set of 12 questions and answers about guardianship: (1) what is guardianship; (2) how many older Americans are under guardianship; (3) who are the elderly persons under guardianship; (4) who can be a guardian; (5) do courts require that guardians receive special training; (6) what is the legal process by which a person can be put under guardianship; (7) what checks are in place to protect an elderly person from abuse by a guardian; (8) what are some of the most frequently cited problems with the current American guardianship system; (9) how can an elderly person get out from under guardianship; (10) what are some examples of  guardianship abuse; (11) are there federal laws or national uniform standards for protecting the elderly under guardianship; and (12) what reforms are needed. Tables are included which illustrate which states have restrictions on who can be a guardian, the legal representation of an alleged incompetent by state, which states give the alleged incompetent the right to a jury trial, which states require the alleged incompetent to attend competency hearings, which states require medical evidence to find incompetence, and which states allow &quot;advanced age&quot; as cause for determining incompetence.

        "description":"Most evaluative research focuses on the outcome of programs, giving little attention to differences in clients' utilization of the programs' services. This study explored factors which were predictive of teenagers' participation in the Resource Mother Program, an educational support intervention program for pregnant and parenting adolescents. Subjects were 74 rural, mostly single, black, primiparous adolescents of low socioeconomic status. Subjects who agreed to participate in the program were interviewed prenatally prior to participation. The program was a home-based support program in which experienced mothers and paraprofessionals worked with the subjects prenatally through the infant's first birthday. Once the program was completed, records were examined to determine the  degree of subject utilization of program services. The results suggest that differences in the teenage mother's relationship with her family and with the baby's father, environmental stressors, and preparedness for her baby were related to different patterns of program participation. The teenage mothers who actively participated were living with their families, felt they could rely on their families for financial assistance and instrumental support, and were not very involved with the baby's father. The findings have implications for the evaluation and development of support programs. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"This study developed new national estimates of morbidity costs and examined trends in disability and labor-force participation for the noninstitutionalized population of males aged 17 to 64. Based on 1974-1978 data from the Health Interview Survey, the study found 2.7 million working-age males unable to work, 5.4 million working-age males with chronic health problems, and 272 million work days lost annually during 1974-1978. The annual morbidity cost was estimated to be $51.9 billion (in 1975 dollars) when education, occupation and industry were held constant, and $64 billion when these factors were not held constant. Debility costs, a component often omitted in previous studies, accounted for 24.4 and 30 percent of these totals. Cost estimates for 61 specific health problem  categories were derived. Descriptive analysis of trends for the 1969-1980 period showed a correlation between increases in reported disability and declines in labor-force participation rates for the 45-54 and 55-64 age groups, but the magnitude of the disability increase was not large enough to fully explain the labor-force participation decline.

It is divided into three parts. Part 1, Growing Pains, discusses what parents and children might go through during the adolescent years and explains the developmental tasks of adolescence. Part 2, How to Help, suggests ways that parents can use to develop more open lines of communication with their teenagers and to guide them in decision making. A section on how not to communicate gives examples of typical responses parents may have to an adolescent which can be classified as threatening, preaching, blaming, analyzing, pacifying, probing, and avoiding. Possible reactions of adolescents to these types of responses are explored.  Suggestions are given for how parents can become better listeners. Parents are encouraged to be attentive, encourage talk, try to empathize, and listen with respect. In talking to adolescents, parents are encouraged to show respect, be brief, be aware of one's tone of voice, and be specific. Eight steps are presented which parents can use to teach responsible decision making. Part 3, Homework for You Both, includes materials designed to help parents implement the ideas presented in the guide. Samples of the youth and parent questionnaires are included. (NB)",

        "description":"Elderly housing has become a special concept in which level of activity, social support, and social integration may be more important than square footage or closet space. An increased concern among housing specialists has been the ability of traditional senior housing to meet the needs of frail tenants who have &quot;aged in place.&quot; As tenants survive into and beyond their 80s, housing sponsors must address the problems of growing numbers of frail tenants. This study was conducted to describe the capability of senior housing to meet the support needs of frail tenants and to understand the formulation of discharge policies which address frailty among tenants. Two methods to assess discharge policies were used: a survey of housing sponsors and in-depth telephone interviews with selected  housing personnel. The results indicated that few housing sponsors had developed discharge policies concerning frail tenants. Rather, decisions regarding frail tenants were made on a case by case basis. Overall, housing sponsors reported low turnover rates and few problem discharges. These findings have implications for senior housing as a component of the long-term care system. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"Nursing home patients suffering from dementia had a desire for placement in a setting where their special needs could be addressed. This resulted in the creation of special nursing home units designed to meet patient needs. Recent reports have provided evidence that nursing home residents suffering from dementia who receive care on these special units fare better than those on heterogeneous units on a variety of measures, demonstrating decreases in psychotropic drug use, accidents, and acting-out behaviors; and increases in orientation levels. While research has supported the contention that special care units for patients with dementia enhance the quality of life for the patients, the issues of quality of life may be more related to the patient's perception of outcome than to  statistical findings. In future research, direct measures of quality of life should be included when assessing the outcome of special care units. The recipients of the care should be asked directly about their quality of life on the unit. While it has been argued that direct assessment of patients with dementia is impossible, research has been conducted which supports the procedure of an empathic assessor using the appropriate measure and having sufficient time to obtain valid responses.

        "description":"Over the past two decades, the chronic mentally ill elderly have begun to receive care in residential health care facilities (RHCF) such as domiciliary care, intermediate care, and skilled nursing facilities. While there is justification for this increase, as the mentally ill elderly also present with significant physical illnesses, there are presently more chronic mentally ill elderly residents of RHCFs than of state mental hospitals. The need to provide care to the mentally ill in the RHCF is expanding. Not only are patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of mental illness, many are admitted with unreported mental illnesses and others develop illnesses while institutionalized. Related key issues include accurately defining patient needs so as to respond appropriately, and  addressing the patient's desire to be placed homogeneously by type of need. Several recent reports indicate the efficacy of behavioral intervention programs for the chronic mentally ill in RHCFs. This paper reviews those reports and a report on the preliminary findings of the impact of a staff psychologist on the provision of mental health services in eight RHCFs. (Author)",

        "description":"Early research on motivation, especially achievement motivation, was based on a dynamic model which focused on enduring affective dispositions growing out of early childhood experiences. Cognitive theory provided a way to reconceptualize achievement motivation in terms of achievement-related perceptions, thoughts, and meanings, and a framework for beginning to examine how changing circumstances possibly correlated with age might modify whatever turned out to be defined as achievement motivation. A research project was developed which focused heavily on the development of a workable approach to research in this area. It examined how age was related to meanings and in turn to personal investment. Results from preliminary data on approximately 3,000 adults in white-collar  occupations seem to suggest that modest changes in personal incentives may occur with age and that goal directedness may vary with age. The results suggest that job satisfaction tends to increase with age, as does organizational commitment. The research found little evidence of age-related changes in achievement motivation. Motivational patterns appear to be minimally related to age during the working ages of 20 to 70 years of age. (NB)",

Full-timers can enjoy life in recreational vehicles that are modern, convenient, and well-built. Full-timing can be as expensive or as economical as the individual circumstances are. The economic benefits of full-timing increase when the traditional home is sold and the proceeds are sufficient to pay for the recreational vehicle plus investments which will provide income. Major expenses are for gasoline, maintenance and repairs, and vehicle registration and insurance. To further examine the phenomenon of full-timing, surveys were obtained from 100 full-timers who were members of a nationally-based camping organization. Fifty-five percent of respondents had lived in  their motor homes, fifth-wheels, or travel trailers for at least 2 years. Most of the respondents had sold their conventional homes and planned to full-time indefinitely. Low-cost and adventurous, full-timing may be a lifestyle especially suited for older people in the context of today's mobile society. (Author/NB)",

It goes on to explain how, 20 years later, the situation is changing enough to create a need to examine whether there is a fairer or more efficient way to maintain current levels of health insurance for the elderly. Of particular interest in this report is the role that employers can or should be expected to play. Data from national surveys and other sources are assembled to provide a description of the employer-sponsored insurance of Medicare beneficiaries currently and to speculate on the future direction of retiree health benefits. The 1977 National Medical Care Expenditure Survey (NMCES)  and the more recent Survey of Income and Program Participation are used to examine patterns and trends in enrollment. NMCES provides additional data concerning the payment of premiums by employers and retirees and the provisions of the insurance. Sections of the report focus on current retiree benefits, uneven access to employer-sponsored insurance, and looking to the future.

The GAO interviewed program, budget, and evaluation officials at 12 departments or agencies that were involved in prevention and education activities, concentrating efforts on agencies with the highest funding levels for such activities. The GAO analysis revealed an increase in funding for  prevention and education in the area of drug abuse, a change in the federal role in drug abuse prevention, evaluations that were of the less rigorous type, ineffective early prevention efforts, and concerns about spending new funds. The GAO recommended that the Senate adopt state and local reporting and technical assistance requirements, that Congress provide states with the authority to reduce or terminate funding in cases where reasonable progress is not being made following provision of such assistance, and that the accountability of state and local programs be increased under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986.

In an attempt to provide information about such long-term patterns while controlling the population and setting, samples of incoming freshmen at the University of Maryland in 1972 (N=750), 1983 (N=460), and 1987 (N=285) completed an anonymous questionnaire assessing their sexual attitudes and beliefs. The results revealed that students in all 3 years were personally more conservative than they believed others to be. Students in recent years expressed more liberal views about homosexuals but were also more  likely to indicate that, if they were homosexual, they would want this fact hidden from others. Reported levels of sexual intercourse were lower in recent years. Males in all years reported more liberal personal sexual codes than did females, attesting to the stability of gender differences in sexual attitudes and behaviors. (Author)",

        "description":"Clients with concurrent substance abuse and other psychopathology constitute an often neglected patient population which presents significant assessment and treatment challenges. Proper treatment requires a careful assessment of issues not always addressed in standard substance abuse or mental health treatment settings. Psychologists with expertise in the psychology of addiction and psychopathology are needed to develop and implement effective approaches to working with such patients. Assessment issues which need to be addressed include the nature and severity of both types of problems, but also the presence and nature of interactions between concurrent problems. This document addresses some of the assessment and treatment questions posed by the client presenting with concurrent  substance abuse and psychopathology. It sets forth a way of classifying concurrent problems, including a taxonomy of types of interactions between substance abuse and other psychological problems. To facilitate such an assessment, a set of assessment categories is proposed. Common treatment options for persons with concurrent problems are discussed. Optimal treatment strategies for persons falling into the various assessment categories are considered, with a particular emphasis on the treatment of problem interactions. (Author/NB)",

This report was written at the request of the House Committee on Armed Services to examine some of these issues. It looks at a range of possible reforms in the military health care system. Chapter 1 discusses the need for cost containment and provides an overview of the military health care system. Chapter 2 examines issues in the use of military health care, including the problem of high use, factors contributing to high use, and the effects of potential reforms on readiness and satisfaction. Chapter 3 focuses on the Administration's CHAMPUS Reform Initiative, which aims to contain the rapidly rising costs of  the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services. Chapter 4 considers alternative strategies using capitation. Chapter 5 discusses techniques for building on current programs, looking at civilian-run outpatient clinics, selective contracts for mental health care, realignment of military medical assets, and a greater use of cost sharing. The 1984 Military Beneficiary Health Care Survey, actual and expected admission rates, the statistical model of family use, and the information on the capitation budgeting demonstration project are appended.

The results of the survey revealed that 55% of respondents had received personal counseling themselves. No significant differences were found between counselors who had received counseling and those who had not in the areas of educational degree, work setting, names of programs from which they had graduated, or counseling experience. Those who had never received counseling reported that they either  never felt the need for counseling or they received informal support from friends, colleagues, or supervisors. Of the 81 respondents who had received counseling, most had sought counseling for personal problems, followed in frequency by emotional symptoms and self-improvement. Over 90% had received their counseling on an individual basis; 25% had received group counseling; and 33% had been to more than one counselor. Over 90% reported that they would see a counselor again if the need arose and 86.4% reported that the experience of being a client had an impact on their effectiveness in their own work as counselors.

At present, nearly 30% of all health care dollars are spent on persons over the age of 65.

In this view of literacy and literacy learning, various forms of reading and writing are seen as distinct ways of knowing and acquiring knowledge for ones' own purposes. Supporting this view of literacy are theoretical and research findings from various sources, including research in reading and writing, knowledge acquisition, and current functional approaches to literacy. However, while studies have examined the influence of a restricted array of teacher-initiated reading and writing tasks on content learning, researchers need to investigate in-process thinking and learning by individuals involved in the self-directed use of reading and writing  activities. In terms of instruction, the development of literacy repertoires is a major goal as students study difficult topics and attempt to solve complex problems. Helping students acquire a &quot;critical literacy&quot;--the ability to use reading and writing for purposes which exceed those most often associated with minimum competence--is of utmost importance, and may warrant a reconceptualization of literacy learning that would entail a critical analysis of current principles and practices dominating how reading and writing are used and taught across the grades.

Each session was analyzed according to what the teacher said and did before, during, and after a book reading session. Analyses of the videotapes showed that the teachers read a story in much the same way that parents read to their children at home, encouraging discussion through comments and questions, adding information before reading and recapping important ideas after reading. The results indicated that text  comprehension was the central theme for kindergarten book reading sessions, with variations derived principally from differences in the type of book.

Also tested was the methodological validity of using a conceptual (word recognition) perceptual (tachistoscopic word flash) task as a means of investigating the types of information processing that may occur during reading. Based on the Nelson-Denny Reading Test, Scholastic Achievement Test scores, and teacher rating, subjects--75 tenth grade students--were assigned to average or below average reading ability groups. In the first of two experiments, 43 students read an experimental passage and were then given a perceptual identification task to perform on selected words from the story. In the second experiment, 32 different students  read the same passage and were given a conceptual recognition task to perform on the same list of words. Before reading the passage, each subject was assigned the perspective of either a home buyer or a burglar, and told to rate the relative importance of each story segment according to their perspective. Results indicated that both good and poor readers spent more time on text items that were important to their assigned perspective than on unimportant items. Poor readers consistently outperformed good readers on the perceptual identification task, and good readers outperformed poor readers on the conceptual identification task. These results supported the hypothesis that good readers outperform poor readers on selective attention tasks primarily because they employ a greater degree of  conceptual attention.

After a discussion on the nature and purpose of the program, the handbook describes a model of Chapter 1 programming, presenting three combined approaches that are used in the model: the diagnostic-prescriptive approach, utilizing subskills; mastery learning; and holistic reading instruction. The second section reviews information about young readers, focusing on reading problems and learning styles, with implications for Chapter 1 instruction and diagnostic tests for detecting hemispheric, eye, and hand dominance. The third section of the handbook presents ideas and strategies for young readers,  providing a case study of a diagnostic-prescriptive approach activity, and guidelines for implementation of a mastery learning unit. Other sections consist of: (1) 25 holistic reading strategies, including the language experience approach, neurological impress method, and sustained silent reading; (2) modality preference learning style strategies for visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learners; (3) learning style strategies for right-brain learners, including the whole-word approach, sequencing events, and phonics; (4) a sample weekly schedule; and (5) susgestions for coordination with the classroom teacher.

Subjects--120 students with IQ scores in the average range--were divided evenly between both grades. Thirty subjects from each grade who scored above the 50th percentile on the California Achievement Test were selected as good readers, and 30 subjects from each grade who scored below the 50th percentile were designated as poor readers. Students were individually tested in two separate sessions separated by one week. For the visual input condition, students were shown 28 monosyllabic words one at a time, asked to say each word aloud, and told to remember each word shown. A second set of words was presented one  at a time; students replied \"yes\" if they thought the word was on the previous list, or \"no\" if they thought the word was not on the previous list. For auditory presentation the initial set of words was presented verbally and the recognition list presented visually. Word pairs were classified as phonetically similar if they shared the same vowel sound and differed by no more than three consonantal phonetic features. Results indicated that good and poor readers made equivalent numbers of recognition errors on phonetically similar and dissimilar items. Groups could not be distinguished by their use of a phonetic code in working memory. (One table is included, and 31 references are appended.) (MM)",

Passages consisted of an underlying event sequence, and used a narrative text with different discourse organizations which violated different principles. After listening to the passage twice, subjects answered 20 true-false comprehension questions about the order of events in the underlying even sequences of the passage. Results showed strong effects of global narrative organization on discourse comprehension,  and supported the four principles of discourse organization as applied to narrative text: the immediate integration principle, the consistency principle, the completeness principle, and the isomorphism principle.

        "description":"Reading comprehension can be more effectively taught using new instructional frameworks--such as explicit comprehension instruction--rather than the basal reading model. Traditionally, comprehension has been taught through a process of mentioning the skill that students should apply, practicing the skill in workbooks, and assessing student responses. Explicit comprehension instruction, however, focuses on direct explanations of comprehension strategies, guided practice to understand how the strategy is applied, and the transfer of comprehension strategies to new materials. Studies of these comprehension approaches, including inference training and reciprocal teaching, reveal that reading comprehension can be explicitly taught. There are several basic elements involved in explicit  comprehension instruction: (1) complex strategies are not broken down into separate, sequentially ordered subskills; (2) multiple answers exist for all questions; (3) multiple ways exist to apply a strategy; and (4) feedback is suggestive rather than corrective, in that teachers praise students for applying parts of the strategy appropriately and encourage students to consider alternative ways of approaching a problem. Because guided practice and strategy explanations may be difficult for teachers unfamiliar with the process, explicit comprehension instruction can be implemented gradually, simultaneously decreasing the number of teacher controlled tasks while increasing student responsibility and control. (Two tables outlining the stages of responsibility in inference training and  question-answer relationship tasks are included, and one footnote and 50 references are appended.) (MM)",

The challenge for teachers of reading is to make it a human endeavor. For many students reading is an operation done to extract data from the page; it is not an experience. Approaching a book as if it were a television set, these students expect to be able to understand the contents exactly. Teachers encourage these attitudes by selling &quot;right answers&quot;--the one way to interpret a text. Though television seems the enemy of reading, it creates two things which teachers of reading should try to replicate for their students: a sense of identification and a sense of community.  This can be done by encouraging students to listen and respond to the speaker in the text and by forming small autonomous discussion groups which are encouraged to come up with differing interpretations of the text. To encourage self-involving reading teachers must create a context which makes such involvement worthwhile, not just for grades but for social interaction and personal growth as well. (MHC)",

Subjects completed a 29-item questionnaire covering five reading habits categories--satisfaction with reading, types of material read, reading efficiency, ease and availability of obtaining reading materials, and impact of environment on reading. Results indicated that more married than single, and more males than females, read religious materials. Significant differences were also reported between males and females, and between white collar and professional subjects, regarding their  reading habits. Findings from this study were compared with a reading habits study of 59 adult subjects in Senegal, West Africa. Comparison showed that both Senegalese and Egyptian subjects would like to read better, liked to read, read newspapers often, enjoyed reading fiction, would like to take a course to improve their reading, and retained most of what they read for a reasonable period of time.

Inspired by the literacy work of Paulo Freire, the method makes extensive use of small group discussion within the context of small and medium sized classes, and considers the role of student motivation to be very important. The technique, which involves the repeated application of a three-step procedure to each topic in a course, appears to promote the development of a variety of higher-order cognitive and affective student characteristics. The initial tryout of the method occurred in a University of Delaware course  entitled &quot;Sociological Foundations of Education,&quot; with an enrollment of 48. Interviews of the participants revealed an overwhelming amount of student agreement on the value of the technique in promoting many kinds of personal development and stimulating interest in topics initially thought to be boring. An independent course evaluation conducted by the Department of Educational Studies also revealed very positive student response.

The review argues that since a majority of adult reading is performed upon workplace related material, understanding the nature, difficulty, and prevalence of these functional reading tasks is critical for an understanding of the reading demands encountered by adults and their abilities to meet such demands. The review suggests that the quantity and complexity of literacy demands appear to be increasing in most sectors of the workplace and that research has revealed that reading, writing, and computation in the workplace is ubiquitous and at a relatively high  level. The review then discusses several studies that show that vocational training literacy demands are even higher than the workplace literacy demands. Citing figures that show generally that literacy skills demands have been increasing, the review examines several basic skills programs that apply a functional literacy approach to teaching, both in the military and in the public/private sector. The review concludes that (1) it is possible to make fairly rapid gains in the ability to comprehend technical material if training is focused on that material; and (2) in the private sector, successful technical and basic skills training programs are beginning to emerge in the vacuum left unfilled by traditional schooling.

Following field testing with 25 learning skills students, 50 freshman biology students enrolled at Indiana University were divided into treatment and control groups. Both groups read two 7-10 page biology textbook selections. Treatment students scheduled three weekly one-hour appointments using the computer programs, which helped students identify key concepts, write summary statements comparing and contrasting concepts, and graphically map relationships among concepts. After each lesson students answered a  questionnaire on the usability of the lesson, and on completion of the last lesson, chapter examinations were given along with an open-ended questionnaire evaluating the program. One week after the chapter exam, treatment subjects read a new biology text and were given an exam on the new material. Control students were provided only with the text and completed the same examination taken by the treatment group. They also returned one week later to repeat the process with the new text. Findings showed that treatment students significantly outperformed control students for both texts in ability to link terms and map concept relationships. Questionnaire data indicated that computer instruction was viewed positively as a way to learn strategies for reading difficult material.

Journal-writing and small group discussions in composition and literature classes have been successful methods for merging the skills of reading, discussing, and writing. Students not only learn the commonalities of reading and writing skills but get actively involved with the text being studied through: (1) independent reading, thinking, and writing about ideas presented in literature; (2) sharing  of those ideas in small and then in large groups; (3) reevaluating those ideas in after-class journal entries; and (4) articulating those ideas in formal writing assignments, papers or exams.

        "description":"Using the Pizza Hut \"Book It\" Program which encouraged students to read a certain number of books per month, a study examined the effect of this program on standardized test scores. Subjects, 98 fifth grade students, were placed in high, middle, or low reading groups according to teacher assessment. Half of the students from each group participated in the reading program. Each student chosen had an I.Q. in the average range, and students with I.Q.'s above or below average were not selected. Improvement in reading ability for each student was measured by the difference between the composite reading scores on the Metropolitan Achievement Tests at the end of the fourth and fifth grades. Results indicated no statistical difference between the experimental and control groups in  improvement of reading ability for the high and middle reading groups. In the low reading group, significant differences in reading ability between the control and experimental groups were found, indicating that students who participated in the recreational reading program had more improvement in reading ability than those who did not participate.

        "description":"This report first presents a brief analysis of the &quot;Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing&quot; that provides the basis for an argument that the test user/purchaser must see the possibilities in uncommon types of assessment before any test developer/publisher is likely to make them available. Next, six criteria (theoretical base, achievability, transfer, importance, intercoder agreement, and economy) guiding the development of a framework for the analysis of reader: writer conferencing are sketched out in a way that reveals why it may be seen as a plausible and important alternative assessment to complement direct product assessment of writing. Then, a framework for the analysis of reader: writer conferencing is briefly described along with data on intercoder agreements.  The report then illustrates two approaches to portrayal, the conferencing transcript (between an elementary school teacher and a prospective elementary school teacher) and a graphic plus episodic representation, in order to determine &quot;what is externalized&quot; by the analysis of one-to-one conferencing. The report's conclusion--that the analysis of one-to-one conferencing between teacher and student, focusing on a draft of the student's writing, externalizes a number of variables that are elements of conferencing performance and that constitute or influence writing accomplishment--is then presented along with some implications for future research.

        "description":"In conjunction with the New Mexico State Department of Education's Writing Appraisal Program for high school students, a project was designed whose central goal was to identify and clearly delineate writing competencies for students in the younger grades. A pilot project first collected student writing samples and descriptive data from third and fifth grade students and their teachers in randomly selected classes in two districts (Santa Fe and Alburquerque). Following this, approximately 3,000 writing samples (narrative, descriptive, and persuasive writing) were collected from 13 school districts over a 7- to 12-week period, beginning in the fall of 1982 through mid-January 1983. In addition, descriptive data from 45 elementary language arts teachers from the same 13 school  districts were compiled based on responses to curriculum mapping questionnaires, and descriptive and evaluative data were elicited from a statewide appointed 23-member Elementary Writing Competencies Task Force composed of reading, language arts, and English faculty at all levels of instruction. Two documents were developed from the compilation and summarizing of these data. &quot;Essentials of an Effective Writing Program&quot; presents guidelines for the writing teacher, and describes in detail seven segments of an effective writing program: setting the stage; pre-writing; drafting; rewriting and revision; editing and proofreading; evaluation; and publication. &quot;Exit Level Writing Competencies for Third and Fifth Grades&quot; includes behavioral objectives for various areas of writing  competency--coherence and unity; sentence structure; mechanics; narrative, descriptive, and persuasive modes; and intention and delivery.

During May and June of 1987, surveys were administered to 32 CA's, all teachers supervising CA's, and a sample of English teachers without CA's. Overall response rates were 50% for CA's, 59% for supervisors of CA's, and 80% for teachers without CA's.

        "description":"Although writing and reading instruction can be integrated regardless of the reading program materials used, teachers need a greater understanding of the similarities and differences in reading and writing processes, as well as knowledge of ways in which instruction can be merged, before integration can take place. Both reading and writing are complex cognitive processes that involve three similar strategies--planning (prewriting or prereading), drafting (writing or guided reading), and revising (modifying and extending, or postreading). Fundamental elements for developing an environment within which reading and writing can be integrated include: (1) emphasizing writing for real purposes and audiences; (2) providing frequent opportunities to write and share one's writing; and (3)  creating opportunities for extended writing and evaluation. In this general environment, specific strategies, such as &quot;concept of definition&quot; instruction and Cognitive Strategy Instruction in Writing (CSIW), focus on helping students develop a schema that enhances both reading and writing. Writing experiences should link directly to reading activities in the classroom. For example, students using basal reading can write in connection with each basal selection. Some specific suggestions for writing activities integrated with basal reading topics include selecting a favorite character from a story and writing a character sketch, and rewriting a story written in the first person to take the form of a newspaper report.

        "author":["Brown, Byron K."],
        "description":"To help students develop a broadly generative approach to reading and writing about literature, teachers of literature should employ not only systematic procedures, but also the eclectic and utilitarian spirit of rhetorical invention. A semiotic perspective offers the most solid theoretical foundation for establishing a genuinely heuristic approach to texts, one capable of encompassing and organizing a variety of interpretive schemata. Using a grid format to illustrate the multiple perspectives that semiotics bring to texts, students are encouraged to examine texts through the two overlapping perspectives--linguistic and cultural--implicit in structuralist and semiotic readings. The linguistic perspective, with categories of repetition, variation, and progression, explores  significance as both static (focusing on the oppositions of similarity/dissimilarity, resemblance/difference, or repetition/variation) and dynamic (the progressive unfolding of meaning through shifting relationships generated by the sequential appearance of textual features). From the cultural perspective--in categories of text, literary context, author, and social context--students examine the codes that shape the text's production, considering the work's textuality, intertextuality, and extratextuality. Such a rhetorically-generated grid, drawing on both configurations and extratextual considerations, can simultaneously identify competing interpretive centers while placing them in relation to each other, allowing students to experience interpretation as a creative act. (A chart of the  interacting perspectives of linguistic and cultural phenomena is included, and eight references are appended.) (MM)",

Previous efforts to establish guidelines for the student press by factions in the administration had failed, and the student newspaper has been able to solidify its First Amendment position with the help of the faculty and the Writing/Media Department. In this process the student press had to fend off challenges for control from student government, threats of economic censorship, and other assaults that paid no heed to judicial precedents. Internal fiscal malfeasance by some of the editors and a failure of the fiscal oversight responsibility of the student government also threatened the paper's existence.  Through a series of events, which included setting up a new student newspaper in the Writing and Media Department and not seeking a direct budget allocation from student government, the paper has begun a process of extricating its fiscal control from the student government. In the paper's fight against censorship and for academic freedom, the student journalists, who worked with the faculty adviser to effect change, have liberated the student newspaper from improper constraints--and did so within the established governance procedures.

Using ethnographic style techniques, researchers conducted 46 writing episode observations of seven fifth graders in the spring of 1985, and 21 observations of six fifth graders and 36 observations of seven third graders in the fall of 1985. Both free writing (journal writing) and structured writing assignments were observed. Data consisted of verbatim copies of the student's written text, and notes of all behaviors and language exchanges occurring during the writing episode. Each incidence of language was examined and judged according to Kasten codes  (consideration/pre-writing comments, language during text production, reconsideration of text language, other writing related comments, language unrelated to writing, and undetermined language). In addition, the same utterances were then reviewed according to Halliday codes for language functions (instrumental, regulatory, heuristic, interactional, personal, imaginative, and informative). Results indicated that the language which accompanied writing was not only highly related to the writing process, but also facilitated learning opportunities.

Over the semester the attitudes, of both those that did (43) and did not (78) visit the writing center, were recorded and compared. In addition, the attitudes of students who received peer feedback in class were considered. Results indicated that although the attitudes of all students engaged in writing improved, those who visited the writing center showed the greatest gains in positive attitude. Findings suggest that writing centers are performing a valuable service by contributing to the improved  attitudes of student writers.

        "description":"Employing a body of texts for the reading and study of literature in the English classroom leads to much argumentation, with much disagreement about what is fair game for the writing student. To help determine which texts to select it is necessary to define cultural literacy in a different way from that of E. D. Hirsch. Hirsch would prescribe definitions of culture--or its relation to language--that would invalidate the experiences, ethics, and aspirations of our students. Instead, cultural literacy can be that which Mikhail Bakhtin called the &quot;carnivalesque,&quot; or those words and speeches valued in public places of celebration. This extra-academic valuation of texts gives rise to &quot;the vulgar canon&quot;: texts which do not normally enter the classroom context but which have been given  value in other contexts, primarily those of the home or &quot;popular culture.&quot; Three good reasons for using this canon are: (1) the recognition by the teacher of this hidden canon can facilitate the teaching of writing in what Bakhtin calls the &quot;special collectivity;&quot; (2) it can empower Bakhtin's &quot;carnivalesque crowd,&quot; the source of that socially constructed, &quot;unofficial speech&quot; the teacher must encourage through assignments sensitive to the contemporary text, the unwritten text, the visual text, and the moving image; and (3) it may draw two communities--the academic and the carnivalesque--into direct engagement rather than maintaining the usual respectful, or disrespectful, distance.

        "description":"Focusing on English as a second language (ESL) students' cognitive difficulties in content courses, a study evaluated the Retention Exemplary Model Project for 1986-87 of Hostos Community College of the City University of New York. The project's goal was to help advanced and post-ESL students acquire the language and cognitive skills required to succeed in their course work through the use of weekly tutor-led groups concentrating on a particular content course. Seven graduate and undergraduate student tutors were selected on the basis of grades and writing abilities, and were given intensive and ongoing training. Participants--65 students registered in Advanced ESL and enrolled in one of three content courses targeted by the program (Concepts in Science I, Public Administration,  and History of the Caribbean)--were divided into seven tutorial groups. During the group sessions, students were given opportunities for expressive, exploratory talk and writing. Specific sessions elicited student paraphrasing of course concepts, the use of learning logs, tutor- or pupil-generated writing assignments, reading aloud of student papers, and group discussion. Project effectiveness was evaluated using pre- and post-test student questionnaires, faculty questionnaires, and student grades. Results indicated that the Exemplary Model assisted adult advanced ESL students in English-language content courses in improving their comprehension of course material.

        "description":"Literature is an artistic expression which teaches human beings valuable lessons about life. Literature invites the reader to share decisions with the decisions of others--the characters seen in literature. Unlike science or philosophy or ethics, which make people say &quot;I understand&quot; and then &quot;I see,&quot; literature, as an art, begins with the statement &quot;I see&quot; or &quot;I feel&quot; and then moves to &quot;I understand.&quot; Classics like Albert Camus'&quot;The Fall,&quot; Miguel de Cervantes'&quot;Don Quixote,&quot; the children's book &quot;Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes,&quot; Joseph Conrad's &quot;Youth,&quot; Fyodor Dostoevsky's &quot;Notes from Underground,&quot; Nikos Kazantzakis'&quot;Zorba the Greek,&quot; and Somerset Maugham's &quot;Rain&quot; help an individual make better decisions by providing direct analogies to real life events, forcing  self-criticism, assisting in the questioning of reality and the redefining of ideas, and helping people to see with their feelings and to see through the eyes of others. Teachers of English can choose to teach literature from the inside rather than the outside. Comprehension, structure and vocabulary can be supplanted by a partaking of the character's life, watching the implications of the character's actions, and finally understanding individual lives through the lives of others.

Several planning strategies can assist in promoting this integration. A writing program should involve all related campus activities and constituencies, including coordination with writing centers, honors programs, business communication courses, and other relevant courses and programs. Secondly, administrators can develop an integrated, comprehensive writing program by cataloguing all existing aspects of writing instruction on campus, an exercise which could highlight needed program components. Writing program administrators should develop programs in which  they would want to participate as students. In addition, the program should be specific to local needs and aspirations, based on student, faculty, and community expectations. Planning is important, but should be viewed as a continuous process, progressing simultaneously with evaluation and action. Finally, staffing, curriculum, pedagogy, theory, research, and evaluation are all integral to a comprehensive writing program, and are interdependent elements in a successful program.

In the field of English, process is associated with writing and content is associated with literature. However, process and content are extremely important in the teaching of literature and the teaching of writing. Process means establishing a context in the classroom in which learning and  communication can occur, one which focuses on how to read student writing and how to listen to student voices. Content is literature, defined as broadly as possible to include traditional genres, non-fiction prose, theories, practices, classics from the canon and works by women and minorities. For a coherent general education program in English, the ideal involves the integration in all courses of process and content, writing and literature. (MS)",

The concept of &quot;convention&quot; may be especially useful in rethinking the teleological basis of these textbook descriptions. Conventions found in composition textbooks need to be unmasked as arbitrary concepts which serve to perpetuate the decisions of others and to impose a linear order upon what is necessarily a chaotic process. The authority of printed textbooks coupled with the inclination of many students to reduce the complexity of writing tasks may outstrip some composition teachers' recent efforts to qualify textbook conventions and to encourage a more critical perspective. While the distinctions of invention, writing, and revising should be preserved,  English teachers need to re-examine their attitudes toward these distinctions and how to best teach students to appreciate them. Instead of using clusters, Pentads, and brainstorming lists, a writer could begin with pleasure reading, physical exercise or dreaming. Requiring students to proceed with composition in conventional ways excuses them from the requirement to judge the contextual appropriateness of composing conventions and from inventing their own strategies for writing.

        "description":"By viewing women's literacy within the context of America from the Colonial period until the present, it is clear that men have traditionally shaped and controlled who shall be literate and what shall be viewed as literate, both within and outside the educational system. Women's writing from the Colonial period is virtually non-existent, and studies indicate that women's literacy at this time was low. After mandatory public schooling for both males and females began, the gap between the functional literacy skills of the sexes narrowed considerably between 1780 and 1850. Yet even with the advent of women's education, men reserved serious education for themselves. Although women began to occupy a place of status within the public domain by publishing in most fields after the  mid-19th century, women's studies courses still have only marginal status because of the male-controlled educational system. Few women are found in the more powerful positions of public education. Males command a public discourse community of epic proportions, while women have traditionally been restricted to the private sphere. This public/private dichotomy should be replaced with pluralism, which breaks down the male power structure and promotes cooperation rather than control. In the classroom, the emphasis on argumentative discourse and correct usage should be eliminated, and thought given to developing instead a community of cooperation and an awareness of many equally effective ways of communicating through writing.

        "description":"In writing instruction, emphasis should be placed on developing a sense of a community, focusing on the social or collaborative view of writing. This view contends that writing is taught best as collaborative learning, with the classroom providing a social context in which students come together to develop their writing skills. In the collaborative classroom the teacher is a facilitator, setting up an environment for students to work together on all stages of the writing process. Conversation is encouraged, because writing is viewed as internalized talk. A close connection exists between this type of collaborative learning and social constructionism, or the social construction of knowledge. Social constructionism states that meaning is not privately constructed, but is generated  by social interaction. Advocates of social constructionism believe that the goal of education is to engage the human community in problem-solving and in an ongoing conversation of humankind. Therefore, if both thinking and writing are seen as forms of conversation, then collaborative learning as it relates to the teaching of writing is a practical outcome of social constructionism. Several teaching strategies can be employed to create a collaborative environment, such as encouraging group work, re-evaluating writing assignments, and redefining the teacher's role in the writing process.

        "description":"Scholars from varied disciplines--first language (L1) acquisition, second language (L2) acquisition, composition research, and cognitive psychology--have found a high level of permeability in their search for more effective classroom models of writing instruction. Among the most influential work in this area has been Stephen Krashen's theory of L2 acquisition. Krashen makes a distinction between language learning--involving conscious knowledge of rules--and acquisition, a subconscious process. Cognitive psychologist Jerome Bruner added to Krashen's theory by emphasizing language acquisition as a necessity for thinking and achieving the highest levels of cognitive development. Also influenced by Krashen's work, Alice Horning formed a theory of writing development which states that  for basic writers, academic written English is a second language. Other research--such as the work of Jim Cummins, Janet Emig, and the Bullock Report--shows the increasing overlap of research in L1 and L2 acquisition, language and thought, language and learning, and language and writing. Process writing techniques, reflecting this research, utilize natural language settings which develop communication, which in turn facilitates acquisition. Furthermore, methods that promote writing development necessitate student-centered environments which lower anxiety, increase levels of confidence, and provide natural language contexts based on meaningful communication for both L1 and L2 writers.

        "description":"Composition specialists will find Plato's dialogues, and especially his conception of writing, useful for studying the nature of writing. Plato's strategy, in &quot;Phaedrus&quot; and other dialogues, was to use first person, to conceal himself by using an &quot;I&quot; that he created. In recent times this strategy, using the first person, has been forbidden by many writing teachers, but the writer, through the use of the &quot;I,&quot; develops a facility, a fluency in language that teaches the variousness of the &quot;I.&quot; By using the first person, the writer discovers the multiplicity of selves which reside in the writing. Plato's model, which he developed in &quot;Phaedrus,&quot; is to play at writing rather than to take it seriously. With &quot;Phaedrus,&quot; teachers can help students learn to engage in the sort of play  allowed only through writing--play in which the writer becomes other people with other opinions and other agenda. In this way writing teachers can use the sort of written texts created by Plato to teach students to write. (Two passages from &quot;Phaedrus&quot; and five references are appended.) (MS)",

Analysis of the texts was based on a taxonomy of given/new information developed by Ellen Prince (1981).

        "description":"Until students have opportunities to discover the power of personal expression through writing in the narrative mode, it is dangerous to teach them writing solely in terms of institutional discourse. The goals of institutional prose, or professional writing, are not determined by the writer, and often demand an &quot;objective&quot; style that removes human agency and appears free of moral consequence. Institutions condition people how to feel about realities that the institutions themselves define. Much of this conditioning is done through writing constrained in tone, strategies, and constructions of subjectivity. Although students need training in these rules of writing hierarchical discourse, they must also recognize that institutional discourse often requires the writer to create  managed feelings contradictory to his or her interests. Institutional prose should be taught as a social and vocational function, whose goals are determined by institutions and not by the writers. However, teachers should first encourage students to find their own voices, discovering the social and historical context of their worlds through the narrative mode of thought.

        "description":"To provide a better understanding of the depictions of countries by the news media, it is necessary to determine whether similar portraits are presented in all types of reporting or whether there are different, or even contradictory, portrayals of foreign countries within individual newspapers considered nationally influential. A study examined the images presented of the governments of El Salvador and Nicaragua in four U.S. elite newspapers during 1983, primarily focusing on the frequency and direction of mention. Content analysis was used in an attempt to discern whether an overall image of a foreign country is a reasonable manifestation of how that country is presented in mass media, or whether such an overall measure is too broad. Results indicated considerable differences  between the images presented by domestic and foreign reporters, probably due to the differences in the informational sources they consult and quote in their reports rather than any overt bias. In addition, findings suggest that there is a relationship between the policy position of the U.S. Government toward the governments of El Salvador and Nicaragua and the type of coverage those two governments receive in the elite press of the United States.

        "description":"Responding to the Chapman/Tate survey (1987), which concluded that U.S. doctoral programs in rhetoric and composition lack a well-defined core of related courses, a survey investigated courses offered in 37 doctoral programs in rhetoric and composition. Questionnaires probed three areas: (1) whether or not classical rhetoric was offered, and, if offered, whether it was part of the core requirements; (2) frequency of the course offering, length of time it had been offered in the program, qualifications of the faculty who taught it, average enrollment, and area of student specialty; and (3) coverage, approach, required texts and sample assignments. Findings revealed a lack of uniformity among programs. A course in classical rhetoric was offered in 76% of the programs; and classical  rhetoric was a core requirement in 50% of the programs. Programs that offer the course in classical rhetoric generally offer it every other year, and it is usually taught by a faculty member who is a generalist rather than a specialist in rhetoric. Most courses run one semester, and cover ancient to modern rhetoric. The fact that most of these courses are sweeping one-semester surveys may make meaningful connections to the teaching of writing difficult. In addition, the appropriation of classical rhetoric in composition studies may be leading to theoretical disharmony between rhetoricians and compositionists. (ARH)",

The samples of writing were unrehearsed, 50 minute, in-class essays. Forty students were randomly selected from freshman composition courses to write on pre/post switched topics. Essays were evaluated by both IPC and holistic methods. IPC differs from holistic evaluation by making an analytical evaluation of two essays written by the same student (one early and one late in the course), comparing separate writing subskills (ideas, support, organization, diction, syntax, mechanics, and overall quality).  Findings indicated that holistic evaluation was more costly (44 rater-hours as opposed to 33 for the IPC) and time-consuming. Both methods seemed equally sensitive in detecting overall improvement. However, the IPC method recorded more individual improvement because it rated subskills separately. (Six figures and one table of data are included.) (MM)",

        "description":"In composition studies, the most influential statement of what Brian Street calls the autonomous model of literacy is the work of Walter Ong. Ong bases the foundation of this model on the research on cognitive development done by Alexander Luria, a student of Lev Vygotsky. Ong finds in this research, carried out among the Islamic people of Uzbekistan in the Soviet Union during the 1930s, empirical evidence for his contention that literacy actually causes fundamental changes in human cognition. The weakness of this interpretation is that it fails to consider the context. Ong's reading ignores not only the ethnocentrism and the propaganda value of Luria's research but also the political ideology incorporated into the experiment. In addition, Ong's autonomous reading allows him to  dismiss as &quot;elaborate Marxist scaffolding&quot; the theory underlying Luria's project. This theory of the relationship of language, society, and individual thought leads to a richer explanation of the Uzbeki data than either Ong's neutral autonomous reading or Luria's rudimentary Marxist interpretation. This alternative explanation has implications for our own literacy instruction, for it is consistent with David Bartholomae's findings about the written language of freshmen attempting to move into the academic discourse community.

Its purpose was to aid in the mastery of course material and to contribute to the development of students' skill in written expression. In the first of two studies, 84 students wrote weekly essays and were graded in part for their ability to write complete sentences and use reasonable grammar. The second study restricted the types of essay questions to four classic rhetorical forms studied in freshman composition. Eighty-one students were given examples of how to write answers to such questions and were no longer graded explicitly on their complete sentences and reasonable  grammar; instead they were given a score based on the organization and flow of their essays. Results demonstrate that students do not necessarily improve in their writing skills merely because they are required to write and are being graded on their efforts. Instead an improvement in writing skills was established only after narrowing the kinds of essays students wrote, providing suggestions about writing such essays, and grading the students on the overall quality of their writing.

        "description":"Before students are able to write fairly original, successful, critical essays on literature, they need to become experienced members of the audience for whom they will write, sharing fully the social context of critical writing by becoming part of an interactive, interpretive community. This reader-response technique appears to be the best critical viewpoint for the freshman composition class to adopt. One way to guide students through this method is to first introduce the reading process, the basics of reader response, and German aesthetic theories. Students then react to literary works on the basis of their own unguided, unfocused, aesthetic reactions to the text. As students discover the elements of the literary work, the critical vocabulary they will need for their own  critical essays is then introduced within the contexts of their discussions of the work. Next, students turn to the literary text itself in order to develop and support their viewpoints about that text, giving the text its proper power. As students working in an interpretive community with the literary text before them, they will exchange and confront one another's readings of the text and move from their own experience into the text itself in order to interpret how they all arrive at those meanings. Finally, the &quot;alternative criteria of validity&quot; that students agree upon within their interpretive communities can supply them with the problems they can define and solve in their essays.

        "description":"Rhetorical ethos, or the character of the rhetor as she presents herself in discourse, is vital to the success of any student attempting to enter the universe of academic discourse. According to Aristotle, ethos is demonstrated by showing good sense, good character, and good will. However, in the modern university, with the diversity of population, it is often difficult to teach what is meant by &quot;good.&quot; The collaborative learning classroom is the best environment for developing a sense of appropriate ethos because it provides students with a community which has its own standards. It also provides an audience, which enhances in writers a sense of self and of how to accommodate to an audience's values. Through the collaborative learning processes of arguing, writing, and  criticizing each other's work, students in one freshman English class learned to demonstrate good sense by being thorough, to demonstrate good character by being honest, and to demonstrate good will by being tactful. Students' writings about their collaborative learning experience indicated that they improved their abilities to express their views and influence their audience's views.

        "author":["Terchek, Mary E."],
        "description":"Placements in English departments' internship programs are problematic when writing opportunities lack range and/or depth, but at the same time students often have excellent internship experiences despite limited writing opportunities. An examination of the designs and assumptions of the writing skills internship program in the English Department at the University of Maryland explores these problems and experiences. The program, developed in response to the educational trend towards more vocational majors, assumed that the skills of English majors were linguistic. It requires students to spend one-third of their field work on writing-related activities. For the academic component of the internship, students write a series of technical reports, including a final evaluation of  their placement, and develop a portfolio of their field and academic work. The academic integrity of the program has been insured by the way in which the assignments and portfolio allow close supervision and careful evaluation of the intern. The program is also structured to help students reach the primary goal of the internship--to assume responsibility and grow personally and professionally. This goal is fostered by having students write personal statements, part of their own applications and initial reports on goals and responsibilities, as well as on-going progress reports. This approach makes the individual student's professional growth, not the written products, central to the program. (MS)",

        "author":["Davis, Kevin"],
        "description":"In this study comparing peer group conversation with conversation in other settings, five college freshmen were observed and taped in the 12th week of the semester during a group discussion about their own writing. Four types of conversational moves were tallied: structural comments, solicitations, responses, and reactions. Comparison of these totals with those in teaching, tutoring, and non-teaching settings revealed that peer group conversation most closely resembles non-teaching conversation. Non-teaching or natural conversation has been described as a series of reactions between speakers. Teaching conversation consists of questions from the teacher, student responses, and then teacher reactions. Tutoring settings fall in the middle, with characteristics of both natural and  teaching conversation. All of these settings may be differentiated also in relation to negotiations for control. Non-teaching settings involve little negotiation since participants seem to assume equal status. In traditional teacher settings, the teacher is clearly in control. Questions remaining for future studies are: (1) whether there is a cause and effect relationship between a student's writing ability and that student's participation in the peer group; (2) whether the socialization of women makes them more likely than men to assume active roles in peer groups; and (3) whether peer group conversation's likeness to natural conversation makes it more beneficial to students than other kinds of conversation.

        "description":"As part of a study examining articles on composition at five-year intervals from 1971 through 1987 to explore the evolution of composition knowledge, a study examined articles published in &quot;College Composition and Communication&quot; (CCC) and &quot;College English&quot; (CE) during 1971-72 and 1976-77. A citation list was created by noting the author cited for each article, the title of the work cited, and the author who cited the work. Book reviews, poems, and various information from the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) and the Conference on College Composition and Communication were excluded. The citation list was entered into a computer file, and information was collected concerning: (1) the names and works cited in a given year in each journal; (2) the number of times each  author and work was cited; and (3) the number of different articles in which the citation occurred. For 1971-72, results indicated that although a significant relationship between composition and literary studies and an interest in psychology was revealed, overall the &quot;composition community&quot; did not reflect a central focus or common canon of works, scholars, or ideas to initiate a dialectical process of defining or revising composition knowledge. The year 1976-77 showed a continued interest in composition practice and psychology, and a greater attention to social issues and the role of composition in the university.

In a seventh grade social studies class, 23 students wrote in low-structure content journals for five to ten minutes several times a week throughout the 1986-87 school year. High-structure content journals were used in an eighth grade science class of 26 students, writing on specific assignments for the same time period. In the final month of school, a 10-statement attitude survey was  administered in which students were asked to agree or disagree with five positive and five negative statements concerning content journals. In addition to the attitude survey, three open-ended sentence stems were given to further assess students' attitudes. Results showed that the low-structure group was more positive than the high-structure group about the journals. However, the high-structure group reported the journal as enhancing learning while the low-structure group viewed journals as providing an opportunity to express personal opinions.

        "author":["Dandy, Evelyn Baker"],
        "description":"Because an instructor's attitude toward students' language is a crucial factor in determining whether students will be active participants in the educational process, it is important for teachers to be aware of dialect differences. Labelled by many as &quot;nonstandard,&quot; Black English is a dialect derived from Gullah, a creole based on English and West African languages. Black English: (1) is not spoken by all Blacks all of the time--many Blacks are bidialectal; (2) shares many features with other dialects of English; and (3) is a legitimate linguistic system that has its own rules. Several studies, as well as classroom observation, reveal that teachers often fail to understand alternate dialects and allow dialect difference to interfere with their assessments of their students'  abilities. For example, although a study of children and adults in two southern cities revealed that the pronunciation of &quot;skr&quot; for &quot;str&quot; is a common Black English dialect alternation, one student, a good reader, became deeply embarrassed when his teacher repeatedly corrected him during oral reading for pronouncing the &quot;skr&quot; alternation. This type of practice causes students to form negative attitudes about school. Teachers can help their students by understanding that all dialects are logical, rule-governed systems; being courteous and supportive; correcting only for meaning; pointing out the advantages of code switching; and serving as appropriate models.

        "description":"Designed to examine the experiences of writing teachers and their students in the United States and the United Kingdom, a comparative study administered questionnaires to &quot;successful&quot; teachers and secondary school students and conducted observational studies in a small number of classrooms in both countries. The sample of 560 U.S. teachers was gathered through the National Writing Project (NWP), which yearly identifies successful local teachers. Each teacher was asked to select two high achieving and two low achieving students to answer the questionnaire, with 715 students responding. In the U.K., 218 teachers were surveyed from a variety of geographical areas, grade levels, and types of schools, and 244 student questionnaires were administered. Topics for the teacher  questionnaires included: (1) teacher training; (2) teaching conditions; (3) length of time, amount, and length of writing; (4) teachers' reasons for teaching writing; (5) teaching practices; (6) types of writing taught; and (7) keys to achieving success. The student questionnaire covered school leaving age, grading and examinations, amount of writing, and students' opinions about their teachers' practices. Results showed that U.K. teachers were student-centered while U.S. teachers were curriculum-centered. The U.K. teachers emphasized imaginative writing, while U.S. teachers emphasized analytic writing and critical thinking. Teachers from both countries believed in individualizing instruction, and students were optimistic about their educational opportunities. Observational studies are  still in progress.

Many distinctly modern cultural texts use letters both as phonetic code and as a pictorial element of visual design, thus combining the modes of signification of phonetic and picture writing. Both pictographs and ideographs bear a natural resemblance to their meanings, and have visual presence in messages that are as much graphic designs as text. Modern text-and-image messages, such as commercial promotions, merge  imagerial elements with print. Electronic media provide immediate and vivid experiences which can be shared by groups, replacing solitary reading with participation in a common symbolic environment, which tends to break down social hierarchies and promote egalitarianism. On the other hand, electronic media can overwhelm the sense of logical process found in print, and encourage spontaneity at the expense of reflection. A shift from print media to image-oriented media is not necessarily imminent, but a communication technology in which print is handled electronically, as screen images, may become an extension of print media, requiring a new literacy which will not replace print, but will accommodate and enrich it.

Four treatments--SSM, MD, Cognitive Modification (a combined version of SSM and MD), and an attention-placebo treatment--were administered to four different groups (a total of 53 university students with high self-ratings of speech anxiety) in four two-hour periods, preceded and followed by assessment sessions. A five-week follow-up assessment was  performed, which included self-report measures of speech and social anxiety, as well as stress-condition measures (self-report and behavioral) of acute speech anxiety. Results indicated that SSM was the most effective strategy for reducing speech anxiety, and that students experiencing high social anxiety benefited more from treatments than those experiencing low social anxiety. The synergy hypothesis, designed to examine an additional unique effect resulting from the interplay of procedures, was not supported.

        "author":["Ellis, Dwight M."],
        "description":"In some areas of employment in mass communications Blacks and other minorities have made impressive gains, but in others, such as the newspaper industry, there is a distinct lack of minorities in the work force. The chance that this situation will change is highly likely because the media industries in America are finding it necessary to diversify both their personnel and programming. Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and Native Americans comprise nearly 30 percent of the U.S. population and by the end of the century they may constitute more than half of all Americans. This change will significantly affect all TV advertising and programming. An examination of the relationship of language, culture, and politics provides meaningful insight into current barriers to greater empowerment for  racial and cultural minorities in the United States. Several recent court rulings and the extension of protections and remedies to broader segments of American groups means that competition for the prizes of empowerment and success is increasing. Still, the struggle for greater parity and participation for minorities in media will continue as a cyclical mission. However, the quality of progress will not advance solely from programmatic endeavors--inspired leadership, present and future, will make the difference. (Thirty-one notes, 24 references, and five addendums containing data on minority employment in broadcasting, total number of broadcast stations and number of minority owned stations, and minority employment on newspapers, are appended.)

Better integration of the two will help to clarify the role communication departments play in the academic community, begin a more fertile and generative relationship among faculty, and establish a centered and coherent curriculum for students. Specific suggestions for teaching production courses in the undergraduate curriculum are: (1) focus on process rather than on product; (2) organize assignments so that they use the analysis of techniques which transform reality into images; and (3) help students understand the structures, the assumptions, and the biases of the media environments in which they are immersed.

        "description":"Only one Pittsburgh television station (WPXI) chose to show the entire event when R. Budd Dwyer, Pennsylvania state treasurer, shot himself at a televised news conference. Within 12 hours, the focus of the story had shifted from Dwyer himself to the media's coverage. Was WPXI wrong to show the suicide? Were the other stations wrong to curtail the public's right to know? On an &quot;Action News Special Report&quot; news editors reasoned that showing the suicide was too gruesome, too graphic, served no purpose, and that the audience did not want to see it. &quot;Pittsburgh 2Day,&quot; a locally-produced talk show, devoted its entire hour to media coverage of the suicide. Media persons on the show questioned whether it was right to &quot;manage&quot; the news. A telephone poll of viewers revealed that 46% felt  the entire suicide should have been shown and 54% felt it should not. WPXI's decision not to participate in &quot;Pittsburgh 2Day&quot; lessened the effectiveness of the discussion and led people to conclude that WPXI staff regretted having shown the suicide. The media missed an opportunity to address the larger issue of the need for differing points of view in a democracy. The next time such a controversial event happens, each Pittsburgh station will probably make the same decision as the others regarding proper coverage. (Twelve figures are included.) (MHC)",

After completion and observation of the presentation by 34 students, they were asked to write a brief report evaluating their involvement in the project as a learning experience. Student responses to these questions indicated that their  participation in the project was an enjoyable, positive learning experience. The slide show was presented to 38 students from two sections of the course in the following semester, who then completed a written survey which quizzed them on their knowledge of the concepts covered in the presentation, and solicited their views on the effectiveness of the presentation. Students who observed the presentation exhibited correct understanding of the nonverbal concepts and agreed that the presentation benefited their learning of the material. Comparison of students who produced the presentation with the students who only observed the presentation indicated that the students who produced the presentation gained a more thorough appreciation of the application and relevance of nonverbal communication  concepts.

Early research suggested that men interrupt more than women, and this finding was attributed to the dominant/submissive relationship traditional in relationships among men and women. Later studies, however, found that either there were no significant differences between men and women in the use of interruptions, or that women interrupted more than men. Four different explanations of the function of interruptions can be identified: (1) the dominance perspective, where the purpose of the interruption is to control the conversation; (2) an equalizing perspective, ensuring that each participant receives equal conversation time; (3) a spontaneity providing perspective, where interruptions  add flexibility and spontaneity to conversations, thus providing a healthy atmosphere for communication; and (4) personality variables relating to interruptions, such as intimacy and social anxiety.

Study one tested three models hypothesized to explain this process, an altruistic model, an egoistic model, and a dual-process model combining aspects of both motivational processes. Subjects, 171 students enrolled in introductory communication courses, were given empathy and communicative responsiveness measures, and were asked to respond to a video presentation soliciting volunteer assistance for a cancer aid program. Results indicated support for altruism as a motivator of prosocial behavior and suggest that the egoism and dual-process models are unlikely explanations. Study two  sought additional support for the altruism model, and differed from the first study only in substituting a measure of comforting behavior for volunteering. Students were asked to list the things they would say to comfort a distressed friend. The second study fully replicated the findings of the first study. Together, these findings suggest that prosocial behavior is primarily motivated by concern for others, that emotional reactions to the perceived distress of others are preceded by a concern for others, and that an altruistic interpretation of prosocial behavior should be used to reformulate the egoistic model. A 45-item reference list and various data tables are included. (JG)",

The survey consisted of 405 telephone interviews with parents of children between the ages of 10 and 19, divided equally into four groups: fathers referring to sons, fathers referring to daughters, mothers referring to sons, and mothers referring to daughters. The results suggest that parents' sex, children's sex, and parents' education are the strongest predictors of parents' attitudes toward sex roles and expectations of their children. Both mothers and fathers of girls tended to take somewhat stereotyped views of their children's educational needs,  personality development, and future occupations. Their responses suggested a stronger orientation toward family life for girls, as opposed to a greater emphasis on jobs for personal happiness. Fathers of daughters had the lowest level of occupation expectations for their children among all the parent groups. Mothers of daughters were relatively more supportive of expanded work opportunities for women than fathers of daughters were. Mothers talking about sons stood out as the group with the highest expectations of their children and the most traditional views of male and female roles.

One effective segmentation strategy (used at Minnesota Opionion Research Incorporated--MORI) is to divide the population into four groups, based on relevant behavior and apparent likelihood of change in that behavior, and to use discriminant analysis to &quot;predict&quot; individuals who are users and non-users of a product or service. Another useful reader typology is a typology of mobility, showing how people relate to their communities and the role of that relationship to newspaper reading. A third typology measures attitudes toward media, news, and alienation from society,  classifying the public into two groups--&quot;sophisticated skeptics&quot; and &quot;less well informed and suspicious.&quot; These two subgroups are further defined by the variables of demographics, perceptions of media philosophies, perceptions of bias and opinion in media, and attitudes toward the media. In contrast to these audience groups, groups of journalists represent a typology which can contribute to a theory of people in the media. One such typology divides journalists into subgroups based on their age and relationship to their community. (Two pages of footnotes and 11 tables of data are appended.) (MM)",

The paper states that (1) the seven studies compare two or more procedures; (2) they have been published or presented to professional meetings; (3) they are described in terms of their historical evolution as improvements on the Kish procedure for telephone surveying; and (4) comparisons show that all the methods vary in their biases. The paper suggests that the last-birthday, Collier-Hagan, and Bryant modification of the Troldahl-Carter method appear to be the most  representative procedures and that Kish and Troldahl-Carter techniques appear to lead to less representative samples than other techniques. Other procedures reported in the paper include two non-probability ones, a &quot;Stanford modification&quot; of Troldahl-Carter, and a modification of the Troldahl-Carter-Bryant correction for overrepresentation of women. The paper suggests more systematic testing of different combinations of respondent selection methods and more replication are needed to learn more about external validity, representativeness, and other criteria to help evaluate the most effective selection strategies for specific projects.

The Q-sort, which incorporates Q methodology into a measure, allows respondents to sort statements (pictures or other materials) according to an agree--disagree (pleasure--unpleasure) continuum. Using this method, researchers can construct a theoretically based measure in which the respondents restructure information to reflect their interpretations. A study on music videos effectively illustrates the use of Q-sort statements as a research tool. Q methodology can also be used as an instructional tool, as demonstrated by a sophomore level  interpersonal communication course structured around the design and completion of three Q-sorts. Course evaluations indicated that the use of Q methodology was an effective teaching strategy.

        "description":"Furthering research on the explanations for gender differences in nonverbal expression, a study investigated the types of posed smiles depicted in sorority and fraternity photographs, and related them to whether or not the subject held a leadership position in that organization. Five sororities and five fraternities at a large eastern university were included in the study--the total number of subjects was 746. Two composite photographs from each organization, showing the face and neck of each member, were rated on a simplified version of Ewan C. Grant's smile scale. Four types of increasingly broad smiles were identified. Results showed that females gave statistically significantly wider smiles than males. Also, female leaders gave significantly wider smiles than female  nonleaders. However, there was not a significant difference between male leaders and non-leaders in smiling wideness. The Upper Smile (which shows the top teeth only) was by far the most frequent smile observed: it was found in over one half of the photographs in each of the groups. Also, females were much more likely than males to show teeth in their smiles. Female leaders did not differ from nonleaders in showing teeth, but they showed over twice as many broad smiles as did female nonleaders. Male leaders did not differ significantly from male nonleaders in either respect. (ARH)",

        "description":"In order to attract strong faculty members, many of whom may not realize initially the distinctive strengths of small colleges, small schools need to work hard and plan well to recruit and hire qualified faculty in communication and theatre. A search and screen process which presents an accurate and attractive picture of the small college is an important part in achieving that end. The first step in the process is a thorough consideration of the nature of the position. The department should be explicit about the duties that will be assumed by the new faculty member, and should encourage administrators to offer the most competitive salary possible. The second step, publicizing the position, is best carried out through a combination of an advertisement in at least one of the  national publications with distribution of a printed flyer. The third step, the interview, is the most powerful way to convey to the candidate the distinctive attractiveness of the college. Involvement of top level administrators and/or students in the interview process stresses an institution's distinctiveness. Candidates, who are likely to assume that the publish or perish model which is active in many institutions is being followed, should be informed if a school bases tenure and promotion upon different criteria. Information highlighting the attractiveness of the living situation, academic distinctiveness, and fringe benefits should also be offered. (ARH)",

The liberal arts curriculum should include a course examining the omnipresent process of aging and its relationship to communication. Gerontology and observation of and interaction with people of older generations can all provide valuable knowledge and sources to include in a course on aging and communication. Courses in sociology, psychology, anthropology, interpersonal communication, mass media, and group interaction and discussion may all serve as useful prerequisites for the student of communication and aging. Important topics to be covered in a communication and  aging course include: (1) development throughout the life cycle; (2) the aging process and communicative interaction (intrapersonal and interpersonal); (3) communication across and between age levels; (4) mass media and the aging; and (5) communication specialists in aging-related organizations and settings.

Approximately 300 undergraduate students completed three survey instruments that measured (1) willingness to communicate; (2) communication apprehension; and (3) communication competence. Data were analyzed using canonical correlation analysis and the Pearson Product-Moment Correlation. Results supported the hypothesis. A relationship appeared to exist between communication apprehension, willingness to communicate, and  perceptions of interpersonal communication competence.

        "description":"The Know-Nothing party of the 1850s was the first nativist party in American politics to gain importance and serves as an exemplar of how cultural nativism may be captured and turned toward political goals. The resurgence of nativist sentiment in the Know-Nothing era provides an excellent example of a rhetorical situation which seriously constrains the form of the accompanying rhetoric. To overcome the failings of nativist rhetoric, the Know-Nothings linked nativism to common American values in such a manner that audiences were convinced that nativism was consistent with American tradition. The Know-Nothing party created their conspiracy theory along traditional lines and by appealing to three basic concepts that were strong in the American mind at that time: secrecy, patriotism,  and Protestantism. The use of these three basic American values enabled the party to construct a drama consistent with the values of the natives, thus easily incorporating it into the traditional American mythology. The failure of the Know-Nothing party was that it did not adjust its story to respond to the demands of the changing rhetorical situation, which include the party's refusal to acknowledge a strong competing counter-explanation of the country's problems and the party's ignorance of a dramatic change that had taken place in the American audience, that is the division of a country on the brink of civil war.

Mainframe networks--large computers used by universities before the advent of microcomputers--serve the needs of many users at once. Mainframe users send and receive messages through &quot;electronic mail,&quot; connecting them with other users. This information sharing, or &quot;connectivity,&quot; can be adapted to create communication networks between instructors and students. A computer applications specialist is helpful when designing an educational computer network using a mainframe computer. The advantages of a computer network include the timeliness of the interactions, the computer's word  processing capabilities, the ease of evaluating assignments, and the facilitation of communication between the instructor and students. In addition, the discussion forum created through electronic mail can successfully extend classroom discussions. Network and mainframe software capabilities allow an instructor to design specific applications for a variety of communication courses, such as public speaking, organizational communication, and journalism. Both students and instructors can benefit from increased interaction opportunities and from the experience gained in computer-mediated communication.

The nations selected for study included three developed countries (Britain, the Soviet Union, and Japan) and three developing countries (Mexico, India, and Venezuela). Knowledge about the countries was measured by asking respondents to identify the capital and estimate the population and income per person for each country. Respondents were also given the name of each country's political leader and were asked to name that leader's country. Favorableness of opinion was assessed by asking respondents to rate each country on a scale of zero to 100, with  zero representing an extremely unfavorable opinion. News orientation variables included traditional exposure items and measures of attention to news. Results indicated that individuals acquire knowledge about the characteristics of developing and developed countries from news in cosmopolitan print media, and from attention to news. Furthermore, data showed that an individual's attention to news about developed countries may contribute to more favorable impressions of them. Results provided evidence consistent with both the optimistic view (media enhances audiences' understanding of nations) and the pessimistic view (audiences acquire negative attitudes from news about developing countries) of news impact on audience knowledge.

The editors of these newspapers are gatekeepers who, like their counterparts on large elite newspapers, play a fundamental role in determining the images of the world which their readers receive. To measure &quot;typical&quot; American editors' views of what are the most important problems facing the world press, editorial staffs of 31 small- and 30 medium-size daily newspapers and 38 state newspapers (largest daily newspaper in the state) answered questionnaires (an overall response rate of 66%). Findings indicate that the editors on these newspapers regarded government  pressure on the press, such as governmental controls, closings of newspapers, and gags on the press, as a major problem. Other problems which emerged from the analysis but which were not seen as important included development-related problems, coverage of the Third World, and professional needs of the newspaper industry. Results also suggest that the concerns of the world press problems among the editors of small- and medium-size daily newspapers may not be greatly different from the concerns of the large, elite press.

When students are invited to consider language as an instrument for thinking, their imaginative (thinking) engagements are set underway very differently from when students think of language as bits of information to be internalized or memorized. When students are given the responsibility for creating meanings, they can become imaginatively engaged.

However, the glamorous image of the city has changed over the years, and in the 1960s, popular music, in particular, began to reflect a utopia/dystopia dichotomy in relation to New York. During the past twenty years, six popular singer-songwriters who have produced record albums destined for mass market consumption and specifically dealing with the concept of the city are (1) Laura Nyro--&quot;New York Tendaberry&quot; (1969); (2) Bruce Springsteen--&quot;The Wild, the Innocent, and the E-Street Shuffle&quot; (1973); (3) Neil Diamond--&quot;Beautiful Noise&quot; (1976); (4) Billy Joel--&quot;52nd Street&quot; (1978); (5) Joe Jackson--&quot;Night and Day&quot; (1982) and &quot;Body and Soul&quot; (1984); and (6) Bryan Ferry (Roxy Music)--&quot;Avalon&quot;  (1982). Although the six musicians all project different visions of New York City, such is the city's diversity that each succeeding portrayal seems as valid as the previous one. Each artist uses the city in his or her own way, either as background or as foreground for particular preoccupations; some of them present realistic pictures of the city, while others go out of their way to avoid realism. The essential kernel of truth about New York City seems to be that it reflects the wishes and desires of those who inhabit or visit it, and that is all. (NKA)",

This paper briefly describes all correlates and then focuses on climate and expectations as applied to improving science instruction. Although climate originally referred to the physical comforts of a school or classroom, it came to denote the psychological environment--an environment conducive to learning. This concept can be further expanded by adding a planning dimension, including organization and management. Organization refers to things a teacher does (curriculum planning, activities, and strategies) before students are present. Management refers to things a teacher does (teaching and explaining  and justifying classroom rules) after students have arrived. Both phases are essential and complementary. Hints are provided to ensure that classroom activities are satisfying and move along at a brisk pace. Sound instructional objectives and high teacher expectations are very important in science classes. Teachers must be careful not to discourage female students from pursuing an interest in science. There is a high correlation between attitudes and achievement. Teachers should be concerned about students' misconceptions about scientific concepts and their attitudes toward science. The best hope for encouraging students to consider science careers is to make their classes interesting, challenging, and meaningful. Proper classroom management techniques get students off to a good start.  Included are 15 references. (MLH)",

        "author":["Bredeson, Paul V."],
        "description":"Leaders in any organization can usually see beyond their immediate surroundings and stir the consciousness, emotions, and energies of others to move in a similar direction. This paper suggests metaphor as a useful construct for understanding how people in schools respond to these elusive, yet persuasive leadership influences. Metaphoric languages are at the heart of organizational leadership and communications and provide helpful frameworks for enhancing teaching, research, and educational administration practice. Recent research has explored how metaphors underlying organizational life are generated, how they represent organizational processes, and how they guide the actions of those within particular social settings. Using metaphor as an instructional device allows students to  examine school structures, beliefs, values, and social norms from multiple perspectives. One example might be comparing schools and service stations. Using metaphor as a research tool can provide distinctive lenses for viewing, describing, and interpreting social phenomena and can help create new realities, concepts, and ways of viewing the same phenomena. For example, viewing the school through rational/mechanistic, organic, or critical theory lenses is bound to produce varying results. The most important application of metaphor to administrative practice is as a tool for creative insight into organizational problem-solving. Since leadership is the exercise of influence, school leaders' choice of metaphors can be a source of power. Included are 17 references. (MLH)",

        "author":["Moersch, Christopher M."],
        "description":"Since the publication of &quot;A Nation at Risk,&quot; curriculum leaders have been under increased pressure to make more prudent, informed decisions about allocating district resources that will directly or indirectly lead to increased student achievement. The decision-making process should include a thorough investigation of the best and most cost-effective methodologies, strategies, and programs to achieve the desired outcomes. This paper summarizes the results of a study to provide Grossmont Union High School District (San Diego County, California) with a basis for comparing the effects of computer-assisted learning, cooperative learning, peer tutoring, and class size on academic achievement. A literature review yielded encouraging evidence concerning the effectiveness of cooperative  learning and peer tutoring for increased academic achievement. Cooperative learning, employing the group study approach and group rewards for individual learning, produced higher achievement gains than conventional instruction. Numerous research studies support computer-based instruction as a viable supplementary medium for increasing student achievement, although additional research into microcomputer applications is needed. Class size had the least empirical support as a viable strategy for increasing student achievement. Excluded from this study were per capita student costs, physical space requirements, and scheduling considerations--important factors when allocating district funds to support a particular program. Included is a bibliography of 42 references. (MLH)",

          "King, Jean A."],
        "description":"This paper describes a structure for assessing the school evaluation use process developed from a longitudinal case study of districtwide and school level evaluation procedures in a large urban school district. Two fundamental questions guided the study: (1) Why isn't the evaluation process more useful to decision-makers and practitioners? and (2) If it is not useful, is it worth the effort? In the absence of pertinent literature, research focused on people on the \"front lines\"--the teachers, principals, and project implementers. Central office managers, and evaluators were consulted to determine possible communication gaps. Data were collected over a 6-year period through formal and informal observation of activities and interviews with key actors responsible for implementing  evaluation unit functions. Results showed that program evaluation in schools involves implementing a complex, innovative concept that for most school staff (including managers) is unfamiliar, confusing, and even intimidating. This means evaluation use is not a simple matter of reviewing recommendations and following through on suggested changes. In reality, the evaluation use process challenges people to modify their routines and design new ways of accommodating to changing job demands. After discussing evaluation and innovation, the structure of school evaluation use is explained and applications are outlined. As with other innovations, integrating evaluation into complex school organizations is evolutionary and likely to cause disruption. Even so, evaluation is well worth the effort.  Included are two appendices and a bibliography of 43 references. (MLH)",

        "author":["Haggerson, Nelson"],
        "description":"During a 1985 symposium in Chicago sponsored by the American Society for Curriculum Development, Noreen Garman, Carl Glickman, and Madeline Hunter discussed the question of whether clinical supervision should be used for formal evaluation and contract renewal. While Hunter's answer was a qualified \"yes,\" Garman and Glickman both felt strongly that it should not. Nevertheless, evaluation of teachers in schools is often tied to the \"Hunter Model,\" even though Hunter expressed reservations regarding such use. Inquiring why this is so, this paper argues that the language used by proponents of clinical supervision implies a form of evaluation that is generated to judge the outcomes of the process, regardless of the original intent of these proponents. A second proposition discussed is  that if the language used to describe a \"model,\"\"strategy,\" or \"practice\" is literal, it implies a literal evaluation process, whereas if it is figurative, it implies a figurative process. The third proposition is that in a society caught up in rapid technological change, with a need for fast answers and definitive directions, those responsible for evaluation of instruction naturally tend to develop and use literal, not figurative or imaginative, evaluation instruments and practices. These propositions are investigated through analysis of the use of literal or figurative language in the text of the Hunter, Garman, and Glickman symposium. Findings are that Hunter's model of clinical supervision is based on literal language, Garman's is based on figurative language, and Glickman's is based  on both, but predominantly figurative. But in a country possessed with the need for literal accountability of their teachers and schools, Hunter's language has naturally come to predominate. (TE)",

        "description":"The National Commission on Excellence in Educational Administration 1987 report, &quot;Leaders for America's Schools,&quot; has brought renewed attention to the underrepresentation of women and minorities in educational administration. This study attempts to collect data on placement practices of educational administration professors, analyze findings, and discuss implications for women and minority graduates. Survey data (open-ended questions) were collected from department chairpersons and a random sample of professors selected from the University Council for Educational Administration membership. Data were analyzed using qualitative methods, coding like responses into categories or theme areas. Results suggest that traditional stereotypic images are most likely to inhibit placement  opportunities in positions in which minorities and women have not been &quot;seen&quot; in the designated role or setting. Professors can work to increase these candidates' visibility. Departments of education can more actively socialize students to the importance of leadership development through professional organizations or community service work. Faculty can formalize the development of students' job search and self-marketing skills and emphasize the importance of (1) maintaining close working relationships and visibility profiles with advisors and other faculty; (2) developing mentoring and networking opportunities in professional circles; and (3) encouraging the early identification and communication of career plans and goals. Job mobility factors also need to be addressed. Efforts to help  minority and women placements should also benefit administrator preparation programs as a whole. Included are 34 references. (MLH)",

These assumptions are explored first through a discussion of issues related to the definition of inservice education, where a typology is proposed, based on three orders of learning: reorienting, initiating, and refining. Issues related to conceptualization or justification of inservice education are next addressed, followed by a discussion of issues  related to three aspects of the setting: sponsorship, involvement in planning, and school climate for adult learning. Issues related to design include the characteristics of successful learning groups, learning incentives and rewards, and optimum learning experiences.

        "description":"This paper is a response to two recommendations for preservice training of school administrators proposed in the 1987 report of the National Commission on Excellence in Educational Administration: that greater attention be placed on discovering ways in which universities and local education agencies might collaborate more effectively in the preparation of educational administrators; and that administrative preparation programs include more opportunities for \"clinical\" approaches to learning. Accordingly, the status of administrator preparation in the United States is examined to determine the extent to which these potential improvements have been realized. The first part discusses existing barriers to collaboration between universities and local education agencies, including  institutional territoriality, the absence of parity between partners, and the lack of staff time. After a brief discussion of attempts to increase clinical preparation, a tridimensional model of administrator preparation is presented. The three dimensions are academic preparation, field-based programs, and \"professional formation.\" The latter conception refers to activities that help an aspiring administrator to synthesize his or her learnings through preservice mentoring, personal reflection, developing a personal educational \"platform,\" understanding interpersonal styles, and personal professional development. The final section of the paper describes a recent program that incorporates many of these concepts, the Danforth Foundation Program for the Preparation of School Principals.

Unfortunately, today's educators are so involved with reading instruction and competency testing that independent or recreational reading may become a lost art. This paper asserts that principals should be directly involved in providing staff development, supporting the link between independent and creative reading, promoting schoolwide efforts, and being realistic about how to proceed. In one plan, blocks of independent reading time are spaced throughout the school year in a variety of subjects. For this plan to succeed, classrooms must be organized as circulating minilibraries. Teachers must serve as reading models  while students are reading silently. Teachers can also vary the routine by reading aloud sections of an interesting book, motivating individuals to discuss their books, or encouraging students to serve as journalists for a classroom newspaper. Commitment to such a plan suggests the need for an administrator who is knowlegeable, has courage, and relates well to teachers. Although the principal's leadership is not a panacea, it can significantly affect our society's future literacy. Included are nine references. (MLH)",

The key to any successful professional growth program is preparation, involving several essential components to ensure that both teachers and administrators receive maximum benefit from the appraisal process. Research indicates that strong administrative leadership in the evaluation process is also helpful. This paper shows that combining a strong administrative leader with certain appraisal elements can build a more effective school system and that performance appraisal can be used to enhance professionalism. Adequate planning, especially regarding participatory goal-setting, is an essential element surpassed only by desire for improvement in importance. The belief that all teachers and  administrators can become effective is necessary to keep administrator leadership from becoming merely an exercise in authority. Top-down commitment to improvement is also important, as districts control the time and money necessary to train administrators as evaluators. Oklahoma's progress in administrator training programs is briefly discussed. Teachers must also have time to confer with administrators to pinpoint weaknesses and work out corrective strategies. Finally, effective two-way communication that includes feedback and evaluation is a never-ending process that should lead to continued improvement as a goal for everyone.

        "description":"Research for Better Schools and a Maryland county school district developed a school improvement program to examine the relationship between the program and subsequent improvement. The program involved a self-assessment survey, choosing goals for the following year, assigning a committee of practitioners to lead the program, executing the plan created by the committee, and completing the self-assessment survey at the end of the school year to analyze the amount of improvement. The Dimensions of Excellence Scales (DoES) was employed to assess program effects and the School Survey was employed to measure program implementation. The study reveals that every school except one significantly improved; schools that achieved high faculty completion rates on the DoES made only moderate  school improvement; no relationship seemed to exist between participation in the program and the amount of improvement; improvement was affiliated with the original pretest status; and schools with better pretest scores attracted more faculty personnel to the program. Essentially, no consistent relationship was evident between involvement in the program and school improvement. Future school improvement efforts should consider the context of the school.

        "description":"A second wave of educational reform is closely scrutinizing fundamental issues (structure, organization, management, curriculum, and instruction) and calling for at least partial restructuring of the public school system. After presenting a scenario of an ideally restructured elementary school, this paper explores the &quot;why,&quot;&quot;what,&quot; and &quot;how&quot; of restructuring for Maine faculty and administrators involved in the state's Restructuring Schools Project. Although some states have made significant progress and can point to steady standardized test scores, the dropout rate remains excessive, students still possess inadequate writing skills, and educators continue to deplore students' inability to use higher order thinking processes. Other challenges include new technological advances,  growing numbers of nonfamily households, an aging population, a growing demand for skilled workers in a rapidly changing labor force, and increasing numbers of poor and minority students. Attempts to define restructuring as a solution are discussed, along with definitions of what it is not (tinkering around the edges or improving existing structures). Next, eight critical restructuring components are outlined, including the need to focus at the buiding level, educate all students, clarify and raise expectations, personalize teaching and learning, rethink administrative roles and responsibilities, apply research and development knowledge, humanize the organizational climate, and involve parents and the community. Finally, a model restructuring plan is described. Appendices detail five  examples of innovative restructuring programs and list relevant resources. Also included are 36 references. (MLH)",

The steps in the delegation process include task identification, assessment of skills necessary to execute the task, selection of the subordinate for the task, communication of the task, assignment of the task and the resources for executing it, monitoring, and feedback to the subordinate. Because ambiguities regarding the subordinate's role may result in stress, a distinction should be drawn between routine work and delgated work. Administrators should ensure that delegated work is distributed equally, assign an appropriate degree of authority, ensure that subordinates have equal growth opportunity, and consider  job enrichment. Benefits of delegation to the organization include increased results and productivity, faster reactions to various situations, more employees with a broader knowledge of the organization, better communication, clear policies, less employee turnover, and a fuller use of personnel. Delegation benefits administrators in that they may use their time more efficiently. Finally, benefits to subordinates include less stress on the job, increased capabilities, more responsibility and autonomy, increased self-esteem, involvement in professional development, the use of otherwise dormant skills, increased motivation and job satisfaction, and less staff turnover.

In 1980, the Board of Directors of the National Study of School Evaluation perceived the need for a K-12 self-study instrument. Consequently, the executive director of the board and a national advisory committee proceeded to develop the materials for the instrument. Suggestions were submitted so that the instrument would address specific demands. Twelve schools tested the instrument from 1981 to 1982. After the program, 70 percent of the participants responded to a questionnaire that would endeavor to determine if a K-12 self-study is more beneficial to the whole unit school and if the curriculum had more continuity as a  consequence of a K-12 self-study. The results show that 73 percent of the respondents thought that the K-12 self-study was more beneficial, while 21 percent did not; 55 percent thought the curriculum exhibited more cohesiveness as a consequence of the self-study, while 27 percent thought it did not. A larger scale study is suggested to judge if the benefits to unit schools are long-range plans, short-term adjustments, or only the optimism of the program participants.

Psychoeducational profiles describing two children were distributed to 108 multidisciplinary teams in New York City. Team members (first individually and then in groups) were asked to read the case summaries and select an appropriate placement from six program alternatives. Each case was prefaced by a referral statement indicating whether the teacher supported a change of placement into a least restrictive environment. Previous review of each case by a panel of experts had determined that neither child met the state's criteria for identification  of the handicapped. Results indicated that the teams' placement recommendations, like those by the individual members, were substantially biased by the teacher's opinion. Each team's placement decision was also significantly influenced by the opinion of the psychologist in the group. Although the teams tended to move children from the special class into the least restrictive alternative slightly more often than did individuals, differences between the group and the individual decision making process were not significant.

Significant differences in rate of engagement were found for classroom setting, type of instruction, and level of peer involvement. LD students were more academically engaged: in the resource room than in the regular class; during teacher directed instruction than during seatwork in both settings; and when entire class engagement was high. Results indicated that degree of attending is highly related to the  context in which it occurs and is not a fixed quality of the child.

The baby, who had been developing normally, was bottlefed by \"strangers\" for 2 days and then began to avert her eyes from all people, an autistiform behavior which persisted and grew worse as the mother tried to re-establish eye contact. In conformance with theories of autism as a disturbance of symbiosis, the mother was advised to avoid all eye contact at first, while giving her baby intensive \"holding contact.\" With this approach the mother succeeded in restoring the symbiotic bond with the baby, thus saving the infant from further autistiform deterioration. Therapy developed by J. A. B. Allan and R. W. Zaslow emphasized various preventive holding  methods and playful sensori-motor movement programs for parents to practice with disturbed babies in order to diminish their babies' autistiform behavior, improve their symbiotic bond, and prevent later autism.

It describes the referral and identification process, program characteristics, current problems and issues. The first section presents statistics related to prevalence, types of programs received, costs of special education, and the certification and supply of special education teachers. The second section describes a study of 94 randomly selected behaviorally handicapped students receiving special education programs. Discussed are reasons for referral, the referral process, assessment procedures, and major components of the individualized education program (IEP) for students assigned to resource programs, special education classrooms, and residential treatment centers. Among conclusions are  the following: most behaviorally handicapped students were initially referred to special education prior to the end of the third grade; one-third of the sample reported contact with state and community services; the determination that a student is behaviorally handicapped was often made without systematically obtained assessment data; most (58%) students were viewed by teachers as having significant learning problems in addition to behavioral handicaps; students were mainstreamed an average of 28% of their school day; most elementary resource teachers were certified in the area of learning disabilities; and, achievement tests and tests of intelligence were the most frequently used measures of student progress.

Survey results produced four major findings: (1) all but three states have legislation or state board of education policies regulating minimum graduation units; (2) 36 states reported that they have raised academic unit requirements since 1975; (3) most of the states with increased unit requirements reported that these policies are still being phased in, thus indicating that their full implications for special education students are unknown; and (4) 30 states reported having a minimum competency program, 15 of which determined students'  exit documents by their scores on a minimum competency test. Implications for special education students include the following: the emphasis on academic subjects stressed content which may not be relevant to some special education students; special education students who complete goals of the Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) may be differentiated from the norm group by a differential diploma or certificate. Such differential diplomas may preclude or negatively affect postsecondary education and employment opportunities. Recommendations for developing state level policies that balance the concerns of appropriate education and equal opportunity are presented. (DB)",

The program's goal is to facilitate the establishment of independent vocational skills, through individual and group training and work-related counseling. Student workers are expected to become competent in the skills of: work orientation, punctuality/attendance, attention to task, safety on the job, co-worker interaction, supervisor interaction,  quality and speed of production, and independent transportation. Specific objectives for each area of skill development are outlined, along with appropriate training activities. Training activities utilize such techniques as individual instruction in performing work tasks and in self-monitoring, work critiques, various levels of training assistance, and individual/group instruction and counseling in work-related behaviors. Admission and discharge criteria for students are described. A copy of the Student Worker Assessment Checklist is included. (JDD)",

Three secondary purposes included evaluating effects of intervention upon the communication skills of the Down syndrome children, effects of intervention on interactions with mothers when playing with their Down syndrome children, and evaluation of parent perceptions of interventions with siblings. Baseline, intervention, and follow-up phases were employed. Intervention was delivered over six sessions in the context of familiar games (e.g., ball play, blowing bubbles, peek-a-boo), employing procedures which included modeling with puppets in a series of six videotaped segments, verbal  instruction, role playing, and social reinforcement. Results indicated that older siblings consistently increased contingent responses to younger siblings' nonverbal turns. Increased communication of younger siblings was observed in higher frequency of spontaneous comments and more response to turns by older siblings. Younger siblings did not, however, increase initiated turns as a result of intervention with older siblings. Contingent responses by mothers measured before and after intervention did not indicate changes related to the intervention by older siblings. Parents reported they observed a moderate level of change in the interactive play of their children. (JW)",

Two preliminary experiments validated the affective content of 29 sentences and of tone of voice respectively. Among results  of the study comparing disturbed (N=34) and normal (N=34) 7- to 10-year-old children's interpretations of messages were: both groups rated discrepant messages as more angry than nondiscrepant messages; disturbed children were more likely to interpret messages primarily on the basis of verbal content; and disturbed children interpreted messages as happier than did normal children.

The normalization principle suggests that interventions be age appropriate and functional. For children younger than 3 years an age appropriate and functional intervention program would emphasize social reciprocity recognizing the fact that parent-child interactions are often interrupted and distorted because of such child characteristics as nonresponsiveness, inability to \"take in,\" to feel comfort, atypical motor responses, and atypical daily living needs. The curriculum stresses the need of parents to feel competent about handling the young child, to feel effective  in meeting the child's needs, to observe positive changes in return for their caregiving; and the need of the child to sustain the caregiver's attention, to communicate needs, and to develop satisfying relationships. The project's implementation strategies include an early intervention model that is both home-based and center-based and the establishment of individualized social reciprocity goals for both parent and child.

Results were organized according to seven themes: (1) variation in local implementation in Public Law 94-142, the Education for All Handicapped Children Act; (2) magnitude of the referral, evaluation, and placement process; (3) limited exit from special education programs; (4) limited participation in vocational education programs; (5) involvement of special education in district decision making; (6) need for impact data to evaluate special education programs; (7) recommendations for special education policy makers. Among study conclusions were the following: variation was seen among districts in the percent of students enrolled in special education and in funding levels;  the referral, evaluation, and placement process represents a significant demand on special education resources detracting from treatment capability; the largest number of students identified as handicapped were in the specific learning disability category; increasing numbers of \"at risk\" students are referred to special education due to a lack of options in regular programs; and the participation rate of handicapped students in vocational programs is far below that of non-handicapped students. Among recommendations was the development of a longitudinal database on special education. (DB)",

The rules suggested for guiding a program scientifically include having: (1) a well delineated program; (2) generalizable implementation procedures; (3) measureable objectives which are to be measured and tracked; (4) means of reporting documented results and enforced recognition of this reporting by all people engaged in the public education of the gifted; and (5) the earliest identification of differentiated intellectual abilities followed up  with uniquely matched curriculum to further develop the intellectual giftedness. The document argues for the objective evaluation of the impact of gifted programs on participating students and for the open sharing of outcomes among programs. Also advocated is the assessment of every child upon school entry to identify individual abilities and the training of teachers to understand the nature of differentiated intellectual abilities so that curriculum experiences can be designed according to individual needs.

Improper understanding of brain functions can cause gross errors in educational placement. Until recently, the popularity of IQ scores has curtailed the understanding of the measurement of demonstrated functions in human intelligence. Tests based on the Structure of Intellect (SOI), first published in 1975, evaluate 26 abilities that are highly predictable of success in school. They are based on the theories of J. P. Guilford who differentiated 96 kinds of intelligence that could be identified factorially. The Guilford model predicted the  separation of sites of brain functions clearly. The Contents dimension of the model, comprised of Figural Intelligence, Symbolic Intelligence, and Semantic-Verbal Intelligence, actually maps the functions of the right, cross-over, and left hemisphere sites. IQ scores are now used as criteria for identifying giftedness in only a few states. Giftedness is recognized as a multi-dimensional human phenomenon and with more concern for the kinds of giftedness shown by an individual as can be measured by the SOI tests. (VW)",

The results, summarized in matrix form, show the relationship between the form of the teacher's communication (e.g., linguistic, conventional non-linguistic, touch, manipulation, pause in contact, depictive action, non-depictive action) and the response of the student (e.g., positive or negative effect, comply, reject, participate,  echo, no effect, can't tell, no response expected). The procedures yield detailed assessment information concerning the students' communicative behavior and responsiveness to the communications of others, which may be used to guide program design and implementation, to evaluate interventions, and to measure student progress. Matrices of the communication of four teacher-student pairs are provided to illustrate use of the procedures. (Author/JDD)",

The 14th amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees safe living conditions and freedom from unnecessary bodily restraints, and may be violated when aversive stimuli are used. The deference accorded by the court system to professionals caring for institutionalized persons should be challenged when professional judgments are not &quot;presumptively valid,&quot; for instance, when institutionalized persons are treated in a manner repugnant to decency norms. The  research literature has shown that aversive conditioning has only short-term results, that positive interventions may produce better long-term effects, and that negative side-effects result from aversive interventions. Parental consent to aversive conditioning may be legally defective as parents are sometimes not given full information concerning treatment options. The Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice vows to examine vigorously the use of aversive techniques under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act and to act swiftly when violations are found.

        "description":"The paper looks at rules for discourse in the classroom and how they may complement or conflict with each other in facilitating the learning of language disordered children in the classroom or therapy session. Six critical skills are identified which children need for a good teaching-learning interaction. They are: attention, turn taking, coherence, repair (self correction), listener modification, and informativeness. Similarities and differences in styles in clinical discourse compared with classroom exchanges are noted. Problems which speech-language impaired children have in bridging these two styles of teaching-learning discourse is analyzed using an ethnographic study of the underlying rules of the interactions. Problems of the clinician studying the classroom include  physical access, psychological access, and overcoming personal biases. Examples of direct (field notes, participant observation) and indirect (interviews, role play) methods of data collection are given. A case study of a 9-year-old communication disordered boy which uses the steps of the ethnographic method is offered. The steps are as follows: identify the child; describe communication problem; interview the child; develop a summary of the problem; observe in the classroom; summarize observations and determine pattern of communication breakdown; and, validate observations. Finally an intervention plan is developed by the clinician, the teacher, and the child. (DB)",

The study also attempted to investigate the relationships among factors believed to influence such abilities and to identify subgroups of disabled children based on profiles derived from the following factors: skills in a referential task and a semi-structured dyadic interaction; self-perceptions of social acceptance, behavior/conduct, and self-worth; and cognitive processes as evidenced by intelligence test subscale scores. Statistical analyses supported the hypothesis that the communicative abilities and related self-perceptions of learning disabled children differ markedly from those of nondisabled children. In addition, the use of  strategies, whether to narrow the comparisons needed in a referential task or to maintain engagement in a conversation, was found to play an influential role in subjects' success on the communication tasks.

        "description":"This paper comments on the increasing numbers of handicapped individuals attending colleges and universities in the United States. The increase is attributed to federal legislation, pressures from self-help and advocacy groups, marketing efforts by universities suffering from declining enrollments, and increased recognition of the institutions' social mission. Learning-disabled students represent the newest and fastest growing handicapped constituency at colleges/universities. The number of handicapped students attending postsecondary institutions in Canada is likely to rise, in part due to two important pieces of legislation: Ontario Bill 82: An Act to Amend the Education Act, 1974; and Section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms as set out in The Constitution Act,  1982. Critical issues which thus need to be resolved include: architectural barriers; attitudinal problems of university personnel, especially toward students whose handicap is &quot;invisible&quot;; the need to fairly and accurately assess the presence of learning disabilities and the student's ability to cope with the academic demands of higher education; and the need to determine what constitutes reasonable accommodations in teaching and evaluation of learning-disabled students.

The equality provisions are open-ended in nature and make the courts a new partner in educational decision-making, causing some educators to regard the Charter generally and the equality provisions in particular with fear. This paper examines literature and court decisions concerning the nature of the Charter, the reasonable limits on Charter rights, and the remedies for violations of these rights. It speculates on the impact of applying the Charter to education law and policy with regard to children who have special education needs. It addresses: (1) the constitutional right to education,  including problems of access, the appropriate content of education, special education rights, and related services; (2) the classification of students and constitutionally fair procedures; (3) the confidentiality of and access to curriculum programs, students' records, and reports; (4) discipline, suspensions, searches, and other treatment of students with special needs; (5) the potential for malpractice suits and teacher accountability; and (6) reasonable limits and costs.

The children ranged in age from birth to 5 years, with 64 percent under age 2, and came from families who were black, inner-city residents with low incomes and poorly educated mothers who were usually heads of households. The children were evaluated three times, at 1-year intervals, using an extensive battery of tests, observations, and interviews to examine their social, intellectual, and emotional development and the quality of their child-rearing environment. Data from the first evaluations indicated that schizophrenic offspring, as a  group, exhibited more social behavior problems than the children with depressed or well mothers. The children of depressed mothers also scored poorly in the areas of role play and using the mother as a resource but otherwise performed comparably to the well group. At the time of the third evaluation, however, the children with depressed mothers actually were worse off than the other two groups on five of six variables for social behavior. (VW)",

An observer recorded client/staff interactions thought to lead to the use of restrictive procedures. Observations were categorized by two independent researchers and reliability measures were obtained. Categorization reached acceptable consistency (p=.001). The results indicated that 71% of observed client/staff interactions consisted of other than restrictive procedures. Most of the restrictive procedures employed limited movement. The overall  rate of the use of restrictive procedures was 1.54 per hour. Depending on the setting, the rate varied from 0.00 to 6.00 per hour. Suggestions were made for improving the methods of similar studies and for improving the behavior modification aspects of the programs. (Author/DB)",

Methodological issues raised by the analysis of school readiness research include experimenter bias, errors in sampling procedures or sampling description, matching errors, sample restriction, misinterpretation of identified statistical relationships, and selection of dependent variables. Misinterpretation of the studies has resulted in magnification of the importance of obtained differences, confusing correlation and causation, concluding that no treatment  (keeping the student out of school another year) is preferable to early intervention, and misapplying the findings to early entrance or acceleration of gifted students. It is concluded that arbitrary cutoff birthdates as a basis for determining school entry should be replaced by assessing the needs and characteristics of all children and providing them with an individually appropriate educational program.

        "description":"The use of dialogue journals as a means of communication between students and teachers originated as a teacher-developed classroom practice rather than a research idea or theory-derived technique. It began in 1964 when a California teacher, Leslee Reed, became fascinated with the comments about learning that she solicited from her students, and responded in writing. In 1979, a researcher began to analyze the communicative aspect of the diaries and teacher responses and found rich and varied language and thought in them. When the teacher was transferred to another school, where many immigrant children were learning English as a second language (ESL), she continued the practice with considerable success. A second researcher undertook a study of those diaries and the interaction in  the classroom, which resulted in a collaborative research project. A third study at Gallaudet College, a four-year college exclusively for deaf students, examined the effect of sustained written interaction for deaf students and their teachers. The use of dialogue journals spread initially by word of mouth among teachers and researcher-educators, and has now become the focus of a professional newsletter, a variety of new research projects, and a number of doctoral dissertations. Two of these dissertations, by Jana Staton (University of California at Los Angeles) and Joy Kreeft (Georgetown University) respectively, were studies of the dialogue journal strategies used in Leslee Reed's two California classrooms. A dissertation by Robby Morroy (Georgetown University) examined more closely  Reed's strategies for responding to and establishing understanding with ESL students. Marsha Markham (University of Maryland) studied the effects of dialogue journals in upper division composition classes, and Deborah Braig (University of Pennsylvania) analysed second graders' audience awareness as manifested in their dialogue journals. Abstracts of all five dissertations are included in this report and a list of publications on dialogue journals is appended. (MSE)",

It provides instructional notes for the teacher and a series of lessons on aspects of grammar, phonology, and morphology. Much of the text is descriptive. Lessons include grammar and phonology notes, exercises, and vocabulary. The materials are organized for two phases of language learning: a pre-speech or comprehension phase occupying one-fourth of the total class time, during which the student acquires a passive knowledge of Tunisian Arabic structure and phonology, and an active phase during which the student covers the same material and is drilled in language production. The vocabulary and exercise types differ for the two phases. (MSE)",

The results suggest that intonational phrase-final lengthening and a smaller durational effect, seeming word-final lengthening, are very different types of effects. The latter does not appear to be a phonologic boundary mark because of highly inconsistent production and perception, nor does final lengthening appear to be related to the edges of any prosodic  constituent below the level of the intonational phrase, either phonologically or phonetically. It is suggested that the smaller effect is a result of articulatory timing relationships within the stress foot. (MSE)",

There is no single correct way to use video in language teaching, but teachers experienced in intensive language practice generally agree that it is  beneficial to show short segments, allow for repeated viewing, encourage active viewing, present activities before viewing, know the material, and know the equipment.

It examined the applicability of theories of common underlying proficiency in the storage of two languages and the development of cognitive academic language proficiency. The teachers had been selected to participate in a master's program in teacher education sponsored by the World Bank. Before beginning the program, the teachers attended three months of training in English for special purposes (ESP) and took sheltered courses in pedagogy for six weeks. After the initial ESP course, the participants underwent a series of tests including English language tests and a test of inferential ability. After the  sheltered courses, the teachers' grades were analyzed. Results suggest that while strong first language inferencing ability is associated with better second language ability, English language proficiency is a more salient variable in determining foreign students' grade performance. Several interpretations of the results, relating to both the theoretical models and the tests used, are suggested. Additional cultural orientation for foreign students is recommended. (MSE)",

The evaluation addressed whether the program is meeting its objectives, whether English second language (ESL) instruction, as contrasted with bilingual instruction, should be continued, whether the program's pull-out design should be continued, and how program costs relate to outcomes. Results show that participants are making gains in oral English, reading, language arts, and mathematics beyond expectations of comparable students in the regular classes, as measured by standardized norm-referenced tests. In narrowing the achievement gap  caused by their limited English proficiency, the students have in many instances surpassed the national growth norms.

Within the personal development section, these subareas include communication, acquisition and use of knowledge, and leadership.

        "description":"A study of non-Hispanic attitudes about bilingual education had two goals: (1) to apply symbolic politics theory to bilingual education and (2) to test the theory's assumption that the symbolic meaning of an attitude object determines which symbolic predisposition it evokes. A national sample of 1,170 non-Hispanics were surveyed via telephone interview about two versions of bilingual education: cultural maintenance and English-as-a-second-language (ESL). There were five main findings: (1) symbolic meaning influenced support for bilingual education, with cultural maintenance drawing the least support; (2) personal experience and self-interest (potential impact on one's children, personal experience with bilingualism, and living in substantially Hispanic areas) had little effect on  support; (3) symbolic predispositions had substantial effects on support, particularly symbolic racism, as did attitudes about foreign language instruction and government spending in general; (4) symbolic meaning and symbolic predispositions interacted, with the cultural maintenance version of bilingual education most likely to evoke symbolic racism; and (5) living in an area with numerous Hispanics increased the tendency to evaluate the cultural maintenance plan in terms of symbolic racism. Since the last had little to do with parental variable, it is interpreted as more a case of symbolic group threat than of realistic personal threat or self-interest. (MSE)",

        "description":"Issues concerning an aging faculty are discussed, including faculty vitality and quality in an era of institutional constraints and limited career opportunities, restricted mobility of faculty between institutions, and limited recruitment of young faculty. Perspectives of the faculty and their institutions about these issues are outlined, and change strategies are proposed. The historical context since the 1950s that contributed to these conditions is traced. Because a large proportion of U.S. faculty members is young, replacement needs for faculty will be low. The majority of faculty in four-year institutions are tenured so that there is a long-term cost commitment and reduced staffing flexibility. Economic conditions have placed college faculties in an increasingly distressed  economic status. The preparation and interest of college faculty is highly specialized by subdiscipline and field of inquiry. Issues posed by these conditions for the professoriate and for their institutions are detailed, and responses to the issues are proposed. Most of the strategies are designed to: (1) increase the rate of turnover in positions held by tenured faculty with emphasis on the more senior persons, and (2) control the tenure process. (SW)",

The faculty and college are liable by tort law for students in three ways: intentional acts or interference, strict liability, and negligence. Intentional acts include improperly installed or dangerous equipment, while strict liability cases usually occur where fault is not specifically identifiable, such as when students hurt themselves on ice when there was no adequate protection barriers and warnings. Negligence may occur when there are student injuries without proper supervision of students by faculty members. Another type of negligence action is educational malpractice (i.e., teachers and administrators did not carry out their responsibilities to students and students did not learn what they should have).  Specific concerns include proper training of graduate assistants for their responsibilities, management by faculty of health emergencies while exerting caution in administering first aid, and keeping accident reports. The use of religious materials in public classrooms is another concern, along with prayer and bible reading, free speech and expression, and the copyright law. Guidelines to avert adverse legal actions are provided. (SW)",

The effectiveness and fairness of the adjustment changes according to who is viewing it. It is a complex process with great potential for conflict from the vantage point of students, parents, teachers, school administrators, local school authorities, the public, government, organized educational groups, and the courts. What one group sees as fair allocations may be viewed as totally unfair by another group. The school system is a product of the government and does not stand separate. The government is legally accountable for the products in education. Government intervention is imminent during shifts in educational demands.  It would be a matter of concern if there was a lack of a sensitive assessment of the changing demands of the school system by the government. In America, state governments have moved toward more centralized control of local school districts. The government action in the United States, Canada, and Australia is called the inbetween response strategy (devolution whereby there is increase in control in conjunction with a decentralization of responsibility). Educational, economical, and socio-political variables affect this strategy. The government must listen to and respond to any interested groups. There must be an appropriate balance of educational and socio-political concerns. (SM)",

Data were collected in three iterations through mail questionnaires, with an overall response rate of 56.9%.

Results included the following: (1) items assigned to Huebner's technical valuing perspective, involving  nursing content and learning activities, were most common; (2) the second most commonly occurring curriculum perspective was social relevance/reconstruction; (3) although few questionnaire items represented a cognitive processes or self-actualization perspective, approximately one-third of them were rated as essential, indicating their perceived importance in the nursing curriculum; and (4) a lack of emphasis on a liberal or general education was shown.

Advice and suggestions about appropriate training are offered, and conclusions are drawn about the kind of system that is most beneficial to the education service and to people employed in higher and further education institutions. Five chapters focus on: developments in performance appraisal policy (definitions, relevance to further and higher education, interest in performance appraisal, possible obstacles to the practice of performance appraisal, advantages of staff appraisal, and aims of government policy); introduction of appraisal (why staff appraisal is fashionable, why interest is not practice); employment law and other legal parameters (appraisal and the law, Sex Discrimination Act 1975  and Race Relations Act 1976, Data Protection Act 1984, employment protection legislation, redundancy selection, instruments and articles of government, the Burnham provisions); scheme design (objectives and standards, other needs, methods of appraising performance, techniques, starting points, involvement of senior management, and a system for further and higher education establishments); and appraisal training (preliminary steps, explaining performance appraisal, preparation for appraisal, classroom observation, appraisal interview, setting objectives, counseling, feedback, and the program). In the concluding chapter recommendations are given for performance and review development, response to union opposition, and pilot schemes. Appended are reprints of relevant legislation, a staff  review scheme, two appraisal forms, an observer handout, an interviewing checklist, and a guide sheet for course members. 40 references. (SM)",

        "description":"Assessment of student learning and development has become a national issue. The status of local campus initiatives was considered in a national survey designed to determine (1) the extent to which assessment programs have been developed or are being developed, (2) the objectives and source of initiation, and (3) assessment techniques. Emphasis was on the role student affairs played in local campus assessment initiatives. All National Association of Student Personnel Administrator (NASPA) member institutions in the United States and Canada were surveyed with a pen and pencil instrument. Responses were solicited with the Total Design Survey Method. The survey form had four areas: general institutional information, student outcome program/plan, information sharing, and optional  section. Institutions were identified as two- or four-year colleges, universities, or graduate schools, although there were not enough respondents in the fourth category to permit conclusions to be drawn. Findings indicate that institutions are responding to the pressure for reform by implementing outcomes assessment programs, and that this trend does not vary according to the type or size of the institution. Trends toward developing programs seem the strongest in those NASPA regions whose members are from states with statewide initiatives. Although there is a trend toward outcomes assessment, almost two-thirds of the respondents indicated no activity. Still, indications are that the program activity level will dramatically rise over the next several years. Maps, tables, the survey form,  and resource listings are included. 4 references. (SM)",

While the majority of respondents perceived discrimination in the United States and in Prince George's County, Maryland, a minority believed that there was discrimination on the Bowie campus. Respondents viewed slightly over one-third of the faculty as competent. The majority agreed that race, religion, or handicap do not make one characteristically smarter or ignorant. The majority of respondents also agreed that race, religion, or handicap do not make one characteristically more athletic; however, 27.6% said the handicapped are less athletic. The majority also indicated that they do not avoid people based on gender,  handicap, religion, race, or age. Some prefer multi-racial and multi-religious environments and some even prefer to interact with the handicapped. The survey questions and responses for each question are appended. (SW)",

Of the sample of 1,565 students, 51.2% responded. Responses of Davis students were compared with norms derived from a sample of colleges with populations larger than 10,000 students that were surveyed between during 1984-1986. Major findings include: students feel positive about the information they receive prior to enrolling; students appreciate and use the various sources of academic advising found on campus; freshmen report less use than their national counterparts of academic advising services (59.5% versus 67.4%); not all students were able to easily meet with their faculty advisors and some students received misleading or  contradictory information; students who used career planning services or job placement services reported moderately high levels of satisfaction; and undergraduates deferred use of career planning and job placement services until late in their academic careers. It is suggested that many students do not get into the advising system early enough in their academic careers to take full advantage of the services offered.

Students were encouraged to submit questions in writing if they felt uncomfortable asking them in class. The students wrote their questions on a separate page in a small booklet that was used to take attendance. The queries could be anonymous if the student desired. Questions were asked for each class; the mean number of questions was 3.95 per class. Thirty-one students submitted questions or comments concerning course content, careers, and procedural matters for the class. A general breakdown of the questions by category is provided. Students were highly satisfied with this method for taking attendance and  dealing with their questions. Benefits from using this system to generate questions include: the finding that students are very interested in career prospects and salary; letting students know that the teacher is interested in answering their questions; being able to review or adjust lectures based on student questions; and providing a means for shy students to ask questions.

Attention is directed to: the retention rate, changes in the retention rate over time, and differences in the retention rate among subpopulations of students. Using multivariate regression analysis, the relationship between retention and the following factors were assessed: age, sex, race/ethnicity,  college, transfer or first-time student, grade level, full-time or part-time course load, and cumulative grade point average. Also studied were: factors that affect freshman-year retention, retention patterns of stop-outs, within-semester withdrawals, nondegree students who matriculate, and the measurement of retention for the College of Public and Community Service, which uses a competency-based system.

To examine the ways in which research proceeds from sociopolitical assumptions and, in turn, shapes perceptions of the field and guides actions, the following are discussed: (1) art education research trends; (2) the sociopolitical nature of research; (3) research deficiencies in art education; and (4) prescriptions for research within a critical perspective. The objective is to focus attention on the reality-constructing nature of art education research, on the need for research agendas supportive of diverse approaches and alternative interpretations, and on the importance of incorporating in research, self-critical components that acknowledge  biases and limitations. Art education researchers have often conducted experimental studies and relied on scientific methods of general education and psychology. The psychological aspects of children's artistic development has been a research focus. Arts education research currently seems to emphasize psychometric studies, histories, and research summaries.

Homework was defined as taking books and assignments home after school for the purpose of home study. Foyle and Bailey elaborated four types of homework categorized by purpose: preparation, practice, extension, and creative. Of the 84 experiments that dealt with homework, 34 found a significant difference in favor of homework over other methods of learning; 6 found a significant difference in favor of other method of learning than homework, and 49 experiments found that homework and other methods of learning produced similar results in student achievement. Since 1957, 59 of 65 cited homework experiments were  conducted in mathematics, mathematics-related subjects, and shorthand. Examining the results of the experiments by level indicate: at the elementary and secondary levels, homework produces student achievement, while at the college level no difference is found between homework and other methods. Data are provided on the link between homework and achievement by level for the periods of 1904-1957 and 1958-1984. Recommendations for each school level are also presented. 35 references. (SW)",

A majority of women and men held the doctorate degree; however, the majority of the women received their highest degree in education, while men were more spread out with degrees in education, social sciences, and other fields. The distribution of current administrative positions indicated that women were more likely than men to hold lower level positions, and were more likely to be at community colleges. Two areas were  important in the career path to higher education administration: one's education, and whether an individual acquires any faculty experience. Barriers perceived and experienced by women include: lack of strong sponsorship for administrative positions, sex discrimination, the importance placed on family responsibilities in the early career, and the type of education received.

        "description":"This paper analyzes the ways in which members of different ethnic groups decode the worldwide hit television program Dallas, and suggests answers to the question of how such a quintessentially American cultural product crosses cultural and linguistics frontiers so easily. The program was studied with the intent of observing the mechanisms through which people understand, interpret, and evaluate a program; to compare such understandings across cultures; and to determine how American programs manage to engage and enter the lives of widely different kinds of viewers. Groups of six persons--three couples, all friends, meeting in the home of one of them--were drawn from four ethnic communities in Israel and one non-ethnic group of Americans in Los Angeles to discuss an episode of  Dallas immediately after seeing it on the air. Based both on the literature and on the reactions of these viewers, discussion of ways in which Dallas invites viewer involvement considers parallels between the soap opera and the story of Genesis as well as the operation of seriality at both the semantic and the metalinguistic levels. It is concluded that Dallas offers viewers at different levels and in different cultures something they can understand from within themselves--not just an elementary understanding of the story as a drama of human relationships, but different types of understanding that are related to different types of involvement; and that the multiple levels of understanding and involvement of such programs offer a wide variety of different projects and games to different  types of viewers.

        "description":"This paper discusses the cognitive effect of a highly successful 1985 British television program, &quot;Edge of Darkness,&quot; which was viewed by millions and received critical plaudits and the accolade of the industry itself. The program is shown to represent a significant television event for formal and cognitive reasons that can usefully be related to the politics of television fiction and postmodern culture. Before describing the program in detail, the relevance of situating it within this broader framework is outlined, i.e., how cognition works in relation to the story's discursive process. The specific qualities of Edge of Darkness are clarified by considering the text itself and why and how it was made. The program is identified as postmodernist stylistically because it: (1) moved  to and fro between the logic of realism/naturalism and a kind of modernist reflexivity; (2) explored complex psychic and political depths; (3) dealt with the concept of mapping; and (4) wove a number of themes (the &quot;back story&quot;) into an engaging fiction. The knowledge and understanding the program generated is analyzed by situating the text in its contexts of consumption and production. It is concluded that the goal of the program--consciousness raising--was achieved, although any sense the fiction makes to television viewers is conversely viewed as tenuous.

Subjects were between 15 and 25 years old and representative of the first generation of Nigerian television children. A 37-item questionnaire was administered to 300 randomly selected youths living in three major urban centers. Analyses of the 227 usable responses received indicated that: (1) most youths had ready access to radio, television, and newspapers; (2)  television was chosen as the prime medium, with newspaper second and radio third; (3) television viewing was a daily routine; (4) many preferred one station to others available; (5) television provided gratification (entertainment); (6) news was preferred to other types of programs; (7) news, politics, and sports were considered entertainment; and (8) commercials were liked. It is concluded that the results suggest the need for definite policies in the operations of Nigerian television. (36 references) (CGD)",

A synthesis of eight statewide assessments and an analysis of the 1984 National Assessment of Educational Progress were designed to examine the displacement hypothesis, i.e., activities are reorganized by children as a result of various media options. First examined was the relationship between television viewing and reading achievement for the statewide assessments; then, a more in-depth analysis of displacement was done by examining leisure reading and free time activities outside of the school context. Findings indicated that: (1) television viewing accounted for little  variance in reading achievement; (2) television viewing did not displace the time spent in leisure reading; and (3) the amount of television viewed was not related to the displacement theories of functional similarity, physical and psychological proximity, and marginal fringe activities. Other studies plus this large scale secondary analysis indicate there are no deleterious effects of television on learning achievement, and it is suggested that future research should focus on other issues.

        "description":"The political context surrounding Canadian broadcasting dramatically changed following the election of a conservative government in 1984, and Canada's current broadcasting debate is marked by national and special interest concerns. While an important social aspect of the system is its profoundly undemocratic nature, the constituent elements of a democratic public medium exist. In dealing with the democratization of communications, it is first necessary to clarify the place of communications in democratic public life, then recognize the public character of the media. The Canadian broadcasting experience has contributed its share to obscuring the emancipatory potential of broadcasting, but it also contains the seeds of its own antithesis, and the struggles around it provide many  instructive elements of an alternative approach to broadcasting based on a reconstituted public dimension. This public dimension can be fully realized only if a number of critical areas are transformed. From a critical analysis of the Canadian experience and the alternative practices and proposals that have marked it, there emerge some elements of a more coherent, responsive, direct system of public broadcasting.

        "description":"This paper addresses questions about the processes involved when viewers &quot;make sense&quot; out of the diverse visual and aural signs of a television program and then render that sense in a spoken account. A pilot study was conducted to explore the manner in which modes of viewing, and talk about viewing, include or exclude recognition of non-fiction television as motivated discourse despite its conventions of naturalistic representation. Sixteen Liverpool respondents representing a mix of gender, class, and occupation, were individually interviewed in one-to-one sessions of about an hour's duration immediately after he/she had watched a British Broadcasting Company (BBC) 2 documentary about life on the dole in their city. Responses were categorized as transparent, mediated, displaced,  or manipulative. The contributions of one particular participant/speaker are used to illustrate the findings of this preliminary research because of the important classic structural, stylistic, and thematic features that appeared in his responses. Reactions of other participants to this individual are then described in terms of the connections they make between their attitudes toward him, their understanding of the program, and his function in their reactions to the program. It is concluded that, in exploring the social character of media reception, a much more extensive literature of documentation and attempted analysis will be required. (17 references) (CGD)",

Topics discussed include: (1) three intersecting planes of temporality that are intrinsic to every moment of social reproduction and a fourth plane which occurs in broadcasting; (2) the process of modernization, after 1834, that demanded new time-keeping habits and work disciplines from whole populations, and with it the necessity for reconstruction of images and emblems of nationhood; (3) the development of radio  broadcasting in the 1920s and 1930s and the role the broadcast &quot;year&quot; played in stitching together the private and public spheres in a whole new range of contexts; (4) the narrative features of broadcast serials and the subtle ways in which broadcasting runs parallel and intersects with the life and times of our actual world; (5) program building in these decades, and the historical development of radio in the organization of the rhythm of work and leisure; (6) The Peoples' Activities and Use of Time, a survey of people's time paths through the day, including the data analysis and conclusions; and (7) phased patterns of (in)attention, of listening and viewing, during the day, and how broadcasting is inextricably implicated in these patterns.

        "description":"The Dynasty Project conducted an empirical analysis of the cross-cultural reception of the program for which it was named. Data were collected via two series of videotaped interviews which were carried out following a viewing of Dynasty episode 105 by a group of subjects together with the researchers. The subjects were 25 American viewers in Los Angeles and 16 Danish Dynasty regulars in the Copenhagen area. Specific findings are described in a qualitative fashion and analyzed from the following perspectives: (1) the interdisciplinary nature of the Dynasty Project; (2) the project's lack of sympathy for and cultural elitist attitudes toward commercial television fiction and toward popular culture in general; (3) television's function as the main forum for collective cultural  processes; (4) liminal processes; (5) the &quot;hegemonic effect&quot; of television; (6) the theory of heteroglossia; (7) the reasons for audience addiction to Dynasty; (8) the extent of viewer involvement with the program; (9) the notion of distance; and (10) Dynasty as the interminable hermeneutic puzzle.

        "description":"Socialization is generally considered the process of making individuals &quot;fit&quot; for living in society. To understand the specific social role of the media, their particular place among agencies of socialization, and the real possibilities of a democratization of mass communication, the question should be inverted to ask, &quot;Who makes the media 'fit' for what society and how?&quot; In essence, the questions are how best to fulfill the collectively transmitted social interest in the field of mass communication through social management bodies, or how to make these bodies independent and responsible; and also how to use the positive experience of the democratization of mass communication in the development of western democracies, and how to develop new methods of actively integrating the  population into the communication processes themselves, as well as in their management and control. The opportunities that Yugoslav society provides for the establishment of social property and the development of self-management in the field of mass communication have remained to a large extent unused. Too much social energy has been used in creating the most perfect, comprehensive laws; too little energy has been spent in developing concrete instruments and mechanisms of socialization of the communication activity.

        "description":"A number of important consequences have resulted from the generally increased sensitivity of trade unions to questions of communication and representation, particularly the trade union's uses of videos. Primarily developed by union leadership as a response to general political problems they have faced in the last decade, trade union videos constitute a large and expanding area of non-broadcast video work. These trade union officials have a precise sense of their members' needs and are prepared to experiment with different formal solutions to problems of communication. However, they also have a strong interest in controlling the content of material produced at all times. The major functions of these materials are general campaigning and training and education of members, and the  distribution of materials for other uses poses severe problems. Conflicts of interest within and between union leadership and video makers have led some trade unionists to look for alternative forms of communication. Many of the avenues tried are fraught with difficulties, and forms of communication which go beyond the limits set by officials may not resolve all of the problems. Video workers who wish to be independent of the restrictions placed on them by the bureaucracy need financial help as well as organizational and political space. The appended list of sources includes 25 printed works, 22 interviews, and 20 tapes. (CGD)",

        "description":"This paper argues that, although community cable television is one of the most dynamic (although experimental) elements of the Hungarian media structure, it is well on its way toward institutionalization. It is suggested that whether community cable television is able to retain the spontaneity, innovativeness, and elasticity of its early days may have a bearing on the future of Hungarian media systems in general. It is noted that, since the official go-ahead in 1984, 17 systems have come into operation, producing about 40 hours of programs a month at a fraction of the cost and capital investment of Magyar Televizio (MTV), and often operated by unskilled and unpaid personnel. The study presented in this paper deals with the expectations and real achievements of the emerging  community studios. A closer, cultural look is taken at two cable stations where field observations were carried out, and where two opinion surveys were made among cable viewers. It was found that the responses to the survey were strikingly different for the two communities. General differences in the two communities, the founding of their respective systems, their programming, and the professional ideologies of the Hungarian cablecasters are described. In addition, the future of cable television is discussed in terms of broader perspectives where realities of Hungarian politics, economics, and new technology must be faced. (7 sources) (CGD)",

        "description":"Collection of detailed data on normative overall patterns of television viewer behavior has been an ongoing effort of the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (BARB) in the United Kingdom. While their measurement system--self-completion viewing diaries in conjunction with electronic meters recording television set use--may register that an audience is &quot;viewing&quot; a particular program, it does not consider the attentional factors that operate during television viewing, i.e., how behavior varies under different conditions of viewing and for different genre and production styles. The Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) has begun a program of research that is designed to chart the &quot;natural history&quot; of television use in the United Kingdom. The first stage resulted in the  validation of BARB's techniques of data collection. A pilot study of television viewing in the second stage was then conducted using nine selected households. This stage of the study involved the installation of special video/recording equipment to record all activity during television viewing (Household Observation and Monitoring Equipment or HOME) in order to assess the new monitoring equipment and generate testable hypotheses about viewing behavior in realistic settings. A number of hypotheses were generated, and the researchers feel that the ability of this technique to show television as it is can have a formative effect on the thinking and designs of those researchers who sustain and use existing large scale assessment methods, since presence alone is not an adequate measure.

        "description":"The race between Mary Decker and Zola Budd, a head to head confrontation in the 1985 Olympic Games, is examined within the broader context of the transformation taking place in sports as a result of the combined efforts of television and the economic forces of sponsorship. Athletics is going through this process of transformation both economically and culturally, with a complex connection between the two levels. Athletics has always had a star system, undercover payments, and promoters anxious to organize head-to-head clashes to attract crowds. Now the television audience has to be attracted with a form of entertainment different from live spectator entertainment. The matchmaking role, which has become crucial between the economic and cultural levels, is linked most closely to  the emergence of stars and the establishment around them of rivalries, dramas, and narratives. More promoters and more sponsors will continue to pressure the small number of global stars available as television continues the attempt to reproduce audience-attracting uncertainty, while ensuring a high and consistent quality of entertainment. The athletic authorities will continue the struggle to manage the free market forces they have unleashed, and more head-to-head confrontations will have to happen. A glossary is appended.

The overall response rate was 75.4% when the data were analyzed in March 1987. Analyses of the data indicated that 77% of the undergraduate students had access to some kind to video equipment for study purposes, with approximately 60% reporting access in their homes. In addition, 26% of the students without home access to video indicated a willingness to buy or rent a videocassette machine if the Open University provided video material for course work. The data also provided some potentially important variations in patterns  of access based on demographics and region. The text is supplemented by 12 figures and data for the study are displayed in four appended tables. (4 references) (EW)",

Such materials are shown to influence the learning process by providing concrete examples or models of abstract principles, and by encouraging the skills of analysis and the application of knowledge. It is recommended that television material be designed in such a way that it encourages interactivity by exploiting the control characteristics of cassettes, i.e., use of segments, clear stopping  points, use of activities, indexing, close integration with other media, and concentration on audiovisual aspects. The relationship between television, learning, and student assessment, and the use of television for relaying classroom lectures are also considered. Ways to overcome the expense of producing educational television programs are suggested, such as using existing materials or making your own programs. Several excerpts from educational television programs accompanied the paper when it was presented. (8 references) (MES)",

Participants in the first study were 93 specialists in aging in four groups--library/information specialists who had achieved a reputation of working with the aging, educators/researchers in gerontology, policy-level administrators who were part of the governmental hierarchy in aging at the state and regional level, and service providers at the level of the area agency on aging. Answers to an open-ended question on how the information needs of the aging should be met were analyzed and compiled into a 40-item questionnaire. Participants were then asked to respond to each item on a scale ranging from &quot;of no importance&quot; to &quot;of great importance.&quot; In the second study, 400 adults aged 65 and older were  interviewed by telephone on the items in the questionnaire. Items identified by both specialists and the aging as important included: (1) better training for personnel who work with the aging; (2) more emphasis on listening to the elderly about their needs; (3) television, radio, and newspaper public service announcements; (4) senior centers as a means of information dispersal; (5) cooperative outreach programs by agencies that assist the aging; and (6) attention to the needs of the sight- and hearing-impaired.

Part 1 provides background on the changing role of community colleges and the introduction of contract training as a means of addressing the growing need of organizations to train and retrain staff. Part 2 offers a national perspective on the boom in training and development, indicating that only 57% of all employee training programs are provided in-house and listing the types of educational and non-school organizations offering the other 43% of employee training. This section also considers statewide efforts to address economic development needs. Part 3 presents a national profile of contract training in community colleges, using survey data to examine the  organizational structures needed to deliver contract training, trends related to program sites and the college-credit status of courses, types of contract clients, problems, benefits, and perceptions of the future of contract training. Part 4 discusses issues in the management of contract training programs, including program organization, planning, finance, and evaluation. Finally, part 5 identifies policy issues related to the establishment of separate business institutes, the goals and limits of a center for contract training, separate advisory structures for representatives from business and the college, staffing needs, and financial policies.

        "description":"Currently, 30 California community colleges have adopted flexible calendars, which permit up to 15 of the 175 days of legally required faculty service to be used for authorized non-instructional activities. A broad range of flex activities are authorized under Title V of the State Education Code, including staff development or in-service training, curriculum or instructional material development, student personnel services, student advising, orientation, department meetings, institutional research, and matriculation services. Although scheduling options exist with flexible calendars, most colleges tend to schedule the flex days as an intersession in January. The implementation and management of flex calendars involves: (1) determining the ratio of mandatory and optional  activities; (2) overcoming possible resistance from faculty, the district governing board, and the public; (3) developing a special set of policies and procedures to encourage faculty participation; (4) involving departments and divisions in planning and implementation; and (5) using evaluations to modify the next year's flex plan. While the flexible calendar provides time for curriculum improvement and staff development, the commitment to making change meaningful must come from the staff. (MDB)",

        "description":"The Urban Community Colleges Transfer Opportunities Program (UCCTOP) was initiated in 1983 to stimulate the transfer of minority students from community colleges to universities. Collecting data on the effects of the UCCTOP activities proved to be one of the most difficult aspects of the project as community colleges typically do not have reliable data on student transfer. Most community colleges rely on the universities to which students transfer for data, with varying results. Even in states in which a central agency collects transfer data, there can be problems if individual campuses define transfers differently or if the existing data are out of date or difficult to interpret. UCCTOP colleges' efforts to gather information on associate degrees awarded and student transfers  reveal more about data inconsistencies and the force of external influences than about UCCTOP's effects. According to the data submitted, the number of degrees awarded increased between 1981-82 and 1985-86 at every college except Miami-Dade Community College (Florida), which showed a 51% decline. The number of transfer students showed a similarly steep decline at Miami-Dade, a strong increase at the Community College of Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), and level or inconsistent patterns at the other UCCTOP colleges. Findings, though difficult to compare or interpret because of numerous errors, missing data, and variant sources of data and definitions, suggest that (1) external forces strongly affect associate degree completion and transfer rates; (2) the effects of programs such as UCCTOP  must be assessed after several years have elapsed; and (3) the comparison of transfer rates between colleges is precarious.

        "description":"After much discussion and several false starts, Nassau Community College (New York) has developed a two-course core curriculum designed to cover significant material from the sciences, social sciences, and humanities in practical proportions. The first course in the sequence, &quot;Exploring Nature and Society,&quot; deals with Perceptions of the Physical World, Views of Human Nature, Authority and the Individual, and the Search for Meaning in the Universe. The second course, &quot;Ideas and Expression in the Arts,&quot; looks at Expressions of the Physical World: Realism to Abstraction, Expressing the Human Condition: Symbolism, Authority and the Individual: The Drama of Protest, and the Beautiful and the Sublime. To help students deal with the abstract concepts presented in the course, each major  unit begins with a discussion of a central, usually contemporary, figure and of a question that the individual might ask. For example, Martin Luther King is the central figure for the unit on Authority and the Individual, and his &quot;Letter from Birmingham Jail&quot; serves as the basis for a discussion of the question, &quot;how should an individual behave when in conflict with authority?&quot; To prepare instructors to teach the courses, a one-semester faculty seminar has been developed to enable teachers to teach each other, refine course content, become familiar with the materials, and determine means of presenting information. The courses will not be team taught, the parameters of the program will remain flexible in order to maintain freshness, and the cross-disciplinary thematic structure of the  course will emphasize connections and the integration of material. Students will be advised to take the courses as early as possible after completing all remedial and developmental work. (MDB)",

        "description":"Before undertaking a computer-assisted composition class, several factors should be considered. First, there will be demands on the instructor to replan the entire course to include the effective use of computers; to teach fundamental word-processing skills in addition to writing skills; to develop enough knowledge of hardware and software to solve minor problems encountered by students; to compensate for new problems in student writing caused by the use of unfamiliar word-processing programs and machines; and to monitor, assist, and schedule out-of-class lab time in addition to class time. The use of computers also places extra demands on students by disrupting their accustomed methods of composing, placing increased demands on short-term memory, and requiring additional  out-of-class lab time. By careful advance planning, familiarizing themselves with the lab and the equipment, adjusting teaching and learning styles to the environment, carefully choosing a word-processing program, and enlisting the help of a lab assistant or a colleague, instructors can alleviate many of these potential problems. While computers can be used for programmed grammar instruction, they are more useful for editing and correcting papers and in the writing stages of invention, development, and organization. Computer-assisted instruction may not be successful with every student, but it does provide alternative learning strategies for some students who are resistant to conventional writing instruction.

Children's need for enrichment activities, as identified in developmental screening, was the basis for the selection of participants. Students referred to but not accepted into the program served as a comparison group. Evaluation was based on student data, classroom observations, and feedback from parents of students in the program and participating teachers. Program developers were particularly interested in validating the identification process, monitoring the consistency of program implementation, and obtaining preliminary evidence of  program effects. Results are discussed in terms of budget and expenditures, identification procedures, parent-teacher and teacher-teacher communication, and program outcomes. Although the results suggested that the program had an impact on the social and emotional development of students, the impact on academic preparation was less clear. Appended are materials used for developmental assessment, sequenced performance objectives, curriculum materials, instructional objectives, and data-gathering forms and checklists. (RH)",

To advocate for appropriate practices for the teaching of young children, teachers can and should: (1) build respect for the unique needs of young children; (2) promote the best interests of all young children; (3) gain support from other child development and early childhood professionals; (4) enlist parents in promoting appropriate programs; and (5) gain a voice in decisions about  curriculum and instruction.

Two samples were selected, one consisting of 104 and the other of 63 prekindergarten children. Mean age of the samples was 52 months. Item analysis was used to determine letters and numbers on the Printing Performance School Readiness Test (Simner, 1985) most predictive of later school failure. A total of 18 letters and numbers were selected and presented to subjects individually. Follow-up data assessing subjects' academic achievements were obtained at the end of first grade from marks in reading and arithmetic on report cards and scores on two standardized achievement tests: the  word identification subtest from the Woodcock Reading Mastery Test (1974), and the addition, subtraction, numerical reasoning, word problem, and time subtests from the Keymath Diagnostic Arithmetic Test (Connolly, Nachtman, and Pritchett, 1971). Findings indicate that form errors in children's printing at the start of prekindergarten can be scored reliably, remain stable over time, and are closely linked to children's performance in first grade.

In addition, fathers in their study showed more extreme sex stereotyping than mothers. Participants in the present study were 20 pairs of Caucasian, middle-class parents of first-born, healthy, vaginally-delivered newborns. Parents were interviewed 2 and 9 days after their infant's birth. Comparison of the Rubin et al. data and the day 2 data of this study revealed that fathers in this sample rated boys and girls much more similarly than the fathers in the previous study had. No significant differences were found in the extent to which mothers in the two studies rated boys and girls  differently. Surprisingly, in the present study, mothers actually showed greater stereotyping than fathers on day 2, although this difference had declined and was no longer significant by day 9. Further analyses of the data were conducted to evaluate effects of infant sex, parent sex, and time of assessment on parents' ratings of their infants on specific adjective scales and on parents' reports of behaviors engaged in with infants. Despite the lack of objective differences between the girls and boys in the sample, some minor sex stereotyping differences were found; but in general, findings indicate that sex of newborn was not a compelling determinant of parental perceptions.

        "description":"The major purpose of this study was to describe community college child care centers in terms of selected operational and physical features. It was expected that findings would provide answers to the following questions: What child care provisions exist on selected community college campuses? How do those child care centers serve their respective colleges? How are the child care centers staffed? How are the child care centers funded? and What are the plans for future advancement of the centers? The population selected was a consortium of 19 community college districts that included 53 public institutions comprising the League for Innovation in the Community College. Of the 19 districts, 18 were represented in the sample. Colleges with no child care centers were excluded from the  study. Although included colleges were located in 13 states and 1 Canadian province, 48 percent of the sampled centers were in California. A survey instrument was developed to obtain data. Sections of the report provide: (1) an introduction; (2) a review of the literature; (3) a description of methods; (4) a report of findings on service design, staffing, fees and funding, facilities, and plans for future advancement; (5) an overview; (6) a discussion of findings; and (7) recommendations for future research.

        "description":"Examined were the effects on children's learning and motivation of the embedding of instructional materials in various fantasy contexts. Students in the third grade worked with graphics commands from the LOGO programming language under one of three conditions. In a control condition, students were given a series of abstract problems characteristic of traditional instructional methods. In two fantasy conditions, identical problems were presented within a fantasy problem-solving context. In one group, children were given their choice of three alternative fantasy contexts; in the other, children were assigned fantasies yoked to the choices of the other group. Students were tested on their knowledge of LOGO and several underlying geometric concepts before, immediately after, and 2  weeks after the experimental sessions. Both fantasy groups showed significantly greater knowledge of LOGO, but not of underlying concepts, than their no-fantasy counterparts. There were no differences between the two fantasy groups. Unexpectedly, girls outperformed boys on both tests. Implications regarding the use of motivational embellishments to enhance interest and promote learning are discussed. (Author/RH)",

It is noted that the well-being of children in Illinois has deteriorated dramatically in the past 10 years, and that significant improvements in policies and programs for children are desperately needed. The paper is organized in two parts. Part 1 contains sections on early childhood, health, and education, with each section listing various problems and then suggesting actions to alleviate them. Problems addressed include: young children at risk of failure; insufficient and inadequate day care for children of working parents; infant mortality and avoidable childhood diseases; school failure; and inadequate financing of  Illinois public schools. Part II contains sections on poverty and economic opportunity, family stability, and juvenile justice. Topics discussed include: (1) work disincentives in the welfare program; (2) inadequacy of the Aid for Dependent Children grant level; (3) the inequitable state tax burden on poor working families with children; (5) the excessive number of children becoming state wards before efforts are made to preserve their families; and (6) lack of support for alternatives to detention for delinquent youth.

Programs differed mainly in length of school day and number of extra activities, and not in amount of academic learning time. Student school achievement test scores were collected at an early and a later point in the year; ratings of student self-esteem were also made at the time of pre- and post-achievement testing. Teachers in both programs were surveyed to determine how well they were getting to know their students and how well they felt they were meeting students' needs. They were asked to report on students' behavior and responsiveness during the last hour of the school day.  Parents were asked to provide similar information and to describe changes they had seen in their children's behavior during the school year. Multiple regression was used to determine which of the variables studied predicted success in kindergarten, defined as academic readiness and possessing a good self-image. Findings indicated only very small differences between half-day and full-day kindergarten. Related materials, including tables, teachers' lists of advantages and disadvantages of full-day and half-day programs, and parents' comments are included with appended survey forms. (RH)",

Also collected were data on the demographic characteristics of the families and their children. Specifically, data were obtained by means of a questionnaire focusing on parental agreement or disagreement, parental feelings, perceptions of the experience for the child, teacher's role, child's reaction to the experience, effects on parenting, effects on daily family life, and the person responsible for the retention decision. The questionnaire was sent to 40 families from a school district in Florida who differed widely in socioeconomic status; 10 families responded. Findings  indicated that parents: (1) felt that the teachers had their child's best interest in mind; (2) believed the decision to retain their child in kindergarten would have positive effects for the child, especially with regard to socialization; and (3) appeared to agree with the decision, but felt angry, embarrassed, and overwhelmed. It is concluded that it is beyond the scope of the classroom teacher to provide the emotional support needed by the families. Recommendations for intervention are offered, as are ethical and legal implications of retaining ethnically diverse children. (RH)",

Findings indicated that parents were more traditional than nonparents, partly because parents were more traditional before having a child. It was also found that the transition to parenthood exerted effects that varied according to the color and marital status of the respondent. For white married respondents, becoming a parent had a clear and traditionalizing influence, but for unwed black women, the opposite effect was observed; for these women, parenthood led to more egalitarian attitudes. This pattern was interpreted to reflect costs and benefits of traditional sex roles for different groups in  different situations. Appended are 34 references. (Author/SKC)",

Dilemmas are defined as predicaments having two main features: a choice between two or more alternative courses of action, each of which is problematic; and the sacrifice of the advantages of one alternative as a consequence of choosing another. The six dilemmas discussed include: (1) coverage versus mastery of course content; (2) thematic versus eclectic course focus; (3) current versus future needs of students; (4) affective versus evaluative emphasis in the relationship of teachers and students; (5) current versus innovative educational practices; and (6) specific versus global assessment  criteria. If the formulation of the dilemmas is correct, then teacher educators are faced with a series of choices of errors; no error-free alternatives exist. The next step in the consideration of the long-term development of the profession of teaching young children seems to be the identification of &quot;least worst&quot; errors. (RH)",

In the first section of the five-part survey, parents indicated the degree to which they agreed or disagreed with statements about such topics as governmental support of children and families. Compared to Minnesotans, more parents in the Swedish sample felt that the government supports early childhood programs. Parents in the United States used early childhood programs as a support mechanism to increase their confidence in child rearing. In the remaining four sections of the survey, parents  rated the importance of various types of parental involvement and of various materials, activities, and caregiver actions in their children's programs. In general, parents in Sweden valued informal contact and inner-directed creative materials and activities, while parents in the United States valued confining activities, such as rote counting, community-based experiences, and compliance with adult expectations.

The longitudinal data, which begins in 1950, when possible, is presented with a minimum of interpretation. The report is organized into five major sections. The first, \"Demographics and Family Composition,\" provides basic information about how many young people there are, and what kinds of families and households they live in. \"Family Income\" is the topic of the second section, which includes data on family finances, public and private economic support, and some of the costs associated with raising and educating young people. The third section is on \"Education,\" and  offers statistics concerning the number, achievement, and effort of young people moving through, and dropping out of, United States schools. \"Youth Employment and Finances\" is the focus of the fourth section, which gives information on employment patterns and earning and spending habits of young people. The fifth section deals with \"Health, Behavior, and Attitudes\" by bringing together direct measures of the welfare of youth--in particular, their health, positive and negative behavior, and attitudes about what is important in their lives. A glossary, list of sources of data, list of tables and figures, and an index are appended.

Only dissertations providing substantial attention to traditional forms of ethnic folk culture in context were considered. The concept of &quot;folklife&quot; governing the selection process was guided by the definition used in the American Folklife Preservation Act (P.L. 94-201) which states that folklife is &quot;the traditional expressive culture shared within the various groups...familial, ethnic, occupational, religious, regional; expressive culture includes a wide range of creative and symbolic forms such as custom, belief, technical skill, language, literature, art, architecture, music,  play, dance, drama, ritual, pageantry, handicraft; these expressions are mainly learned orally, by imitation, or in performance, and are generally maintained without benefit of formal instruction or institutional direction.&quot; Dissertations are organized alphabetically by the author's last name. Each entry includes author's name, complete dissertation title, name of university granting the Ph.D., academic department/field for which the dissertaion was written, year the degree was granted, pagination, order number from University Microfilms International, abstract citation, bibliographic reference to published edition (when applicable), and condensed version of author's abstract.

        "description":"Migrant students--especially those requiring special education--are at a disadvantage in our nation's tradition-based schools. Highly mobile migrant students change schools frequently enough to be out of step with normal school calendars, causing both handicapped and gifted students to be underidentified as candidates for special programs. Migrant students who are more &quot;settled out&quot; and remain for some time in the same school carry with them academic losses sustained during times of high mobility. These students find themselves being overrepresented in some categories of special education. Even when migrant students are placed properly, the time-consuming task of developing an individualized education plan often is interrupted by a move to a new school. Information exchange and  mechanisms for ensuring academic continuity for the special education student are just now beginning to emerge. More interstate and intrastate coordination is prerequisite to equitable educational treatment of migrant students. Additional efforts to recruit eligible students are called for, along with improved involvement of the parents of migrant students. If the parents of migrant children are ill-equipped to influence the educational process, and that is often the case, others must act upon the mandate to build an educational system that enfranchises all out citizenry.

The introduction outlines goals of language arts instruction and notes that activities conducted outdoors contribute to these goals because they are motivating, concrete, consistent with whole language methodology, and relevant to children's lives. Chapter 2 contains practical tips for managing children in the outdoors, planning outdoor activities, and evaluating children's outdoor experiences. Chapter 3 explains a cyclical instructional model consisting of motivation, exploration, expression, labeling application, and a second opportunity for expression. Chapter 4 suggests ways of using  children's literature in outdoor education and lists books and activities that could be used to study astronomy, American Indians, the desert, and environmental communications. Chapter 5 describes language arts activities that can be used to facilitate outdoor education experiences. Activities are listed under the topics of air, humans in the environment, plants, animals, and rocks and minerals. Appendices contain an evaluation by students of a trip to the Grand Canyon and four books written and illustrated by students (\"Deserts Are Alive,\"\"Plants and their Adaptations,\"\"Wonders of the Desert,\" and \"How You Can Survive\").

The book treats the three topics of self-knowledge, human communities, and outdoor-environmental awareness and values. Chapter 1 deals with building intentional communities, focusing on the necessary conditions for a sense of community and the interpersonal skills needed for getting along better with others in groups. Definitions and checklists for program evaluation are included. Chapter 2 examines intrapersonal and interpersonal skills and explains how these skills can be learned in the outdoors. Chapter 3 presents numerous outdoor  learning activities. Exercises for building intrapersonal skills deal with becoming aware of feelings, affirming personal worth, demonstrating humor and imagination, recognizing personal power and growth potential, taking risks, making decisions, setting goals, deferring judgment, and identifying personal wants and needs. Exercises for interpersonal skill enhancement deal with communicating thoughts and feelings, empathizing, interpreting nonverbal language, questioning, validating others, getting to know and trust others, dealing effectively with group conflict, cooperating, and listening and responding to others.

Findings showed that the migrant population was estimated at 1,089 workers and dependents. Family households were 60% of Mexican American origin and 73% of Mexican American migrant households had more than four members. Families spent approximately 5 months in the area. The solo population was distributed among Afro American (34%), Jamaican (34%), Puerto Rican (19%), and other (13%) ethnic groups. Almost half of solo migrants were married and had families in their home state/country. All respondents perceived their own  health as good and 34% of family respondents thought their families were in excellent health. However, 33% of solo and about 50% of family respondents reported at least one health problem. The leading health conditions were back and musculoskeletal problems. The Hispanic population made the greatest use of available health services while 33% of solo respondents did not know where they would go for needed medical care. Migrant farmworkers accounted for $4.03 million being pumped into the local Oak Orchard area economy. (NEC)",

The report is divided into two sections: a brief summary of national survey results and a summary of results from the Northeastern states which emphasizes rural strengths, state-by-state differences, rural concerns, and differences among respondent groups. Nationwide results revealed concurrence by all respondent groups on only three issues: improving academic performance of students from low-income families;  improving students' thinking/reasoning skills; and better recognizing/rewarding outstanding teachers. The survey identified 10 additional issues of high concern to at least 33% of Northeast respondents: community/parent involvement; use of evaluation/research to plan; development of students' self-esteem; expectations for students' academic development; understanding instructional goals; quality inservice programs; alternative delivery systems for instruction; community support; fine/performing arts; academic performance of secondary students. Over 50% of Northeast respondents suggested that of the 40 issues included in the survey, little or no improvement was needed in: availability of quality instructional materials; size/stability of teaching/administrative staff; and students'  attendance patterns.

        "description":"The Committee on Indicators of Precollege Science and Mathematics Education was established by the National Research Council to develop indicators of the condition of science and mathematics education in the nation's schools. In this report, the committee makes recommendations for improved ways of monitoring the condition of education in these fields. The recommendations are based on two premises: That all students need the knowledge and reasoning skills that good science and mathematics education provides; and, what teachers and students do in schools determines how much learning takes place. Included in this book are sections on: (1) indicators of science and mathematics education; (2) what are indicators? (3) learning in science and mathematics; (4) student behavior; (5)  teacher quality; (6) curriculum; and (7) financial and leadership support. Also included are recommendations, a summary, and a 19-page list of references. Appendices include: &quot;Colloquium on Indicators of Precollege Science and Mathematics Education: Participants&quot;; &quot;Review of Science Content in Selected Student Achievement Tests&quot;; &quot;Summaries of Meetings with Representatives of State and Local Education Agencies&quot;; &quot;Current Projects on Indicators&quot;; and &quot;Coordination of Strategies for Collecting Data.&quot; (CW)",

This monograph is an attempt to analyze the environmental improvement efforts since that time, with emphasis on environmental education and environmental studies. It is claimed that environmental policies developed over the past 17 years have failed to incorporate adequately the human dimension in relationships between people and their environment. Environmental education and environmental studies programs not only have failed to address cultural or human ecology substantively, but have evolved in a manner largely isolated from both the teacher education curricular mainstream and the humanities and science disciplines. Environmental educators are challenged to get on the \"cutting edge\" of the scholarly and education mainstream.  (TW)",

The purpose of the Lab Sites Study is to understand the process of implementing technology-enhanced guided exploration in school classrooms. Teachers and researchers are working together to understand what it takes to use computer-based technology to support student exploration of mathematical and scientific ideas in ordinary classrooms. The data analyzed in this paper was collected as a substudy of the Lab Sites project, which looked at comprehensive questions of implementation in relation to materials produced at ETC for teaching science, mathematics, and  programming. The substudy reported herein was concerned with teachers' points of view about using one piece of educational technology--The Geometric Supposer--to substantially change the way they teach geometry. The Supposer is designed to fundamentally change the way instruction is delivered in classrooms by enabling students to engage directly in the exploration of subject matter. What is reported here, therefore, is the teacher-users' thinking about that broader change in the way they do their work, as well as their thoughts about the technology. (TW)",

Each chapter of this report contains a non-technical summary of findings. Specific areas studied include: (1) the teaching force; (2) science teacher professionalism; (3) research in science education; (4) policy documents; (5) student enrollments; (6) student achievement; (7) male and female achievement; (8) student attitudes to school and to science; (9) male and female attitudes to school and to science; (10) valuing science; (11) science laboratories; and (12) curriculum decision making. In general, it  was found that Ontario students have positive attitudes about school and science but their achievement is not as high as might be expected of the richest province in Canada. In addition, Ontario shows innovation in curriculum decision making and exhibits more confidence in its local personnel than do other provinces. (TW)",

The objective of this project was to determine the effectiveness of the preservice materials. This project included an evaluation of students' working definition of science, their understanding of effective questioning techniques in teaching, and their approach to developing science lessons. Forty-eight elementary education  majors participated in this assessment. At the first class session of each methods course, the students were given a pretest to assess their background and knowledge in relation to the main objectives of the preservice materials. At the end of the semester, the students were given a posttest to assess how effectively the objectives of the preservice materials were met. The results indicated that after using the preservice materials, the students made significant gains in their knowledge of the nature of science and in the application of specific teaching techniques.

Both individual interviews and paper-and-pencil questionnaires were used in which children were asked to classify animals, plants and inanimate objects. It was found that: (1) there was a high percentage of incorrect classifications of plants at all ages; and (2) there were no consistent  connections between the classification of plants into living/non-living and according to biological criteria.

The original system has been implemented to involve three separate phases: the offline, or model generation phase; the online, or tutoring, phase; and the analysis phase. The offline phase, which is completed prior to any interaction with a student, involves the construction of a set of student models for a given domain. The online phase involves the tutorial interaction with a student, consisting of both diagnosis and remediation of errors. During the post-interaction analysis phase, undiagnosed errors are examined and, if consistent, added to the existing domain knowledge base. Four recent enhancements to the system are discussed, each arising  from a shortcoming that was noted in the system as a result of student trials. Two of these additions to the system involve the diagnosis of errors, and two involve the remediation of errors. (Author/TW)",

        "description":"Improvement in science teacher education has been called for by several scientists and science education organizations. The concept of synergy is suggested as a model for enhanced improvements in the overall preparation of science teachers due to positive interactions between groups responsible for science teacher education, scientists, and science educators. A 30-item Likert type survey was sent to scientists and science educators in Ohio and Georgia. This study determined that areas of strong agreement existed between the two responsible groups regarding some aspects of science education. For example, scientists and science educators both agreed that science teaching in high school and college were not the same. Areas of less agreement were identified that suggested increased  interactions between the responsible groups could produce clarification among issues of importance. Scientists and science educators disagreed about offering different science classes for teachers of K-6 and for science majors. Clarification of issues where less agreement was indicated will be necessary for optimum efficiency of science teacher preparation. This study suggests specific areas where dialogue has the greatest chance for success. (Author/CW)",

        "description":"The demand for more valid and useful educational indicators has grown significantly as national, state, and local agencies have moved to improve the quality of elementary and secondary education. At the national level, there is a growing need for more systematic information about student performance in mathematics and science, about the content of courses taught, and about the quality of mathematics and science teachers. At the state and local levels, increased academic standards have led to a need for more sophisticated measures of the processes and outcomes of schooling. No comprehensive indicator system is available to measure the status of mathematics and science education in the United States. This report addresses the question of the National Science Foundation's role in  monitoring mathematics and science education. The report identifies several options for developing a system of education indicators, i.e., measures that report the condition of particularly significant features of mathematics and science education, and then assesses each option in terms of its usefulness, feasibility, and compatibility with other national and state efforts to monitor educational performance.

        "description":"Research indicates that novice problem solvers represent and organize knowledge differently from experts. The novice engaged in problem solving activities is of interest to educators because efficient instruction reduces the differences between initial intuitive knowledge representations and the true concepts to be mastered. A particular cognitive style, namely, field dependence/field independence, affects the way in which information is perceived and processed. In this study, 39 junior high school aged students, identified as field dependent or field independent, were individually questioned about their understanding of the effect of gravity on vertical, horizontal, and projectile motion. They were given the opportunity to compare or verify their responses with information  presented graphically on a computer monitor. Probe questions were organized to access increasingly more abstract levels of knowledge. Student responses were qualitatively analyzed and grouped according to progress through the Pattern Matching Phase, Transformation Phase, and Post-Experimental Phase. The groups were then examined for mean score on the Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT). It was found that success on the Transformation Phase was positively associated with high performance on the GEFT. (Author)",

Animal protection advocates report that dissections constitute abuse of the animals dissected. The advocates state that what is learned by dissection could be more effectively learned by other means. Some science educators state that dissections do not constitute abuse; they are educationally justified. They claim that dissections actually help students to better understand and appreciate the animals. The purpose of this study was to investigate how animal dissections affected student attitudes toward and the learning of information about the animals dissected. A comparison was made of the knowledge gained and the attitudes influenced by dissection with that  gained and influenced by a lecture presentation. It was found that students who were taught by lecture experienced greater gain in achievement than did the students who dissected a frog. However, there was no significant difference in achievement between minority students who dissected a frog and those receiving the lecture. Students who attended neighborhood schools expressed more positive beliefs about frogs with dissection instruction, but non-neighborhood school students indicated more positive beliefs with the lecture approach. No significance was found concerning feelings toward frogs between the two treatment groups. (CW)",

The investigators began by comparing experts and novices on a similarity judgment task and found that experts predominantly relied on the problems' deep structure in deciding similarity of solution, although the presence of surface feature similarity had a clear adverse effect on performance. Novices relied predominantly on surface features, but were capable of using the problems' deep structure under certain conditions. In a second experiment, groups of novices who tended to employ different types of reasoning in making similarity judgments were compared. Compared to novices who relied predominantly on  surface features, novices who made greater use of principles tended to categorize problems similarly to experts, as well as score higher in problem solving. These results suggest that principles play a fundamental role in the organization of conceptual and procedural knowledge for good problem solvers at all levels. (Author/CW)",

These can lead to improper student treatment and often suggest successful teaching which is not warranted. The results of examining 32 fourth through sixth grade students attending a predominately middle class, urban school indicate four distinct groups of students that are not identifiable by these measures. The differences between these groups, although insignificant statistically, are considered by some to be of great importance in the creation of effective learning environments. (Author)",

Kelly's Personal Construct Theory and Perry's developmental scheme provided frameworks for analysis of the experiential, pedagogical, and mathematical perspectives through which the preservice teachers interpreted their undergraduate teacher preparation programs and anticipated their roles as teachers. Mathematical constructs tended to focus on simple algorithmic exercises guided by personal success with pre-college mathematics. Participants generally evidenced neither constructs with which to assimilate the implications of higher mathematics nor the anticipatory schema to deem such  material relevant. Role constructs tended to focus on social, versus intellectual, qualities. (PK)",

However, many researchers, employers and policymakers are concerned that the future supply will be inadequate. In the early 1990s the United States will experience a decline in the number of college-age students. Fewer students seem to be interested in science and engieering careers. Women's interest in these careers appears to have plateaued and non-Asian minorities, traditionally poorly represented in science and technology careers, are forming an increasing proportion of American school children. The Office of Technology Assessment concludes that these shortages are not inevitable. This assessment: (1) examines the  forces associated with elementary and secondary education that shape the talent pool; (2) traces pathways to undergraduate and graduate education in science and engineering; and (3) presents a discussion of policy areas for possible congressional action, developed under two strategies labeled \"retention\" and \"recruitment.\" (CW)",

One argument is that the current understanding of cognition is too crude to be helpful; another, that any scientific approach to education stifles the art of teaching. Some feel that art and science need not be incompatible. This paper offers several illustrations of ways in which cognitive science can be used to refine the art of physics teaching. For a theory to be pedagogically useful it should help teachers see things they might not otherwise have noticed, provide an overall organizing scheme for instruction and suggest specific activities that can improve instruction. This paper focuses on the physics problem. Examples have been drawn from introductory  level college physics classes. (CW)",

Academic freedom was not a concern when the U.S. Constitution and the First Amendment were drafted and is not mentioned in the &quot;Federalist Papers.&quot; However, decisions by a series of Supreme Court justices led to doctrines of constitutional interpretation related to academic matters. Academic freedom issues arose in response to what now seems to be clear abuses of authority. Today, academic freedom issues are complex and intertwined with conflict of interest, public policy, and dissent issues. The point at which academicians' limits to consitutional protection of their rights to express opinions or where speech or conduct so impairs the effective work of an  institution that its interests may prevail over those of the individual have yet to be determined. Since the 1960s there has been a growing interest in students' rights. The Constitution has provided a solid base of protection against political or authoritarian interference and guarded free expression in the academic community. (JHP)",

Topical issues and controversies are used to explore the issue of freedom of expression. The discussion is framed around three different views. Those comprising the first view believe that the balance has swung too far toward unlimited freedom and that words and pictures can cause serious physical, moral, and social harm. Although these people differ on what kinds of speech should be curtailed, they all agree that some additional restriction on freedom of expression are appropriate. Proponents of a second point of view hold that adults need not be protected from controversial or offensive images. But they are concerned about the effects of certain materials on minors. They believe that  adults have the judgment not to be swayed by extremist rhetoric, prurient stories, or blatant stereotypes. To them, the only appropriate action for government is to erect certain barriers so that young people are not exposed to objectionable messages. A third viewpoint would apply Justice Holmes'&quot;clear and present danger&quot; rule quite strictly. Even forms of expression that many people find offensive must be tolerated. Their solution to the problem of offensive ideas is to combat them with preferred ideas. More speech, they conclude, is always better than less. (SM)",

        "description":"Population projections are \"what if\" computational exercises. Given selected assumptions about future trends in fertility, mortality, and migration, population trends can be projected. Government and business planners need this information, and they also require enough time to put facilities in place to meet future needs. Everyone benefits from a clearer understanding of population dynamics and social changes. The different aspects of preparing projections, such as obtaining base data and selecting starting and future levels of rates, are highlighted. Both preparers and users need to carefully check the assumptions chosen for the projections since the reliability of the projections depends on those assumptions. The rules of thumb for reliability are: (1) the shorter the  projection period, the more reliable the projection is likely to prove; (2) the larger the geographic areas projected, the more reliable the projection is likely to be; and (3) the lower the current fertility and the higher the current life expectancy, the greater will be the reduction in the projections' likely margin of error. Major sources of data and projections on world, regional, national, subnational, and local areas are discussed, as are the difficulties in utilizing data for developing countries. (Author/SM)",

Three factors in comprehension were considered: topic familiarity, topic accessibility, and topic structure. A dialogue, a news broadcast, and a popular song were all presented to groups of beginning-level students of German, who were then asked to write down, in English, all they could remember of the texts. Students were then asked to listen to and report on any one of the texts again. Two groups had no prior information about the texts, and two groups had varying amounts of printed information about them. Results show that increasing amounts of information produced statistically significant differences in student performance. It is concluded from  these findings that: (1) students should be encouraged to listen to the full text and not interrupt the listening process, (2) the protocol is useful as a measure of text comprehensibility, and (3) comprehension increases with the appropriateness of the task presented.

Substratum elements in the language spoken by people of both sexes and of different ages are examined, concentrating on the gender system and the use of definite versus indefinite forms of the noun.

The subjects were five adult native speakers of Japanese at the intermediate stage of English learning. Speech materials elicited three different speech styles of varying formality: reading of a word list, reading of a text, and free conversation. The phonological phenomena examined included selected English consonant clusters and final consonants. The results revealed systematic patterns in style and variability and an interaction of transfer and developmental processes. The amount and type of variability according to style was related to proficiency, which in turn was governed by markedness, native language transfer, and universal developmental  processes. In some phenomena, native language transfer produced correct and incorrect productions. In other phenomena, developmental processes reflected markedness considerations and produced incorrect pronunciation. (MSE)",

Students received instruction in English as a second language (ESL), native language arts (where available), mathematics, science, and social studies taught in a bilingual or ESL format. Students also enrolled in mainstream courses. To prepare for enrollment in Brooklyn College during their senior year, students  participated in computer literacy and advanced placement courses, special classes in scientific research and problem solving, and an extracurricular program of field trips and guest speaker presentations. Extensive support services were also provided.

A questionnaire survey of students at New York University revealed that 39 languages were represented and only 10% of the students indicated they were English monolinguals. Comparisons were made among students by subdividing them on the basis of (a) monolingual background, (b) age of acquisition of English, and (c) dominant language (English or another language). These groupings were then used to evaluate differences on Scholastic Aptitude Test measures, ratings of language ability, and ratings of reading patterns. Analyses indicate that bilingualism is a less important factor in differentiating subjects on language background than the age at which  English is acquired, with the later acquisition of English having the greatest impact. Implications of these findings for subject selection for experiments in memory and cognition are discussed. Twenty-five tables and seven figures are included, and the study instrument is appended.

Respondents (N=304) expressed a high degree of satisfaction with their programs' quality, growth in enrollments and undergraduate and graduate majors, a projected upswing in faculty hiring, and the fairness of program resource allocation. Dissatisfaction was shown with levels of funding and faculty salary distribution. Most felt that market-driven salary formulas were not beneficial to their departments, and a smaller number felt that the formulas had lowered faculty morale; most, however,  felt that faculty morale was generally good. Respondents seemed less concerned with salary differentials within their institutions than with differences between institutions. The findings concerning the department chair are less positive. While most administrators found satisfactions in their role, most felt they had increasing responsibility but less power. The greatest frustrations appear to be in lack of time for teaching and research, motivating unproductive faculty, accurately evaluating teaching, budgeting, locating and hiring part-time faculty, and handling faculty discontent.

First, second language acquisition is becoming the model for first language literacy teaching in schools through the \"whole language approach\" to literacy. Second, the field of sociolinguistics has convinced educators that literacy is a social achievement and that literacy abilities are acquired by individuals only in the course of participation in socially organized activities. Third, the way in which children learn oral language is a model for all language learning, including literacy. Fourth, pragmatics and study of the functional aspects of language development have revealed that the situational and contextual demands on language delineate the linguistic requirements,  which establish register and mode of discourse.

The research was part of a larger study of untutored language acquisition by migrant workers in Europe. Specifically, this study examined the learning of vocabulary for ascribing properties to objects, comparisons, grading of qualifications, and expressions of evaluation in the course of 2.5 years. In general, a low adjective frequency was found in these subjects despite the fact that as adults they had a fully developed system of perceptual and cognitive patterns for structuring and conceptualizing linguistic input. Explanations for this phenomenon are sought in pragmatics (i.e., the  learner's uncertainty about the appropriateness of usage) and the organization of concepts. The subjects also showed an analytical (i.e., lexical) approach to comparison, attempting to specify the degree to which an object shows a particular property. The semantic, logical, and pragmatic status of adjectives are examined for insight into both low frequency and idiosyncratic use in these learners' language. (MSE)",

Research on factors in vocabulary learning is discussed, focusing on such factors as similarity in form and morphology, deceptive morphological structure, different syntactic patterning in the native language, differences in the classification of experience in the first and second languages, abstractness, specificity, negative value, connotations nonexistent in the native language, differences in the pragmatic meaning of near-synonyms and first-language translation equivalents, the learning burden of synonyms, and the apparent rulelessness of collocations. It is argued that word learnability (i.e., the ease or difficulty of learning  a particular word) can serve as a guideline to the teacher in: (1) the selection and presentation (quantity, grouping, language of presentation, isolation or context) of words to be taught; (2) facilitation of long-term memorization (through meaningful tasks, mnemonic techniques, rote learning, and reactivation); (3) development of self-learning strategies, and (4) assessment of vocabulary knowledge.

        "description":"Adapted from a curriculum guide prepared by the Hartford, Connecticut Bilingual Program's Vocabulary Development Committee, this guide to vocabulary development in sheltered English offers practical ideas for content area instruction to limited-English-speaking students in the language classroom, with the objective of facilitating transition from the English-as-a-second-language or bilingual classroom to English-only, mainstream instruction. The approach is based on research in first and second language development and the interaction of this research with school achievement. The guide provides background information on the concept and practice of sheltered instruction, vocabulary development through concepts, and the teacher's role in sheltered English. Two units on lesson  planning follow, with lesson activities that illustrate these principles. The first, a science unit on the moon and gravity, provides information for the teacher on the role of sheltered English in science instruction, outlines components of a sheltered English lesson, suggests steps in developing and teaching a lesson, and contains a lesson outline based on these principles. The second focuses on commonalities in the organizational structure of social studies and science. It outlines steps in producing a unit integrating teaching on the cell and teaching about government and discusses the identification of common elements in the seemingly disparate subjects. A lesson outline for using this topic with eighth graders is provided. (MSE)",

        "description":"Australia has a unique range of language communities and language education needs. A variety of languages is currently offered to different groups of learners through diverse programs. Language teaching may be provided through bilingual education, limited-exposure programs, or compulsory language instruction. Federal and state education agencies, policies, and curriculum initiatives further complicate the language teaching situation and increase the need to coordinate policy with curriculum development. New developments in language teaching also make curriculum change desirable. The Australian Language Levels (ALL) Project is evolving from these influences. The ALL Project focuses on the coordination of change in language education by supporting and facilitating changes already  occurring in language education, bringing coherence to the language field at the national level, and producing guidelines to assist in this process. To date, the project has produced two conceptual bases or frameworks for change: an organizational framework for describing language learning at different educational levels, and a curricular framework, or guidelines, for teachers and instructional developers. The curricular guidelines address the principles, goals, and activities of language learning. The curricular framework is deemed to be theoretically and methodologically applicable to the teaching of English as a second language as well as to foreign language instruction. (MSE)",

        "description":"A study examined the general structure of children's information books and their use of language. A corpus of over 110 information books was examined for (1) obligatory elements of the genre, (2) optional elements, (3) iterative or repeating elements, (4) elements with fixed orders of occurrence in relation to other elements, and (5) elements with an optional or variable order of occurrence in relation to other elements. The analysis identified six global elements: topic presentation, description of attributes, characteristic events, category comparison, final summary, and afterword. The first three are obligatory, and the second three are optional and varying in frequency. Despite some patterns in elements, many of the books were not easily differentiated as belonging to the  information book or the story-book genre, a problem attributable to the book's topic presentation and semantic properties. It is concluded that the notion of \"typicality\" is useful in examining and describing book genre, and may also suggest some new approaches to creativity in language use and to the question of the general nature of genres.

The study also sought to identify whether the differences in achievement within and among the groups could be at least partially explained by differences in demographic background, language use and competence, attitudes and school-related behaviors, and school experiences. Three achievement measures were examined, including: (1) academic performance as measured by seventh- and eleventh-grade students' self-report of grades in school; (2) NAEP reading scores for seventh-graders; and (3) NAEP math  scores for third-, seventh-, and eleventh-grade students. Factors relating to the students' self-reports of high grades and to students' tested reading and math scores indicated that (1) frequency of second language use in the home had a significant positive relationship to grades in the total sample, as did English competence; and (2) locus of control, English competency, and positive attitudes toward reading tended to be important explanatory variables of reading performance, but that frequency of second language use in home had little or no relationship to reading performance. Sample NAEP reading and math test items are appended. (Author/DJD)",

        "description":"Programs and policies at four-year majority white institutions with good minority retention rates are examined, and factors contributing to their success that are adaptable to other sites are identified. Identification of the institutions used in the study was based on an objective statistical procedure and expert nomination. The four institutions chosen were Boston College, California State University at Fresno, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, and Purdue University Minority Engineering Program. An introduction to the report provides a statement of the problem; review of the literature (student characteristics and behavior and environmental factors); and a summary of the study including descriptions of the two methods used to select the institutions and synthesis of  results from methods one and two). Case studies focus on the following: Boston College (the institution, African American/Hispanic/Asian/Native American student programs, and conclusions); California State University (the institution, access and retention, special programs, support services, and conclusions); Purdue University (the institution, the Schools of Engineering Minority Engineering Program, and conclusions); and University of North Carolina (the institution, access and retention, and conclusions). Findings focus on: differences among institutions and programs; characteristics of successful retention efforts; a model for developing effective minority retention programs; and a broader perspective of minority retention. It is concluded that retention includes motivating students to  aspire to higher education, preparing them for the rigors of a college career, assiting them to matriculate, helping them finance their education, and offering academic and personal support during their college years.

        "description":"The United States is not doing as well as it could in assessing educational outcomes in the 1980s. The assessment movement of the 1980s indicates that its institutional memory is poor, and when coping with outside pressures, it is slow to recall how it coped the last time it was under pressure. It is important to remember such events and pressures as the minimal competency testing movement of the 1970s; the debates over the relative merits of criterion-referenced testing and norms-referenced testing; and the recurring love/hate affair that public education has with measurement, assessment, and evaluation. One reason the U.S. is not doing well in the assessment of educational outcomes is the confusion about educational purposes since the objectives and expected outcomes of higher  education have not been defined.. Also, there is not an adequate theory of educational achievement in the 1980s. There is a need for a common language for education from kindergarten through &quot;grade 16.&quot; The U.S. can learn from the experiences of the University System of Georgia (USGA) in creating systemwide entrance requirements, developmental studies programs, reading and writing tests for sophomores, and varying forms of senior exit exams. This system suggests that in any efforts to assess educational outcomes, there should be at least three stages of assessment. USGA has entry, rising junior, and senior exit assessment. Systematic, objective, valid, reliable, and fair measures of educational outcomes are rare. For the time being, college administrators should measure what they can,  assess what they must, and evaluate with great care. Contains 15 references. (SM)",

Some of the significant points are that Black and Hispanic higher education participation rates have continued to decline since 1976; the number of degrees conferred to Blacks declined significantly between 1975-76 and 1984-85; in the academic year 1985, Hispanics and American Indians continued to earn degrees in numbers well below their proportion of the total population; and while the percentage of minority students in elementary and secondary public schools has increased, the percentage of minority teachers has decreased.

The accreditation was continued as a result, and it was recommended that a comprehensive evaluation be scheduled in 1986-1987 to look at such areas as: high faculty turnover; instructional programs with marginal enrollment, equipment, or technical depth; lack of faculty development; and new administrative adjustments resulting from a change in administration. Information and institutional data are provided relative to the concerns addressed in the focused visit of May 18-19, 1987. The process discussed took place from June 1984 to February 1987.  An examination of the areas of focus is offered. These areas include (1) finances (the ability to support staffing and equipment) and (2) the institution's progress in long range planning. A future plans summary and a summary assessment of the area of focus are provided. Conclusions are: the enrollment decline has stopped; the college has taken the right steps to turn around the financial base and develop a realistic long range plan; and the college is confident that all of the 1984 concerns have been addressed. Attachments include Data Form C (instructional staff and faculty number, degree, and salary; Data Form D (income and expenditures); items available and displayed for review; agenda issues; and an official response to the concerns expressed by the visiting team.

        "description":"The Financial Aid Study Committee of the Ohio Board of Regents was impaneled in October 1987 to determine if the state's major financial aid investments, principally the Ohio Instructional Grant Program, are an adequate resource in addressing state access objectives. Significant changes in the Ohio economic base have given rise to renewed emphasis on the role which higher education can play in preparing Ohioans for the 21st century. Ohio must develop strategies to expand access to higher education and ensure equality in its benefits. This responsibility must be shared by state and federal government, colleges and universities, and the private sector. Following an executive summary and a summary of 13 recommendations, the focus is on: cost of attending college; sharing the cost;  growth and trends in student assistance programs; growing reliance on student loans; growth and change in the Ohio Instructional Grant Program; packaging financial aid; access and the availability of financial aid; delivery of state grant assistance; part-time students; new options; and proprietary schools. Future study needs are also identified, including: determining the financial need of Ohio's part-time students; exploring the feasibility of further reducing a growing reliance on student loans by creating a work-study program to supplement the federal college work-study program; and exploring other options for families who do not qualify for need-based financial aid.

        "description":"Many studies in higher education have focused on the development of late adolescent and adult personality change on the assumption that such change was brought about by the college experience. The focus of this study is on the value changes that occur during college years and the changes that endure beyond college. Group and individual values preferences changes are examined with controls for gender, Appalachian status, education beyond the bachelor's level, and involvement in selected alumni activities. The Allport, Vernon, Lindzey Study of Values was administered to the Berea College Class of 1966 as freshmen, seniors, and 21-year alumni. Related literature is discussed, and the Pace alumni survey questionnaire is explained. Change in this class was seen to be the most dynamic  during the college period with the greatest change being an increase in aesthetic and a decrease in religious values preferences. The only significant change in the alumni period is an increase in economic values. Males scored higher on theoretical, economic, and political values, and females score higher on aesthetic, social, and religious values. Those educated beyond the bachelor's degree decreased in theoretical and increased in religious values. Participation in alumni activities was quite varied among the respondents.

Data were collected from February to May of 1987 from deans and RN students and from August to December of 1987 from RN graduates. Also, selected data were collected about generic programs. Questionnaires for deans were mailed to 606 baccalaureate nursing programs. The six sections of this report focus on: characteristics of participating baccalaureate programs;  characteristics of the 1987 student RN sample; recruitment, admission requirements, retention, and enrollment and graduation statistics of RN/BSN (bachelors of science in nursing) students; course requirements and curriculum; characteristics of faculty members; and employment trends and issues. The findings from all surveys and comparisons between respondent groups are included. Comparisons are also made between geographic regions and school characteristics. The greatest professional growth areas reported by RN students were research capabilities, confidence in academic abilities, and preparation for graduate school. Details about the 70 tables contained in the report are provided. Appendix A offers a background on the generic baccalaureate nursing data project.

The general philosophy of the degree program and the rationale for including the Student Team Project (STP) are described. The most basic goal of the program is the teaching, learning, and direct application of an algorithm for environmental problem-solving. The STP is a direct experiential application of this 10-step cyclic algorithm. The other project goals are: acquiring good team skills and gaining an understanding of the importance of such skills in successful cooperative group research, and developing good research skills and professionalism in oral and written presentations. The similarity  between the STP technique and other small group techniques is discussed. Evidence for the positive impact of the STP experience is presented, along with examples of the projects that the teams have produced. Specific problems associated with the STP technique and potential solutions are also presented.

One experienced an individually competitive structure (n=39) and five other sections experienced three different cooperative goal structures: one using intergroup competition (n=29), two without intergroup competition (n=29 and n=36), and two using Sharan's Group Investigation procedures (n=37 and n=39). A two-way repeated measures ANOVA design was used to examine pre- and post-test achievement scores by treatments within subjects. The six groups were not significantly different from each other on the pre-test. All six groups obtained significantly higher post-test scores. A significant interaction between treatment groups and time was obtained indicating higher achievement scores in the classrooms  experiencing the Group Investigation treatment and the lowest post-test scores in the classroom experiencing intergroup competition. Factor analysis of a 14-item survey determined four subscales, three of which obtained statistically significant differences and more positive attitudes concerning learning, achievement and cooperation in the sections experiencing cooperative strategies. The data suggest that, while significant achievement gains were obtained by all teaching strategies, students who experienced the cooperative goal structures achieved the most, had a more positive experience, and preferred cooperative goal structures.

Attention to this issue has focused on extremes, obscuring the fact that only a small proportion of students attend extremely costly colleges. National policymakers and those who influence public perceptions have not focused on the significant difference in pricing between the public and private sectors, nor on the fact that the states decide what portion of the cost of operating their institutions will be funded by general tax revenues and what portion by user taxes (tuition and fees). The debate has also not differentiated between the published price and the amount students and  their families actually pay, taking into consideration student financial aid and tuition waivers. State higher education agencies should recognize that increases in the net price are a legitimate concern. The adequacy of financial aid is also a major issue. The federal government is a major student aid provider and states should analyze the effect of both state and federal policy changes on their citizens. State higher education agencies should assess cost increases in state-supported systems continuously, identifying, monitoring, and controlling increases where possible. (MSE)",

        "description":"Tuition policy is interrelated with many issues addressed by state higher education executive officers (SHEEOs), including quality, access, choice, and funding. The central policy issue is how to set tuition levels in amounts and in a manner that support the state's substantive higher education policies, explicit or implicit. Tuition and financial aid are mutually supporting policies, not ends in themselves. Recent national surveys have provided information on related policies and practices. Tuition policies appear to belong to two general models, revenue-based and formula-driven. A variety of approaches to financial aid were found, with only 27 states indicating some form of policy. Links between student aid and tuition policies do not appear to be strong. Examination of states'  relative tuition levels as they relate to student aid policies provides insights into the two tuition policy models. Policies appear to have changed in recent years due to reduced state revenues available to higher education. While each state's higher education finding system reflects its unique environment, state higher education agencies can apply similar tests to see if existing tuition and financial aid policies meet the state's needs and other policy objectives, and can begin to refine the connection.

The study addressed (1) the issues that historically have surrounded the price of public higher education; (2) the changes in tuition and required fees, state appropriations, the higher education price index, consumer price index, and per capita disposable income during the past two decades; and (3) how the changes in tuition and fees have compared to changes in relevant economic indicators. It is concluded that tuition and required fees have increased substantially in the last 15 years, but the income parents and students use to pay tuition has increased commensurately and state appropriations have also  increased substantially. It is proposed that the economic recession of the early 1980s substantially changed the relationship between state support of public higher education and the tuition at public institutions, and that further movement in that direction is likely to result in even more obvious intervention by public policymakers. Five appendices and 40 tables/figures supplement the report. Contains 53 references. (MSE)",

Chapter 1 looks at educational experiences of the 1980 senior class (enrollment in postsecondary education, attainment of one-year and two-year awards and four-year degrees, and educational expectations and progress in postsecondary attainment). Chapter 2 discusses employment experiences of the 1980 senior class (aggregate trends in employment and unemployment, employment experiences of individuals over time, and average wages per hour by level of  education and employment pattern). Information on family formation in the 1980 senior class is given in chapter 3 (marital patterns, child rearing patterns, and household locations and composition), and chapter 4 focuses on participation and attitudes of the 1980 senior class (self-concept and locus of control, civic participation, and attitudes about sex roles). Among the major findings are that: (1) students with higher socioeconomic status were more likely to receive four-year degrees than those with lower socioeconomic status; (2) Hispanics, Native Americans, and Blacks were less likely to earn degrees than Whites or Asians; (3) males were employed at higher rates than females throughout the period by six to eight percentage points; (4) women were more likely than men to have ever  been married and to have become parents; and (5) men had higher self-concept scores than women, but women were more likely to feel they could control events affecting their lives.

Information is reported quarterly, and will be computerized. The  Strategic Planning Executive Committee and the Environmental Planning Evaluation Committee review the information, the first for organizational planning and the second for its usefulness as a link with planning.

Data from the study came from the  National Research Council's Survey of Earned Doctorates and the Survey of Doctorate Recipients from 1975 to 1986. Minority underrepresentation in academe is attributed to slowdown in doctoral production, declines in applicant pools, decline in numbers choosing careers in academe, and lack of minority retention. Findings are reported in three areas: demographic characteristics and trends of minority Ph.D.s; minority Ph.D.s in the labor force; and minorities in academe.

        "description":"The sixth in a series of descriptive summaries about the status of 1972 high school seniors, the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972, is presented. Four chapters focus on the following: education experiences of the 1972 senior class (enrollment in postsecondary education for 1972 high school seniors, attainment in postsecondary education, and the continued interest in postsecondary education); employment experiences of the 1972 senior class (employment experiences of individuals over time and average hourly wages earned by type of occupation); family formation patterns of the 1972 senior class (marital status in 1986, trends in marriage 1973-1986, trends in marital dissolution 1974-1986, parenting status in 1986, and trends of parenting); and civic  participation and attitudes of the 1972 senior class (self-concept and locus of control, civic participation, and opinions about elementary and secondary education). Some of the major findings are as follows: in 1986, 44% of 1972 high school seniors still expected to continue their education; employment patterns differed by sex; in each year between 1973 and 1986, women were more likely than men to have been parents; and substantial proportions of the 1972 seniors agreed that there are serious problems facing elementary and secondary schools. Four appendices consist of methodology and technical notes; tables of regression coefficients and adjusted means; data for figures; and means, standard errors, and sample sizes for tables. Tables are included. (SM)",

The extent and nature of social integration among undergraduates is discussed, with a focus on whether the social environment differs among ethnic groups (Black, Chicano, Asian, and White). The four aspects of the social environment explored are: extracurricular activities; rules and regulations of student life; community relations; and social problems (health and well-being and intolerance on campus). Some of the major findings are as follows: undergraduates overall are well satisfied with most aspects of the campus' social environment; satisfaction level among ethnic groups vary considerably; Davis undergraduates are  generally very pleased with extracurricular programs and services; students are moderately satisfied with the rules and regulations that govern student life; undergraduates overall report fairly high satisfaction with community relations on the Davis campus; Davis students overwhelmingly single out alcohol abuse as the most serious of the health and well-being problems; and student overall rate intolerance of homosexuality as a more serious problem for Davis students than racial intolerance (though this opinion is not shared by Blacks).

        "description":"The question of whether or not having a master's degree rather than just a bachelor's degree makes a difference in the employment outcomes of graduates 1 year after degree completion is considered. Employment characteristics are examined in relation to the number of years of previous work experience. Also, the enrollment status of recent degree recipients in conjunction with their employment characteristics is considered. The employment status of master's and bachelor's degree recipients is compared by selected major fields of study and by graduates' gender and race/ethnicity. Topics include the following: characteristics of master's and bachelor's degree recipients; labor force status; salaries of master's and bachelor's degree recipients; and job attributes of master's and  bachelor's degree recipients. Results of analyses of data from the 1985 Recent College Graduates survey indicate that for individuals employed full-time 1 year after degree completion, having a master's degree had a positive effect on salary. It also significantly affects whether or not an individual can obtain a job that has some career potential and is related to field of study. The field in which a degree is earned is also important to these employment characteristics. Two appendices are: (1) a description of the Recent College Graduates survey, reliability of the estimates, and statistical methodology; and (2) definitions of terms used in the report.

        "author":["Cross, K. Patricia"],
        "description":"Aspects of the perception that assessment is a large-scale testing program conducted at institutional or state levels to determine what students have learned from college is questioned. Small-scale assessments conducted continuously in college classrooms by discipline-based teachers to determine what students are learning in what class are also important. The direct involvement of classroom teachers in the assessment movement is important because: teachers need continuous feedback on learning in the classroom so they may improve teaching effectiveness; continuous feedback is necessary for improvement in teaching and learning; and it is important to know more about how students learn. The two broad categories of feedback provided by students to teachers are: (1) student  evaluations of teaching in which they report their observations and reactions to the course and instruction and (2) measures of student learning such as tests and daily assignments. Sources of bias in student ratings of instruction include student, faculty, and course characteristics. Other topics of discussion are consistency and agreement on teaching effectiveness, validity, and the effect of student ratings on instruction. The effect of feedback to teachers on student achievement in the classroom is noted. Conclusions and recommendations include: students provide relatively unbiased, reliable, and valid information; feedback is much more effective in producing change when augmented with consultation; and research is needed on the efficacy of providing teachers with better methods of  classroom learning. The topic of colleagues as sources of feedback is considered as follows: feedback from colleagues as peers; feedback from consultants and experts; and self-assessment. Contains 69 references.(SM)",

It is difficult to find assessment invoked without a parallel call for improvement, particularly improved teaching and learning. Also, much attention has focused on problematic dimensions of measuring what students learn, but the fundamental set of questions about the match between purposes and methods tends to get bypassed. Six sections focus on the following: a rationale for the approach taken here and the problem that prompts it; principles of assessment grounded in a view of how students learn; a theory of learning, set forth not as the final word but as a possible framework for &quot;theory-driven&quot; assessment; three assessment techniques that follow from that theory (the structured  interview, concept mapping, and Gowin's Epistemological Vee); an evaluation of the three techniques in light of experience of their use and other considerations; and a revisitation of the thesis (where it has gone, and where it will go next). Positive steps for the assessment movement include (1) encouraging faculty to talk to each other about meaningful learning and (2) developing a greater and more diverse array of methods.

Astin, focuses on measuring education productivity, assessment lessons from the Cooperative Institutional Research Program, a talent-development model of excellence, assessment and values, multiple-choice tests, holistic methods, assessing affective outcomes, and beyond narcissism. It stresses that the key to achieving institutional transcendence is ultimately in how excellence is defined. &quot;Assessment and Incentives: The Medium is the Message&quot; (Linda Darling-Hammond) discusses from a teacher's point of view the following: how measurement changes behavior; incentives: a parable with lessons;  the K-12 experience;, limits of standardized testing; effects of testing on teaching and learning; and policy making and assessment. Important factors are educating those who would impose hasty or inadequate methods, and insisting on intellectual honesty and educational validity. &quot;The Assessment Movement: What Next? Who Cares?&quot; (Robert H. McCabe) gives a community college president's views on access and standards, the public call for accountability, state initiatives in assessment, the Florida experience; and institutional assessment initiatives. The assessment movement is growing in tandem with the teaching/learning movement and can be considered an element of it. The future of assessment is in improving student development through more effective teaching and learning. (SM)",

This is a tangible symbol of the degree to which American universities are reaching beyond traditional boundaries to serve adult learners who are place bound and often well into active careers. Information is provided as follows: introduction (case study focus and profile of Penn State Great Valley (formerly King of Prussia Center for Graduate Studies and Continuing Education); strategic planning: genesis of Penn State Great Valley (strategic planning process, external assessment, internal assessment, and strategic planning goals and action plan); establishing a permanent location (authorization to proceed,  ad hoc planning stage, and fiscal analysis and debt service); operating budget model; and facility siting and design. The developer-university partnership is discussed, noting that the concept for Penn State Great Valley was the result of a detailed strategic planning process which conceived the new facility as a strategic opportunity for Penn State in Pennsylvania's major metropolitan area. Penn State Great Valley is a timely response to a unique set of environmental conditions. It appears that developer-university partnerships forged to create unique adult learning campuses established as part of business settings may offer useful options for responding to these requests for expanded services.

        "description":"Lenders' billings for interest subsidy payments under the Department of Education's Guaranteed Student Loan Program (GSLP) are discussed. In fiscal year 1986, the Department of Education paid lenders $2.4 billion in interest subsidies on $39 billion of outstanding Guaranteed Student Loans. The General Accounting Office (GAO) reviewed the accounts of large lenders to determine (1) the extent of errors lenders make in their billing statements, (2) the cost of these errors in federal overpayments to lenders, and (3) the adequacy of the Department's procedures and internal controls for payment to lenders. All 16 lenders studied made errors in their September 30, 1985, billings on which the Department based payments of $69.4 million. Many errors appear small when viewed individually  but are significant when projected to the lenders' total portfolio of Guaranteed Student Loans. It is found that the Department's oversight of billing is inadequate, and lenders lack sufficient incentives to maintain accurate loan accounts. Recommendations are that Congress amend the Higher Education Act to authorize the Secretary of Education to assess lenders' interest on overpayment of interest subsidies due to erroneous billings from the dates of the overpayments and, also to require lenders to have their independent auditors verify loan accounts and interest billings as part of their periodic audits. Five appendices are: loans outstanding for lenders included in GAO's review; interest and special subsidy allowance billed by lenders included in GAO's review, accounts in which lenders  miscalculated loan balances or interest due; comments from the Department of Education; and comments from the Consumer Banking Association.

Such a university system can be attained only in an environment of understanding and cooperation, where the needs of all residents are addressed through a unified, coordinated system of universities, rural colleges, and service programs. The Six-Year Plan embodies the belief that the above can be attained through a more unified and effective system that provides a sound framework in which the special missions of each UA institution can be pursued. It can only be attained if adequate educational master planning occurs. Following a statement of the problem, the focus is  on: methodology (designing the survey and defining survey population, delimiting action support factors, and data analysis); results and summary (the 15 actions making the most progress, the 15 actions making the least progress, actions cited most frequently as no longer relevant, actions with the largest or smallest standard deviation, actions with the largest or smallest response rates, and action rating differences); and assessment statistics on actions (table key and definition of terms used, and detailed action tables).

Seven sections cover the following: cultural perspectives (the warrant for the report, organizational rationality, the remaining sections); culture defined and described (toward a definition of culture, properties of culture, levels of culture); intellectual foundations of culture (anthropology, sociology); a framework for analyzing culture in higher education (the external environment, the institution, subcultures, individual actors); threads of institutional culture (historical roots and external influences, academic program, the personnel core, social environment, artifacts, distinctive themes, individual actors);  institutional subcultures (faculty subculture, student culture, administrative subcultures); and implications of cultural perspectives (a summary of cultural properties, implications for practice, inquiry into culture in higher education). Techniques of inquiry appropriate for studying culture include observing participants, interviewing key informants, conducting autobiographical interviews, and analyzing documents. By viewing higher education institutions as cultural enterprises, it may be possible to learn how the college experience contributes to divisions of class, race, gender, and age within the institution as well as throughout society, how a college or university relates to its prospective, current, or former students, and how to deal more effectively with conflicts between  competing interest groups.

Trends are presented from SREB's extensive databases on demographics, elementary/secondary education, higher education institutions and their enrollments, degrees granted, finances, student costs, financial aid, and faculty salaries. Information is also provided for the SREB states on enrollments and degrees awarded by race. Six sections focus on the following: population, education, and economy; institutions and enrollment; degrees; institutional finances; student finances; and faculty. SREB state profiles present a selection of statistics from each of the six headings, providing a convenient,  at-a-glance overview of the progress and position of higher education in the region and individual SREB states. Some of the findings are as follows: over the last 10 years, full-time faculty salaries have increased faster than inflation in two-thirds of the SREB states; over the last 20 years higher education appropriations in the SREB region have increased from about 10% of state tax revenues to 16%; in the mid 1980s the number of bachelor's degrees awarded in the SREB states grew about one-half percent; and the high school graduation rate has increased during the 1980s both nationally and in the SREB states. An appendix provides SREB-state data exchange definitions of institutional categories. A list of state postsecondary education agencies is included. Contains 67 tables.  (SM)",

The studies reviewed identified Chicano student  characteristics corresponding closely to those variables influencing attrition hypothesized by Tinto. Chicano students reported being poorly prepared by their high schools for college. Services provided by the institution and interactions with faculty were two areas which helped contribute to their persistence. Their social integration into the institutional environment also contributed to their persistence as did family support. Finances emerged as critical in the persistence decision, primarily due to the low socioeconomic status of the Chicano population. Indications are that the educational experience is different for males and females. Tables are included. Contains 103 references. (SM)",

Another factor considered is the current movement of other agencies, primarily multinational corporations, into the European market. Reasons for not expanding into Europe are also presented, including the problems inherent in cultural and language barriers, and difficulties that would be encountered in providing adequate local support administrative services. The possibility of competing with already established European distance education programs is also  considered.

Subjects were 247 college students who had completed a computer course using intelligent workstations in any one of six consecutive semesters. A combination of lecture and hands-on computer practice, the course was designed to teach generalized problem-solving and decision-making skills applicable to a number of settings. Multiple regression was used to determine the significance of factors and the magnitude of effect on the dependent variable in conjunction with the other variables, i.e., average academic ability as determined by the student's grade point average and grade on a previous computer literacy course.  Dependent variables tested included the grades on the course, the lecture portion of the course, and the computer laboratory portion of the course. The major findings were that women, if given the opportunity to practice their skills, outperform men; and that the transfer of knowledge from a previous traditional computer course has only limited effect on performance, which can be compensated for by additional hours of practicing on the computer. The text is supplemented by four tables and six bibliographic notes. (35 references) (Author/EW)",

        "description":"This report investigated the relationship between learning to program LOGO and the development of problem solving skills. Subjects were 133 students in grades 4-8 who had at least 30 hours of experience with both graphics and lists programming in Logo. Students were randomly assigned to one of three contextual groupings, which received graphics, lists, or both graphics and list problems, according to grade level. Groupings remained constant across six instructional units corresponding to six problem solving strategies believed to be helpful for children programming computers: subgoals formation, forward chaining, backward chaining, systematic trial and error, alternative problem representation, and analogical reasoning. Highly significant differences were found across both  contextual groupings and grade levels for all strategies except backward chaining, suggesting that a pedagogy combining a focus on particular aspects of general problem solving, direct instruction, and a mediated learning environment will enable the development of problem solving skills with Logo programming and their transfer to non-computing domains. Highly significant differences were also found between grade levels on measures of subgoals formation, systematic trial and error, and analogy, suggesting that there are developmental differences in students' abilities to acquire and transfer particular problem solving strategies. No significant differences were found between contextual groupings, suggesting that students' abilities to transfer problem solving skills did not vary depending  upon the base context(s) in which those skills were acquired.

It is noted that: (1) the concept knowledge in this research is acquired and reported by a hypertext system called NoteCards; (2) NoteCards is used as a pre-processor to computer based training applications, and the metaphorical structure created by NoteCards and displayed to browsers is used in hypertext navigation; and (3) visual examples of concepts are held on a videodisc attached to the workstation that runs NoteCards. It is concluded that NoteCards provides a useful environment for  experimenting with knowledge elicitation and providing a trainee/learner-based interrupt interface to computer based training. The six figures provided include concept maps, an equipment layout diagram, and a hypertext explanation and video picture. (19 references) (Author/EW)",

Introductory materials note that the tasks set for workshop participants included the examination of 11 case studies prepared under contract with Unesco; the identification of innovative trends in pre- and in-service training of secondary school teachers in this area; and the development of proposals for regional and international cooperation in the implementation of the regional pilot project for the biennium 1988-1989. The report is divided into three parts: (1) background of the workshop, including  objectives, participation, documentation, and organization; (2) the results of the workshop proceedings, including examination of the case studies, strategy guidelines (the needs of the beginner, developing skills, and the informatics-competent teacher), and resource implications; and (3) proposals for regional and international cooperation, including criteria, principles, application area, institutions, and cooperation. Appendixes include a copy of the workshop agenda, a list of participants, the chairman's position paper (&quot;Teacher Training in the Context of a Changing Model of the School&quot; by Rhys Gwyn), a bibliography of participants' papers received, a 94-item supplemental bibliography (of which 35 are in various European languages), and abstracts of 10 of the case studies prepared for  Unesco.

        "description":"A statewide survey of Nevada school librarians was conducted in the spring of 1988 to determine their perceptions of their roles as curriculum leaders in their schools. Their responses showed that Nevada school librarians see themselves as instructional leaders, and to a lesser extent perceive that their principals, teaching colleagues, and parents also see them in this role. The survey also found that: (1) school librarians are support, auxiliary personnel for classroom area teachers as well as the media specialists for their schools; (2) they are particularly involved in the language arts, social studies, and science programs in a support capacity, but are directly involved with reading programs at all grade levels; (3) they value their contacts and friendships with school  colleagues; (4) they are more involved in teaching library skills, serving as media specialists, and supervising students and aides, and less involved in administrative, clerical, purchasing, cataloging, and classifying functions; (5) school principals set the tone for the reception of the school librarian by the rest of the school staff; and (6) each school still remains unique in its perception and utilization of the school librarian. The attached copy of the questionnaire used, which was an updated version of the one developed for a statewide survey in 1986, includes a tally of the rankings for individual questions. (EW)",

In addition, the Board requires that noncredit courses be approved through the same local curriculum review and approval process as credit courses. The tradition of the collegial model of governance in postsecondary institutions in the United States is reflected in the adoption of the new regulations in the California Administrative Code. The spirit of the collegial model perceives academic governance as an interdependent decision-making process and provides for the sharing of responsibility for the development of educational policy among faculty, college administration, and  the public body of governors or trustees. The regulatory changes support the traditional postsecondary model by stipulating the mutual responsibility of the college and/or district administration and the academic senate for review of the composition and structure of curriculum committees and the establishment of a curriculum planning and review process. The process should include: (1) the development of a curriculum manual containing policies and procedures; (2) the establishment of a curriculum committee, ideally as a subcommittee of the academic senate; (3) a comprehensive curriculum review; and (4) provisions for the review of all curricular proposals. Suggestions for the content of a curriculum manual, relevant resolutions of the Academic Senate for California Community Colleges, and  a sample course approval form are included with the paper.

Drawing from existing data and the findings of a national survey of state articulation systems, the task force concluded that Florida's articulation system is unique in the United States, due to a consciously created structure of higher education that incorporates community colleges as the primary providers of freshman/sophomore education and anticipates the movement of students among colleges and universities as the norm rather than the exception. From relatively simple  beginnings, the present-day articulation process has become a formalized system of statutes, rules, agreements, and activities. The success of the Florida model is demonstrated by enrollment and student performance data showing high rates of transfer and academic success. The articulation system involves: (1) admissions components, including minimum requirements, entry testing, college/vocational preparatory instruction, feedback of performance data between institutions, and articulated acceleration mechanisms; (2) transfer of credit/program articulation features, including common transcripts and course numbering, the College-Level Academic Skills Test, limited access programs, foreign language requirements, transfer agreements for particular degrees, and the registration process; and (3)  student services, including programs to improve minority student access, student financial aid, and counseling. Drawing from study findings, the task force developed 16 recommendations to improve the system. (EJV)",

The study revealed that one-third of the high schools had formed an articulation council with a community college, one-third did not receive information from the colleges concerning support services, and almost one-half indicated that joint curriculum review by high school and community college faculty was current practice.

Program components include an intensive job-search class, which assists participants in assessing their work skills, values, and interests; evaluating the local labor market; and using innovative job search techniques. In addition, the program uses an array of cognitive behavioral techniques, including automatic thought stopping, reinstatement of past reinforcers, increased socialization, graded task fulfillment, cognitive rehearsal, reinforcement of positive affect and behavior, and time management. WEN operates through a performance-based contract between the Seattle  King County Private Industry Council (PIC) and South Seattle Community College (SSCC). The college underwrites the program's staffing and supply costs until it has billable earnings based on student enrollment, completion of training, job placement, and job retention. Though JPTA funding fluctuates in response to external forces, the college has benefited from and received regional recognition for the WEN program. The experiences of SSCC suggest that the success of a JTPA/community college partnership rests on the responsiveness of program staff in meeting the changing needs of both the community college and the local PIC.

The program overview examines policies and procedures concerning placement criteria, exit standards, program acceptance, academic standards, longitudinal tracking, and students with limited English proficiency. In addition, this section presents information on courses, facilities, and staffing; as well as MCCC's reading and writing programs, and computation and algebra courses.

This section also offers information on the students' completion of remedial courses; performance in college-level courses; and pre- and post-testing results. Next, data on student outcomes are compared for fall 1983, 1984, and 1985 groups. Finally, major findings and trends are summarized, indicating that an average of 79% of the enrolled students completed remedial courses in reading, 80% in writing, 71% in computation, and 71% in algebra; and that remedial students had higher return rates, but lower grade point averages than students who entered MCCC with college-level skills.

        "description":"Drawing from an examination of changing economic conditions, student needs, and training demands, this manual suggests an ideal plan for developing or revising existing college job placement services. Chapter 1 reviews the literature on the goals, components, and clients of job placement services. Chapter 2 focuses on organizational concerns, such as placement personnel and their responsibilities, the role of instructors and counselors, planning, facilities, eligibility requirements, and budgeting. After chapter 3 analyzes issues in college placement for non-credit education, chapters 4 through 7 examine the four essential components of job placement services: (1) preemployment preparation, including providing a course and/or non-credit workshops on career planning and  integrating their content with other courses and services; (2) job development, including activities to locate and create job opportunities for students; (3) placement of students according to their education and abilities; and (4) conducting follow-up surveys of participants and employers and monitoring the marketplace for new and changing needs. Finally, chapter 8 examines the evaluation of placement services, identifying the kinds of data to be collected and sources of the information. Appendixes present samples of news releases, survey instruments, forms for record keeping, and other relevant materials. (AAZC)",

Section I contains introductory comments on the problem of undereducated and underemployed adults and SAC's efforts to develop an assessment and advisement process specifically for this target population. After section II defines relevant terms, section III offers an overview of the demonstration project, entitled \"Individualized Education and Employment Plans for Disadvantaged Adults,\" and funded with discretionary funds from the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act of 1984. Next, section IV underscores the importance of client involvement in vocational assessment, and section V outlines the eight steps in the  assessment process: (1) screen and provide an orientation for clients; (2) conduct a formal interview; (3) conduct medical screening; (4) determine educational achievement; (5) discover vocational interests and goals; (6) conduct interest inventories; (7) develop an individualized education and employment plan; and (8) offer referral information. Finally, section VI offers guidelines for program evaluation, section VII describes the role of the vocational evaluation specialist, and section VIII presents suggestions on how best to use the handbook.

        "description":"Designed as a report of current articulation programs between high schools and two-year colleges in Washington State and as a stimulus for increased articulation, this guidebook outlines the principles underpinning successful programs, suggests steps to be taken, and responds to commonly asked questions. Introductory comments explain the purpose of the guide, provide a brief historical overview of high school-college cooperation, and establish the benefits of articulation. Next, 10 guiding principles are stated, focusing on the importance of leadership, early faculty and counselor involvement, respect and trust, mutual benefits, written agreements, open and frequent communication, modest initial goals, clearly defined roles, competency-based curricula, and a common focus on goals  rather than on turf. Next, ten action steps for successful articulation are presented, including: (1) take the initiative; (2) schedule a planning meeting; (3) secure validation by chief executive officers; (4) develop coordinating mechanisms; (5) provide orientation for staff members of participating organizations; (6) arrange interagency work sessions; (7) complete draft agreements; (8) publicize the articulation agreements; (9) implement the process; and (10) review the process annually. The final section identifies questions that are likely to arise with respect to the sharing of instructors and facilities, the role of technology, financial implications, equivalent credits, connections with other higher education institutions, and overcoming resistance. Descriptive essays on several  existing programs, sample forms and agreements, and a glossary are included in the guidebook. (AYC)",

The survey investigated services for a wide range of disability categories, including emotionally disturbed, hearing impaired, learning disabled, mentally retarded, orthopedically handicapped, other health impaired, and visually impaired. Over 650 colleges responded to the survey, identifying an extensive range of services, including counseling, on- and/or off-campus housing, test modifications, expressive and acceptive interpreters, learning centers and learning disabled services, notetakers, career/job placement, resource teachers, special new student orientations,  registration assistance, readers and scribes, tutors, transportation, and taped texts. The survey report lists each responding college, the name and telephone number of a contact person for additional information, a coded list of the disability categories served, and a coded list of specific programs, support services, and agreements with government or private agencies.

Between summer 1986 and spring 1987, the colleges awarded 12,221 technical associate degrees in business, engineering and industrial technology, health technologies, agriculture and natural resources, and public services. The colleges were requested to survey their graduates two months after graduation, and to conduct follow-up surveys of non-respondents as necessary. Study findings, based on a statewide response rate of 84.9%, included the following: (1)  community colleges accounted for 33.3% of the total degrees awarded, technical colleges for 39.2%, and urban technical centers for 17.2%; (2) 41.3% of the degrees were awarded to business majors, 20.7% to engineering technologies graduates, 27.3% to health technologies graduates, 3.1% to agriculture and natural resources majors, and 7.6% to public services graduates; (3) of the 10,381 respondents, 9.9% were continuing their education and were unavailable for employment; (4) of the 9,070 graduates who entered the labor market upon graduation, 94.3% found employment and 82.1% found jobs related to their training; and (5) the placement rate for agriculture and natural resources graduates increased from 90.9% in 1986 to 93.4% in 1987.

The study methodology involved in-depth interviews, questionnaire surveys, and observations at one State University of New York community college, and additional interviews at other sites to test the generalizability of the single-campus data. Study findings included the following: (1) the student profile changed dramatically during the past 20 years, with trends toward increasing proportions of women, older students, and middle-class students; (2) the community college was the first educational choice of the majority of respondents, whose reasons for attending included accessibility,  affordability, and the benefits associated with going to a \"well respected\" college; (3) students' major criticisms concerned the lack of social and cultural opportunities at the college; (4) comparatively small classes, rewards for effective teaching, an emphasis on student evaluations, and a folklore concerning student/teacher relationships reinforced positive student perceptions of the college; (5) faculty and staff identified strongly with the college and with the idea of service to the students and community; and (6) major sources of job satisfaction among faculty and staff were classroom experiences, interactions with students, opportunities for mentoring, and supportive relationships with colleagues. Literature on organizational culture and the community college's social role is  cited throughout the report, and a 140-item bibliography is included. (AYC)",

State directors of two-year college education were surveyed for background information on the last three years of vocational education funding under the Vocational Education Act (VEA) of 1963, and on the first year of funding under the Carl D. Perkins Act of 1984. Study findings included the following: (1) two-year colleges received 22% to 23% of the total VEA allotments to 46 responding states in 1982-83 to 1983-84; (2) responses from the 37 states that provided funding data by program category indicated that two-year colleges received less than 20% of the states' VEA allotments for every program category except Basic Grants,  for which 26% to 27% was alloted; (3) 43 states provided information on Perkins Act funding for 1985-86, indicating that two-year colleges received 22% of the Perkins Act allotments in all program categories combined, including 27% of the estimated allocations for the Vocational Education Opportunities Program and 17% of the allocations for the Vocational Education Program Improvement, Innovation, and Expansion Program; and (4) more detailed information on Vocational Education Opportunities Program allocations revealed that two-year colleges in the 43 responding states received 20% of the allocations for the handicapped, 23% of the allocations for the disadvantaged, and 41% of the allocations for adult training/retraining.

        "description":"The concept of barrier-free transfer from two-year to four-year colleges is an important element in planning for student access to the baccalaureate. While it seems clear that transfer works reasonably well for most students most of the time, evidence suggests that transfer may be a qualitatively and quantitatively different experience at the relatively small number of two-year institutions attended by most minority students. Two-year colleges can provide open access and accept that many of their poorly prepared students will not qualify to transfer or graduate, or they can achieve good completion rates by restricting access to their high-demand programs to traditionally prepared majority and minority students. A third alternative involves assessing the preparation of entering  students and providing them with learning strategies and support services necessary to gain college-level content and literacy skills. Changing demographics suggest that institutions must strive for both access and high achievement for all students. In a growing number of states, it is a priority for all postsecondary institutions to work toward the elimination of race and ethnicity as influences on both participation and graduation rates. This goal can be fostered through active recruitment of first-generation underprepared students, collaboration with high schools, early identification of gaps in academic preparation, intrusive advising and mentoring, tutorial services, and career guidance. A definition of educational quality that accommodates the growing diversity of America's  college-going population must also emphasize teaching and support strategies to promote comparable achievement among all races and ethnic groups.

Nine newspapers were monitored over an 8-week period to track the appearance of news stories, special events publicity, &quot;hometown&quot; news releases, announcements of meetings, classroom/campus features, human interest articles, personality profiles, promotional pieces, photographs, and miscellaneous items. For the same period, the office also kept track of the number of press releases sent per week to each paper, the type of article that was sent, the disposition of each release from week to week, the way the article was handled (e.g.,  inserted as received, condensed, or not published), and the ratio of articles published to releases submitted by type of press release. Study findings included the following: (1) the public information office produced and mailed 48 separate articles, including five photographs with captions, during the 8-week period; (2) the office mailed a combined total of 247 pieces of information, or slightly under 27.5 releases per week to the nine newspapers; (3) two newspapers, including a daily paper and a biweekly paper, used more than 75% of the releases they received; (4) the weekly newspapers used an average of 25% of the releases they received; (5) of the 95 articles about the college that were published, only 36% were edited by the newspapers before appearing in print; and (6) the papers  showed a preference for publishing &quot;hometown&quot; releases and timely news stories, while releases which sought to promote the college's programs and services were rarely used.

Research and practice have produced knowledge about the sensitivity of outcomes to characteristics of the infant nurturing situation. Infant caregivers should accept babies' need for sensuous stimulation and intimate relationships. The curriculum for infant caregiving should be embedded in the innumerable daily acts of caring that allow infants' bodies to settle into easy rhythms. Sensorimotor skill building, and, later, preoperational skill building should be done in a sensitive manner so that infants and toddlers are lured, not pushed, into learnings. Language richness should permeate a baby's day. The infant or  toddler's environment must provide safe places for the infants to run, crawl, and gallop about. Discipline in infant caregiving requires that conditions be arranged so that babies are kept as comfortable as possible. Discipline for toddlers may involve arranging the environment so that no-nos are infrequent. To provide an optimal developmental situation for each child, caregivers should hone their &quot;noticing skills&quot; to detect the ways in which each early learner markedly differs from others.

The six prosocial skills considered included cooperation, sharing, taking turns, helping, demonstration of awareness of another's feelings, and verbal resolution of conflicts. Seventeen preschoolers from an Ausubelian preschool program (experimental group) and 17 preschoolers from a community day care center (control group) were selected randomly. Subjects were from middle-class families of different ethnicities. The children received six weeks of intruction in the prosocial behaviors. Instruction in the experimental group was based on Ausubel's theory of  learning, and instruction in the control group was based on a traditional method. Tests were administered to assess the children's ability to resolve hypothetical social conflicts between two puppets. Children's spontaneous prosocial behavior was observed. Testing and observations occurred prior to, immediately after, and six weeks after instruction. Children in the experimental group performed significantly better than those in the control group on both tests after instruction and in observed helping behavior.

It introduces a new data set from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). Information was collected in a supplement to the SIPP conducted between January and April 1985 in about 17,000 households. Statistics cover persons of 18 years and over who were regularly making cash payments for the support of persons living in another household during 1985. Results indicated that the likelihood of providing and receiving financial assistance is determined by the life cycle status of both providers and recipients, while the amount of payment is determined by the financial resources of the providers. It was also reported that: (1) the most  frequent causes for financial need among nonhousehold members are marital disruption and aging; (2) families vary more in their abilities to pay than in their reasons for supporting nonhousehold family members; (3) child support makes up 11 percent of the annual family income of women who receive it. The report includes 27 charts and 3 tables. Appendices provide an overview of the SIPP program, definitions, specifications of sources and reliability of estimates, discussions of data, findings of a loglinear regression analysis, and facsimiles of SIPP questionnaires.

A total of 49 kindergarten children were pretested to determine their levels of seriation and classification operations. Pretests were conducted with a battery of Piagetian tasks that had been refined in a pilot study involving 50 additional children. Subjects were observed in a classroom where a learning center was equipped with a manipulative number board designed to foster seriation and classification skills. The number board was available in a free-choice format during a &quot;free-play&quot; activity hour, 4 days a week for a total of 15 days. Children were then posttested. It was predicted that  children in transitional phases of constructing logical operations would freely choose to use the board more than children would who had already constructed these operations or were not close to constructing them. Decalage, which was based on how much variability existed among test sores measuring the same operation, was used as an index to determine which children were experiencing internal cognitive conflict. As predicted, children with the highest decalage scores used the manipulative number board significantly more often and with greater variety than did their low decalage counterparts. Board use was found to be significantly associated with gain in seriation scores. (RH)",

Participants were 28 children who were equally divided into experimental and control groups, pretested, and found to be nonconservers. A sequence of two AO lessons and related learning activities was presented to the experimental group. Lessons focused on paying attention to special properties of objects and using high-order rules for solving conservation tasks. Control group children received regular instruction in a traditional preschool program. Posttests to measure immediate transfer of training and long-term retention of conservation concepts were conducted immediately after, and four weeks after, the training period. Results indicated that AO  instruction was successful in promoting the learning of a high-order rule for conservation that children generalized to five conservation concepts. The high level of improved performance by experimental group children at posttest I was maintained at posttest II. Control group children showed little improvement in performance in both posttests, and their level of performance remained essentially preoperational. All children found number conservation easiest to deal with. Data suggested that the five conservation concepts were acquired in the following order: number, liquid quantity, length, area, and weight (mass). (RH)",

Sub-categories of the domestic role were meal preparation, cleaning, shopping, washing, sewing, outdoor tasks, and house/car repairs. Sub-categories of the child care role were custodial, play/stimulation, outings, physical punishment, verbal punishment, positive socio-emotional, and encourages. Results revealed that mothers were perceived as doing more domestic work and providing  more custodial child care than fathers or teachers. Teachers were seen as most involved in play and stimulation, with fathers less and mothers least involved. Despite the fact that more than two-thirds of the mothers were employed, fathers were much more likely to be perceived as doing paid work than were mothers or teachers. Type of early childhood center experience was not clearly related to children's perceptions of adult roles. In general, findings showed both overlap and differentiation between children's views of mother, father, and teacher. (Author/RH)",

Mothers were perceived as doing the most domestic work, whereas fathers were perceived as mainly doing repairs or outdoor tasks. Nearly the same number of responses described mothers and fathers as doing child care. Mothers were perceived as more likely to perform routine care and fathers are more likely to take children on outings or to provide stimulation. Fathers were more likely to be described as doing paid work than  mothers. Teachers were perceived primarily as fulfilling an educational role in the classroom. About one-fifth of the sample described verbal control of behavior, custodial child care, and positive socioemotional responses as part of the teacher's role, but no children ascribed domestic activity to teachers.

Described are: (1) the recent expansion of and anticipated future need for child day care programs, focusing on families with working parents and emphasizing the use of family day care; (2) the identification of children's basic and universal developmental needs; (3) perceptions of childhood that affect adults' responses to children's needs, emphasizing the development of early education and child day care programs, especially in family day care; (4) conceptions of politics that underlie the current role of government in the formation and operation of  family day care homes; and (5) means by which to express the relationship between the perceptions of childhood and the conceptions of politics in a pluralistic society. It is argued that persons in the roles of caregiver, advocate, and policymaker must function simultaneously in whichever roles are appropriate so that government will operate at a consistent level of consensus and compromise, so that government will respond to each segment of society that has responsibilities for child-rearing, and so that no one group will be favored to the exclusion of another.

These presuppositions concern: (1) the complexity of change and the nature of pluralism; (2) the view that history is dull, boring, and irrelevant, and (3) the idea that politics is \"dirty,\" manipulative, and cynical. A second aim of the discussion is to show early childhood educators, caregivers, and administrators how the knowledge of their historical roots and their  political context can enable them to become, not just capable advocates, but also more effective and successful workers at whatever job they do, whether it be as group teacher, head teacher, director, coordinator, administrator, professor, or policymaker.

A systematic method of observing developmentally appropriate and inappropriate behaviors was sought. The result was a comprehensive model based on Gordon's (1968) conceptualization of instruction. The model proposes that presage variables, such as pupil entering, teacher entering, and demographic characteristics, be investigated with a teacher interview sheet and a teacher belief inventory. Process variables, including teacher and pupil behavior in the setting, organization, and content factors, be studied by means of observations of situated teacher and pupil behavior and other information about the classroom environment; and that data on product variables, such as short-  and long-range cognitive and affective effects on students, be gathered through pre-conference contact with teachers. Five categories were included in the systematic observation component of the model: teacher management strategies, children's learning strategies, types of verbal interactions, teacher communication strategies, and affective guidance. To establish the reliability of the instrument, \"Dimensions of Developmentally Appropriate Teaching Techniques,\" two trained graduate students observed tapes and coded behaviors of four teachers and their students.

        "description":"The purpose of this paper was to analyze the initial results of statewide implementation of the PRIME TIME program in Indiana. PRIME TIME is a state-wide program to reduce class size in the primary grades. Mean scores from 65,911 third graders who had completed the Indiana Competency Test in the spring of 1987 after completing 3 years of the program were compared with the scores of 67,987 third graders who had no experience with the program. A difference of only 0.7 points favoring the smaller classes was found on the composite scores of four subtests, suggesting that monetary expenditures for PRIME TIME were not justified by program effects. A test of homogeneity of variance was also performed. Results indicated that the smaller classes caused both high and low scores to regress  to the mean. It is concluded that, since smaller classes cost a tremendous amount of money, it is the responsibility of educators to learn when and where reductions of class size are most beneficial to students.

Major assumptions underlying the organization of an accelerated school include unity of purpose among parents, teachers, and students;  empowerment of key participants in the school; and use of the strengths of all available resources. Features of the accelerated school include school-based governance; a clear set of goals; pupil and school assessment; awareness of nutritional and health status of students; curriculum which places heavy emphasis on language use in all forms; instructional strategies which reinforce the curriculum; and participation of parents.

Assessed as a function of action and sound were preschool children's preferential selection and recall of words presented in a computer microworld. A computer microworld consists of scenarios providing options to move various objects on a static but vivid pictorial background. The objects, called &quot;sprites,&quot; are programmed to have particular shapes, colors, movements, and sounds. In this study, 40 preschoolers, equally distributed by sex, were randomly assigned to one of four versions of a microworld. Within each version, 24 sprites were randomly assigned action and sound properties. The experimental design was  counterbalanced so that in each version every sprite assumed all possible factorial combinations of action and sound. Children preferentially selected and recalled more words presented with action than words presented without action. Although children selected sounds, sounds interfered with children's recall of linguistic information. Results supported an action superiority hypothesis and an auditory interference hypothesis. These results suggest that action should be an integral component of educational computer software designed for young children. Cited are 25 references. (RH)",

An office of Advocacy for Rural Development would be formed within the department to explore means of improving rural economies and to join in cooperative agreements with state governments for the same purpose. Rural technology grants proposed would support programs in rural areas to develop and commercialize new products and processes.

        "description":"Analysis of data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis shows that during the 1970s and 1980s the composition of personal income in rural America shifted dramatically. Transfer payments and investment income accounted for almost 40% of total personal income in the nonmetro United States in 1983, up from just over 20% in 1969. This report examines the various forms of unearned income and relates them to total personal income. Most transfer payments received by nonmetro residents in 1983 were retirement related, although transfers providing income maintenance benefits, such as food stamps and unemployment compensation, and veterans' and military benefits also accounted for significant shares of personal income. Most investment income came from interest rather than dividends or rent.  Investment earnings increased dramatically in the late 1970s and early 1980s when inflation increased the value of assets and the real interest rate increased to historically high levels. The fastest growing component of transfer payments to nonmetro residents was unemployment compensation, increasing from almost $500 million in 1969 to $6.5 billion in 1983. Most of the growth in transfer payments to rural residents, more than 70%, was related to retirement programs. Income maintenance payments accounted for less than nine percent of the growth over the study period, contrary to the frequent complaint that welfare is largely responsible for increases in government spending. Unearned income was 38.9% of total personal income in nonmetro counties, compared with 32% in metro counties.  Because unearned income is so important in rural America, rural communities have a major interest in policies affecting investment and transfer income, general retirement programs, unemployment compensation programs, and tax codes.

        "description":"This paper is an overview of 64 documents on multicultural education policies from various Australian state education bodies during the period 1979 to 1985. In comparisons between states and across time, these policies are marked by inconsistency in form, scope, status, and content. States vary considerably on: (1) whether English as a second language (ESL) is part of multicultural education or an independent field; (2) the purposes of bilingual education and second language learning; (3) the role of ethnic schools; and (4) approaches to sociocultural education. Nevertheless, important trends are worthy of note. Institutionally, the multicultural education movement developed as a result of initiatives from Canberra, and policy statements began emerging in the late 1970s as part  of the administration of tied federal funding. Across all policies, there have been moves toward concepts of mainstreaming: (1) influencing mainstream teachers about the ESL needs of their non-English-speaking students; (2) broadening the concept of community languages to encompass all languages other than English so that they gain equal curricular importance; and (3) establishing multiculturalism as an ethic that crosses the school, combatting racism at both structural and attitudinal levels. However, equivocation in policy language and reports of actual practice suggest that the mainstream has hardly been affected. Mainstreaming is now the key word of policy and debate. (SV)",

        "author":["McNutt, John G."],
        "description":"This paper discusses ways to make social work education more appropriate for the preparation of development practitioners to work with the people and communities of Appalachia. The current dominant theory developed by economists of Appalachian development is that of modernization. The theory emphasizes economic growth. Modernization sees society as progressing via industrialization, causing high rural to-urban migration. Acceptance of this theory, a world view that fails to take Appalachian culture into consideration, puts social work planners in a role that supports the economic system, limiting them to &quot;cleaning up the casualties of economic activity.&quot; The theory also discourages adequate funding of social programs and robs social workers of the opportunity to improve the lives  of their clients in a significant manner. Movement toward a new approach to development could open the doors for both a more appropriate development and more effective social work. An alternative model (McNutt 1987) includes: a reorientation of development goals away from economic growth and toward social objectives; a change in the measurement of growth to reflect those goals; a community level planning strategy; support for planning strategy at higher levels of analysis; technical support that relies on the talents and abilities of community people; and a structure for ensuring fulfillment of basic needs. Appropriate changes in social work education are needed and will require changes in perspective, an understanding of the region and its people, the acquisition of new skills, and  better field education. 37 references.

        "description":"This paper describes a model for a literacy program proposed for the Rural Education Project at Tennessee Technological University in Cookeville. The program would target unemployed adults, at-risk youth and others in a seven-county target area whose lack of reading skills hampers their search for employment. The model calls for cooperative efforts among the university, area school systems, and other community agencies. The literacy program would link up with community education programs, including those that offer adult basic education, job related skills training and vocational education. Components would include dropout prevention, basic skills, higher-order thinking skills, telephone hot-lines for homework assistance and increased access to college for low-income rural  students. The literacy program would also encourage parent involvement through the use of newsletters, school produced videotapes, and telephone hot-lines for parents. The Rural Education Project proposes to raise literacy rates by identifying other successful programs, linking college faculty with local school personnel, and tapping into other community resources. The project would provide training, some means of program assessment, and a method for disseminating information among schools. Project personnel established fund-raising goals and planned to assist local officials in application for additional funding. A successful literacy project, the paper concludes, would result in lower dropout rates, more adults completing high school equivalency tests, and more involvement in education  by adults. (TES)",

The six video programs in the series are each 15 minutes long and present the special skills, talents, and strategies used by successful Alaskans to meet the challenges in their lives. The subjects are a female artist, a female student leader who moved from her rural Native village to the University of Anchorage, a male businessman with diverse life experiences, a female newspaper editor, a male Eskimo teacher involved in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, and a male commercial fisherman. Series goals are (1) assisting students to develop strategies for their own success; (2) developing the basic skills of conducting research,  writing, speaking, listening, and making decisions; and (3) encouraging students to reflect upon their own lives and futures. During the course, students conduct interviews with people they consider successful and write biographies to be compiled into a class publication. The appendix includes student worksheets to be used during biography production, a description of brainstorming, a discussion of cognitive mapping as a more creative planning tool than traditional topic outlines, 4 references on cognitive mapping, and bibliographies of 27 books and 11 videos about Alaskans.

        "description":"This teaching unit was written to supplement the curriculum of intermediate and secondary teachers in Washington State. The material is applicable to social studies classes, special events and American Indian studies. The unit includes an extensive account of the various historical periods in American Indian Education, beginning with initial contacts with white settlers in the late 15th century. The document reports on mission schools set up by churches and covers the period following 1871, a time when Indians lost control of their educational systems. In boarding schools, for example, Indian children were confronted with a school culture and curriculum vastly different from their tribal reality. There is also a section on the New Deal of the 1930s and the Meriam Report, a 1928  survey of Indians' social and economic conditions. A section on legislation explains several acts passed by Congress and their effects on Indian education. The period immediately following World War II was perceived as a time of regression, when the government withdrew services. Since the 1960s, however, a number of studies, reports, and legislative acts have been directed at improving the American Indian educational system. In 1972, Congress passed the Indian Education Act, allocating $18 million to improving education for Indian students. The unit concludes that cultural conflict was most evident during the 19th and early 20th centuries, when the federal government attempted to bring American Indians into the mainstream of society. The unit includes an Indian Education Chronology, study  questions, and 22 footnotes. (TES)",

        "description":"Three standard assessment instruments (Rorschach, Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory and 16PF) were administered to 12 participating Rosebud Sioux Indians--6 males, 6 females. Reports were generated for each instrument. Consensual and unique concepts contained in all the reports were analyzed in order to describe the contents. Six judges, all residents of the reservation and either college employees or social agency personnel attempted to match the participants with their reports. The judges may not have known all of the participants intimately, but they were well acquainted with the facts of their lives. Two general questions were explored: (1) can people who are acquainted with all participants identify them from their reports; and (2) what are the similarities and  differences in report content among the three instruments. Only two judges were able to identify reports with significant accuracy, suggesting that assessors should be wary of their conventional assessment instruments as applied to Native Americans. The report suggests that the instruments are not sufficiently sensitive to themes concerning particular tribes and cultures; social etiquette of assessment interaction; and to an underlying genocidal theme of white-Native American assessment confrontations. The paper concludes that psychological tests might be made more culturally specific and that objective tests require local and tribal norms for Native Americans. Cautious use of assessment instruments is recommended until training in culture-specific administration and interpretation of  projective techniques is available and local tribal norms have been provided for objective tests. 19 references, 4 tables.

It is designed to alert leaders in classrooms, families, and councils of government to the state of mathematics education in the United States. &quot;Why Mathematics Counts&quot; is summarized in the first section. Then, highlights from the assessment are given: the trend in mathematics performance is encouraging, particularly for students at ages 9 and 17 and for Black and Hispanic students. However, the gains have been confined primarily to lower-order skills. Other findings concerning achievement, instructional patterns, technology, course-taking, and attitudes are succinctly presented. Next, the assessment procedures are summarized, followed by some reflections  on the findings. Trends in mathematics proficiency is the concern of the next section, with a graph highlighting overall trends and a chart showing the percentage of students in each age group (9, 13, and 17) in the last three assessments (1978, 1982, and 1986). Implications for instruction are considered in terms of students' perception of mathematics, patterns of classroom instruction, and the place of mathematics in the curriculum. Finally, a summary stresses the need to teach not only skills, but also higher-order thinking strategies. (MNS)",

To understand these advances and to make educated decisions concerning them, the citizenry must be scientifically literate. It is further argued that to be scientifically literate, individuals must understand the scientific process. The materials provide an example of an investigation which employs the scientific method to learn about some aspects of sound. Once data are collected, as a result of student investigation, they are computerized as a method of identifying trends. In the investigation students use active inquiry, group processes  and Piagetian principles to determine how various factors interact to produce the pitch one hears. The investigation is an extension of the one where all jar or glass sizes are identical and, therefore, the glass size variable automatically controlled.

        "description":"In the past, science textbooks have been the target of criticism of science educators in studies of sex bias in the past. The purpose of this study was to examine the illustrations in the biology textbooks most commonly used in high schools in the United States. Seven textbooks were examined for their representation of women in illustrations of scientific activity. It was expected that these textbooks would have women underrepresented as active participants in science activities, as compared with men. Illustrations that were identifiable by sex were coded based on the sex and activity shown in the illustration. It was found that, for the sample as a whole, females were just as likely to be shown as active participants in science activities as males. However, these books represent  a trend toward favoring male participation in science; that is, some of the effects were masked by the sample as a whole. Individual textbook differences were examined and a range of representatives was found. (Attached are a bibliography of 30 items and a list of the texts used in the study.) (Author)",

The principal purpose was to seek the views of individual investigators at academic institutions about NSF's competitive proposal review and decision making process. Two-thirds (more than 9,500) responded. The reasons most often volunteered by dissatisified applicants about the review process were that the reviewers selected by NSF were not sufficiently expert in the subject matter of the proposal, or that the reviews were cursory, conflicting, or did not seem to support NSF's decision. Applicants' views varied according to their experience, i.e.,  depending roughly on the proportion of awards they received to proposals submitted. Applicants' experiences, actions and views also differed according to which NSF research support division handled their proposal(s). The report also contains the first cross-tabulation of applicants' fields of research to the NSF research support divisions, and the initial chart of award rates by division for first proposals and resubmittals.

Their language embodies a people's world view, expressing the values they consider important for physical and spiritual survival. Students are greatly influenced by their native culture. For the Ojibwe, culture plays an important role in their lives and this should be evident in the core curriculum of their schools. Unfortunately, this has not been the case for the Ojibwe. The Ojibwe Language Institute was initiated on the assumption that knowledge and understanding of the Ojibwe language and culture would help teachers to better assist their students. The intent of the 1987 institute was to develop a science curriculum from the Ojibwe perspective.  The goals of this program included helping students to become aware that science has always been a part of the Ojibwe way of life, to develop cognitive skills, to develop a positive self-esteem, and to gain a pride and understanding of their heritage. Topics covered in this curriculum include life cycles, the water cycle, food production, trees, and the seasons. The lesson plans within each topic include lists of concepts, grade level, objectives, vocabulary, suggested references, and ideas for class and individual activities. Content, cognitive and language emphases are highlighted. (CW)",

The final sample consisted of 160 students enrolled in a remedial arithmetic course in a four-year college in Puerto Rico. A two-way analysis of covariance with pretest in basic skills in mathematics as covariate was used to test the hypothesis that different instructional interventions reduce mathematics anxiety and increase mathematics achievement. It was concluded that: (1) either of the two instructional interventions can be successfully employed to improve mathematics achievement of remedial college students; and (2) although the  difference in adjusted posttest means was not statistically significant, the gains in mathematics achievement of both groups on posttest scores were considerable.

Features of a desirable notation for algebraic problem solving are described.

These tools supply students with important learning opportunities. Finally, comments are made about continuing research in this area, and the importance of testing different representational systems in real educational contexts. In addition, theoretical work must be directed toward deriving a general  classification scheme for representations. (MNS)",

        "description":"In the past, science textbooks have been the target of criticism by educators and feminists in studies of sex bias in education. The purpose of this study was to develop a useful tool that could be used in formative or summative evaluation of the level of sexism in science textbooks and as a research tool to study the effect of sexist instructional materials on the course choices made by secondary school students. Seven popular grade 10 biology textbooks were examined for their representation of women in illustrations of scientific activity. Three variables were examined in each of the biology textbooks; gender represented by the image; the presence/absence of dominance between persons in an illustration; and the traditional/nontraditional nature of the activity of the  individuals in the illustration. It was expected that these factors would help to explain the variation in the impression left with a person by these texts. Using multiple linear regression methods, it was found that these three factors accounted for a significant portion of the variance among the textbooks. Another factor, intensity, the number of illustrations which carry these socializing messages in a given text, has emerged from the study of this data.

        "description":"Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) aim to improve upon previous computer-aided instruction programs by embedding much of the expert knowledge that good human teachers possess. While ITS research has a practical goal of developing programs that assist students in learning, there is little data on their instructional effectiveness. This paper presents preliminary student outcomes from the initial introduction of a prototype intelligent computer-based algebra tutor in a California high school. The focus is on student characteristics, including their background and attitudes about computers and computer-based instruction, and their evaluation of the tutor's usefulness for learning. Pre- and post-semester algebra achievement tests and final course grades provide data on student  learning for 80 participants. It was concluded that: (1) positive attitudes toward learning with computers, experiences with this algebra tutor and previous computer experience appear to be unrelated to actual achievement in algebra; (2) there is a significant negative relationship between programming and overall algebra achievement; (3) gender differences existed; and (4) the preliminary data tell little about the relationships between student characteristics, overall achievement, and the nuances of learning algebra with an intelligent tutoring system.

Distinctions made in action science bring out this difference. Action science emphasizes an integration of personal knowledge and social discourse along with objective data in cycles of planning, acting, and fact-finding about the results of the action. Practical ways for teachers to implement these features are discussed. In particular, methods of making it easier to obtain objective data by means of self-recording are presented in some detail. Two examples of field projects in the first grade mathematics illustrate how this works. (The first example presents a record that justifies keeping and repeating one of the teachers' strategies. The second example  presents a record that indicates a change was needed and how the change turned out.) (Author/YP)",

Included are preliminary results of an investigation of the counting and calculating abilities brought to instruction by students in grades K-3 in Chicago (Illinois) and similar research from a number of developing countries. This demonstrates the dangers both of ignoring the knowledge children develop outside of formal school instruction and of becoming too dependent upon it. It is argued that a key means by which elementary school quality can be improved is to begin with the knowledge students develop on their own and transform it though pedagogic  and curricular intervention into a set of portable intellectual skills. The point is also made that children around the world bring more knowledge to school with them today than students 50 years ago did, yet curricular materials fail to account for this. This knowledge depends not so much on where they live, what their sex is, or who their parents are, but on the level and complexity of mathematical experience their out-of-school activities provide.

        "description":"Evidence from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and other sources suggests that both the content and structure of our school science curricula are generally incongruent with the ideals of the scientific enterprise. By neglecting the kinds of instructional activities that make purposeful connections between the study and practice of science, educators fail to help students understand the true spirit of science. The results from the NAEPs 1986 science assessment indicate recent improvements at all three age levels assessed. This document presents the results of the 1986 assessment. Data are presented as trends in average proficiency; levels of proficiency for the nation and demographic subgroups; the context for learning; the relationship between course taking  and proficiency; teacher qualifications and classroom practices; experiential, home and attitudinal factors associated with science learning; independent learning experiences, parental and educational support; and student views of science learning.

Middle school science education spans all of the natural sciences and therefore a college program to prepare teachers for this kind of assignment should include a strong background in interdisciplinary science and professional skills particularly suited to the characteristics of middle school students. With these ideas in mind, two model teacher preparation programs were developed at the State University of New York at Potsdam and Hampton University. This document focuses on the characteristics of the programs at these two institutions. Discussed are the interdisciplinary science major at Potsdam including course outlines for chemistry/physics  courses and geology/biology courses, and a description of the middle school teacher preparation program at Hampton University. These two programs are among nine such programs funded by the National Science Foundation in 1986. (CW)",

The report discusses the extent of United States and foreign participation in R&D in the United States, federal policies regarding foreign access to R&D, reciprocity of information exchange, and implications for U.S. policy. Researchers reported that the primary mechanism for participation is through programs that bring researchers into the laboratories from outside organizations, that U.S. researchers have not had trouble gaining access to foreign laboratories, and that scientific exchange between U.S. and foreign scientists has occurred readily.

In response to this need, PC/Nepal has shifted its emphasis in the education sector from providing teachers to providing teacher trainers. The purpose of this task analysis is to define this new PC role and to provide systematic information for preservice and inservice training activities. This document contains four sections: (1) task analysis; (2) job description; (3) technical training sessions; and (4) technical readings. The task analysis was developed through interviews and review of program materials and documentation. The other sections were developed  based upon the task analysis. The job description, technical training sessions, and technical readings were compiled into a technical training manual which the mathematics and science trainees received during the first week of the preservice training. The last two sections are organized into general teacher and mathematics/science teacher training sessions. (Author/YP)",

Many of the demands stem from the way rapid changes in information technology have altered our economic and social culture. In particular, these technological changes have changed both mathematics and its applications. Given these circumstances, this report outlines the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics proposal, \"Curriculum and Evaluation Standards\" (1987). Also discussed are the implications for instruction of the adoption of a curriculum based on these Standards. Next, the problem of developing appropriate indicators to determine the effectiveness of a school mathematics program based on these curricular and instructional changes is presented, and a  domain knowledge strategy proposed. Finally, the problems of implementing these changes in the schools are identified. While not easy to accomplish, a professional development strategy is described which, if followed, has promise in bringing about the reforms in the teaching and learning of mathematics which are being proposed.

In line with the mission of schools, historic preservation involves the maintenance of culture--the sites, structures, and objects that constitute the tangible legacy from the past and reflect the identities, values, traditions, and aspirations of the past citizens of the United States. The school curriculum reform in the 1980s recommends an extensive core curriculum that reflects common ideas, experiences, and traditions; and historic homes, bridges, workplaces, and other structures are tangible forms of these legacies. An outcome of common learning is cultural literacy which can be enhanced by including video programs and  photographs of landmark sites. Cultural literacy is fostered through the strong revival of interest in geography and history, and landmark sites can be readily connected to the fundamental themes of these disciplines. Heritage education can foster the common memory that a diverse population needs in order to survive and thrive. (DJC)",

In response to that publication, this paper examines the core curriculum as it affects social studies. The social studies sequence emphasized history (ninth and tenth grades), geography (ninth and tenth grades), and government/civics (eleventh grade) with elective courses in non-Western civilizations and economics (twelfth grade). This sequence was in response to the presumed problems of fragmentation and incoherence in the organization of content. The strength of this core curriculum includes the coherence and integration of its organization that contribute to comprehension and retention and its  balanced approach to content and cognitive processes that should contribute substantially to cultural literacy. The obvious weaknesses involve the omissions of science and technology as social forces, economics in history and government, the studies of non-Western cultures, and the insufficient flexibility in teaching methods. Critics of Bennett's proposal claimed that it did not consider the needs of the majority of students and its standards were unattainable while other critics opposed a curriculum that maintained and strengthened the idea (which they reject) of a common national culture. The appendix contains an overview of the four-year curriculum plan and descriptions of the social studies required courses. (DJC)",

        "description":"Given the content of the Reagan administration's New Federalism initiatives and their accompanying effects on Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments, the logical means of effectively continuing educational equity appear to rest with the states. A dozen states have enacted laws similar to Title IX, and more states are considering enactment of such laws. This paper summarizes the findings of the Project on State Title IX Laws (University of Southern California, Institute for the Study of Women and Men, Los Angeles, California) that studied the adoption of state Title IX laws, as well as the implementation of state sex equity policies and programs in relationships to New Federalism. The paper addresses the following questions: (1) what kinds of sex equity laws exist at the state  level; (2) how do states adopt and carry out sex equity laws?; (3) which factors determine the types of laws adopted by states?; (4) do state sex equity laws make a difference?; and (5) what is the prognosis on state sex equity action under the New Federalism? While the adoption and implementation of state Title IX laws may be the second wave for ensuring sex equity in education, the impact of these broad state laws will be limited unless there is also continued federal commitment in providing both statutory protection and financial assistance to states.

        "description":"This paper presented by the Quebec (Canada) Minister of Communications contends that until the 1900s the cultural essence of a particular western country was found in its folk-tales, folk-songs, and the daily activities of ordinary people. The growth of the electronic and mass media has industrialized popular culture, and large-scale passive consumption of the electronic media has displaced community-based religious ceremonies, amateur performances, and music halls as the heart of common cultural experiences. Technological advances have steadily improved the quality and accessibility of movies, music, and other cultural industries over the years and have promoted English as a universal language. While people in other cultures prefer domestically-produced programs, U.S. industries  are able to export films and television series at costs lower than other countries can produce domestic products. Consequently, U.S. culture is being forced on other cultures. The secularism and materialism of North American culture, however powerfully reinforced by mass media, are emphatically not the foundations of an emerging global culture by which other societies should be measured.

        "description":"One of the most significant challenges confronting college instructors who teach international politics survey courses is the coverage of current events issues and how to stimulate student interest about the issues. This paper describes two techniques, a current events sweepstakes and a Great Decisions roundtable, designed to infuse current events into the curriculum. Conducted on a weekly basis, the sweepstakes involves presenting to the students a general question relating to a newsworthy event which requires a written answer. The sweepstakes winner is selected randomly from the correct answers and awarded a simple prize such as a candy bar. A five- to ten-minute discussion about the event follows the award ceremony. The Great Decisions Roundtable, sponsored nationally by the  Foreign Policy Association, is designed to supplement the course curriculum and the &quot;Study Guide for the Roundtable&quot; serves as a required text. Scheduled approximately once every four weeks for an entire class period, the roundtable's underlying purpose is to give students an opportunity to exchange ideas and to articulate their own views with limited interference from the instructor. While the participating students rated the two techniques favorably, neither the sweepstakes nor the roundtable successfully motivated them to acquire additional information related to the issues. Four tables are included that reflect the cognitive impact, the instructional impact, and the motivational impact of these activities, as well as a breakdown of the responses by political science majors and  non-majors.

For the next three decades, job seekers in Mexico and other Caribbean countries will crowd into the labor market faster than the region's developing economics can absorb them.

The subjects, 43 males and 43 females who ran at the 1987 Ohio High School Cross Country Championships, responded to a questionnaire which requested information regarding academic achievement, family involvement in running, running experience, and reasons for running. Significant differences were found on a number of variables which classify an elite distance runner. These were academic achievement, sibling involvement in running, perceived effects of running, and motivation for running. The findings support a popular belief that elite distance runners are generally goal-oriented and run for reasons related to personal satisfaction. (Author/JD)",

The first section of the report concentrates on the national context for the movement toward teacher testing. Conflicting trends in education involving projected teacher shortages and concerns for improved teacher quality and professionalism are identified as some reasons for the current popularity of teacher testing. The second section of the report focuses on the five states: Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, and South Carolina. It highlights why these states decided to change certification requirements, as well as how they implemented new  testing programs with what consequences. Specific attention is paid to the impact the different kinds of tests have had on schools of education, the teacher supply, and the local school districts. Repercussions these changes have had on the overall state education system, especially in indicating power shifts in policymaking, are identified. These findings are discussed in terms of their implication for the wider issue of the development of the teaching profession. (Author/JD)",

The program integrated pedagogical content from empirical, experiential and theoretical perspectives. The rational for developing the progam was that in order to be considered as viable content for a teacher preparation program, the concept, principle or process must be: (1) related to student growth as revealed by empirical evidence; (2) identified as a necessary curricular component by expert opinion based on experience; or (3) logically explained by theory from social science and/or philosophy. Content maps and instructional models are presented along with course offerings. The results of the  observations completed for the evaluation are discussed in the areas of: (1) student achievement; (2) teaching practices; (3) reflective thinking about teaching; (4) collaboration between schools and university; and (5) recruitment and selection of interns.

Because a self-confidence scale is included on both entry and exit program surveys, it was possible to examine the ways in which self-confidence changes. When responding to items in the self-confidence scale, teacher candidates are asked to describe the level of confidence they have in their ability to perform 15 different teaching roles. The exit-level survey includes items focusing on career aspirations, personal goals in teaching, and  educational beliefs. Findings indicated that: (1) candidates with a high level of self-confidence at program completion thought in distinctly different ways about careers in teaching than those with low self-confidence; and (2) all students gained confidence over the course of the program. It is suggested that enhancing self-confidence alters the ways in which teaching candidates think about their roles as teachers. (JD)",

An analysis of the results suggested that teacher preparation programs have a limited influence on teachers' orientations and beliefs. This is attributed to: (1) a frequent lack of agreement among program faculty as the ways in which beliefs should be shaped; and/or (2) faculty's collective failure to challenge inappropriate prevailing  beliefs or to encourage students to form their own opinions on certain educational issues.

A total of 33 primary, 31 upper elementary, and 20 J/I/M (junior high/intermediate level/middle school level) teachers participated in the 8 focus groups (43 teachers discussed reading language arts, and 42 discussed the mathematics instructional system, with 4 groups of 8-12 participants discussing each of the areas). Questions addressed by the group concern problems that the curricula may have due to an overly  prescriptive orientation, heavy demands on teacher time, and lack of support for teachers in the form of staff training and assistance and materials. Group findings for the two curriculum program cover teachers' perceptions of the overall program, planning, testing, administrative supports, recordkeeping, and collaboration.

        "description":"Key results and conclusions from the first year (1986-87) of the Detroit (Michigan) Effective Schools Project are presented. The project was designed to determine how low-achieving schools in Detroit can best be helped and to ascertain factors with greatest impact on retention and achievement. Focus is on assisting selected schools designated as Chapter 1 schools under the provisions of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act, including eight elementary schools (Couzens, Herman, Hosmer, Ives, Keidan, Peck, Rose, and Stephens) and four middle schools (Earhart, Longfellow, Nobel, and Remus Robinson), by involving these schools in comprehensive self-study/needs assessment and improvement planning and implementation. The district's School Effectiveness Questionnaire was  administered, achievement data collected, a school profile created, and interviews conducted to insure input from parents. Findings indicate that: (1) special attention to schools has a positive impact on increasing staff morale; (2) school self-studies are key sources of information for assisting schools in assessing their own needs; (3) instructional programs lack the necessary link between thinking skills and basic learning skills; (4) remedial programs lack the necessary link to basic school programs; (5) teacher beliefs about students' capabilities and home backgrounds have an impact on student achievement; and (6) parents want more involvement in school decisions and activities. It is recommended that the project be continued and that it emphasize in-school activities focusing on  shared decision making, improving leader behaviors, instructional and classroom management, and congruency between remedial and basic school programs. Support is recommended from state, federal, and local entities. An appendix contains tables, figures and charts, the School Self-Study Instrument, and a review of the School Effectiveness Questionnaire. (TJH)",

        "description":"The implementation of the elementary magnet school program in Montgomery County (Maryland) from 1983 through 1985 and the racial balance changes experienced in these schools are discussed. Ten elementary schools in Area 1 and four of seven elementary schools in Area 2 operate magnet programs; these 14 schools comprise the study sample. The objectives of the study were to determine: (1) the extent to which magnet programs have been implemented in the schools as planned; (2) whether these programs stimulated increased participation in the programs through voluntary pupil transfers; (3) whether the resulting pupil transfers improved the racial balance of the schools in the magnet school cluster. School visits were conducted to examine program implementation in 1985. Montgomery  County Public School's &quot;Statistical Abstracts&quot; provided data on racial balance in the schools. A distinction is made between school minority composition and racial balance--the difference between the school's and the county's overall minority composition. Magnet programs included gifted and talented programs, and areas of concentration in the arts, mathematics and science, computer literacy, and foreign languages. Magnet programs were generally implemented as planned and did generate transfer requests. The racial balance of Area 2 schools improved to within Board of Education guidelines, although the magnet schools cannot be said to be the sole reason. In Area 1, the racial balance stabilized, but remained above the overall minority composition. The current program does have an impact on  the racial balance of magnet clusters. Strategies are discussed for increasing the pace of improvement. Overall demographic trends in the county are described. Findings on racial balance and magnet programs are tabulated and analyzed for each area, and the various alternatives are described. (SLD)",

The pilot program, implemented by the New York City Board of Education and the United Federation of Teachers, focused on increasing teacher effectiveness and teacher retention rate. The 1986-87 program was funded by the New York State Education Department's Office of Demonstration Programs. The participants included 42 mentors (teachers with at least 5 years of teaching experience in the New York City Public School system) and 73 interns from 23 schools in 13 community school districts in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. The study involved interviews with and surveys of participants  and fellow staff, participant logs, and on-site visits. Significant findings are reported in the areas of staff development, expectations and final impressions of participants and other staff, and student performance. As of June 30, 1987, the MTIP has been generally effective in meeting its objectives. It is recommended that: (1) a substitute recruitment program linked to the MTIP should be implemented; (2) teachers who substitute for mentors should be made an integral part of the mentor team; (3) mentor-intern confidentiality should be retained; (4) principals, mentors, and interns should be informed about the MTIP prior to the school year; (5) temporary per diem teachers should be included as interns; and (6) mentors should be provided with additional staff development support.

This 6-week, 75-hour test coaching program was developed to teach high-achieving students principles/strategies required for doing well on the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test (PSAT)/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test to increase the number of National Merit semifinalists and finalists. The TPPGTS emphasized language arts, mathematics, and guidance, and was conducted at the Lane, Lindblom, and Curie High Schools in Chicago, Illinois. Pretests and posttests were completed by 93 of the 148 enrollees; 72 of these took the October PSAT. The comparison group initially included 137; of these, 47 completed practice tests and 37 took the PSAT. There were nine teachers and  three teacher aides in the TPPGTS. Student and teacher questionnaires and classroom observations were analyzed concerning the degree to which summer program students outperformed the comparison group from pre- to posttest and whether this effect was attributable to the program. The TPPGTS appeared to be implemented as designed; an overall positive math program effect equivalent to 42 SAT points was found. Neither general nor site-specific verbal coaching effects were seen. Students were generally satisfied with the TPPGTS and thought they had learned effective strategies. Teachers noted the diversity of instructional materials and activities, and made recommendations for improving the program. (SLD)",

        "description":"A three-year longitudinal study of bilingual curriculum content (BCC) was initiated in the 1983-84 school year to assess alternative strategies for teaching curriculum content to Limited English Proficient (LEP) students in Dade County (Florida) Public Schools. The BCC strategy (in which content subjects are taught bilingually) was contrasted with a control strategy (in which students are taught in English). LEP kindergartners of Hispanic origin (Cohort I--52 BCC and 58 No-BCC) were followed through second grade. A follow-up group of first graders in 1984 (Cohort II--80 BCC and 58 No-BCC) was also studied. Six BCC and six No-BCC schools participated; six BCC and six No-BCC kindergarten teachers each were in Cohorts I and II. Implementation and survey data from teachers and  principals, and classroom observations were analyzed. Achievement test results for both cohorts showed no discrimination pattern of achievement between BCC and No-BCC students. Comparable academic progress in grades 1 and 2 was achieved with or without BCC. It is recommended that the program be substantially modified or replaced to change time allocations and teaching content. The program should also be evaluated in the intermediate grades. Appendices include the implementation instruments and surveys, the pilot project guidelines, and 15 tables of test results. (SLD)",

First, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, and an analysis of variance model adapted from multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) research, were used to examine the internal structure of the TSCS responses. Second, MTMM analyses were adapted to examine the convergent and discriminant validity of TSCS responses in relation to responses to the Self Description Questionnaire III and to the multidimensional self-concept ratings inferred by external observers. The subjects were 343 participants (aged from 16 to 37 years) in one of 9 Outward Bound courses offered in 1985 or 1986 at the University of Sydney (Australia). One-third of the subjects were full-time students,  and most of the others were employed full-time during the year prior to the course. Across all analyses there was consistent support for TSCS family, social, and physical scales, but less consistent support for other TSCS scales.

Three measurement approaches were employed: (1) sequential problem solving; (2) context-free assessment of fundamental skills and knowledge; and (3) constrained tasks. Computer administration was chosen for its advantages of: (1) dynamic control; (2) variable response mode; (3) capturing responses and scoring; and (4) test security. Disadvantages were considered to be outweighed by these aspects. The Diagnostic Achievement Tests consist of Part I, a computerized sequential problems test, and Part II, the Enabling Skills Test (an independent assessment of each skill).  Subtests are discussed briefly, and the 15-step process of test development is summarized. Special problems in the development of these specific tests are discussed, including excessive test length, glitches in the computer software, and flaws in the test orientation and approach to obtaining airmen's hypotheses about the locations of faults as they work through the problems. Since initial pilot testing was informative and supportive, validity studies will be done. Four figures support the process description. (SLD)",

Data came from item responses of four spaced samples of 1,000 examinees each--two samples of 1,000 Anglo-American and two samples of 1,000 Native American students taking the New Mexico High School Proficiency Examination in 1982. In addition, a matched group analysis was conducted using a third sample of 650 Native Americans and 650 Anglo Americans. The item characteristic curve area and the MH methods were used. The consistency of classification of items into biased and not-biased was in the 75 to 80% range for both methods. When the unreliability of item bias statistics was taken into account, both methods gave similar results. Discrepancies  between methods were due to bias from intersections of item characteristic curves and the choice of interval over which item bias was defined. The Mantel-Haenszel method, with a minor modification or two, provides an acceptable approximation to the item response theory based methods. Five data tables and eight graphs show study results.

The purpose of the present research was to evaluate the validity of logistic test models and computer simulation methods for providing a frame of reference for item bias statistic interpretations. Specifically, the intent was to produce simulated sampling distributions of item bias statistics under the hypothesis of no bias for use in determining cut-off points to provide guidelines for interpreting item bias statistics obtained with actual test data. The test data used were the item scores of 207 white and 730 black Cleveland (Illinois) ninth graders to the 75 items on the 1985 Cleveland Reading Competency Test. The area, root mean  squared difference, and Mantel-Haenszel methods were used to statistically analyze the data. The results support the basic data simulation approach used in this study. Real and simulated distribution for three item bias statistics when bias was not present were very similar and the minor differences that were found between the distributions had little effect on the interpretations of item bias statistics obtained with actual test data. Seven steps for applying the method of computer-simulated baseline statistics in test development settings are outlined. One data table and four graphs conclude the document. (Author/SLD)",

The type of training and background needed by evaluators are also considered. In response to the Educational Improvement Act of 1984 (South Carolina), principal improvement programs were initiated, requiring an evaluation model. The first task was to select criteria and performance indicators. Extensive discussion by a committee of educators and community representatives reduced the list to 25 indicators. The next task was identifying appropriate evidence for judging performance. Use of small groups helped build consensus. The model as constituted was  evaluated with a hypothetical case study. The process suggested that successful evaluators need diversified training and an understanding of evaluation in multiple contexts. Models that make sense to stakeholders should be used. The outlined model includes the dimensions of student achievement, leadership, staff supervision, community relations, and personal development. (SLD)",

Structural equation models, using LISREL, were fit to data from the High School and Beyond (HSB) study. Subjects were the 14,825 respondents selected for the second follow-up of the sophomore cohort of the HSB study (N=5,000 was used for purposes of statistical significance testing). The results show a remarkable content specificity of math and English anxieties; despite the substantial correlation between math and verbal test scores, math and English anxieties were nearly uncorrelated. As predicted by the I/E model, better  math skills were related to substantially lower math anxiety but slightly higher English anxiety, whereas better English skills were related to substantially lower English anxiety but slightly higher math anxiety. Stereotypic sex differences were observed (women had higher math anxiety scores whereas men had higher English anxiety scores), and these differences remained after controlling for the small sex differences in the achievement tests. The results strongly support the usefulness of separating math and English anxieties, and add to a growing body of research arguing for the content specificity of many academic affects. Four tables are provided. (Author/TJH)",

The present study unites these two related research areas, and extends the diversity of outcomes and the theoretical frameworks considered. In a longitudinal analysis of High School and Beyond (HSB) data, the effect of SAA on a comprehensive set of academic outcomes (e.g., standardized test scores, ASC, course-work selection, academic effort, school grades, educational and occupational aspirations, and college attendance) was measured in the sophomore and senior years of high school and 2 years  after high school graduation. The subjects included 10,613 respondents selected for the second follow-up of the sophomore cohort of the HSB study; all attended the same high school as sophomores and seniors. For the purposes of statistical testing, a sample size of 4,000 was used. The influence of SAA was not positive for any of the outcomes at any time and was moderately negative for some. The academic outcomes related to higher-ability schools were not commensurate with the ability levels of students attending these schools, and no academic advantages of such schools were observed for any outcomes. The negative effects of SAA were primarily mediated by ASC and educational aspirations.

        "description":"This newsletter is part of an effort to improve mastery of the Texas Educational Assessment of Minimum Skills (TEAMS). Responses of teachers to a survey in the Spring of 1987 concerning their beliefs and facts about the TEAMS are reported, along with clarifying facts about this criterion referenced test. Teaching to the TEAMS is advisable because it is part of a program intended to promote test-driven instruction on skills all students should know. Results of the Austin (Texas) Independent School District (AISD) show that AISD students scored higher on the 1987 TEAMS than on the 1986 test, although gains were not as large as those made by students in other urban Texas districts. On exit-level TEAMS, AISD has ranked number 1 since 1985, with 99.4% of students passing both areas of  the tests and fulfilling requirements for graduation. Performance of educationally disadvantaged (Chapter 1) students in grade 3, English TEAMS data for limited English proficient students in grades 1 through 9, and Spanish TEAMS data for grades 1 and 3 are outlined. A summary is given of ways to prepare students for the TEAMS. Seven graphs are included. (SLD)",

The four secondary campuses involved were those with the highest concentrations of Hispanic LEP students--Martin Junior High and Travis, Anderson, and Johnston High Schools. Title VII provided staff training, student tutoring, curriculum development, and parent/family training. In 1987-1988, a total of 233 LEP students were enrolled in these schools, while over the 3 years of the project, 33 Title VII teachers took one or more courses leading to ESL-endorsement certification. In addition, between 1986 and 1988, 16 workshops were held  for parents/families of LEP students. Title VII in combination with other AISD programs appeared to have a positive impact over 3 years as English proficiency improved steadily across time and students narrowed the gaps between their performance and national norms in mathematics and language, although not in social studies, reading, or science. Spanish achievement improved in all subjects. Title VII students had lower retention rates, higher grade point averages, and more course credits than did other LEP students. Results for the single year 1987-88 were more mixed, but still positive, although the tutoring program was not considered effective. Long-term results show Title VII to be working, in combination with other AISD programs. Nineteen graphs and tables provide study data.  (SLD)",

        "description":"The Austin (Texas) Independent School District's (AISD) programs that were developed as alternatives to retention in grade for low-achieving students were studied. The AISD had 19 elementary transition classes (all-day classes, language arts, and language arts/mathematics) in 17 schools for 282 first and second graders in 1987-88. The Transitional Academic Program (TAP) was evaluated and compared with an Academic Incentive Program (AIP). The TAP is designed for retainees and potential retainees at the secondary level (primarily eighth graders) and allows them to enroll in ninth grade work while repeating eighth grade courses that they had failed. The TAP has served 494 students since its beginning in fall, 1986. Data were collected primarily by analysis of achievement gains on  the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills; surveys of elementary school principals, seven TAP administrators, and 100 TAP students were also conducted. Grade point averages (GPAs), percentages of students passing all coursework, dropout rates, and the number of classes failed for TAP students compared unfavorably with those repeating the full year. Low achievers who took part in the transitional first grade and who were then placed in grade 2 showed the best overall achievement. Dropout rates were lower and GPAs were higher for AIP students than for TAP students. Transition classes were beneficial at grades 1 and 2, but secondary transitional students did not fare well (perhaps since TAP students change schools often). Twenty-eight graphs and data tables are included. (SLD)",

Under the rule, enacted in 1985, a student must pass every course (with an average of at least 70) or sit out extracurricular activities in the next 6-week grading period. Focus is on the rule's impact on high school students in the Austin (Texas) Independent School District. Selected student data for the school years between 1982 and 1988 are provided. Students did fail fewer courses under the new rule, particularly in the fall semester. The decline in failure was greater for those participating in extracurriculars. Overall, the dropout rate did not increase, although there was a possible increase  for those participating in varsity sports. Enrollments in honors courses did not decline under the new rule. Students agreed that the rule encouraged them to make better grades. On balance, the new rule appears to have had a positive effect. Since many other changes were implemented at the same time, it is difficult to be sure that these changes are attributable to no pass/no play, but there are no evident negative effects in the areas of course enrollments and overall dropout rates.

Four conditions are necessary for the effective use of evaluation information: (1) real need; (2) trust in the evaluators and in the information provided; (3) understanding of the information; and (4) practice in using such information. In considering the use of testing and evaluation information, the level of preparation of the data and the ultimate use of the information must be determined. Examples of evaluation information as used are appended, including a discussion of the &quot;Report on School Effectiveness&quot; of the Austin Independent School District, three school profiles on  context variables related to general outcome variables, and an outline of effective school standards.

Mean achievement scores were obtained for each year between spring 1981 and spring 1986 for the two groups and compared to the national average. Regression analyses were used to compare the achievement progress of the two groups. In all, 183 of the first-grade retainees and 184 of the matched sample were retained between grades 4 and 7. Since almost 40% of the comparison group was eventually retained in some grade, separate analyses were made to compare those retained in grade 1 versus those retained in later grades. Those retained in grade 1 were more likely to be placed in special education later. In both reading and  mathematics, those promoted showed higher gains than did retainees, and the differences broadened across the years. Additional adverse effects were not generally seen for retention in later grades. Results suggest that retention did not help students catch up to grade level. It is suggested that placement with special help is a better alternative than retention for most low achievers. (SLD)",

In one study, limited English proficient (LEP) students attending AISD kindergartens in 1981-82, 1982-83, and 1983-84 were followed to see if those who attended pre-K showed an advantage over those who did not in terms of achievement, retention, special education referrals, and LEP status. The AISD had 260 LEP kindergartners in 1981-82; 195 did not and 65 did attend pre-K. There was no consistent evidence of fewer retentions, lower rates of special education placement, or higher exit rates among the children attending pre-K. Long-term achievement of these pre-K students was not better. It is difficult to see why more  positive effects were not seen for this pre-K program, but explanations may lie in the amount of time spent in instruction in English and Spanish. A second approach compared pre-K students from educationally disadvantaged and LEP groups with other students in the AISD at the same grade levels. Difficulties in finding an adequate comparison group limited the usefulness of conclusions. The importance of evaluating the effectiveness of pre-K programs makes better follow-ups imperative. A table showing scores of pre-K versus no pre-K LEP kindergarten students in reading, language and math is attached. (SLD)",

Twenty examples cover apparent paradoxes and contradictions in the reporting of evaluation findings. These are generally problems of wording, problems that often have seemed too frivolous for textbook consideration. Evaluation findings are seldom simple and straightforward. Reporting them requires a practical communication style that is focused on the intended audience. The key to describing an  evaluation question is understanding and addressing the question that is being asked. As obvious as this seems, some reports never directly answer the question that was to be addressed. (SLD)",

In all, 282,155 essays were scored at four regional sites by 290 teachers; this number includes some papers double scored in a reliability study. About 99% of the students had responded to a topic. Scoring considered rhetorical effectiveness, a feature score about some characteristic (such as coherence), and a conventions score for mechanics. Most students wrote adequate or marginally adequate essays (68%), some wrote exceptionally well (13%),  and others wrote poorly (19%). Eighth graders were most competent at reporting information, less competent at writing autobiographies, and least able to produce the two types of persuasive writing. Control of the conventions was better than of rhetorical strategies. Recommendations for teachers begin with encouraging more direct writing instruction and more analysis of what is read. Recommendations for school administrators, parents, and teacher educators are included. (SLD)",

The questionnaire assessed the primary purposes of evaluation, the procedures used in the subjects' school systems, and the perceived strengths and weaknesses of the systems. Both teachers and administrators agreed that the primary goal of evaluation was improvement in the teacher's classroom performance. Chi-square analysis of the results showed significant differences between principals and teachers when evaluation was used for contract renewal or termination. There were statistically significant correlations between the number of years of teaching and willingness to participate in  pre- and postobservation conferences. The worst aspects of evaluation seen by teachers were: (1) principal bias; (2) inconsistency; (3) subjectivity; and (4) focus on trivial issues. Principals wanted more time for observations. The best features of the evaluation systems were a non-threatening attitude of the principal and the use of pre- and postobservation conferences. A demographic summary of teachers and administrators, and correlations between study sample's years of experience/gender and survey questions are appended. (Author/SLD)",

It is a supplementary mathematics program applying Socratic discovery method to mathematics instruction. The program's implementation was evaluated, and information about student attitudes was collected to supplement student achievement data. Each year, participation ranged from 5 to 24 weeks. Classroom instructors gave up one-fourth of their instructional time to SEED specialists. Although SEED instruction doubled time for mathematics, achievement was not notable, with gains comparable among SEED and  non-SEED students. The responses of 68 fifth and 29 fourth graders show that both groups enjoyed the SEED experience. Their responses about math were more positive than were those of non-participants. All 8 principals were interviewed in both years. Of the 18 teachers sampled, 16 in 1986-87 and 15 in 1987-88 were interviewed. Administrators and teachers expressed concern about the lack of integration of SEED with the regular curriculum. Follow-up of 420 SEED graduates indicated that a smaller proportion of them participated in advanced programs in middle school. Outcome data warranted neither expansion nor continuation of the program. Data are presented in three tables. Principal, teacher, and student questionnaires; achievement graphs; and an observation checklist are appended.  (SLD)",

Variables studied were: (1) respondent age; (2) ethnicity; (3) gender; (4) educational level reported by parents; and (5) agreement between parent and child on background items.

No consistent pattern of agreement results was related to ethnicity. Girls appeared more accurate in reporting their parents' educational levels. Data were inconsistent about the relationship of parental educational level and accuracy of the child in determining parental level. Students were most accurate in reporting items they knew about directly. These analyses indicate that data from young children may misrepresent important demographic factors.

Research on means of student assessment procedures for Grade 13 examinations was initiated in 1986. Since then, student assessment has been conducted by experienced teachers. This study focused on whether teachers were assigning course marks that were comparable in terms of curricular emphasis, the kinds of evidence collected about student achievement, criteria used by teachers to assess evidence, and marking standards. The grade 13 (pre-university) calculus course is successfully completed by 30,000 Ontario students each year. After a  pilot study during the fall semester of the 1986-87 school year, a spring semester main study was conducted, followed by a study of marking standards during the fall of 1987-88. Activity logs, supplemental teaching materials, assessment instruments, marked examination papers, and final mark records were reviewed. Examinations and term tests were the main determinants of student grades. Results show: wide variations across teachers in allocation of classroom time to various activities; substantial differences in content emphasis; substantial agreement among the teachers as to the relative importance of examination questions and relative quality of 20 sample student papers; and substantial disagreement among the teachers as to the absolute quality of the student papers.

This study was designed to replicate the pilot study and test the hypotheses based on that study. The test materials used were the English Usage and Mathematics Usage tests of the American College Testing Program Assessment. It was hypothesized that: (1) items that emphasize mechanics in the English Usage Test, such as grammar and punctuation, tend to favor ESL examinees; (2) items that focus upon style and structure in the English Usage Test tend to favor non-ESL students; and (3) mathematical items with the greatest verbal load tend to favor non-ESL  examinees. Subjects included 471 Mexican-American ESL students and 1,000 White native speakers (non-ESL). Results indicate that none of the three hypotheses was supported. Although the mean score for the ESL students was almost a full standard deviation below that of the native speakers for both tests, it appears that the group difference in performance was reflected throughout most of the test items. Specific categories of items that were disproportionately easy or hard for either of the groups could not be found. Six graphs and four tables conclude the document. (TJH)",

The purposeful application of individual past experiences is valuable to the reform effort in that it taps a vital resource of individual knowledge and suggests a way of bridging the chasm between the worlds of practice and individual experience and that of theory. The philosophy of J. Dewey and the work of R. S. Usher are used extensively to support this thesis. The notion of knowledge and learning as a transformation of experience is discussed, and the processes of reflection as mediators of individual experiences are addressed. The key concern of the paper is how to convince professors and, in turn, their students that  individual experiences and biographies have worth beyond the anecdotal illumination of extant theories in the area of educational administration. A model depicting the interaction of reflective skills, conceptions of learning and knowledge, educational tasks and assessment, and use of experience is outlined. (TJH)",

        "author":["Kingston, Neal M."],
        "description":"In October 1981, the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) Program introduced a new version of the General Test (GT) that differed from the previous version in three major ways. The GT was altered to: reduce the verbal measure's speededness and allow the addition of several quantitative items; delete two item types from the analytical measure; and replace formula scoring with rights scoring. The GRE instructions were changed to advise examinees to answer all questions. An anchor test design was used to equate verbal and quantitative measures. Focus was on determining what effects these changes and/or the equating (in the case of the verbal and quantitative measures) or the scaling (in the case of the analytical measure) had on the three GRE GT score scales--verbal, quantitative, and  analytical. These changes could be manifested as either shifts in the score scales or changes in the constructs underlying the scales. Data were from a self-selected group of GRE examinees who took the GT for the first time between October 1980 and April 1982 and at least one additional time by June 1982. A total of 5,072 GRE examinees took the old version at least twice, and 2,353 took the old version first and then the new version. The 1981 changes had a small effect on the verbal score scale and a somewhat greater effect on the quantitative scale; these changes are attributed to a shift in the dimensionality of the factors underlying these measures. The effect on the analytical scale was quite large. Five data tables and three graphs conclude the document. (TJH)",

These issues include selecting and assessing the appropriateness of IRT models, choosing methods of IRT scaling for item pools, considering test scoring strategies, and applying IRT tools within the context of different test scoring strategies. Since all items currently used in ETS testing programs are scored either right or wrong, this paper deals only with models for binary-scored items and focuses on unidimensional models. Use of IRT tools with theta-hat, number-right or formula, and scaled scoring methods is addressed. The following test development steps are listed: (1) collect pretest data; (2) select an  IRT model; (3) assess the IRT model's appropriateness; (4) place all item parameters on a single scale; (5) choose IRT tools appropriate for the test scoring method used; (6) develop one or more forms of the test; and (7) assess the test development effort's success.

The accuracy of five background characteristics, nine extracurricular activities, and 15 special accomplishments reported by students completing the ACT Assessment Student Profile Section was examined. Data were collected on 477 students, who took the ACT Assessment in February or April of 1986, enrolled at 67 high schools. The students' responses were compared with the responses of high school staff to a questionnaire concerning student demographic data. Student response data were classified as congruent with school information, incongruent with school information, or incomplete. It was found  that students generally reported such data with a high degree of accuracy. The typical rate of incongruent responses when school- and student-reported data were compared was about 10%; of this 10%, only about 6% of the students claimed credit for an activity or accomplishment that the school did not confirm. These results suggest that, for most purposes, colleges can be fairly confident that the reports of activities and accomplishments provided on students' ACT assessment records are accurate.

        "description":"The High School Course/Grade Information Section (CGIS) of the American College Testing (ACT) Assessment registration folder collects detailed information about the courses students have taken or plan to take in high school, and the grades they have earned in courses they have completed. In this study, data provided by students on the CGIS were compared with corresponding information from their high school transcripts. Indices of concordance between these two sources were computed concerning 30 courses and grades. Data were obtained from 1,074 students who took the ACT Assessment during the 1985-86 school year. Using criteria developed for the study, it was found that for the typical course, about 10% of the students provided no information, about 87% of the students' statements  with respect to whether they took the course could be presumed to agree with their transcripts, and about 3% of the students' statements were inconsistent with information on their transcripts. Of the students who provided no information about a course, most, according to school records, had not taken the course. Among students who reported grades for a course, the typical rate of exact agreement between student-reported and transcript grades was 71%. About 97% of the students reported grades that were within one letter grade of the corresponding transcript grades. The CGIS; descriptions of the sample design, selection, weighting, and representativeness; coding forms used in extracting data from high school transcripts; and further comparisons between student-reported and transcript data  are appended. Twelve data tables are included. (Author/TJH)",

        "author":["Sawyer, Richard"],
        "description":"This report addresses the problem of sample size in developing prediction equations for college freshman grade averages under the American College Testing (ACT) Assessment Program. For the ACT Assessment, the prediction weights are estimated by standard least squares procedures. Because prediction weights are estimated regression coefficients whose accuracy depends on the size of the base sample used to estimate them and because error in estimating the weights propagates error in prediction, sample size affects prediction accuracy. This issue is examined from both theoretical and empirical viewpoints. The expectation that total group predictions based on 50 or more cases and eight or fewer predictor variables have nearly the same accuracy as predictions based on larger samples is  supported. Moreover, two-variable prediction equations based on as few as 20-29 cases would have essentially the same accuracy as prediction equations based on larger samples. On the other hand, the results from separate-sex prediction equations strongly suggest that eight-variable prediction equations based on much fewer than 50 cases would be noticeably less accurate. Four data tables are provided. (TJH)",

        "description":"This paper describes the efforts of the Talent Identification Program (TIP) of North Carolina to relate American College Testing (ACT) Assessment and Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores of academically talented seventh graders. The study was also designed to interpret the results in the context of &quot;concordance&quot; studies that have been done with other groups of students. The target population for the central study consisted of students who applied to the TIP during the 1986-87 talent search by taking the SAT in December 1986 or January 1987. A stratified random sample of 2,042 applicants was invited to take the ACT Assessment on the April 1987 test date. Results from the 611 students who responded to the invitation indicate that the ACT Composite and SAT Total scores are nearly  as strongly related among academically talented seventh graders as they are among college-bound high school students. However, the English Usage/Verbal and Mathematics Usage/Mathematics components of the two test batteries measure different characteristics of academically talented young students, and these characteristics are developed to relatively different extents than they are among high school students. The results illustrate the tendency of conversion tables for non-parallel tests to differ among various subgroups. (TJH)",

The FEFT has a multiple-choice format that may facilitate administration and scoring in comparison with use of supply-format tests such as the Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT). Analysis was based on data provided by 302 students enrolled in mathematics courses at a university in the southern United States. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: (1) GEFT and Form A FEFT (n=70); (2) GEFT and Form B FEFT (n=77); (3) Form A FEFT completion followed by Form B (n=76); and (4) Form B FEFT completion followed by Form A (n=79). Results suggest that  the FEFT forms provide data with reasonable psychometric integrity.

These coalitions should focus on achieving the following goals: (1) prevention through early intervention, particularly with preschool children and teenagers at risk; (2) restructuring the foundations of education; and (3)  retention and reentry programs for dropouts and students at risk.

The black poverty rate rose significantly in 1987, from 31.1 percent to 33.1 percent; the white poverty rate fell from 11 percent to 10.5 percent. The poverty rate for black children under age 18 reached 45.6 percent; for those under age six the poverty rate reached 49 percent. Black female-headed families are four times more likely to be poor as black married-couple families. Increases in poverty have been especially sharp among young families, among those without a college education, and among blacks in the Midwest. The black poverty rate has been higher under the Reagan Administration than under its predecessors. Not only have black poverty rates risen, but those black households that are poor  have fallen deeper into poverty. The median income of the black family was stagnant in 1987, while that of the white family rose. Income disparities between black and white families have grown since the late 1970s in all regions of the country except the West, but most acutely in the Midwest. In 1987 the gap between upper and lower income families in the nation reached its widest point in 40 years; this is true also within the black community. While black unemployment has declined markedly during the current economic recovery, it has fallen less than has white unemployment, and the gap between black and white unemployment rates has widened. The federal budget reductions in programs for people with low incomes disproportionately affected blacks, and are probably linked to the increases in  black poverty, especially among families with children. Tables and figures illustrate the data. An appendix reviews the declining impact of government benefit programs in removing black families from poverty. (BJV)",

Poor and minority parents have complained that the schools are not run to benefit their children; educators complain that the parents of those students who tend to be the lowest achievers are so burdened by their own lives that they are of little help. Efforts must be made  to decrease parent alienation and to strengthen the parent school relationship. Some analysts suggest that the home and the school must be supported by wider cooperative arrangements with community organizations. A four-page list of references is included. (FMW)",

The M and M program is designed to provide a case management approach to the problems of at-risk students in high schools and their feeder elementary and middle schools. Students receive the services of outreach consultants who work with students, their parents, and community businesses and agencies to provide tutoring, medical care, shelter, and clothing. The consultants also work to develop donations of goods and services to use as incentives for tudents. The Partnership Academy is a 3-year  senior high school-within-a-school model, emphasizing basic skills, career instruction and summer work experience. Business support for the program is developed in diverse career areas. STEP is focused on at-risk 14- and 15-year olds. It offers a combination of work, remedial education, and life skills instruction during the summer, as well as school year counseling and support services. Contact information is included. (FMW)",

The subjects were 164 students enrolled in eight sections of an introductory elementary education course at a state university. Three sections were selected to be administered the simulation; five sections served as a control group. All students were administered two racial attitude measures as pre- and post-tests. After participating in the simulation, students described their feelings about the experience both in writing and in an hour-long debriefing session. Outcomes include the following: (1) all subjects reported that the experience was meaningful; (2) statistical analysis  of pre- and post-test results showed moderate prejudice reduction; and (3) all participants reported stress from the simulation. An attempt to measure long-term behavior change, using a mail solicitation one year later, was inconclusive.

Findings include the following: (1) older Blacks are the poorest of the poor among the elderly; (2) older Blacks suffer more intense health care problems than other Americans; (3) older Blacks have suffered from recent federal budgetary cuts; (4) older Blacks are more likely to inhabit unsuitable housing; (5) older Blacks are more likely to be the victims of crime; and (6) older Blacks are underrepresented in Older Americans Act and other  service programs. Key recommendations include the following: (1) reform the Federal Supplemental Security Income standards; (2) establish a mandatory pension system; (3) resist further attempts to cut Medicare and Medicaid coverage; (4) encourage preventive medicine; (5) enact a universal, comprehensive national health insurance program; (6) develop a more balanced method of reducing the Federal deficit; (7) repeal the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Amendment; (8) provide additional housing units for the elderly; (9) combat crime with preventive techniques; and (10) encourage minority elderly to participate in programs of the Older Americans Act.

        "description":"Most economists agree that the difficulties of targeting minimum wage increases to low-income families make such increases ineffective tools for reducing poverty. This paper provides estimates of the impact of minimum wage increases on the poverty gap and the number of poor families, and shows which factors are barriers to decreasing poverty through minimum wage increases. A model was developed for simulating the poverty reducing effects of minimum wage increases using wage, employment, hours, and poverty status data from the March 1987 Current Population Survey. Findings indicate that an increase of the minimum wage to $4.35 per hour has a much larger poverty reducing effect than previous research suggests. If accompanied by full coverage and compliance, such an increase would  reduce the poverty gap by 13 percent, and the number of poor families with low-wage workers would decrease by nine percent. However, the resulting unemployment of some workers could reduce the poverty-reducing effects. Ten tables of statistical data are included. The appendix contains two additional tables showing a sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in the minimum wage, with full coverage and compliance, and with the coverage and compliance unchanged.

The initial phase of the project commissioned research papers which were reviewed and discussed at a symposium by members of the legal and advocacy communities. The outcome of the symposium was a shift in emphasis away from residential mobility as a solution to urban minority problems, toward a more balanced policy and research approach emphasizing improved education, employment, and housing opportunities in central cities. The first part of this report synthesizes the findings and policy recommendations contained in the  following commissioned papers: (1) \"Minorities in Suburbia\" (Eunice and George Grier); (2) Metropolitan Housing Opportunities for Poor and Working Class Minorities\" (Margery Austin Turner; Douglas B. Page); (3) \"Segregated Housing, Educational Inequality, and the Possibility of Urban Integration\" (Gary Orfield); (4) \"Spatial Mobility, Minority Class Structure, and the Urban Underclass\" (Douglas B. Page); (5) \"Metropolitan Decentralization, Transit Dependence, and the Employment Isolation of Central City Black Workers\" (Yale Rabin); and (6) \"The Economic Performance of Minorities in National and Urban Labor Markets\" (Wayne Vroman). The second part of the report outlines a research agenda based on these papers which supports a general strategy for expanding opportunities for minorities in  urban areas. An extensive bibliography is organized according to the following topics: (1) Education; (2) Transportation; (3) Urban Economic/Employment Patterns; (4) Urban Residential Patterns; (5) Minority Income and Class Structure; (6) Policy and Legal.

The welfare system, through the explicit and implicit shelter allowances that welfare recipients receive as part of their public assistance benefits, spends at least $10 billion a year on housing assistance. The Department of Housing and Urban Development spends a similar amount. Yet, the two streams of government financing for low income housing are uncoordinated and frequently overlapping. Part 1 presents new evidence on both the nature and the impact of this two-pronged approach to providing shelter assistance to the poor. It compares the level of benefits available to households receiving various combinations of aid, and documents the housing outcomes that are produced by the two systems of  shelter support. It includes the following chapters: (1) Executive Summary; (2) Introduction; (3) Shelter Allowances Under the Welfare System; (4) The Impact of the Two-Pronged System; and (5) Directions for Future Policy. Part 2 presents detailed statistics on estimated shelter allowances for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia under the following programs: (1) Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC); (2) Supplemental Security Income (SSI); and (3) General Assistance (GA).

        "description":"This paper compares the characteristics of those experiencing short spells of low income with those having longer spells. Data from the 1984 panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) was examined. It was found that short spells--less than six months--are quite common, and make up a substantial proportion of all poverty spells. About 30 percent of the population as a whole has at least one month with an income of less than the poverty level (adjusted to a monthly basis) over an observable period of 16 months. About half of those entering poverty leave within the first three months, and about 80 percent leave within six months. The probability of leaving poverty was highly related to the probability that someone in the family would begin earning again in the  near future. Specifically, families with a member who had recently become unemployed were particularly likely to leave poverty quickly, since most unemployed persons with previous earnings find re-employment fairly rapidly. Conversely, those who were less likely to have earnings in the recent past--female-headed families (especially with children) and the elderly--were more likely to have longer spells of poverty. Those seen to be poor on a cross-sectional basis contained a larger proportion of longer-spell cases than did the cohort of poverty entrants, although even those poor on a cross-sectional basis were in the midst of a spell that lasted less than six months. Age and racial differences in poverty duration are discussed. Data are presented on nine tables. A list of references is  included. (BJV)",

        "description":"A review of the literature on residential segregation reveals that Blacks remain the most segregated group in American cities, despite the more recent arrival of Hispanic and Asian groups. By one measure--the index of dissimilarity with respect to Whites--Blacks are 1.6 times more segregated than Hispanics, and twice as segregated as Asians. Race is a far stronger correlate of residential segregation than cultural or ethnic differences. The segregation of blacks showed little improvement--and perhaps worsened--during the 1960s, despite heightened awareness and activity from civil rights activity. Substantial improvement during the 1970s offset this deterioration and left the nation's cities marginally less segregated in 1980 than in 1960. Researchers express conflicting opinions  on the importance of black suburbanization in reducing measurable segregation. In general, large, slow-growing cities with large existing minority populations exhibit the most segregated residential patterns. The North Central region of the country consistently shows the highest levels of segregation and the least encouraging signs of improvement. Implications for future research are discussed. Data are presented on four tables and figures. A list of 39 references is included. (BJV)",

All levels of education from pre-kindergarten through graduate education must be involved in designing and making such programs work. Education is the key element that can enable minorities to overcome conditions of racism and poverty and to better their lives. The numbers of minority students enrolled at each successive level of education from elementary through postgraduate have been continually decreasing. The following issues are examined to demonstrate the importance of minority education: Minorities are a growing portion of the population of Illinois; minorities are underrepresented in the work force; the success of the  work force in meeting the demands of the market depends upon the success of people in completing high school and programs beyond high school. An overview of minorities in elementary, secondary, and higher education in Illinois is provided. The following recommendations for action are offered: (1) make minority student achievement a priority in Illinois; (2) provide support programs early and throughout education; (3) promote change in the school/campus environment for minority students; (4) promote increasing the employment of minority teaching and administrative personnel; and (5) monitor programs and student progress closely. A list of references is provided. Statistical data on the population of Illinois, school enrollment, and education requirements of the labor market are appended.  (BJV)",

        "description":"A cost effectiveness study by the Austin (Texas) Independent School District of its elementary compensatory reading programs, namely, the Chapter 1 Reading Improvement Program (Chapter 1 Regular) and Schoolwide Projects (SWP), found that the Schoolwide Projects cost two to three times as much to achieve the same gains in student achievement as did the Chapter 1 Regular program. Both programs are funded by the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act Chapter 1. Both programs measure improvement in reading skills with the Iowa Test of Basic Skills. The programs differ in the way that instruction is delivered. Chapter 1 students receive supplementary instruction from a reading specialist. SWP students receive all of their instruction in a classroom with students of mixed  achievement levels, but where the pupil-teacher ratio has been reduced to 15-to-1. To measure achievement gains, percentiles were converted to Normal Curve Equivalents (NCE) and students' pre-test scores were compared to their post-test scores. Only teachers' salaries were used as the program cost. The cost per student was divided by the average NCE gain to obtain a cost-effectiveness figure that translates into dollars per NCE gain for each program for each year of implementation.

The ND Program is designed to provide classroom and tutorial services in language development and mathematics for pupils in eligible facilities for the neglected and delinquent. During the 1987-88 school year, there was one full-time ND reading teacher at Rosemont School and 10 part-time tutors providing services in 8 other institutions. Evaluation was based on the number of pupils served and the length of that service. Major findings include the following: (1) a total of 150  pupils were served for an average of 3.5 hours of instruction per week; (2) 17 pupils were in grades 1 through 5, and 133 pupils were in grades 6 through 12; (3) average daily membership was 52.7; (4) average days of enrollment per pupil was 43.2; (5) average days of attendance per pupil was 30.2; (6) pupil mobility was very high due to varying lengths of time assigned to the institutional facilities served; (7) 45 pupils were females, and 105 were males; (8) 83 pupils were non-minority, 63 were Black, two were Hispanic, and two were Oriental; and (9) minorities composed 44.7 percent of the pupils served.

The framework was developed from a literature search on program evaluation methods and their use, the experiences of the United States Government Accounting Office (GAO), and consideration of the types of information required to make a variety of program decisions. The framework consists of a descriptive component and an evaluative component. The descriptive component is a standard format for describing the program. The evaluative component consists of a set of ten general criteria to assess the program's need, implementation, administrative efficiency, and effects. Details that specify particular program expectations would have to be  enumerated for each criterion when the framework is applied to an individual program. To test the applicability of the framework, it was applied to the following programs: (1) Head Start; (2) the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); (3) Medicaid Eligibility Extensions; (4) Child Welfare Services Program; and (5) Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Grants. Program descriptions and lists of evaluation criteria developed for each of these programs using the framework are included in six appendices. Experts reviewed drafts of the framework, the program descriptions, and evaluation criteria illustrations. Using the framework to evaluate a program will require both policy-making and technical expertise. (FMW)",

Despite gains in the number of blacks who found housing in the suburbs in the 1970s, the great majority of metropolitan blacks (71 percent) remain concentrated in the central cities of the largest Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas, and their number is increasing as a proportion of the population. While whites have steadily migrated from the cities to the suburbs, blacks have steadily moved from the suburbs to the cities. Since World War II, employment, particularly blue collar employment, has left the central  cities for suburban locations along regional highway networks. During the past 40 years, nearly two out of every three new jobs created have been in the suburbs of metropolitan areas, and most are not accessible by public transportation. These dramatic changes in the distribution of the population have profoundly altered patterns of access, and have produced increasing isolation among those without access to an automobile. In this group, blacks are greatly overrepresented. A list of 45 references is included. Extensive statistical data are included on 13 tables. (FMW)",

The program was originally implemented in grades 6-12, with a special focus on six middle schools. The goals are the following: (1) develop a comprehensive drug and alcohol prevention counseling program and materials; and (2) promote cooperative prevention partnerships among administration, staff, parents, public/private agencies, and community leaders. The two components of the plan consist of direct services to six middle schools, and district-wide technical assistance to improve the quality of services and support groups. Services are targeted to students who are  themselves substance abusers or who are children of alcoholics or drug-affected families, and to at-risk students. Evaluation methods included a Stages of Concern questionnaire for facilitators, observation of support groups, and interviews with project staff and school administrators. The findings of the evaluation include suggestions for improving some areas of the program. Statistical data are included on twelve tables and three graphs. A brief bibliography is also included. The appendices include the following: (1) Risk Factors for Substance Abuse; (2) Stages of Concern Questionnaire; (3) School Counselor Alcohol/Drug Interview Questionnaire Summary Responses; (4) Parent Contact Log and Agency Contact Log; and (5) Alcohol/Drug Discipline Policies.

        "description":"Project Literacy U.S. (PLUS) combines national network television and radio broadcasts with community action, alerting the public to the urgency of the adult illiteracy problem and helping to mobilize efforts to deal with it in towns and cities across the United States. All 525 affiliate and member stations of the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) take part by airing programs, referring member stations take part by airing programs, referring individuals to local programs of instruction, and otherwise giving assistance to individuals and groups in their communities. The PLUS initiative is conducted in two phases. The first, in process since January 1986, is focused on building an outreach infrastructure via the local ABC and PBS  stations. The second, on-the-air coverage, operated throughout the September 1986-June 1987 broadcast season. The PLUS campaign overlaps, and works in cooperation with, the national multimedia campaign begun in January 1985 by the Coalition for Literacy and the Advertising Council. In some states, special television projects are in progress that will serve to reinforce the PLUS and Advertising Council efforts. However, short-run success in raising public awareness could ultimately result in failure, unless public and private sector funding sources can respond quickly with substantial new monies to support and nurture the new activities that will be generated.

        "description":"Illiteracy is an alarming national problem. An estimated 27 million Americans are considered illiterate, and another 45 million are considered marginally competent in basic skills. Although literacy efforts have been increasing, little attention has been focused on women. This oversight could be costly. Four critical factors weigh heavily in favor of the needs of literacy education for women: (1) the economic jeopardy of poorly educated women and the families they head; (2) the cycle of illiteracy; (3) increased labor force participation of women; and (4) family needs. Illiteracy is increasingly linked to America's deepest problems: teenage pregnancy, crime, chronic unemployment, long-term welfare dependency, and poverty. Each year the lives of millions of women and children are  tragically affected by illiteracy. In the future, two out of three new entrants to the labor force will be women, and few jobs will fall into the low-skill category. If women are to benefit from the jobs of the future, their literacy needs must be met. Programs must not only address their learning needs, but must also provide support services (such as child care) so they can learn. More public funds should be targeted toward women, and provider programs must be coordinated to help women and the families they head to break out of the cycle of illiteracy and poverty. (KC)",

The study sought to describe student perception of the agriculture program and what factors are involved in this perception; the length and names of the curriculum offerings within the agriculture department and how they affect enrollment; student perceptions concerning membership in the Future Farmers of America (FFA); and the impact that gender, place of residence, and grade level had on student response. Data were obtained from a survey of 8th-, 9th-, and 10th-grade students in the Waterloo-Cedar Falls, Iowa, area. Responses were received from 306 of the 412 students surveyed (74 percent). Some of the results are as follows: (1) students thought of  agriculture as &quot;farming&quot;; (2) students thought that vocational agriculture should be offered for science credit; (3) college admission requirements are a barrier to students' continuation in vocational agriculture in the 11th and 12th grades; (4) scheduling problems are a factor in reducing vocational agriculture enrollments; and (5) less than half of the students were interested in FFA. The study concluded that enrollments in vocational agriculture will continue to drop and that changes in the vocational agriculture curriculum are needed if the trend is to be reversed. Survey forms are appended. (KC)",

The study was limited to a small sample of chief executive officers (n=3), supervisors (n=5), and staff (n=10) working in small, medium, and large businesses in Edmonton, Alberta; all 18 participants responded. Findings indicated that all organizations--small, medium, and large--support both training and retraining. Support for this scenario was evident from all levels within organizations and was perceived to be of great personal and corporate  value. Findings also showed that technology was definitely affecting policies and procedures with respect to training and that companies were definitely involved in processes of need analysis and strategic planning as ways of determining direction and priorities. Technology was causing change, the speed at which technology was forcing businesses to adapt showed that change was a norm, and planning for change had begun to dominate the business community.

Nineteen items that measured the perceptions of superintendents, principals, and vocational agriculture instructors toward adult agricultural education programs were used in the factor analysis. Perceptions were measured with a five-point Likert scale. Four factors were identified in the 19-item instrument.

        "description":"A study examined the interplay among the initial family context of noncollege-bound youth, their entry into the full-time adult labor force, and formation of their families. The social psychological literature suggested that parents and other family members played an important role in teaching youth about the value of work, provided them with many experiences that prepare them for employment, and helped connect them with job opportunities. Their parents, other family members, and their own children exerted influence on youth employment patterns in a wide variety of ways, influence that both enhanced and impeded employment. Little research was found that investigated the causal relationships among family living arrangements, family responsibilities, and patterns of youth  employment. The issues were complicated by the simultaneity of the processes involved, that is, relationships of cause and effect were intertwined. A few job training and employment programs have begun to target young parents, offer employment services to other family members, and encourage parental involvement. It is concluded that public policies aimed at improving the transition of noncollege-bound youth to the adult job market must take into account the likely influence of the family context of youth--both families of origin and the families they create.

        "description":"A study determined how service policies implementing the combat exclusion provisions affect the number and assignment of military women and whether service procedures unrelated to the combat exclusion limit job opportunities for women. Based on the combat exclusion and related program needs, about 1.1 million of 2.2 million military jobs were closed to women. Not all of the remaining jobs were available to women, however, through their policies and procedures for identifying job availability and for determining or implementing accession goals for women, the services further limited the jobs for which women may compete. To allow women to compete for all jobs not closed by statutes or program needs, it was recommended that the Secretary of the Navy consider berthing area  configurations when establishing the number of noncombat sea duty opportunities for women; direct the Commandant of the Marine Corps to provide open access without regard to gender to noncombat assignments now prorated between men and women; and review procedures used by officer career field managers for determining proposed accession goals for women officers. The Secretary of the Air Force should allow all unrestricted pilot and navigator openings to be available for competition by women on an equal basis with men. The Secretary of the Army should remove limits resulting from implementation of gender specific accession goals for enlisted women. (YLB)",

The following implementation strategies are discussed in Part 2: infusion;  application (the transfer process, similarities between transfer situations, and identification of the important parts of a task); cooperation; integration; and barriers to effective information (lost opportunities, implicit goals/uninformed participants, and the importance of a team approach). Part 3 presents examples of activities to develop problem-solving, interpersonal, computation, and communication skills.

Comprehensive programs of guidance and counseling serve as the link between providing occupational training and employment readiness for the eventual transition to and satisfaction in the workplace. The statement of purpose in the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act of 1984 sets forth an ambitious and important agenda for vocational education to help the nation meet the challenges facing it. Guidance should be treated as a program that has characteristics similar to other programs in education and vocational education (including learner  outcomes, activities and processes to assist learners to achieve these outcomes, professionally certified personnel, and materials and resources). Guidance and counseling should be developmental and comprehensive, should focus on individuals' competencies rather than just on their deficiencies, should be built on a team approach, and must mandate articulation. Previous research reported in the literature is described, as well as a survey undertaken in March 1987 on the use of federal funds for vocational education in the United States. Thirty-one of 50 state career guidance supervisors provided information and suggestions for change. (MN)",

Specialized and elite interviews were administered to program developers to identify the approaches that are being used and to determine how they relate to the approaches described in the adult education literature. The responses given during the interviews indicated that most of the programs for adult learners were focused on problem solving and information giving and were normatively defined by the sponsoring agency, with the program developer acting as a solution giver and resource linker. The information gathered during the interviews indicated that what is being practiced in reality is not what is prescribed  by any one approach in the literature. It was hypothesized that program developers who state that theories and formulas in the literature do not always apply in their situation may have factors and forces in their situation that may call for adjustments or modifications of the approaches advocated in the literature. The interviews conducted would seem to indicate that program development can be viewed as a process used to link various agent and client systems for the deliberately undertaken action of learning.

One reason for the difficulty is that there are many facets to this integration process: time, emotionality, conflict, complexity, change, and situational factors. Individuals need to decide what faces or roles are important in their lives and act accordingly. This might include building the necessary support systems to assist in carrying out these decisions. The catch is that it may not be easy to make such definitive decisions and it may be even harder to act on those decicions. In addition, as one's roles and the nature of those roles are usually in a constant flux, one will need to reevaluate the priorities and be willing to accept that one's life  patterns will take on a number of forms as one continues to grow and develop.

Four of the studies appear to fit the more traditional notion of what the qualitative paradigm is all about, in that they are exploratory in nature. The remaining four studies focus more on the expansion of earlier ideas that had been generated by previous research on self-directed learning. The number of subjects for all but one study can be characterized as \"normal\" for studies that are qualitative in nature (sizes ranged from 10 to 33). What is interesting is that in general they appear more broadly based in terms of the educational and socieconomic background of the subjects than the quantitative studies. The data collection technique used most often was the unstructured or  semistructured interview. An examination of these studies as a group indicates that the key contribution the authors have provided to the knowledge on self-directed learning is a more in-depth picture of how individual learners go about organizing, doing, and evaluating their own learning. These findings provide a fruitful direction for future research on self-directed learning. (YLB)",

By applying the principles of client-oriented service, Virginia Tech (Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University) has undertaken a comprehensive project to improve its continuing education program. This program improvement process has included looking at environmental trends, reviewing competitors, establishing the program's current functioning with direction for the future, and planning a strategy to reach program goals. The methodologies used have included written  questionnaires, focus group interviews, personal and telephone interviews, and a literature review. As a result of the information gathered, the program's capabilities and staff training efforts have been expanded and several new client services have been added. Training materials were obtained and training workshops on various client services were held for the staff involved in serving continuing education students, including administrators, faculty, and all hotel and operating services staff.

        "description":"Dependence on standardized tests in adult literacy programs derives partly from their relative ease of adminstration and their appearance of providing valid and reliable quantitative data for program evaluation. Few adult educators are satisfied with the quality of the information, and most are extremely dissatisfied with the effects of such testing on teaching and learning. Literacy practitioners, researchers, and theorists have been working together and separately to seek alternatives and reinvent assessment. This movement is based on learner-centered or participatory approaches that are congruent with recent cross-cultural and ethnographic research. To understand and assess the literacy practices of different adult learners, alternative assessment explores the particular types  of reading and writing that adults themselves see as meaningful under different circumstances and that reflect their own needs and aspirations. Most important, these new approaches communicate respect for adults. Procedures for assessing learner progress often include scripted or ethnographic interviews, conducted by students with students or by administrators or teachers/tutors with students. Some programs use profiles or inventories; others integrate assessment with instruction. Support is needed to build networks to share questions and findings about alternatives to traditional methods of assessment. (YLB)",

        "description":"In March 1988, the Institute for Literacy Studies at Lehman College, New York, initiated a short-term, participatory research project in alternative assessment. It consisted of two major components--a five-session seminar held for two hours on Wednesday afternoons in May and June and two rounds of interviews with Adult Learning Center (ALC) students conducted by students participating in the project. This project was intended as the first step in development of a model procedure for classroom-based assessment in ALC classes. Interviews focused on ALC students' current status as readers and writers and on their knowledge about the texts, tasks, contexts, strategies, and processes involved in reading and writing. Three ALC teachers and five students from their classes participated.  Five experiential workshop sessions provided some theoretical background on reading and writing processes and on the nature of ethnographic research. The series also took participants through a process of planning, conducting, and analyzing interviews of ALC students. This project showed that students, with training, can conduct assessment interviews with other students that produce useful information about student learning. Implications from this alternative assessment were proof of its cost-effectiveness, a closer relationship between assessment and a student-centered curriculum, and need for an assessment method for student writing.

A concurrent trend of great importance to U.S. businesses is the rise in health care costs paid for employees, dependents, and retirees. This booklet is intended to assist company benefit managers in developing and implementing health care benefit plans. It includes six sections on issues that have a profound effect on the types and costs of health benefits that companies can provide to an aging work force: company size, the changing demographics, health  profiles of the older work force, company health cost management profiles, worksite wellness activities, and attitudes and perceptions of the older worker. Each of these sections contains a statement of purpose, background information, and discussions of the implications for benefit managers and related management decisions. The final section contains strategies for employee education, benefit redesign, health program development, data access, and management education. (MN)",

A representative group of 168 dislocated workers who had been employed in manufacturing, taconite mining, lumber, and farming were interviewed from June through September 1986, with follow-up interviews conducted with 119 workers from 6 to 9 months later. Some of the findings of the research were as follows: (1) most dislocated workers did not envision making radical changes in their occupations; (2) about half of the workers intended to enroll in retraining, with older workers less inclined to seek retraining; (3) groups of workers varied in their perceptions of the importance of reading and  mathematics in their former and future jobs; (4) 80 percent of workers thought that co-workers needed remedial programs in mathematics and reading, but that they themselves did not; and (5) workers recommended that policies should be implemented to protect workers' jobs and benefits, give advance warning of closings, extend unemployment benefits, improve helping agencies, and retrain workers on the job. The study concluded that recommendations regarding basic skills and job training could be implemented without major changes in policy, programs, or funding. (KC)",

Chapter I discusses the transformation of the United States from an agrarian nation into an industrial one and the equally momentous transformation from an industrial nation into one variously described as a post-industrial, service, Third Wave, or knowledge-intensive economy. Chapter II describes the emerging technologies that both underlie the transition and promise to give the third era its distinct technological character. Focus of the chapter is on the information technologies, which are the  most significant for the immediate future of work and employment in the emerging era and which include the devices, machines, and systems that generate, transmit, manipulate, and are controlled by means of the binary-represented data upon which computers operate. Sections of the chapter look at the information technologies from three perspectives: the computer itself as the paradigm of the information technologies, advanced research and development in computer-based technologies, and specific applications in the workplace.

Since the information obtained from the assessment is used in making programmatic as well as budgetary decisions, the assessment process was developed in such a way as to give faculty and administrators a sense of ownership of the process. All survey and assessment efforts are managed by the EICCD Office of Academic Affairs and Planning. To date, assessments have  been conducted in 19 occupational/program areas. The following common core of information is collected in each occupational/program area assessed: demographics of local businesses and industries, current and projected local employment needs, entry-level job requirements, minimal educational levels required, current wage/salary for new employees, current employees' continuing education needs, and emerging trends in the specific occupational areas.

A long version of the survey instrument was originally mailed to 1,640 institutions, organizations, and government agencies, and a short version was mailed to 741. An overall response rate of 21.4 percent was obtained (with response rates ranging from 3.3 percent for Eastern Europe to 40.0 percent for Australia). The study yielded data on the general characteristics of the distance education institutions and their budgets. As expected, widening educational services to include new groups of adult learners was cited as the most important goal of the institutions studied. A great number of  educational media were being used and surprisingly large sums are allegedly being invested in media development. There was great interest in developing and maintaining student independence, as well as in learner friendliness (using personal counseling and tutorial services to enhance students' success). (Appendixes include short and long versions of the questionnaire, information on the survey respondents by country, and a list of institutions in the study sample.) (MN)",

        "description":"The female share of the older work force has nearly doubled since 1950. In 1987, the 6.2 million women aged 55 and over in the labor force constituted 4 of every 10 older workers. Because young women today have a stronger work attachment than did their mothers and grandmothers, the female share of the older work force is likely to continue to increase. The employment characteristics of older women today reflect not only age-related factors but also lifetime work patterns and attitudes unique to the group; i.e., women were not expected to work after marriage, whereas unmarried women usually worked. Over the past several decades, fundamental changes have occurred in women's work life patterns. Three decades ago, only about 3 in 10 young women worked, whereas today 7 in 10 women  between the ages of 25 and 34 are in the labor force. Women reaching their fifties or sixties several decades from now will have much more work experience than the women born before them. However, these women, as their predecessors, are still concentrated in three occupational groups--sales, administrative support, and services--which usually pay low wages. Therefore, their retirement benefits, although better than those of older women of today, will still be lower than men's and will affect their work life in their older years.

The leave sharing concept could be implemented on a personal basis, with any employee donating sick or annual leave to another employee with a long-term illness who has exhausted his/her own leave, or via a &quot;bank&quot; in which employees could deposit and from which they could withdraw leave. Most of those testifying endorsed the leave sharing concept, and several cited cases in which such sharing would have saved an employee from financial ruin. Several witnesses had experience with leave sharing programs, either in other levels of government or in a federal leave-sharing pilot project, and  heartily supported the concept.

        "description":"Cooperative education is an educational method that offers many opportunities and benefits to students, employers, and higher educational institutions. Higher education has traditionally resisted marketing in any form. This has largely been the result of the traditional, narrow promotional concept of marketing. In contrast to this view, marketing may be viewed as a central activity of modern institutions that grows out of their quest to serve some area of human need effectively, an activity that is essential to their continued survival and success. As it applies to higher educational institutions, marketing may be defined as gathering and assessing information on customer needs and planning and executing activities designed to bring about an awareness of program and service  offerings. Many analysts see a sink or swim case for marketing college and university cooperative education programs. Those responsible for marketing cooperative education programs must realize that these programs have a variety of internal and external publics that need to be served, i.e., students, faculty, administrators, employers, potential students, and parents. Each of these publics must be kept in mind when analyzing product life cycles, doing market research, formulating a marketing strategy, and developing and evaluating a marketing plan.

In most cases, however, it appears that adult learners of mathematics share the characteristics of other adult learners. Adults are often good problem solvers, but they often need to be convinced that these methods are acceptable and applicable to math. Mathematics teachers working with adults must also be aware of the fact that many adults have learning histories with unusual gaps. Careful background assessments (not necessarily based on traditional methods) are therefore very important. Many adults have also developed a learning style that affects their approach to mathematics. For example, adults who lean toward a concrete experiential learning style will find the abstract  quality of mathematics unnatural and will need to accommodate some of the structure of math while building on their strength as problem solvers. The following are techniques that have been found to be effective in teaching adults math: shared learning, sensitive diagnostics, integration, visualization, math as language, peer tutoring, and efforts to change past negative attitudes toward math.

It is intended to acquaint the reader with the difficulty of counseling Hispanics due to manifestations of cultural and racial stereotypes. It stresses the need to change the counseling techniques that have proven ineffective and to try new approaches in dealing with Hispanics and with other racial and cultural minorities. Chapter 1 asserts that counselors who serve a multicultural constituency need to familiarize themselves with the Hispanic community, and describes several manifestations of racial and cultural stereotypes. Chapter 2 presents a review of related literature, focusing on the Hispanic family, colonized people, Hispanic family  values, the nuclear family, machismo, passive acceptance versus active mastery, cooperation and obligation, time orientation, and identity and the Hispanic movement. Chapter 3 gives guidelines for counseling Hispanics. It presents a minority identity development model which consists of five stages: (1) conformity; (2) dissonance; (3) resistance and immersion; (4) introspection; and (5) synergistic articulation and awareness. An extrapsychic model is also discussed. Nineteen strategies for counseling Hispanics are listed. References are included. (NB)",

This study examined therapists' attitudes toward their own behavior and toward their clients at intake in relation to premature termination. Premature termination was studied after different numbers of sessions to determine the relationship of therapist attitudes at intake to client premature termination at different phases of treatment. Six psychotherapy practicum trainee therapists served as therapists; 208 college students who sought help at a counseling center served as clients. After initial interviews, therapists completed the Therapist Personal Reaction Questionnaire (TPRQ), assessing therapist feelings toward the client and toward how well the therapist conducted the interview. Scores  were analyzed relative to the premature termination of 64 clients, of whom 24 left after 1 session, 35 after 2-9 sessions, and 5 after 10 or more sessions. TPRQ responses indicated that therapists felt they had not understood or been as helpful to their premature terminating clients as to their normal terminating clients during the first session. Therapists felt particularly ineffective with clients who terminated prematurely after only one session. These findings highlight the importance of the initial interview to the course of treatment as assessed by the manner of client termination and number of sessions. (NB)",

        "description":"This paper examines the arbitrary distinctions between intentional and unintentional child injuries, noting that a careful review of the literature of both child abuse and unintentional child injury revealed similarities among the risk factors associated with the two outcomes. A single, multifactor model of injury etiology, the ecologic model, is described, providing a framework for systematically comparing risk factors for abuse with those for unintentional injuries. The etiology of childhood injury is examined in an ecological context, making possible a unified approach to prevention of many kinds of intentional and unintentional child injuries. While the model is described as useful in bringing together research on child abuse and research on unintentional child injuries, it  is noted that the social responses to abuse on the one hand and to unintentional injuries on the other remain very different. Individual, familial, social, and cultural factors in childhood injury are identified and the role of social support and social networks is explored. Because the ecological model postulates that life events, chronic stressors, and perceived stress immediately precede an injury event, whether intentional or unintentional, stress and life events are considered in the context of their universality in both types of injury. Implications for prevention and treatment are discussed, and a list of 109 references is appended. (Author/NB)",

While management support has been a variable frequently cited as critical to the success of QCs in organizations, very little research has empirically documented the relationship between management support and QC effectiveness. This study was conducted to examine the relationship between top-, middle-, and lower-management attendance and the effectiveness of QCs. The effectiveness of 47 QCs over a 3-year period was examined as a function of management attendance using the archival data of a QC program. The results showed that QCs with a high level of upper-management attendance had a higher attendance rate at QC  meetings and had more QC members than had QCs with a low level of management attendance. QCs with a high level of middle-management attendance had attempted more QC projects and had a higher amount of cost savings than had QCs with a low level of management attendance. The effect of lower-management attendance on QC effectiveness was not significant. (Author/NB)",

The American work ethic today is not the same as it was in early America. In order to examine whether the American work ethic today is undergoing a significant change, it is important to examine the major characteristics of individuals who endorse the Protestant work ethic. This study was conducted to investigate the relationships between the Protestant work ethic and some demographic variables in a sample of 689 subjects in the middle Tennessee area. Subjects completed a 25-page questionnaire which included the  Mirels-Garrett Protestant Work Ethic Scale and items measuring selected demographic variables. The results revealed that Protestant work ethic endorsement was positively related to Republican Party identification and negatively related to age, educational level, employment status, annual income level, and marital status. A similar pattern of results was also found using one-way analyses of variance. (Author/NB)",

The ICE program primarily emphasized improving students' writing skills and exploring career possibilities, as well as helping students prepare for high school. During the 1987 program, 7,256 students attended classes at 35 sites. Eighty-four percent of the general education students for whom complete data were available improved from the pretest to the posttest, indicating that the program met one of its evaluation  objectives. The other evaluation objective related to staff development training. Teachers were positive about on-site and centralized staff development activities, and over 80% believed that the sessions provided skill enhancement that would be transferable to instruction during the regular school year. This document presents an evaluation of the ICE program. Included in chapter I are discussions of the program background and structure, evaluation objectives, program evaluation, and the scope of this report. Chapter II discusses program implementation, focusing on staffing, site themes, student characteristics, staff development, and educational excursions.

The program was implemented at 108 New York City high schools, and schools were encouraged to develop programs tailored to their own specializations as well as to the needs and interests of incoming students. Visits by Office of Educational Assessment staff to 11 program sites indicated that Summer Leadership Program activities appeared to be successful and relevant to students' and parents' concerns.

The purpose of this program is to prepare students to achieve a measure of independence and success once they leave the institution. Results of the evaluation indicated that the program exceeded its mandated goal that 80% of the students would master 80% of the objectives since 97.5% of the students mastered 80% of their objectives. A moderate relationship between number of sessions attended and number of skills mastered was also demonstrated. Goals were  accomplished through the application of an individualized instructional approach. Instructional content ranged from basic self-care living skills to preparation for aptitude and competency tests. The bulk of instructional activities focused on conceptual and practical aspects of the working world: defining student vocational interests and capacities, exploring the requirements of different occupations, and practicing such skills as form completion, job applications and interviews, and work habits. The program continued to expand several activities which had shown exceptional success, such as field trips to various businesses, site visits by representatives of different occupations, job placement, and a computer literacy program. Program teachers and supervisors suggested further expanding  students' contact with the work world. Teachers reported two factors that limited program effectiveness: lack of cooperaton and support from some agency staff, and variation in students' length of residency with a single institution.

According to this perspective, an individual's global self-esteem is largely the result of subjective &quot;reflected appraisals&quot; of others' evaluations of him rather than their actual evaluations of him. This study hypothesizes that if the symbolic interactionist position is veridical, then high self-monitoring participants would be more attuned to the behavioral and emotional manifestations of parental discipline than are individuals low in self-monitoring. Participants (N=222) were college students who were asked to appraise their own self-esteem and their parents' disciplinary style as well as to complete  Synder's Self-Monitoring scale. Results showed the self-esteem of college students to be inversely related to parental authoritarianism and directly related to parental authoritativeness. The strength of these relationships was much greater for high self-monitors than for low self-monitors. The results suggest that &quot;looking glass&quot; explanations for self-esteem may not have universal cogency, but may be far more germane to high self-monitors' self-esteem development than to that of low self-monitors.

        "description":"The goal of synergistic psychology is to synthesize different psychological theories into an explanation of how social, cognitive and biological factors interact in human behavior. Synergism refers to the mutually co-operating action of separate substances which taken together produce an effect greater than that of any component taken alone. The term &quot;synergistic psychology&quot; was suggested by Larry Smolucha in 1988 as a metatheory for synthesizing psychoanalytic and Vygotskian theories. The basic theoretical assumption in synergistic psychology is that internalized social interactions become higher mental functions that regulate lower biological functions. The resulting synthesis consists of six points: (1) Vygotskian theory can provide a means of formulating a developmental model  of primary and secondary process thought; (2) adults act as mediators of infants' social-cognitive development; (3) internalized social interactions serve self-regulation; (4) imagination can mature into a consciously directed thought process that collaborates with logical thought in creative thinking; (5) there is a non-verbal, unconscious domain in human cognition; and (6) the internalization of social interactions results in the development of self-concept and world view.

Results from the 1986 Survey of Inmates of State Correctional Facilities which included 13,711 inmates, indicated that inmates reported high levels of drug use prior to the commission of the crime for which they were incarcerated. In the month before their current offense, 43% of state prison inmates were using illegal drugs on a daily or near daily basis; 19% were using a major drug on a daily basis. Many inmates began their use of drugs, particularly major drugs (heroin, methadone, cocaine, phencyclidine, or lysergic acid diethaylamide), after their criminal careers had already started. Almost 80% had used drugs at some  time in their lives; 52% had used a major drug. White inmates and female inmates were somewhat more likely than others to have been regular users of major drugs. About 65% of inmates reported that they had never been regular users of a major drug, and an additional 21% began such regular use after their first arrest. The greater the offender's use of major drugs, the more prior convictions the inmate reported. Users of major drugs were substantially more likely than nonusers to report that they received income from illegal actiViuies during the time they were last free. Twenty-eight percent of inmates reported a past drug dependency. Thirty percent reported that they had participated in a drug treatment program at some time. About one-half of the inmates who had participated in a program  had received their most recent treatment while they were incarcerated. Seventeen tables illustrate the report's statistics. (ABL)",

This study has been developed to distill information that currently exists, to provide new data based on national estimates and to highlight both public and private sector initiatives targeted at caregiving. Informal caregiving is the first topic discussed. An historical perspective is provided, as well as current demographic, health, and social trends. Next characteristics of the caregivers themselves are described, including their gender, age, marital status, employment, economic status, health status, and living arrangements. The benefits and negative aspects of caregiving are described, including sources of stress and types of  caregiver strain. The public sector response to informal caregiving is discussed. These topics are covered: status of current public policies; public sector support for informal caregivers, including service and financial strategies; and federal legislation, including the Older Americans Act Amendments of 1984 and the Respite Care Act of 1986. The private sector response is also described, including education and training, respite care, and employee benefit programs. The report concludes that family members, friends and neighbors have continued their long tradition as the principal source of long-term care assistance to impaired elderly persons, and these caregivers will continue to be essential in providing care to dependent elderly.

        "description":"Particularly in the 1960s and 1970s it was frequently argued that coeducational (Coed) high schools provided a more natural social environment to prepare adolescents for adulthood than did single sex (SS) schools. Based on the assumed accuracy of this belief, SS schools are becoming infrequent or even nonexistent in most western societies. This investigation was designed to provide information about the effects of the transition from SS to Coed high schools. This 5-year longitudinal study examined the effects of the transition from SS to Coed high schools when a boys' high school and girls' high school were reorganized into two Coed high schools, involving approximately 2,250 students sometime during the period from 1982 through 1985. Students were compared on self-concept and  academic achievement before, during, and after the transition, and detailed perceptions were also collected from teachers who taught at the schools before, during, and after the transition. For both boys and girls there was a clear increase in multidimensional self-concepts from the pre-transition to post-transition, despite a small decrease in self-concepts for students attending Coed classes during the transition year. Sex differences in specific areas of self-concept were unaffected by the transition. Across the 5 years of the study there were no significant differences in either mathematics or English achievement. Results suggest that the transition to Coed benefited both boys and girls in multpile dimensions of self-concept and that these benefits were not gained at the expense of  academic achievement.

The purposes of this study were to examine age and sex effects in multiple dimensions of self-concept during the preadolescence to early-adult period and alternative operationalizations of the orthogenic principle positing self-concept to become differentiated with age. The investigation used 12,266 responses comprising the normative data for the three Self Description Questionnaire (SDQ) instruments designed to measure multiple dimensions of self-concept in preadolescence in early-adolescence, and in late-adolescence and early adulthood. Results showed responses to all  three SDQ instruments were reliable and resulted in well-defined factor structures. Age effects were U-shaped, self-concept declining from early preadolescence to middle adolescence, and then increasing from middle-adolescence through early adulthood. Sex differences in specific areas of self-concept, those favoring girls and those favoring boys, were generally consistent with sex stereotypes and were relatively stable from preadolescence to early adulthood. There was little support for the increased differentiation of the multiple dimensions of self-concept beyond early preadolescence. (Four tables, 7 figures, and 66 references are included.)

        "description":"Junior high schools have been blamed for failing to meet the needs of early adolescents. Proponents of the new middle school structure favored moving grade nine to the high school and moving grade five and or six from the elementary school to the new structural organization. The uniqueness of the middle school is in how the philosophy behind this structure gets translated into a more \"student-centered\" environment. This study sought to identify students' attitudes regarding their middle school experience. This research study was limited to 8th (N=192) and 9th (N=187) grade students in private schools regarding their self-reported concerns and attitudes with respect to their middle and high school experiences during the 1986-87 school year. This study shared similarities to one  using public school students by Mitman (1981). In general it was found that those students achieving a higher grade point average exhibited a more positive attitude toward school. As was expected, it was also found that females were more positive in their attitudes toward school, while eighth graders showed a greater general dislike of school than did their ninth grade counterparts. Students felt that directions and goals were not clear and that teachers were not helping them to learn and understand or to take into account what they were interested in. Students were more confident, felt teachers were friendlier, but felt less like they were making good progress, and had a lower sense of self-efficacy than those in Mitman's study. The implications from this study indicate that the  differences in private school norms, rules and regulations are likely to influence achievement outcomes, as well as serve as an added source of pressure.

Ninety-seven community college students, over 70% of whom were minority group members, completed self-report instruments measuring cognitive-motivational processes and academic performance. Students reported using many self-regulated learning strategies and had generally positive attributional patterns. In addition, the students expected to perform well in the course and did, in fact, accomplish course objectives, on average. There were significant positive correlations between self-regulated learning strategies and academic performance expectations  and attributional patterns. No relationship was found between students' academic performance expectations and their subsequent academic performance. It was concluded that the students may benefit from learning ways to assess the relationship between their own efforts and academic outcomes, including how to engineer the outcomes of choice.

This study was conducted to examine the generalizability of these differences across ethnic categories. The sample consisted of 14,173 7th through 12th graders, including 8,119 Anglos, 4,492 Hispanics, and 1,562 American Indians. For purposes of data analysis, a subsample was selected in which equal numbers of subjects of each ethnic group were represented in the four identity statuses (diffused, moratorium, achieved, foreclosed) and an unclassified status. The subsample included 512 Anglos, 478 Hispanics, and 495 American  Indians. Subjects completed the Objective Measure of Ego-Identity Status and a questionnaire related to subjects' involvement with alcohol and various other kinds of drugs. The results revealed apparent ego-identity differences among the three ethnic groups in the larger sample which suggests that Hispanics and American Indians engage in less identity exploration than do Anglos. Ethnic differences continued to exist when identity statuses were viewed in relation to substance use patterns. American Indians had a higher percentage of having tried alcohol and drugs, while Hispanics and Anglos were similar in their lower substance use patterns. Future research might focus on the identity-substance abuse relation in addition to the identity-substance use relation examined here. (NB)",

        "description":"A number of studies suggest that demographic characteristics may be related to individuals' satisfaction with their work. If gender does relate to job satisfaction, this relationship might be partly explained by a mediating effect of another set of variables--individuals' reasons for working. Because the effect of socialization on work attitudes is likely to develop during adolescence, this study tested the thesis that female and male adolescents would have different reasons for working at part-time jobs, and that these reasons may impact on their job satisfaction. Male (N=361) and female (N=508) high school students who worked at fast food restaurants completed a structured questionnaire assessing demographic characteristics, family background, educational attainment and goals,  and attitudes about work and fast food jobs in particular. Subjects described their past jobs and present duties, reasons for working, satisfaction with their job, and skill development. At the bivariate level, gender was found to relate significantly, but to a small degree, to job satisfaction. It was also found that female adolescents were likely to work for different reasons than male adolescents. Females reported working to learn skills or gain work experience more than did males. The relationship between gender and job satisfaction disappeared after controlling for differences in the reason for working, suggesting that gender did not have a direct impact on job satisfaction. Reasons for working did not account for much of the variance in predicting job satisfaction.  (Author/NB)",

Programs directed toward males are discussed in the areas of sex education, decision making and life planning, parent involvement,  teenage peer advocate programs, teenage theater, condom distribution, male outreach and media programs, family planning clinic-based programs, comprehensive health and social services, school-based clinics, youth agencies, programs that add on pregnancy prevention, and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome prevention programs. Strategies of organizations promoting male involvement and their sources of financial support are summarized for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the American Public Health Association, the Center for Population Options, the National Urban League, the Ounce of Prevention Fund, and international programs.

Demographic results indicated that practitioner school psychologists were increasingly women, had a median age of 38 years, and had at least the specialist degree or the equivalent. Most are employed by public schools. The NASP leadership sample was more evenly divided between men and women, was slightly older than the  practitioners, had more years of experience, and was more likely to hold a doctoral degree. The college faculty sample was older, about 75% male, and had a higher salary often supplemented with private practice or consulting income. Both the practitioner and the leadership samples strongly supported the current NASP position concerning nondoctoral credentialing. Concerning items pertaining to issues in learning disabilities and appropriate programs for low achieving and mildly handicapped individuals, the leadership sample was slightly more critical of current practices than were other samples, and more committed to development of alternative delivery systems. Responses from practitioners and faculty on training and continuing education needs revealed needs to improve in the areas of  neuropsychology, interventions in regular education for students with behavioral or emotional problems, and regular education interventions for students with learning problems.

        "description":"Sexual harassment of college students by college faculty is not an uncommon occurrence and may influence women's career decisions to enter male-dominated professions. Attitudes about sexual harassment of college students by professors were examined among 84 male and 84 female college students. Each student was shown one of six scenarios based on three professor-student interactions that varied in harassment severity and gender of harasser and victim. Subjects were then asked to judge the appropriateness of the professor's behavior on a five-point scale from appropriate to extremely inappropriate. The students were also asked whether the professor's behavior should be reported. A factorial analysis of variance was conducted to assess the effects of gender of student, gender of  victim, and level of harassment severity on perceived appropriateness. A main effect was found for level of harassment severity and for gender of student. Students' recommendations to report the professor's behavior were significantly related to manipulated severity and to rated severity, but not to gender of the rater or the victim. More serious acts of harassment were rated as more inappropriate and more deserving of being reported. Women rated behaviors as more inappropriate than did men. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"Because sexual harassment by faculty can deter college women from entering male-dominated fields, college administrators face the serious task of determining effective policies to deal with such harassment. This study was conducted to examine students' ratings of appropriate punishment for male professors who harass female students. The effects of gender and behavior on suggested punishment for sexual harassment of female students by male faculty members were examined for a wide range of behaviors. Male (N=96) and female (N=106) college students completed a questionnaire which briefly described 25 situations which might occur between a male professor and one of his current female students, both within and outside the classroom. All nine recognized categories of sexual harassment  and six innocuous items of appropriate student-instructor interactions were included. Subjects rated the appropriate discipline for sexual harassment for each item with punishment ratings on a seven-point scale ranging from no punishment to filing criminal charges. A two-way analysis of variance revealed significant main effects and an interaction, with each p < .005. Pair-wise post hoc comparisons allowed for the isolation of clusters of acts deserving similar punishments and revealed significant sex differences on 13 of the 20 harassing behaviors, especially among items describing more moderate levels of harassment. Male students were significantly less punitive overall than were female students. (Author/NB)",

This type of research continues to contribute to standards of quality for nursing homes, congregate housing, and health-care facilities. However, the perceived qualities of the environment may also be a key element in patient well-being and satisfaction, as well as staff morale. An instrument has been developed to measure these perceptual variables, the Physical Environment Perception Scale (PEP), a 7-point, 48-item semantic differential scale. The PEP asks both patients and staff members to rate the facility based on their perceptions of environmental attributes such as spaciousness, color and lighting, maintenance, organization, style and  aesthetics, and mood or affect. The PEP was administered to nine patients and six staff members of an adult day treatment center. Results showed that, overall, patients tended to rate the physical environment more favorably than did staff members. This may represent a genuine difference in perception of the physical environment or expectations, or it may reflect the patients' reluctance to be critical of the program. Staff members may have a greater awareness of environmental problems. Results of the study also indicated a high level of internal consistency for the 48 items. The PEP proved to be feasible to administer to elderly, non-cognitively impaired patients and quick and easy for staff members to complete and return. (ABL)",

        "description":"Considerable attention in recent years has focused on the consequences of social comparisons and has suggested that learning that one's outcomes or abilities compare unfavorably to others' is an unpleasant, if not painful experience. Indeed, upward comparisons have been shown to result in negative affect, loss of self-esteem, stress symptoms, and frustration with one's outcomes. Downward comparisons have been purported to result in positive affective consequences. Seven variables appear to moderate the effects of comparisons: dependent measures used; degree of self-esteem threat; the point in the coping process in which comparisons occur; justifiability of outcome; attribute importance; similarity of comparison; and perceived control. In this study of perceived control the  affective consequences of upward and downward social comparisons were examined. College students who failed a test were led to believe that it was either possible or impossible to improve performance on a subsequent test. They were then exposed to either an upward or downward social comparison. Participants exposed to upward comparison information who believed they could not improve their performance experienced greater depressive affect and greater hostility than all others. Results suggest that exposure to upward comparison is affectively and behaviorally debilitating only when perceived control is low. Examining the impact of moderating variables appears to be a fruitful approach to studying social comparisons and one that should be continued. (ABL)",

Data for the study were derived from a representative sample of 10,259 7th through 12th grade students in North Carolina conducted in the spring of 1987. Data reported in the study were limited to 11th and 12th grade students, who are most likely to engage in organized athletics. Of these two grades, 3,328 were student athletes. Results showed student athletes' use of and beliefs about substances were in general more like those of non-athletes than they were different. Athletes' lifetime and 30-day use of marijuana, cocaine, and hallucinogens were the same as that of non-athletes. Athletes' and non-athletes' beliefs about the risks of using five of the seven substances  about which they were asked were also similar. However, athletes were less likely to smoke cigarettes than non-athletes. Athletes' use of smokeless tobacco exceeded that of non-athletes. While athletes were no more likely than non-athletes to use alcohol or get drunk over the course of their lifetime, they were significantly more likely to do both over the 30 days prior to the survey. It is also of concern that both athletes and non-athletes gave by far the lowest risk ratings to the two items relating to alcohol use. These results appear to shatter the illusion that, relative to non-athletes, athletes are avoiding alcohol, drugs, and tobacco. (ABL)",

This study investigated personality differences among student groups who have attempted suicide. Subjects (N=114) were college students who responded to questionnaires about depression, peer relations, self-acceptance, and hostility. Nineteen subjects reported attempting suicide at least once; 45 subjects reported having seriously considered suicide; and 50 subjects reported never having considered it. Even though they may have been years away from the suicide attempt, those who had attempted suicide had significantly lower  self-acceptance than the other groups, and those who had considered suicide were significantly lower in self-acceptance than those who had never considered it. Those who had attempted suicide were significantly more depressed than those who had neither attempted nor considered suicide. Results suggest that a depressive personality may be as likely to cause suicide as a depressive episode. It is concluded that cognitive therapy may be helpful for these people as a preventive measure to avoid future attempts. (Author/ABL)",

A theoretical explanation of alcohol abuse is the Tension Reduction Theory (TRT), which predicts that alcohol reduces tension and that alcohol is consumed because of its tension-reducing effects. This study examined the validity of this theory. College students (N=81) completed the Khavari Alcohol Test and the Trait scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Results indicated that high anxiety students drank significantly more alcohol than did low anxiety students when a comprehensive measure of alcohol consumption was used. Frequency of alcohol consumpton did not appear to differentiate between high and low anxiety groups. No interaction between gender and anxiety was found; there were no significant interactions on  the alcohol use measure. The TRT provides an explanation that seems to work equally well for both genders. The results imply that self-reported anxiety levels may provide a useful screening device to identify problem drinkers. Alcohol education/intervention programs may be designed specifically for these students. (ABL)",

This study focused primarily on the variability of subjects' reports of their physical and emotional well-being for each meal and the association of these variables with subjects' self-reported eating habits. Subjects (N=28), ranging in age from 20-72 years, responded to advertisements and flyers for the study. Subjects first completed an interview during which procedures were explained and subjects completed a demographic and health/diet history  questionnaire. For the next 28 days, subjects recorded on a specially prepared, fixed-response questionnaire, everything they ate at breakfast, lunch, and dinner within an hour after the meal. At the same time subjects also completed two statements assessing their general physical and emotional state. Subjects also indicated any of 12 physical symptoms, such as nausea or headache, they might have experienced before the meal. At the end of the day subjects recorded all snack foods they had eaten and completed summary statements about their impressions of the day. Results failed to show any very strong relationships among the various reports of physical symptoms and moods and subjects' assessment of how much they ate during each day. Subjects' reports of their physical symptoms and feelings  were correlated with the variability in the amount of food they reported eating as well as their weight-to-height ratio. This suggests that variables that might be expected to influence patterns of eating may have their effects not on actual amount eaten, but rather on how much the meal pattern changes over time. Future analyses will focus on particular patterns of variability in the eating patterns of heavier individuals as well as the influence of physical symptoms and mood on the choice and intake of specific foods during each meal.

While such a threat has led some to \"psychic numbing\" it has led others to action. Research on how children were being affected by the threat of nuclear war began in the early 1960s. This study explored the impact of parental anti-nuclear activism on children and adolescents with respect to psychic numbing using a post-test only equivalent control group design. The samples included 23 anti-nuclear activist families with 20 fathers, 23 mothers, 17 children (8-12 years), and 15 adolescents (13-19). There were 26 non-activist families with 11 fathers, 20 mothers, 15 children, and 15 adolescents. Separate structured survey  questionnaires were prepared for the parents, children and adolescents with somewhat overlapping content, dealing with awareness of the nuclear threat, activism, and the future. The results affirmed the greater awareness of the nuclear threat among activist families which was not totally absent among non-activists. Parents' activism and awareness was reflected well in the children (8-12 years). However, adolescence seemed to be a time when psychic numbing began to appear irrespective of parental activism. Activism as an adaptive coping mechanism and the need for creative intervention to prevent psychic numbing among adolescents are discussed. (Author/ABL)",

Thirty undergraduates were the subjects of the first experiment; 32 undergraduates participated in the second experiment; and 30 undergraduates participated in the third experiment. Subjects responded to free recall and restricted response measures. In general, the results showed that although lateral preference groups did not differ in short term memory or verbal facility, subjects with less consistently right patterns of lateral preference  recalled fewer idea units.

Instead, holistic teachers emphasize process, and they structure the students' classroom activities to be rich in language experience. Computers can be used as tools for whole language experiences in reading and writing, based on principles of holistic language instruction. Classroom reading should center on children's literature rather than basal stories, and software of popular children's literature is available. Teacher feedback for writing should be provided during, not after, the writing process. For this, computer-based revision and editing programs are available for a wide variety of word processing software, giving  feedback on grammar, usage, style, and organization. The transition from oral language to print should be as natural as possible, favoring guided language experience over direct instruction in subskills. Several computer programs allow children to create their own stories on the computer, then read the stories back to the children using voice synthesis. Writing should culminate in publishing in order for children to develop a sense of authorship. Desktop publishing is a key computer-based application for developing this sense of authorship in children. These are only a few of the ways in which computers can be used in the whole language classroom.

        "description":"Differing views on how meaning in a literacy event is formed have a large impact upon literacy instruction and language research. Teaching and research are often conducted without considering who is in charge of meanings. Yet the answer to this question establishes an interpretive frame that creates the questions, methods, and findings in language research. This interpretive frame is a perspective, a system of beliefs and assumptions about language--a &quot;paradigm.&quot; Three literacy paradigms have shaped the questions, methodology, and interpretations of reading comprehension research. In the transfer literacy paradigm, a text's fixed meaning is transferred to the reader's mind. Able readers are those who can absorb the greatest amount of text information. In the interactive literacy  paradigm, the reader activates cognitive knowledge structures and language processes to interact with meanings fixed in the text by the author's language processes and cognitive structures. This paradigm is dominant in school literacy instruction and language research. Finally, the transactive literacy paradigm treats meaning in a social context. Reader, text, and context are dynamically created in the meaning. Since multiple contexts coexist, multiple meanings are created while reading. Each of these literacy paradigms represent a different way of thinking--linear, cyclical, and dynamic. A triadic dynamic, derived from the transactive literacy paradigm, organizes pragmatics, sign-systems, and social interaction (three primary symbols involved in literacy research) into a dynamic  reflecting the focus of literacy research.

Subjects, 70 freshmen at a western New York state college of liberal arts and sciences in a required developmental reading/study skills course, were randomly assigned to an experimental or a control group and divided into four ability levels for each group according to raw score performance on the Stanford Diagnostic Reading Test comprehension subtest. Subjects were given instruction on eight readings consisting of scientific expository text, each of which had a comparison-contrast internal organization; they then took an  evaluation posttest consisting of four scientific comparison-contrast passages. Results indicated that transfer of training to real-world tasks did occur at each of the ability levels tested. However, training in the strategy did not appear to have any effect on the subjects (as compared to those in the control groups), except for the lowest ability group which apparently did benefit from the training.

Results indicated a need for building-wide and system-wide direction in reading at the elementary level and generated five conclusions: (1) MacMillan Reading: Series R is not being used properly; (2) Building goals in reading are being established; however, very little follow-up occurs during the school year; (3) Students are grouped according to ability in  heterogeneous reading classes; (4) School-wide activities are held to promote reading for learning as well as for pleasure; and (5) The services of a Reading Resource Teacher would significantly enhance the structure, organization, and implementation of the reading program in elementary buildings.

Each quarter, teachers recorded all the writing behaviors they had observed in their students. At the beginning and end of the year, they assessed students' ability to recognize letters, sounds, and words, and their ability to read connected text. Results indicated that when children are encouraged to invent texts, they grow as writers, regardless of the reading and writing behaviors they bring to school. Patterns of growth were quite individual and often consisted of the addition of new writing behaviors rather than the  abandonment of old behaviors.

The limitations of traditional definition and context-based instruction are discussed in the paper, and principles are outlined which explain why, how, and when teachers can use more intensive vocabulary activities effectively. The paper does not just present specific new techniques for instruction, but also describes how approaches to vocabulary instruction such as integration, repetition, and meaningful use of words contribute to reading comprehension. The information furnished in this paper is intended to provide teachers with a basis for making use of, and effectively  adapting, a range of different instructional techniques.

The second section, by Patrick Groff, offers a critique of the \"Report Card\" by asking whether it is more or less likely that the reading program that it proposes will bring on greater achievement in reading for children than can the  typical basal system.

        "description":"In 1988, a national survey was conducted by the Center for the Study of Community Colleges to assess the needs of two-year colleges for faculty, equipment, and facilities for science, social science, mathematics, engineering, and science-based technology programs, and to identify innovative programs for recruiting students into these programs. Telephone interviews were conducted with a faculty member or administrator from a representative sample of 91 community colleges. Study findings included the following: (1) the colleges had an average of 7 full-time and 12 part-time mathematics faculty members, 5 full-time and 4 part-time physical science faculty members, and 9 full-time and 12 part-time social science faculty members; (2) 40% of the colleges had hired new full-time faculty  in math, engineering, and technology within the past 2 years; (3) over 50% of the respondents indicated that compared to part-time faculty, full-time faculty were more experienced in teaching, more committed to the institution, in some cases had stronger credentials, and devoted more time to courses and students; and (4) 30% of the respondents felt that their division had better equipment than other divisions on campus, though small and medium-sized campuses rated their own equipment and facilities more highly than did the large campuses. Based on study findings, it was concluded that if enrollment trends continue and state and local budgets remain at their current level or increase, almost 2,000 additional full-time science, mathematics, and engineering/technology faculty will be  employed in the next 5 years.

        "description":"Presented are a summary and proceedings of a workshop on community college issues of legislative concern. The summary report begins with Patrick Callan's paper, \"The Question of Mission,\" which assesses the changing role of community colleges in the western states. The remainder of the report highlights the key points of the formal presentations and considers alternatives for action with respect to: (1) access to education for student populations exhibiting increasing diversity in age and ethnicity, greater needs for basic remedial education, and higher levels of prior educational attainment; (2) the need for community colleges to identify their distinct contributions to local and state economies in order to more effectively meet changing job requirements and industry needs; and  (3) conflicting demands for institutional accountability reflected in changing state expectations and community needs. The proceedings includes opening comments by Phillip Sirotkin, John Kitshaber, and Martha Romero; and the text of the presentations by Richard C. Richardson, Jr., and Helen Sommers on access; Jim Scherer and Myrna Harrison on economic development; and Bruce Hugo and John Terrey on accountability. Summaries of the small group discussions on each of these topics are presented, as well as the concluding comments of Thomas Gonzales, Patrick Callan, and Louise Ryckman. Lists of the legislators and other participants attending the workshop are provided in both publications. (AJL)",

In response to the increase, a study was conducted to determine the characteristics of full-time students and the factors influencing their enrollment. The Virginia Community College System provided data on the demographic and enrollment characteristics of both full- and part-time students, and PVCC surveyed all 799 full-time enrollees to determine their reasons for attending full time. Study findings, based on a 33.67% response rate, included the following: (1) unlike part-time students, most of the full-time students were recent high school graduates, seeking an associate degree and eventual admission to four-year colleges or universities; (2) 70%  of the respondents held full- or part-time jobs; (3) 66.2% were attending PVCC to prepare for transfer to a four-year institution; (4) parents and friends were rated as the most important influences on students' decisions to enroll at PVCC, though advertisements and publicity were also highly influential; and (5) 62.5% of the respondents claimed that cost was a factor in deciding to attend college.

An extensive literature review, a 69-item bibliography, a guide to information and  organizational resources, and the survey instrument are included. (EJV)",

An initial survey of 181 randomly selected first-time, first-year students was designed to provide a profile of community college students in the state and identify their educational and career goals. Follow-up surveys were scheduled at 6-month intervals, beginning in spring 1988, to evaluate students' progress toward their goals. Based on responses from 85% of the original sample, findings from the first follow-up study included the following: (1) 93% of the students were enrolled in the same college in which they were enrolled in fall 1987, and 77% planned  to continue their studies there; (2) respondents had a mean grade point average of 3.02, and enrolled for an average of 15 credit hours; (3) 84% reported no major life changes within the last 6 months affecting their future educational or career plans; (4) 36% of the students who had left college after one semester gave academic reasons for leaving; and (5) a large majority of the respondents were either satisfied or very satisfied with the instruction, faculty/student relations, grading, variety of courses, counseling/academic advising, financial aids services, student employment services, friendship with students, and facilities and equipment at the college.

The next section offers brief descriptions of the community college systems operating in each province, noting that in all there are 200 community colleges or allied postsecondary institutions in Canada. The scale of the community college sector is assessed next in terms of enrollments (i.e., approximately 500,000 full-time and over 1,500,000 part-time students); and numbers of faculty, administrative and support personnel, and citizens serving on college boards and advisory committees. The next sections examine college governance structures, relations with the provincial and state governments, and unionization and labor relations within the colleges.  Information on funding is provided next, indicating that the community colleges accounted for 9% of the total educational expenditures in Canada in 1984-85, with the three layers of government contributing 84% of direct college funding.

        "description":"A study of relations between perceived closeness and the level of biological maturation of male and female seventh-grade students sought additional support for empirical differentiation between closeness and acceptance. The study also investigated the relation of perceived closeness to parents' reports of satisfaction with parenting, children's participation in family activities, and disagreements over rules. Subjects were 100 male 7th-grade students, 100 female 7th-grade students (each of whom was the oldest child and lived with both natural parents) and their parents. Testing occurred in the families' homes. The parents' questionnaire consisted of a closeness scale, a parental satisfaction scale, a participation in family activities scale, and a disagreement over rules scale,  while the children's questionnaires included a closeness scale and an acceptance scale. Results indicated that relations between parent-reported family behaviors and perceived closeness were similar to those found with acceptance alone, but were present even after acceptance was controlled. The implication of this finding is that research based on reports of closeness (as opposed to acceptance) is necessary, because only reports of closeness accurately tap both parents' and children's perceptions.

In the process of program implementation, much has been learned about large-scale efforts aimed at young children. It is known that simply realigning resources does not guarantee positive results. In the future, as new programs are implemented, several questions must be answered: (1) How can a school system best marshall its resources to strengthen early childhood education? (2) What kinds of efforts are likely to pay off? (3) Which programs deserve support? (4) Which strategies are unlikely to succeed? and (5) Which strategies are counterproductive? By drawing upon the Office of  Educational Assessment's evaluations of recent early childhood initiatives, this research brief addresses the questions and reviews nationwide research. Particular attention is paid to curriculum and professional development. Findings that are relevant to policy formation are highlighted and strategies for planning early childhood initiatives are suggested. (RH)",

In response to these trends, the National Association of Early Childhood Specialists in State Departments of Education has developed the following six principles to guide kindergarten entry and placement: (1) Kindergarten teachers and administrators guard the integrity of developmentally appropriate programs for young children by resisting pressure for acceleration of narrowly focused, skills-based curricula. (2) Children are enrolled in kindergarten based on their legal right to enter. Families are not counseled to delay children's entrance. (3)  Kindergarten teachers and administrators are informed about measurement techniques and are involved responsibly in their use; they do not defer measurement decisions solely to psychometricians and test publishers. (4) Retention is rejected as a viable option. (5) Any tests used at kindergarten entrance are valid, reliable, and helpful in initial program planning and information-sharing with parents; they are not used to create barriers or to sort children. (6) All children are welcomed as they are into heterogeneous kindergarten settings. Concluding discussion argues that practitioners cannot uphold practices and programs predicated on failure. (RH)",

In 1980, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the first two years of full-day kindergarten was published. A longitudinal study of the effectiveness of full-day kindergarten, including information concerning grades one through four, was issued in 1983. This report summarizes the earlier two studies, adds information about grades five through eight, and ties together the various strands and grade-level results to determine the consequences of full-day kindergarten. The purpose of the study was to determine whether the students who completed full-day, everyday kindergarten in 1979 or 1980 obtained long-term benefits. These students were compared  with students in half-day programs. Data were collected from standardized tests, report cards, school records, questionnaires, and interviews. Included in the report are approximately 20 pages of copies of newspaper articles concerning implementation of full-day kindergarten in Evansville. Articles reveal the high degree of interest in starting the full-day program. Concerns focus on student achievement, parent and teacher acceptance, attitudes, self-concept, attendance, participation in school activities, burnout, and content of the school day. (RH)",

Problems needing analysis include: (1) the establishment of early childhood demonstration programs throughout the state; (2) an assessment of training and technical assistance capacities and needs; (3) credentialing; and (4)  effective strategies for promoting home-school communications. Problems ready for action are public information and advocacy, interagency collaboration, and the development of an early childhood data base. The report concludes with a synopsis of recommendations directed to the State Department of Education in conjunction with other agencies serving young children and their families. Appended are facts and principles of the 1984-1985 report, lists of committee membership and contract consultants, the model employer report, the training and technical assistance report, and, extensively, plans for credentialing-retraining and home-school linkage.

Factors such as program effectiveness, quality of service, management efficiency, community networking, and demographics can be investigated while services to individuals are recorded and tracked. The article first offers examples of some agencies using their MIS data base to answer research questions. Secondly, it describes conceptual considerations relevant to the use of computerized information for research. These considerations concern: (1) the nature of the information base; (2) implications of different forms of data elements for retrieval; (3) ad hoc queries of information  in a relational data base; and (4) specialized data retrieval through variable listing. Finally, special characteristics of single agency studies and multi-agency research originating from a management data base are highlighted.

It is asserted that the key to dealing with separation anxiety is the acceptance of infants' and toddlers' feelings by both child and adult as a means of building infant and toddler self-confidence and trust. Subsequent discussion provides specific ways child caregivers can help children feel confident about separating and lists several signs that indicate that a child may be having difficulty separating. Influences on children's feelings in the context of separation are discussed, with particular attention to the role of the caregiver in establishing an environment of trust. Substantial emphasis is given to six ways of building an environment of trust, namely: (1) allowing the child plenty of time to  make the transition to the day care environment while the parent is present; (2) encouraging children to participate in saying good-bye; (3) providing to children many tangible reminders that their parents exist though they are out of sight; (4) regarding regression or shift in behavior with aplomb; (5) helping children bring a favorite toy or blanket to the day care setting; and (6) making sure that the setting is characterized by a low child/adult ratio, a sensitively responsive trained adult caregiver, and a group size of no more than 8 or 9.

        "description":"In 1984, the Connecticut State Board of Education (CSBE) convened a study committee to: (1) establish a conceptual foundation supporting developmentally appropriate programs and services for 4-year-old children and their families; (2) assess existing services and identify served and unserved populations, providers of services, and gaps in services; (3) identify methods of coordinating existing services and new services needed by the population; (4) assess the costs, personnel and training needs, and impact of new services on the current structure of kindergarten and the primary grades; and (5) make recommendations regarding the above to the CSBE. This report begins with a rationale for early childhood programs and services that is based on demographic and empirical data and  focuses on the issue of high quality programs. Subsequently explored are services offered in other states. Service inequities are highlighted, the emerging family support movement is discussed, and concluding facts and principles are derived. Finally, recommendations and an action plan are presented. Appended are related materials, such as a map of Connecticut school districts with pre-kindergarten enrollment, a list of Connecticut state agencies providing programs and services for 4-year-olds, and tables of levels of slots available by county, type of community, and per capita income.

This paper addresses the question by describing three areas in cognitive development, highlighting major themes in the research, and suggesting implications for teaching practice and social policy. Classical and contemporary views of cognition are contrasted prior to discussions of theory contextualizing and differentiating cognitive development. Qualitative and, preponderantly, quantitative evidence for the \"five-to-seven shift\" is reviewed. Discussion concludes by contrasting academic versus everyday cognition. It is argued that teaching and assessing 4-year-olds in public school settings will fail, unless special emphasis is placed on embedding cognition in everyday  practical terms, so that all classroom communications \"make human sense.\" It is concluded that a considerable amount of information is available concerning the cognitive development of young children which can serve as a guide in teaching practice and social policy. Because young children do have an intrinsic motivation to learn and to understand, they deserve developmentally appropriate educational challenges. The alternative relegates 4-year-olds to understimulation. (RH)",

The primary goal of the project was to improve the quality of the curriculum of the nationally accredited preschool by making it more culturally sensitive. Activities conducted to attain this objective included the design of age-appropriate lesson plans for teachers to use in their classrooms, distribution of letters to parents requesting their involvement, and the administration of a multicultural questionnaire to parents, teachers, and the center's director to determine if the program's curriculum had become more culturally diverse. Lesson plans were designed for units concerning self-awareness, similarities and differences, Native  Americans, and Korean and Greek cultures. Evaluation data indicated that the outcomes of the intervention were positive. Teachers reported feeling comfortable with the multicultural materials. Parent participation was a positive experience for parents and children. Questionnaire data indicated an increase in the multicultural dimensions of the curriculum. Two sample unit plans are included. (RH)",

        "description":"Three studies examined the domain of concepts about dinosaurs in order to assess how the domain might be structured in 4- through 7-year-old children's representations and to explore how the knowledge might be used. Findings indicated that significant differences exist in the way expert and novice children's representations are structured. Evidence further suggested that the structure of expert children's knowledge is more coherent, both locally and hierarchically. Some experts were able to sort dinosaurs at both the superordinate and family levels, but no novices did. Expert children could discriminate contrastive diet classes by using a single feature in both an inclusive and exclusive way. Expert children could reason categorically, using superordinate, family, and dinosaur  categories. Novice children were just as competent as matched expert children in using general learning skills when these skills were assessed in a domain in which both the expert and novice children had equivalent knowledge. The use of learning skills seemed to differentiate experts from novices only in the context of dinosaur knowledge. Findings suggest that children can act more or less intelligently on the basis of what knowledge they have. A modest mastery of a domain results in intelligent explanations, constrained inferences, categorical reasoning, hierarchical classification, and classification based on well-defined family structures. Six figures are presented. (RH)",

Scores did not differ between groups for any dependent variable other than civic awareness. Preschool children scored higher than day care or home care children on civic awareness. Civic awareness scores were divided into awareness of national symbols, government figures, historical  figures, religious figures, and Star Wars and cartoon characters. Preschool children scored higher on awareness in all categories except Star Wars and cartoon characters, for which the three groups did not differ. Data indicated that: (1) participation in a high quality child program expands a child's awareness of the world; (2) knowledge of cartoon and film figures appears to be part of the culture of childhood and is held by most children; (3) alternative and supplemental childrearing experiences do not necessarily affect children's prosocial values and notions of honesty.

Parents are being asked to wait a year before sending their children to public school classes or to place them in a pre-kindergarten class. Other children complete kindergarten but are retained or placed in a transition class before they can proceed to first grade. Affecting one-fourth to one-third of all children, these procedures are disturbing and unjustified, as discussions of birthdate effects on early school success, screening tests, exclusionary practices, retention and transition classes, and changes in the kindergarten curriculum over the last 20 years show. Data indicate that setting up barriers  to access to educational settings does not benefit the children excluded or retained. Curriculum and entrance policies must be changed so that kindergarten can become an environment that accepts all 5-year-olds and helps them to pass on to first grade. Schools must accept diversity in all spheres of development and employ well-trained teachers who use appropriate strategies to help all children succeed in the early years of schooling. (RH)",

Evidence concerning peer difficulties as risk factors is reviewed along with research dealing with family relations and peer relations in social development.

It is argued that the origins of these conjunctive cycles appear in early childhood, and therefore require attention in program design and management for young children. (RH)",

For the determination of vocabulary knowledge, Forms L and M of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test were administered. The Test of Analogical Reasoning in Children (TARC) was employed as a measure of analogical reasoning performance. Results indicated that there was no significant effect for age on analogical reasoning performance, and that age accounted for very little of the variance in TARC performance. Vocabulary knowledge had a  significant effect on children's analogical reasoning performance and was the only categorical variable to contribute significantly to total variance. There were no significant gender differences and gender accounted for the least amount of variance on TARC performance. A significant effect for ethnicity on analogy performance was found; however, ethnicity did not contribute significantly to the regression equation. There was also a significant effect for SES on analogy performance and SES did not contribute significantly to the regression equation. (Author/RH)",

Participants were early childhood specialists; center and family child care providers from profit and not-for-profit suburban, urban, and inner-city programs; community decision-makers; employers; and parents from various income levels and family backgrounds working in jobs with varying degrees of flexibility. The forum was divided into two parts. First, a national overview  on the child care issue was provided by Bernice Weissbourd, founder and president of Family Focus, Inc. and The Family Resource Coalition. She was followed by a panel of four parents who had each experienced child care in a different way.

        "description":"This study deals with the structural interrelationships among agricultural sub-sectors, and between the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors of the West Virginia economy. The study is intended to offer information on which to base sound economic development decisions. An input-output economic model is used in order to focus on the interaction between agricultural production and other sectors of the state economy. The major findings are: (1) a $1 million change in commodities sales at the farm level translates into an average change of $2.9 million in the state's total output of goods and services; (2) a $1 million change in gross farm income yields an average change of $2.2 million in statewide income; (3) every 100 jobs created in the agricultural production sector  stimulates 295 total jobs in the state economy; (4) the crop production sub-sectors have larger output and employment multipliers, on average, than those for livestock production, although the livestock production sub-sectors have larger average income multipliers; (5) the agricultural production sub-sectors showing high impact on the state economy include dairy products, food and feed grains, and fruit and nut trees; and (6) input-output coefficients from this study reflect high degrees of interdependence among agricultural production sub-sectors and between the agricultural sector and other sectors of the economy. The paper includes three tables showing cash receipts from farm sales, sectors and their components, and input-output multipliers for different sectors. Includes 11  references. (TES)",

        "description":"Young urban teachers assigned to rural schools in Queensland, Australia, experience difficulties in adjustment related to isolation from family, friends, and other professionals. Twelve teachers in a small remote settlement and 12 teachers in a rural school close to a suburban area completed a questionnaire exploring their relationships with their pupils, the community, and the State Board of Education, and their perceptions of their own professional positions and morale. All the teachers were young, urban, and relatively inexperienced, and all had been assigned to their positions by the State Department of Education. In comparison to the less isolated teachers, teachers in the remote settlement: (1) had more difficulty separating their profession from their social lives; (2)  were less able to establish appropriate relationships with their pupils; (3) felt more alienated from the rural lifestyle around them; (4) felt more strongly that the State Department of Education was insensitive, and; (5) expressed less confidence in their own professional abilities. Almost all teachers in both schools said that they would not remain in their present positions if they did not get the positions they wanted, a response with ominous significance for the future of rural Australian schools. Unless rural teachers' professional isolation is recognized, it is unlikely that the position of rural pupils can be improved. The study questionnaire and 34 references are included. (SW)",

Part I outlines the history of Indian education and describes the state of BIA education today, including enrollment trends, descriptions of facilities, teachers, curriculum, and extracurricular activities at 28 selected schools, statistical breakdowns of student performance in 1986 on nationally standardized tests, funding and budget figures, and family background and high school performance of Indian students. Part II addresses the long-range future of BIA education, and raises some basic policy options concerning the management of BIA school facilities and the exercise of BIA  educational leadership. The merits of these options depend in part on developing consensus as to the desired future of the BIA school program. Part III reviews recent research into the characteristics of effective schools, and suggests policy options that would apply the results of this research to BIA schools to improve the quality of teaching, curricula, and special programs. The final chapter proposes 15 short-term goals for revitalizing Indian education, goals which can serve as topics for tribal, public, and bureau discussions. The report includes 90 data tables and 46 references. A statement from the National Advisory Council on Indian Education, which cautions that reported Indian student test scores included special education students whereas reported non-Indian student test  scores did not, is appended.

        "description":"Project WILD, a Canadian elementary school curriculum supplement about wildlife and the environment, is seriously flawed in that it presents a human-centered view of the world while purporting to be unbiased. This anthropocentric perspective, in which humans are alienated from the environment and in control of nature by technological means, is in sharp contrast to the biocentric view, which emphasizes the relationships among all living things, including humans. Evidence of Project WILD's anthropocentric bias includes: (1) a preponderance of photographs of humans, human artifacts, and animals that humans like or resemble; (2) exclusion of humans from its scheme of wildlife classification; (3) lack of activities that teach the stated concept of wildlife's intrinsic value, although  each of five other stated values has 9 to 15 teaching activities; and (4) lack of activities that illustrate man's position in the &quot;food web.&quot; Although anthropocentrism has long been a fundamental assumption of European culture, it has failed to provide a sustained, healthy biosphere. There is a place in the curriculum for materials like Project WILD, provided they are suitably labeled, but there should also be room for criticisms of anthropocentric assumptions and presentations of the biocentric view.

Using the regional Indian education network, 571 surveys were mailed to 1987 high school graduates; 123 surveys were returned for a 23-plus percent response rate. Responses came from public and tribal schools, urban and rural, in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Montana. Responses showed a variety of student types. Half of the students surveyed were involved in sports, 35% in church activities, 25% in tribal activities, and 15% in civic organizations. Their average cumulative grade point average was 2.86. Eighty-two percent of students identified teachers as most influential in their success. Forty-seven percent also identified counselors and 39% identified coaches as influential. Attributes  of most influential teachers included caring and positive attitudes, honesty, concern, respect, and patience. These teachers made school interesting, and inspired and challenged the students, while maintaining high expectations. The most helpful teachers were those who gave help willingly, were open-minded, encouraged goal setting, were supportive when students failed, but complimented them when they did well. Half of the Indian students surveyed ascribed their motivation to finish high school to the reward of current successful experiences, including individual attention of teachers and participation in sports and other extracurricular activities. High expectations of family and friends, aspirations for a college education, self-confidence, and the negative consequences of dropping out  were also cited as strong motivations. Students suggested telling other students that finishing high school is the way to future success on and off the reservation. (DHP)",

        "description":"Based on the assumption that the problem of the at-risk, low-achieving student lies at least in part with staff attitudes, the Special Populations Project at Research for Better Schools developed a survey instrument to measure staff attitudes and perceptions. The &quot;Assessment of School Needs for Low Achieving Students: Staff Survey&quot; includes nine scales: Classroom Management, Instruction, Parent Involvement, Principal Leadership, School Climate, School Programs, Staff Development, Student Involvement in Learning, and Teacher Expectations. To complete the survey, respondents rate their opinion or experience using a five-point Likert scale on the 228 individual items. The survey was field tested with 228 school staff from four nonurban schools in the mid-Atlantic region. When items  with correlations below .50 were eliminated the items across the nine scales were reduced to 177. In interpreting the average mean score for each scale, lower scores reflect areas of higher need. Computed means for the nine scales ranged from 2.6 for Parent Involvement to 3.5 for Classroom Management. Overall staff perceived relatively more need in four areas, Parent Involvement, School Climate, Student Involvement in Learning, and Staff Development. Comparisons of individual school profiles indicate high consistency across the four schools except that elementary school teachers identified Principal Leadership as a top priority. The document concludes that this staff survey is a reliable instrument for prioritizing perceived staff needs for support in addressing the population of nonurban  students at risk for poor academic achievement or failure.

The land and equity is currently being held by 12 regional corporations and 150 village corporations formed by the act. Native shareholders, however, will be free to sell their stock in these corporations for the first time on Dec. 31, 1991. This report addresses the magnitude of the potential problem posed for Native Alaskans receiving public assistance, should they exercise this option, noting that as many as 40 percent of low-income Native stockholders will be inclined to sell their stock since owning stock in the corporations could make them ineligible for public assistance programs. Relying primarily on data from public service agencies, the report  discusses state and federal assistance programs for low-income Alaskans and outlines eligibility criteria for each, paying attention to assets that might affect Native corporation stockholders. Data on recent enrollments and trends in public assistance among Native Alaskans are examined. It was found that poverty among Alaska Natives continues to be widespread, and that almost all rural Alaskans receiving public assistance in early 1986 were Natives. It is concluded that the sale of 40 percent of the stock would have the effect of dissipating the benefits for Native Alaskans of the ANCSA, not only for those who sell, but possibly for all Natives. Eleven tables and a list of references are included. Two appendixes provide data on financial eligibility criteria for Alaska public assistance  programs and on families below poverty level with and without public assistance income, native/non-native by census area, 1979.

One teacher at a small American Indian tribal school volunteered to teach one science lesson per week to each elementary class. Untrained in the techniques of teaching science to young children, he began with a discussion of the four steps of the scientific process: question, hypothesis, testing, interpretation. Student boredom and teacher despair led him to attempt a physical demonstration simulating a dust explosion in a grain elevator. This demonstration illustrated the steps of the scientific process and created student enthusiasm and involvement. Currently, most contemporary scientific knowledge is passed on via textbooks and rote memorization. In contrast, ancient  Indian science was practical, involved a working knowledge of the environment, and was passed on to new generations via stories, games, and the experiences of daily life. Experiential instruction of contemporary science can be compatible with the native American viewpoint by using ordinary life experiences, shared in a scientific context. Such an approach requires an enthusiastic and innovative teacher but is well worth the extra effort. The report includes three references. (SV)",

Two southern Oregon schools implemented the 4-day school week on a trial basis in 1982-83 and, along with five eastern Oregon districts, continue to use this schedule today. The primary purpose of the change to a 4-day week was reduction in cost. According to the enthusiastic responses of parents, staff, and students on annual surveys, the 4-day week produced: (1) a 15% to 23% reduction in transportation costs plus additional savings in energy costs and nonteacher salaries; (2) more actual learning time due to less set-up time and fewer interruptions; (3) more time for staff development, extracurricular activities, and family business; (4) less student and  teacher absenteeism; (5) higher teacher morale and student enthusiasm; (6) more parental involvement; and (7) no adverse effects on student achievement. The following disadvantages have been noted: (1) difficulties if restoration of the 5-day week is desired; (2) increased costs for some parents; (3) increased teacher stress; (4) tiredness in younger children; (5) the impact of holidays on the schedule; and (6) concerns about the national movement toward a longer school year. An additional three eastern Oregon districts have successfully implemented a four and one half-day week. The appendix includes state criteria for approval of alternative school calendar proposals, charts outlining calendars and daily schedules, and a list of participant Oregon schools. (SV)",

Applicable federal laws and eligibility policies were reviewed to determine the treatment of tribal trust fund distributions and purchases made with such distributions by six welfare programs: Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC); Supplemental Security Income (SSI); Food Stamps; Pensions for Needy Veterans, their Dependents and Survivors; the Indian housing component of Lower Income Housing Assistance; and the Bureau of Indian Affairs' General Assistance. It was found that for the four non-Social Security  programs, guidance on a legislated $2,000 exclusion varied and was sometimes unclear. There was some inconsistency with federal laws in the treatment of such exclusions at the local level. The report recommended that Congress clarify the $2,000 exclusion required by the Judgment Funds Distribution Act and consider whether it is appropriate to require tribal trust fund awards and purchases to be treated differently under Social Security programs than under other welfare programs. The report also recommended that agency secretaries review welfare program policies to ensure consistent treatment of tribal trust fund distributions. The report includes tables, distribution figures and comments from affected agencies: the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Health and Human Services,  the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of the Interior and the Veterans Administration.

Costs incurred on behalf of Alaskan Natives were to be excluded in the report. It was found that for fiscal years 1982 through 1987, the Indian Resources Section of the Justice Department spent about $5.1 million to carry out its mission of litigating Indian rights cases. Of that amount, about $3.9 million was for personnel compensation and benefits while the remaining $1.2 million was for other expenses. The funds supported approximately 10 attorneys and 4 staff members each year, or 84,638 staff hours on 654 cases for the 6-year period.  The information is contained in a response letter and in several statistical tables showing data on Indian Rights cases handled by Justice's Indian Resources Section. The tables show numbers and status of Indian cases, hours attorneys worked, staff and salary costs, and costs of expenses. A list of major of contributors to the fact sheet is included. (TES)",

It examines the history of rural schools, and posits a rural-to-urban continuum of characteristics, citing studies that indicate rural schools are more effective in some ways than urban schools. The paper looks at needs of rural/small schools and the reasons those needs exist. Included is a list of recommendations by Kansas science teachers for addressing the needs of science educators generally. Also examined are the dynamics of change in rural schools and claims that many reform efforts have failed for lack of community consensus. Planning must be broad-based; technical assistance for implementation must be available to teachers; and change must be supported at the  institutional level. Innovative approaches linking schools to their communities are suggested. Funding mechanisms are discussed. Conclusions are then synthesized from several other studies for improving science education in rural schools. Resources from outside the rural community will be needed, but sustained change will require support at the community level. This document includes reference list and tables. (TES)",

The study was designed to complement the National Longitudinal Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Services for Language Minority Limited-English-Proficient Students, which was also conducted for the Department of Education, but which did not include Native American students. This report summarizes the results of the second year of the two-year study of performance of LEP American Indian students. It includes results of two years of on-site data collection in a sample of eight projects visited. Schools visited include public schools, tribally controlled schools, and one school controlled by the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs.  Researchers assessed the extent to which Indian languages and English are used at home and during school. Overall, the students participating in the study scored substantially below the national average on standardized achievement tests in mathematics and English. Indian students scored lower on math subtests than did students in the main LEP study, even though their English oral proficiency ratings were higher. Several variables are examined but the report suggests Indian students' low test scores are largely due to lack of exposure to English and lack of home support for educational achievement. A final section examines the implications and areas for further study. Graphs, tables and references are included. There is a glossary and appendixes describing the study's design, methodology,  data, and the &quot;technical advisory panel members.&quot; (Author/TES)",

The study was designed to complement the National Longitudinal Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Services for Language Minority Limited-English-Proficient (LM-LEP) Students, which did not include Native American students. The document summarizes results of the first year of a two-year study. It includes results of data collection from 23 projects, with students from 16 different tribes and 18 different language groups. The document describes American Indian bilingual education projects, their criteria, and the instruction generally received by Indian LEP elementary students. The Stanford Achievement Test (SAT) was used as a measure of  academic achievement of first- and third-grade American Indian LEP students. The students scored somewhat higher on vocabulary and reading comprehension than students in the national LM-LEP study, but slightly lower in math. It is noted that students receiving special instruction in English were most likely to have low SAT scores, suggesting the special services are being directed toward those who are most in need of them. The report contends Indian students in rural schools have serious educational problems. Although the students have average or better than-average academic aptitudes, they performed poorly on standardized achievement tests. A comprehensive assessment of the schools the students attend is recommended. Graphs, charts and references are included. (Author/TES)",

The introductory first chapter explores the need for change in mathematics programs. Chapter two describes the achievement of U.S. students compared to others. At grade 8, U.S. students were slightly above the international average in computational arithmetic, well below the average in noncomputational arithmetic, average in algebra, and among the bottom 25% in geometry, while Japanese students obtained the highest scores. For grade 12, Hong Kong achieved highest, with Japan a close second. In the United States, the achievement of calculus classes was at or near the international average; precalculus students were  substantially below average. Chapter three discusses the opportunity to learn; the United States was typically at or below average. Attitudes toward mathematics of United States and most other students were positive; attitudes of Japanese students tended to be negative, however. Chapter five discusses five deceptive explanations for the data. The sixth chapter considers the underachieving curriculum in terms of content and goals, while chapter seven discusses it in terms of opportunity to learn. Finally, the &quot;road to renewal&quot; is considered. Appendices include background information and data. (MNS)",

        "description":"This study was designed to determine if the final grade in college biology at a suburban community college was a true measure of student's knowledge. One hundred and seventy undergraduates taking a semester course in biology took part in the study. This population was randomly separated into a control, placebo, and experimental group. The progress of the groups was tracked for 15 weeks. During this time the control group followed a traditional biology scheme of two lectures, one lab and one seminar each week. The placebo group also followed this schedule, but, in addition, was given a 20 to 30 minute presentation on the historical significance of the week's lab. A similar scheme was followed by the experimental group. However, rather than learning about the historical value of  the lab, this group was given a specific 20 to 30 minute interaction that had previously been found to enhance a students visuo-spatial potential. At the end of the semester all the students were given written final exams and lab practicals (an exam that measures the student's skill and understanding of the semester's lab investigations). Statistical differences were noted between the experimental population and the other biology groups on the lab practical. (Author/TW)",

        "description":"An understanding of fraction addition can be thought to involve two quantitative ideas: (1) the understanding that adding to an original quantity increases its size, and (2) a sense of how much increase occurs. Both of these ideas should underlie or inform a child's approach to problems involving fraction addition and thereby constrain the class of possible answers to ones that \"make sense.\" It is well known, however, that many children do not give reasonable answers when asked to compute or estimate the sum of two fractions. This problem has generated much discussion in the mathematics education community and, in general, such discussions suggest that poor understanding of fraction size is at the heart of children's difficulties. The purpose of this study was to determine what  children who compute fraction sums incorrectly and, as it turns out, estimate the same sums poorly do and do not understand about fraction addition.

This report discusses the conceptualization, development, and formative evaluation of a series of science education videodiscs. Three major concerns addressed by the development of the \"Core Concepts\" videodisc program included: (1) a concern for the instructional setting; (2) an emphasis on courseware rather than hardware; and (3) a willingness to make the necessary \"front-end\" investment. The discs were designed to enhance the efforts of teachers working in both individual and group instructional settings. In presenting the content,  particular attention was given to problems associated with the use of terminology and fragmentation of information. The formative data indicated that videodisc programs can enhance the effectiveness of teachers and substantively impact the student achievement and attitudes. (Author/CW)",

The concern stems from the fact that avoidance of these academic areas places young women in a position of reduced choice with respect to careers. This research examined mathematics and science related attitudes and behaviors among male and female university students. The project consisted of three studies. The first involved a follow-up of female university students who had participated in an earlier study. These students were contacted and asked questions about jobs and careers. Analyses were run to determine the adequacy of different measures in predicting the actual career choices of these women with regards to mathematics and science. The second study analyzed  the results of a questionnaire given to male and female first-year full-time university students to measure attitudes and intentions about mathematics and science, and background information. Gender differences related to a number of attitudes and behaviors were examined. In the third study, first-year male and female mathematics and science students were questioned in order to investigate the factors predictive of persistence in mathematics and science courses once enrolled. Conclusions are drawn from each of these studies. (CW)",

The discipline may be formal or informal, may or may not be represented in a school curriculum, or relate to a wide variety of domains. Moreover, the development or exercise of thinking skills may take place at differing levels of generality. This paper is concerned with how new uses of information technology can profoundly influence the acquisition and application of higher order thinking skills in or near the domain of mathematics. It concentrates on aspects of mathematics that relate to its representational function based on the beliefs that: (1) mathematics itself, as a tool of thought and communication, is essentially representational in nature, and (2) information technology will  have its greatest impact in transforming the meaning of what it means to learn and use mathematics by providing access to new forms of representation as well as providing simultaneous access to multiple, linked representations. This report describes a few examples of novel software environments from the representation perspective, points to more novel approaches to curriculum reform in mathematics that will encourage the cultivation of higher order thinking skills and relates these to unresolved research questions and educational policy issues.

Nevertheless, scientists know what it is, where it comes from, how to measure and detect it, and how it affects people. Cosmic radiation from outer space and radioactive elements in rocks and soil contribute to the natural background radiation that has always been around us. There are also manmade sources of radiation, such as dental and medical x-rays, smoke detectors, and materials released from nuclear and coal-fired powerplants. Radiation comes from the activity of tiny particles (atoms) of matter. Atoms are composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons, the arrangement of which distinguishes  one atom from another. Atoms of different types are called elements. Some of the elements, such as radium, uranium, and thorium are unstable. As they change into more stable forms, they release invisible waves of energy or particles. This emitting of radiation is known as radioactivity.

        "description":"This paper presents the results of a study designed to determine whether preservice elementary teachers with a great deal of previous early field experience, but no previous microteaching experience, would benefit more from an additional science field experience in the local school systems or from an alternative science microteaching experience. Results showed that the microteaching group scored significantly better than the field experience group on three of the five instruments used to measure outcomes of the study. They scored significantly better on measures of science teaching skills, attitudes toward science, and science process skills. There were no significant differences between groups on measures of attitudes toward teaching science or on concerns about teaching  science. The study concludes that integrating science microteaching with field experience in undergraduate methods courses is superior in developing science teacher skills, attitudes toward science, and science process skills than field experience alone. The lace of significant differences between groups on the measures of attitudes toward teaching science and science teacher concerns indicates that these attitudes and concerns are at least not negatively affected when field experience is somewhat decreased in order to implement a microteaching program.

Many important educational decisions are made based primarily, if not exclusively, on test scores. This reliance on test scores has evolved for a variety of reasons. This monograph starts with test scores as a given in American education today, not as an endorsement of the emphasis given to test scores, but as a recognition of what has become common practice. The purpose of this monograph is to describe a set of procedures for reanalyzing test data to extract as much useful information as possible for making important educational decisions. The monograph and procedures described in it focus on the reanalysis of currently available test data, not on  collecting new test data and initial analysis. The reasons for focusing on the reanalyses of currently available test data are described in the text. In this monograph, the reanalysis of mathematics test data is described as a model for other educators interested in taking full advantage of test data that have already been collected. (PK)",

        "description":"Progressive approaches to science education incorporate a social dimension based on an interdisciplinary curriculum. The importance of such an approach has been recognized by educators and many science-techonology-society (STS) programs have been developed as a response to this social need. However, such programs may fall short of their mark without adequate treatment to the process of moral education for the students engaged in these programs. This paper argues that the process of moral development and policymaking are necessary in the classroom both as a foundation of moral education and as the link which will make otherwise interesting STS programs pedagogically effective ones. This paper explores viable approaches which educators may use in presenting the idea of competing  choices with respect to ethical issues in STS and an overview of some of the problems in applying ethical theory to social problems.

UMCs are located in Cleveland, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Durham, Pittsburgh, San Diego, St. Louis, Memphis, and New Orleans. In addition, two other projects were established: a Documentation Project to monitor the activities of the new collaboratives and a Technical Assistance Project to serve as a source of information for the collaborative projects. In each of the 11 cities, the UMC project supports collaboration among groups of mathematicians from high schools, higher education institutions, and industries, and encourages teacher  participation in a broadly based local mathematics community. This report presents an overview of the efforts of the UMC project as a whole, as well as a brief description of each of the collaboratives and the Technical Assistance Project. The Appendix of the report includes a detailed progress report for each of the projects for the 1986-87 school year. (PK)",

At this grade level, the science fair guidelines mandate that students enter a research-type project. For many fifth-grade students the desire to tackle this monumental task does not match their developing cognitive skills. The literature disclosed evidence that would support this age students' lack of skill needed for experimenting. The literature also offered a variety of suggestions for successful science fairs. The goals of the practicum were: (1) to improve participation of fifth-grade students in the science fair; and (2) to improve the students attitude toward the science fair. To attain the goals, the writer implemented a program offering a special science class  that addressed the need of those fifth-grade students interested in participating in the science fair. The students were guided through all the science process skills necessary to create and develop a science fair project with the use of a step-by-step workbook that was written especially for such students. The data analysis indicates that fifth-grade participation was not increased, but attitudes of both students and parents toward the fair improved. (Author)",

The level of College support was measured using an opinion survey of full-time faculty members and the students enrolled in courses during the fall 1986 semester that satisfied the associate degree general education requirement in communication skills and critical thinking. Current practices employed by the 105 California community colleges were identified  through a review of the catalog of each college and direct contact with the mathematics department chair of each of the 10 colleges for which the catalog supplied insufficient information. It was concluded that a high level of support existed for the exclusivity of the Mathematics Department in certification of student mathematics competence. (Author/PK)",

The introductory portion of the document explains the philosophy, goals, and activities of the seminar. The course is intended to provide opportunities for students in the humanities to experience mathematics as a discipline at once creative, intuitive, and historical, with special attention to the alienation of women from mathematics. Topics considered might include Pascal's triangle, the Pythagorean theorem, the Fibonacci sequence, the golden ratio, the roles of zero and the square root of 2 in the number system, and geometries beyond Euclid's. Through informal writing in a personal journal the students: (1) record their insights on the mathematical activities done  in class; (2) record their reactions to the course and to writings about mathematics; (3) ponder their views of mathematics as a field of knowledge and their recollections about being taught mathematics; and (4) develop their ideas for use in the writing of short essays. After this general discussion, excerpts from the student's journal are presented in the second half of the paper. (PK)",

The purpose of this publication is to promote student research on litter prevention and recycling. This science workbook contains 26 student research project ideas submitted by business, industry, trade associations, and others. Also included are \"The Solid Waste Crisis in Ohio\"; \"Background on Litter Prevention and Recycling\"; and \"How to Find Information on  Litter Prevention and Recycling\" (including information on using the library, reference books, journals, indices, abstracts, vertical file and letter writing). \"References and Resources\" include the addresses of 40 organizations and agencies, and a bibliography of over 200 references.

Through hands-on, natural science investigations, children have opportunities to find and observe a variety of plants and animals, look at them closely, sort them to analyze their similarities and differences, discuss ecological relationships, share discoveries, and wonder about the unknown. The children learn that nature is everywhere, in vacant lots, trees, and the playground. The activities are written to teach observation and critical thinking skills. This paper documents the processes used to begin and carry out this program. Chapters include: (1) \"Starting with a 'Think Tank'\"; (2) \"Conducting a Needs Assessment\";  (3) \"Designing the Project and Defining Objectives\"; (4) \"Selecting Appropriate Learning Activities\"; (5) \"Selecting Pilot Test Sites and Gaining Their Participation\"; (6) \"Recruiting and Training Volunteers\"; (7) \"Assembling Materials and Supplies\"; (8) \"Conducting the Pilot Test and Evaluating the Results\"; (9) \"Expanding the Program to Reach More Children\"; (10) \"Getting Financial Backing\"; and (11) \"Establishing a Fee Structure.\" Appendices include: project director job description; volunteers' portfolio; materials for site planning meetings; pilot evaluation forms; host site application; team leader job description; printed material for members' approval and phonathon; and publications cited.

It is based on the premise that in order to teach arithmetic well, teachers must accurately assess, teach directly, provide students with focused practice, corrective feedback, active learning time, and application of each mathematics concept taught until it is determined that a concept has been mastered. The system includes all of the elements necessary for the planning, organization, management and instruction of basic arithmetic concepts. The program outlined includes discussion and suggestions on five steps: (1) plan what you want to accomplish; (2) know the content to be taught; (3) organize for  instruction; (4) establish a management system; and (5) teach effectively and efficiently. The sixth stage is a systematic approach to the classroom in action through a review of critical steps.

        "author":["Clement, John"],
        "description":"Evidence from video tapes of experts thinking aloud and using analogies in scientific problem solving is presented. Four processes appear to be important in using an analogy: (1) generating the analogy; (2) establishing confidence in the validity of the analogy relation; (3) understanding the analogous case; and (4) applying findings to the original problem. This study concentrates on the first process. Evidence was found for three different methods of analogy generation: generation via a principle, generation via an association, and generation via a transformation. The mechanism underlying analogy generation is usually described as an association process. Transformation processes, where the subject modifies or transforms some aspect of the original problem may be just as  important if not more important. In contrast to the usual view of an analogous case as already residing in memory, several of the analogous cases were quite novel, indicating that they were newly invented Gedanken experiments. The usefulness of some analogies appears to lie in a \"provocative\" function of activating additional knowledge schemas that is different from the commonly cited \"direct transfer\" function where established knowledge is transferred fairly directly from the analogous to the original case.

University elementary education majors learned about home energy use from either a computer simulation or a computer tutorial. Learning of science concepts was measured using achievement and applications tests. Four individual learning differences were measured including: (1) discrimination skill; (2) field orientation; (3) locus of control; and (4) learning strategy. Achievement test scores were higher for tutorial users than for simulation users but no difference was found for the applications test. Discrimination skill interacted with mode of CAI on both tests. Increased discrimination skill increased scores of tutorial users but  decreased scores of simulation users. Increased external locus of control produced a decrease in score on both tests. Holistic learning strategies were superior to serialist strategies on the applications test. Field orientation had no influence on test scores. (A list of 26 references is included.) (Author/CW)",

Because the achievements of these women are absent from previous histories of West Virginia, their stories constitute missing chapters in the state's history. Some of these women made contributions in traditional feminine roles while others achieved success in professional and public fields. The lives and careers of these West Virginia women prove that they have not been merely passive observers of history, but active participants in the process. Although not all the women are West Virginia natives, they have all had a share in the state's development. They merit recognition in West Virginia history, not just to correct an imbalance  in historical writing, but to provide positive examples to other women. The women chronicled are: Livia Simpson Poffenbarger; Aunt Jenny Wilson; Val Sayre Hammond; Mary Elizabeth Behner Christopher; Elizabeth Kee; Naomi M. Garrett; Ann Kathryn Flagg; Rebecca Tendael Wood Littlepage; Agnes Greer; Anna Maria Reeves Jarvis; Minnie Holley Barnes; Gertrude Humphreys; Genevieve Starcher; and Ruth Ann Musick.

Universities have frequently been the converging point for revolutionary forces and the catalysts for ideas to improve human welfare and, as a result, should develop futuristic orientations and global perspectives. Dr. Nathan M. Pusey, President of Harvard University, later emphasized that the mission of the university is to direct more attention to rational inquiry in search of truth and to the study of humanism in curriculums. Dr. P. T. Chandi,  representing Christian universities in India, recommended a shift from studying facts to learning how to learn and an emphasis on developing the \"whole person\". Dr. Woo Chu Lee maintained Korean universities should return to an emphasis on liberal arts curricula and become creators of the social values which will lead people in the future. Dr. A. Latif added that universities should cooperate in higher education as a desirable step in meeting the world's needs in the future. Participants agreed that in order to assure that educated persons become a serving minority instead of an exploitative one, universities should teach the value of human dignity and a commitment to serve all persons. Most of the attendees urged Yonsei University to become a leader in teaching the dignity of humanistic  values. (JHP)",

This document comprises the papers of 12 scholars on the public policy and the research implications of this theme. Three addresses were given on the issue of content by Russell Kirk, Thomas Fleming, and Paul Vitz. Kirk proposed that the two fundamental purposes of education are the cultivation of wisdom and virtue and the teaching of responsibility and opportunity in a civil social order. Fleming suggested that it is a mistake to think of the present debate as a backlash against plummeting test scores. Vitz discussed his study of the role given to religion and traditional values in the basal readers and social studies texts  used in U.S. schools. Papers by Joseph Adelson, Joel J. Kupperman, Richard A. Baer, Jr., and William Kirk Kilpatrick addressed the issue of character. Adelson argues that the paradigms by which the social sciences study the realities of human existence may be derived from ideological preoccupations of the times. Choice in education is discussed by William B. Ball, Mary Anne Raywid, Thomas Ascik, Michael Casserly, and Robert L. Woodson. Raywid outlines her research findings on \"Success Dynamics of Public Schools of Choice,\" and Ascik examines the arguments attributed to opponents of choice in education. (SM)",

        "description":"The geographic distribution of arts funding by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and selected state art agencies is examined in this report. Data collected from the 1985 Survey of Public Participation in the Arts was used to determine if variations in geographic participation rates help explain differences in government support of the arts. Funding patterns for jazz, music, opera, musical plays, drama, ballet, and art museums were examined through an analysis of arts-related financial support in the 14 most populous U.S. states. Findings indicated that there was not a statistically significant relationship between arts funding and population distribution. However, there appeared to be a strong relationship between government funding and the relative distribution of arts  organizations, and generally the relationship between government arts funding and the distribution of artists was positive. Data were tested using a number of selected models, and comparisons among them are provided. Fourteen tables and 28 endnotes are included, and appendices contain 3 additional tables showing: (1) dependent and independent variables for all 50 states; (2) participation rates for the 14 most populous states; and (3) subregions' composition and participation rates.

Using U.S. Census Bureau data, emphasis is placed on socioeconomic changes that occurred during this decade. The report consists of specific sections devoted to each of these occupations, an overview and summary of findings, and a review of research methodology. Findings indicate that: (1) except for dancing, women and minorities are not represented in the performing arts in numbers proportionate to their representation in the general population; (2) performing artists have had to subsidize their earnings through either full-time or part-time jobs; (3) except for a very few performers, the performing  arts' occupations are low-paying; (4) no formal education requirements existed for entry into the profession; and (5) while performing jobs require migration, employment opportunities were rather evenly distributed throughout the United States. The bulk of the report consists of 80 appended tables supplying parallel data for each of the 2 years studied. Twenty-two references are also included. (JHP)",

In a special project, handicapped students use tape recorders with special switches to indicate to nonhandicapped elementary students what music appeals to them. With IPAINT, a computer program, the nonhandicapped students then create a visual pattern of colors to illustrate the music composed by the handicapped students. IPAINT notations increase student ability to understand music and deviate from standard musical notations in the following ways: (1) the music's texture is depicted by color; (2) the visual forms correlated with sound allow the music to be more easily &quot;heard&quot;; (3)  interpretation of the notations can vary to create new compositions; and (4) IPAINT musical notations are accessible to all students. In the future, special touch sensitive switches will be attached to the computer and adapted music software provided so that handicapped students can create their own compositions. (DJC)",

        "description":"This paper examines research studies that have concluded that elementary school children can learn more difficult and abstract social studies concepts than are taught in the traditional social studies curriculum. Research studies that focus on constraints on cognition, the use of embedded concepts, and understanding knowledge restructuring and acquisition and learning frameworks are cited in order to emphasize that if early learning does not occur, the optimum teaching opportunity for some concepts may pass, creating situations in which it becomes difficult for students to learn new ideas or to think critically about old ones. Specific social studies concepts that research indicates children may be ready to learn are presented under the topics of: (1) social perspectives; (2)  civic understanding; (3) time and space; and (4) economic understandings.

        "description":"This research study explores how sex role identity is related to the learning of communication and socialization processes in a Taiwanese kindergarten. The study hypothesized that undifferentiated baby-style verbal and nonverbal communication patterns are superceded with styles that become increasingly gender-linked, and language is viewed as a primary means by which children are socialized into gender roles and identities. This paper identifies related language and gender research studies and describes a specific study completed in Taipei (Taiwan) in 1984. Gender linked differences are illustrated in printed excerpts from two recorded children's dialogues. Results indicate that a patriarchical social order continues to exist in urban Taiwan. Gender roles that advocate unequality  between the sexes are learned as part of verbal and nonverbal communication patterns, and children acquire and practice gendered meanings that indicate a developing understanding of their proper places in the larger social order. Tables and a 30-item bibliography are included. (JHP)",

        "description":"In response to the Holmes and Carnegie reports that call for educational reforms in the teaching profession, this paper argues that the financial support for these future reforms will be diverted to fund the research to combat the emerging national crises that ultimately will threaten national security. Describing the emerging crises in this paper as being internal threats of significant magnitude, they are: (1) the prospective food shortage; (2) the energy shortage; (3) the greenhouse effect; (4) the cost of decommissioning nuclear plants; and (5) the cost of AIDS. In addition, other crises are listed as being additional financial drains on the funds that would be used for educational reforms. To fight these crises and to prevent future crises, a societal transformation is  required. However, research on U.S. society reveals that citizens are unwilling to give up their materialistic habits and have little interest in the self-denial or austerity that are needed to bring about this transformation. The admonition to U.S. society is then to live more simply, to preserve natural resources, and to build a new image for the future. (DJC)",

This ERIC Digest discusses: (1) reasons for including religion in the curriculum; (2) how religion is currently treated in the school curriculum; (3) guidelines for teaching religion in the classroom; and (4) resources available to implement in the curriculum. Religion is an active force in today's world, and for students to understand U.S. history and culture and the schisms in Ireland, the Middle East, and Afghanistan, for example, a thorough comprehension of religion is necessary. Citing the Supreme Court decisions written on Engle v. Vitale (1962) and Abington v. Schempp (1963) to support religion as an integral part of the curriculum, teachers,  administrators, and schoolboards are cited as barriers in their efforts to avoid controversy within the community. However, if guidelines are established, teaching religion can be included in the curriculum without public outcry. Some guidelines include the study of religion without practicing, imposing viewpoints, or converting to any particular religion and the infusion of accepted methods and materials while providing a balanced understanding of culture, society, and religion. Resources are available to aid teachers in teaching about religion while staying with the U.S. Supreme Court guidelines. An 11-item reference and ERIC resource list is included. (DJC)",

Critical thinking skills for making rational decisions about these issues are described as are participation skills in civic action projects. The rationale for the inclusion of STS in the curriculum stresses the need to develop capabilities of  synthesizing and applying knowledge from many academic disciplines. STS can be incorporated into the social studies curriculum by infusion into an existing history, geography, or civics course, extending an existing unit of study to include an activity based on a STS issue, or creating a separate course of study that focuses on current social problems and issues.

        "description":"This ERIC Digest on teaching about the Bill of Rights in the schools examines the status, the deficiencies, and means to improve citizenship education. Currently, the Bill of Rights is taught at least four times during the elementary and secondary grades. Constitutional rights and liberties are stressed in K-12 curriculum goals for social studies guides published by local school districts, state departments of education, and the National Assessment for Educational Progress. A thorough understanding of the Bill of Rights is necessary for responsible citizenship, but a variety of surveys of U.S. adults and high school students revealed that they are not retaining important knowledge, values, and attitudes about constitutional rights and liberties. The deficiencies that were noted  in these surveys are: (1) ignorance of the content and meaning of the Bill of Rights; (2) civic intolerance in application of constitutional liberties and rights; (3) misunderstanding of the federal judiciary's role in regard to Bill of Rights issues; and (4) inability to rationally analyze and judge issues. To improve this educational process, the Digest suggests: (1) teaching core concepts systematically through a rule-example-application strategy; (2) using case studies to teach skills in analyzing and judgment; and (3) establishing and maintaining an open classroom environment so that issues can be discussed. A 15-item reference and ERIC resources list is included. (DJC)",

        "description":"Survey data collected from 2,718 Dade County (Florida) public school teachers were analyzed to determine the relationship between teacher ethnic identity and patterns of perceived work rewards and incentives. Anglo, Black, and Cuban teachers were included in the survey. Results indicated that patterns of differences existed among the teacher ethnic groups. Black teachers were somewhat more satisfied with their jobs, schools, and principals than Anglo teachers. Intrinsic rewards related to \"reaching\" students were primary for all ethnic groups, but Black teachers perceived these at higher rates than Anglos. Differences existed in orientation toward individuals in authority positions and colleagues. There were few ethnic differences in perceptions of financial rewards and  incentives. Considerable mismatch was found between the types of students teachers from all ethnic groups wanted to teach and the students they actually taught. Implications for policymakers on incentives and on potential responses to various models of educational reform are discussed and policy recommendations for recruitment and retention are offered.

An introduction to the findings of the survey is devoted to a discussion of the teachers' perceptions of the important factors that influence their teaching in DCPS. Chief among these factors were what is viewed by the teachers as the difficult working conditions in the school system and the perceived high levels of teacher stress and burnout. Findings are reported on responses to interviews with 32 teachers and 16 administrators a survey questionnaire completed by 400 randomly selected DCPS teachers. Questions centered on: (1) What factors appear to influence teacher participation in staff  development or inservice programs currently operated by the DCPS? (2) What staff development topics are of interest to experienced teachers in DCPS? (3) What methods of program delivery, including format, are preferred by teachers in DCPS? and (4) What rewards or incentives are perceived necessary to motivate teachers to participate in DCPS staff development programs? Specific recommendations are made for action or policy in developing inservice programs. A 27-page literature review comprises the appendix. (JD)",

Because it was assumed that teachers' assessments of the value of various aspects of their training program would change with experience, two populations with different years of experience since graduation were selected, totaling 352 teachers. As representatives of the less experienced group, teachers in their second year of service were chosen. For the &quot;experienced&quot; sub-sample, people were selected who were mature and experienced but still sufficiently close to their training to be able to make valid judgements. There were 155 useable returns of the questionnaire (a 44% response rate). The questionnaire  was arranged in four sections: (1) personal descriptive data; (2) opinions on the value of academic and professional components of the program in post-graduate work; (3) attitude toward program components; and (4) general or global issues related to education.

Many and often conflicting conceptions of instruction are reviewed, summarizing what instruction entails, including the mental activities that occur when one is instructing. Two instances of research on studio instruction are presented, offering examples of the kinds of findings the systematic scrutiny of architectural teaching might bring.

About one-fourth of the teachers ranked good work habits and self-discipline and academic excellence among the two most important goals for students, while 14 percent believed that human relations skills were very important. Only a few teachers considered citizenship and special occupational skills very important, while 46 and 86 percent respectively considered them unimportant.

It did not take into consideration interpretation or creativity. Native Americans have had difficulty fitting into this mold of standardization. Traditional Native American teaching centered on interpretation and creativity. The use of legends and fables for teaching important life skills and understanding the world around them encouraged students to become independent creative thinkers. Students of traditional teachers were proficient in language and problem solving. Understanding and interpreting the message of stories was one of the primary means of teaching language and critical thinking. We  propose a curriculum model which relies on traditional teaching methods and uses Native American legends and fables to encourage the development of language proficiency and critical thinking. The model is based on oral tradition, but expands to include recent trade books written about Native American life and legends. It reflects the change from a single society to that of a more global world bringing in stories from various tribal groups. It is intended to enhance proficiency in both native language and English. The model brings back to Native Americans the traditional teaching which encouraged interpretation and creativity and makes them the center of the curriculum. (Author)",

Descriptions are given of each program, exploring such concepts as teacher recruitment, teacher renewal, rewards, and recognition. Some consideration is also given to the question of the efficacy of top-down state mandates. The report provides an informed impression of the two programs, the theories and  philosophies that undergird them, and the way they work in practice--not of individual administrators, teacher-participants, or schools. However, a broad response was sought from parties directly and indirectly involved with schools and teachers in New Jersey.

        "description":"A substantial proportion of teacher education institutions administer follow-up surveys to their graduates at some time or other, and many institutions repeat these surveys at regular intervals. Despite the prevalence of such surveys, most institutions develop and administer their own questionnaires without benefit of the experiences of others. The compendium of survey questions presented here is intended to rectify at least part of this problem. The items included in this compendium were culled from a number of existing follow-up survey questionnaires and are organized around the topics most frequently asked about in such questionnaires. For those situations in which analagous questions were asked by numerous institutions, this compendium provides the best formulations of these  commonly asked questions. Included in the compendium are items asking about demographic information, employment history, job satisfaction, current teaching context, perceived quality of teacher education programs, professional knowledge, teaching skills and dispositions, and teachers' views about continuing their professional growth.

Ordinary schools were chosen as the research subjects: two in high socioeconomic (SES) settings; two in middle SES settings, and two in low SES settings. Two Catholic schools were included--one middle-class college-bound, and the other predominantly working class. The schools were considered alternately as social structures, technical systems, cultural systems, and political systems. Similarities and variations in teachers' approach to their work in the classroom were considered by looking at a triangle composed of teachers' roles and behavior, the students' roles and behavior, and  the formal curriculum in use and the broader goals teachers pursued with students. Particular attention was paid to the multiple interacting differences that flow from communities and families in different social class situations into the schools. Social class was seen as having a pervasive and fundamental role in the internal lives of schools and teachers. (JD)",

Driven by need and ambition, many women worked as schoolteachers in the nineteenth century, although not necessarily attracted by the work itself. This essay focuses on Charlotte Bronte, examining the constraints and values that account for her choice of teaching as a career. It is based on two literary masterpieces: Charlotte Bronte's novel &quot;Villette&quot; and a biography of Bronte, (Mrs. Gaskell's &quot;Life of Charlotte Bronte&quot;). The aim is to provide reflection about conditions of teaching through the presentation of a woman's story, fictional and lived, with complex and concrete content, crafted with literary genius, and capable of bringing universal and time-bound questions to the attention of the reader. It accordingly raises  philosphical issues of general human interest in a specific context: questions concerning choice and change, freedom and love, self-realization and the pursuit of goodness. In particular, it urges a consideration of the paradox that many of the structural features of teaching regarded as evils today--such as eased entry, low retention, flat careers--fit with the lives of women that are typically contingent on or coordinated with the needs of others.

Two studies are presented that used different applications of the CAR. The first is a research study conducted in Tennessee (Project STAR) which focused on the effects of class size on student achievement and teachers' managerial and instructional behaviors. Descriptive information provided by the CAR allowed fine-grained analysis of the differences in instruction in larger and smaller classes. A sample  of these findings are presented. The second study involved the use of the system in training observers to use a beginning teacher assessment instrument, the Kansas Internship Assessment Inventory (KIAI).

Recognizing the key role teachers play in efforts to improve and expand our capacity as a nation to deal responsibly and effectively with these dimensions of American life, this project was designed to internationalize the Indiana University elementary teacher education program. The project goals stressed the development of a comprehensive interdisciplinary program involving required courses for elementary education majors. The courses are designed to: (1) incorporate international content through instructional models designed and tested by faculty; (2) provide cross-cultural, experiential learning involving international students, the use of  community resources and university area studies expertise; and (3) emphasize critical thinking, decision making modules and cooperative learning methods.

The test consisted of item responses of 451 male and 486 female ninth graders to 75 test items on the 1985 Cleveland Reading Competency Test. Focus was on sex bias. Simulated data were used to set cut-off scores for interpreting the item bias statistics. Each method led to the identification of nearly the same set of potentially biased items. Methodological problems included imprecision in establishing cut-off points, Type I errors, and poor item parameter estimates. Results highlight the importance of the choice of interval on the ability  scale over which item bias is measured. It appears that the Mantel-Haenszel statistic provides a quick, cheap alternative to the more laborious and expensive item response theory methods. Seven graphs and four tables are included. (TJH)",

Evaluation of the program involved pre-testing and post-testing at each site on achievement in reading, mathematics, and writing; pre-testing and post-testing on self-esteem and self-efficacy; and surveying participants, teachers, and program coordinators on their assessments of the programs. A total of 1,182 participants and 47 teachers completed assessment surveys. During the subsequent school year (1986-87), 1,128 HJTPC students were tracked in terms of: course grades, course proficiency test scores, performance on the Texas Educational Assessment of Minimum Skills, school  attendance, and dropout rates. Comparison data were obtained on 1,128 Houston Independent School District students. Results indicate that: (1) program providers should be required to demonstrate the adequacy of their facilities; (2) a longer planning period is needed; (3) each program site should have a coordinator; and (4) a system for receiving and reviewing complaints should be established. The HJTPC programs were not particularly effective in improving the performance or attendance of participants. However, upper-level high school students were helped by the program; they were probably motivated to complete academic requirements for graduation. (TJH)",

        "description":"Data from the authors' previous research (1979, 1980, 1987), consisting of responses to five masculinity-femininity (M-F), two esteem, and two social desirability instruments, were reanalyzed. The subjects were 104 male and 133 female college students who completed the: Bem Sex Role Inventory, Personal Attributes Questionnaire, ANDRO instrument and Social Desirability Scale from the Personality Research Form, Femininity Scale of the California Psychological Inventory, Masculinity versus Femininity Scale of the Comrey Personality Scales, Feelings of Inadequacy Scale, and Self-Acceptance Scale. Correlations between M and F for the five M-F instruments varies from 0.23 to about -1.0. Support for distinguishable (non-bipolar) M and F factors was found for four of the instruments.  Applying confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and hierarchical CFA, the dimensionality of M-F and the influence of method/halo effects in responses to specific instruments were studied. The best fitting model identified three higher-order factors. In support of traditional personality theories, one factor was a bipolar M-F construct, but in support of androgyny theory, the other two factors were distinguishable M and F factors. The factor structures were reasonably invariant for men and women; methodological implications of this finding are substantial. In subsequent analyses, the higher-order M-F factors were related to esteem, social desirability, and gender in order to further test interpretations of the M-F factors.

        "description":"During the last 15 years, there has been a steady increase in the popularity and sophistication of the confirmatory factor analysis approach to multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) data. However, important problems exist, the most serious being the ill-defined solutions that plague MTMM studies and the assumption that so-called method factors primarily reflect the influence of method effects. In three different MTMM studies--by T. M. Ostrom (1969), B. M. Byrne and R. J. Shavelson (1986), and H. W. Marsh and R. Ireland (1984)--ill-defined solutions were frequent and alternative parameterizations designed to solve this problem tended to mask the symptoms instead of eliminating the problem. More importantly, so-called method factors apparently represented trait variance in addition to, or  instead of, method variance for at least some models in all three studies. Further support for this counter interpretation of method factors was found when external validity criteria were added to the MTMM models and correlated with the trait and so-called method factors. This problem invalidates the traditional interpretation of trait and method factors and the comparison of different MTMM models. A new specification of method effects as correlated uniqueness instead of method factors was found to be less prone to ill-defined solutions and, apparently, to the confounding of trait and method effects. Two tables conclude the document. (Author/TJH)",

These analyses, however, were based on traditional applications of multiple regression with its implausible assumptions that variables are measured without error and that residuals are uncorrelated. The present study demonstrates tests for mean differences on latent constructs using the LISREL approach to multi-group structural equation modelling for this substantively important issue. Data on 10,507 students from 853 public and 80 Catholic high schools were analyzed. Public/Catholic differences, even after controlling for  background and sophomore outcomes, favored Catholic high school students on senior year outcomes (achievement, educational aspirations, and academic course selection) and subsequent college attendance. These public/Catholic differences were similar for students differing in race, socioeconomic status, and initial ability. However, public/Catholic differences in achievement, educational aspirations, and college attendance were apparently mediated by the academic orientation of course selection. The flexibility, advantages, and limitations of this multi-group structural equation modelling approach are discussed. Six tables and multiple figures and equations conclude the document.

The second study, undertaken to remedy shortcomings of the first, involved refinement of the following categories resulting from the first study (exaggeration/understatement, contrast, audience knowledge, emotion, taboo, aggression, and repetition). These categories were tested for interrater agreement using undergraduate participants trained to recognize the categories. Definitions of the categories were developed.

The table is indexed by effect size, by significance level, and by power level for the two-tailed test that a proportion equals some constant. An alternative approach based upon the construction of a confidence interval is discussed and dismissed.

        "description":"One question regarding the utility of adaptive testing is the effect of individualized item arrangements on examinee test scores. The purpose of this study was to analyze the item difficulty choices by examinees as a function of previous item performance. The examination was a 25-item test of basic algebra skills given to 36 students in an introductory statistics course at a large midwestern university during the fall 1985 semester. The test was administered via a microcomputer. Categorical data identifying the subjects' performance on current item, feedback condition, and choice of difficulty for next item were submitted to a log-linear analysis. A significant performance on current item by choice of difficulty for next item interaction was found. When examinees did not answer  the current item correctly, they tended to request an easier item next; when they correctly answered the current item, they tended to request a harder item next. Preference for the difficulty of the next item appears to be a function of how well students believe they performed on the current item. Most adaptive testing item selection algorithms identify an easier item to be administered upon incorrect performance and a harder item subsequent to successful item performance. Results of this study suggest that this selection algorithm is congruent with examinee selected item difficulty. A table and a graph present study data. (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"A methodology for investigating the influence of correction-for-guessing directions and formula scoring on test performance was studied. Experts in the test content field used a judgmental item appraisal system to estimate the knowledge of the minimally competent candidate (MCC) and to predict those items that the MCC would omit on the test under correction-for-guessing and formula scoring directions. The ability of these experts to anticipate test behavior correctly was examined using a 28-item five option multiple choice mathematics achievement test requiring a clear statement when an item was omitted. A total of 156 students at a large midwestern university in the fall of 1985 took the examination. Ten professors using the Nedelsky method served as judges. The judges did a  reasonable, although imperfect, job of picking items to be omitted. Results suggest that expert judgment may be used to assist researchers in formula scoring studies. (SLD)",

Focus was on assessing the nature and quality of teacher-made tests used in public school classrooms and describing the classroom teachers' testing preferences. It was found that the classroom teachers prepared and administered many formal teacher-made tests during the school year (X=54.1); they wrote most of their own test items; they most frequently used multiple-choice, matching, and short response items but infrequently used essay items; they infrequently completed post-hoc statistical analyses of their tests; most teachers' tests and test items functioned primarily at the  knowledge cognitive level with the exception of the math tests; and matching exercises followed by completion and essay items contained the most construction errors per exercise. Item cognitive functioning levels, testing practices, and item construction error frequencies significantly differed when the tests and teacher survey responses were classified by grade level and by subject area, but only cognitive functioning levels differed by the amount of teaching experience or school setting (urban, rural, and suburban).

In addition, institution results were compared with the scores of all state BFTTs (N=3,025) for the two time periods. The purpose was to determine the effect of an intervention program designed to teach the state identified essential teaching competencies--the Competency Based/Computer Assisted Teacher Education Program--on FTCE results. Statistically significant differences were found in the performance of the institution sample pre- and post-1985 on the subtests addressed by the intervention program. A  statistically significant sex difference was found on the mathematics subtest. Moreover, the institution's overall passing rate increased by 100%, while the state overall passing rate for BFTTs remained the same pre- and post-1985. Three tables summarize data. (SLD)",

The tests' authors emphasized the importance of distinguishing self-perceptions in the physical, social, academic, and general content domains. Tests of this content specificity included factor analyses, multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) analyses, and patterns of correlations with additional criterion variables. The subjects were 510 7th, 8th, and 9th graders (42% female) from two single-sex private high schools in Sydney, Australia. The subjects' motivation and mathematics and reading achievement were also studied. Contrary to previous research, MTMM analyses of responses  to the two self-concept instruments demonstrated their convergent and discriminant validity, apparently reflecting the improved design of these newer instruments. These findings and factor analyses of responses to the self-concept instruments support claims by S. Harter (1982) and by H. W. Marsh. For the perceived control instrument, however, there was little support for the discriminant validity of responses with respect to content domains other than the physical domain, calling into question claims by J.

Natural language understanding and vision systems are the areas of concentration. In simplest terms, the goal is to norm a given natural language system's performance on a sample of people. The specific program under study is a natural language query system, IRUS--an interface between the user and the information desired. IRUS is designed to serve as a general purpose interface to a broad range of databases and expert systems. A pilot study is discussed, which was conducted with early elementary school and preschool students to determine the appropriate language understanding level at which to administer the IRUS test. In the vision area,  common measures of visual tasks are being analyzed in terms of their appropriateness to the vision system. This is the inverse of the language exploration that began with the tasks and created the measures. A review by the vision community of approaches they would use to compare human and machine vision will determine if looking for consistent benchmarks is a feasible approach. (SLD)",

There are, therefore, two streams of government financing of low-income housing: an HUD stream and a welfare stream. This report, examining the efficiency, equity, and overall effectiveness of housing aid, found the following: (1) there is considerable overlap between the goals and the clientele of HUD and HHS programs; (2) the system guarantees that program recipients will live in substandard housing and that  similar individuals in different locations will not be treated equally; and (3) the system is ineffective: 46 percent of all welfare households spend more than half their income on housing, 13 percent are overcrowded, and 29 percent live in physically substandard units. Recommendations are made for future policies that will restructure the current system by reducing inequities, improving efficiency, and increasing flexibility. Budgeting issues are discussed. The national commitment to low-income housing must be reinstated. Data are exhibited on 32 tables. Appendices provide additional data. (BJV)",

        "description":"Aid to Families with Dependent Children for Unemployed Parents (AFDC-UP) is a state option under which cash aid is provided to two-parent families whose principal earner is unemployed or employed less than 100 hours a month. As of January 1988, 27 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam had AFDC-UP. This report reviews the following: (1) available cost estimates of requiring states to adopt AFDC-UP; and (2) research on AFDC-UP's effect on families. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) 1993 Federal and state cost estimates for requiring AFDC-UP under H.R. 1720--$945 million and $961 million, respectively--and S. 1511--$915 million and $1.090 billion--are similar. CBO's and HHS's estimates for H.R. 1720 differ mostly on food  stamp costs; on S. 1511 they differ mostly on Medicaid costs. Mathematica Policy Research's estimates for H.R. 1831 and an identical bill, S. 862, are also reviewed. Very little information was found about AFDC-UP's family stability effects; the information found is of little relevance to the current proposals. Data are presented on three tables. One of the two appendixes lists the data bases reviewed in the literature search for this report; the other describes selected provisions of the welfare reform proposals discussed. (BJV)",

The following aspects were examined: (1) compliance with the requirements of Public Law 100-202, which imposes hiring regulations; (2) regional offices; (3) civil rights monitoring; (4) consultants; (5) temporary employees; (6) mission-related external services contracts; (7) Schedule C employees (these are GS-15s or below with policymaking roles or confidential working relationships with top appointed officials); (8) special assistants to Commissioners; and (9) Commissioners. As of March 31, 1988, the Commission was found to be in compliance with each of the fiscal year 1988 line item appropriations and other limitations. However, the Commission needs to recompute its obligations for temporary  employees: the Commission's original calculations did not include amounts for all temporary employees or benefits for any of them. These omissions may have caused the Commission to unknowingly exceed the legal limitation by the end of the fiscal year. The Chairman of the Commission had used 75 percent of his billable days as of April 9, 1988.

        "description":"During Summer 1986, the Division of Special Education of the New York City Board of Education operated a Chapter 1 Summer Program, Reading and Math with Athletics, which served a total of 1,625 students at 13 sites for six weeks. Students received morning instruction: one period per day each in reading, mathematics, and in athletic and recreational activities. The Big Apple Sports Program sponsored the athletic and recreational activities for a 4-week period. In addition, students had one cultural or recreational trip per week. Program personnel incorporated athletic activities into reading and math instruction, and used a holistic, meaning-centered approach to reading instruction. The sports curriculum component and the trips enhanced student motivation to learn reading and  math. In reading, over 78 percent of the 1,314 participating students (who took both pretest and posttest) showed a gain of at least two points on the Reading Metropolitan Achievement Test (MAT); the mean gain was 5.3 points. In math, almost 79 percent of the 1,332 participating students showed a gain on the Math MAT of at least two points; the mean gain was 4.4 points. Program staff indicated that they wanted more audio-visual equipment and instructional materials. Recommendations for improving the program are offered. Data are presented on eight tables. (BJV)",

The students and their families were then tested on various instruments. Findings are presented in the following areas: (1) family characteristics; (2) family practices and perceptions; (3) student characteristics; and (4) academic performance and school involvement. Among the conclusions are the following: (1) parental social class is a fundamental determinant of educational success; (2) scholastic demoralization, which begins several years before entry into high  school, is a primary cause of educational marginality and dropping out; (3) integration in the majority culture facilitated academic success, but success at school was neither fostered nor handicapped by maintaining one's loyalty to Hispanic language and culture; and (4) participation in extracurricular activities at school fostered academic success by means of reinforcing the social bonding within the school culture. Recommendations for Colorado schools are offered. Data are presented on nine figures. A brief list of references is included.

The design of Chapter 1/Title I is analyzed. The following alternative program designs are compared according to several standard criteria: (1) subsidies to assist (or induce) state and local public school systems to change their service delivery  patterns; (2) contracts with nongovernmental organizations to deliver certain services or serve designated groups; and (3) transfers of purchasing power to students or their parents.

It is now time to question some of the basic policies of Chapter 1 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act in view of the change in conceptions about the Federal role and the recent state and local reform movement. There have been the following alternative modes of Federal action for public schools: (1) general aid; (2) stimulation through differential funding; (3) regulation; (4) dissemination of research results; (5) provision of technical assistance to help build capacity at other levels of government and the private sector; and (6) exertion of moral suasion through the use of the &quot;bully pulpit.&quot; The evolution of the Federal role is  traced; under the Reagan Administration the bully pulpit--which affects the early stages of policymaking, and education research priorities and trends--has become the central government role. The implications of this for Chapter 1 are discussed. There is a need to reorient the Federal role from routine fiscal monitoring and data collection without obliterating the special services basis of Chapter 1 for a particular group of children. Recommendations for improving the Federal role are offered. A list of references is provided. (BJV)",

        "description":"In 1985 the Supreme Court ruled that funding school districts for purposes of aiding children at the parochial schools they attend is unconstitutional. Now it is virtually impossible for parochial schools to receive aid. In order for Chapter 1 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act to serve all eliglbe children, including those enrolled in religious schools, funding should be allocated on the basis of the individual child. The child is the best unit of funding for the following reasons: (1) funding the individual allows by-passing the public school system (and state systems as well), providing direct support for the family and children, permitting them to attend parochial schools; (2) funding the individual places the locus of decisionmaking as to what kind of  schooling a child should receive with the family, where it rightly belongs; and (3) funding the individual creates an education market, allowing families to &quot;shop&quot; for schools, and schools to compete for clients. Political considerations are examined, and the history of parochial schools in America is reviewed. Alternatives to using the public school system to deliver Chapter 1 services, such as allowing local education authorities to issue their own vouchers to local parochial school students, are discussed.

Working definitions of the following aspects of program delivery are presented as a means of establishing evaluation criteria: (1) the resources applied to a local program (input); (2) the operating characteristics of local programs (process); and (3) the consequences of local programs for students (output). The following Federal strategies for enhancing quality are reviewed: (1) the systematic use of information to draw attention to either good or bad behavior (jawboning); (2) the use of discretionary funding to reward and claim credit for local successes (piggybacking); and (3) the use of  discretionary funding to underwrite program development in the most difficult circumstances (bootstrapping).

        "author":["Odden, Allan"],
        "description":"This paper reviews the economic and political science literature, and the literature on Chapter 1/Title I in order to identify policy options that retain adequate fiscal accountability as well as insure program quality. Chapter 1 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 is the successor to Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The current structure of Chapter 1--the law and its accompanying rules and regulations--is adequate for insuring fiscal accountability; the means for implementing this structure at the state and local level are firmly developed and function relatively well. The quality of Chapter 1 programs depends primarily on the quality of curriculum and teaching in local school districts, two areas essentially beyond direct  influence by the Federal government. Nevertheless, there are several strategies available to the Federal government for improving Chapter 1 program quality, including the following: (1) requiring all Chapter 1 sites to have a schoolwide education improvement program with Chapter 1 integrated into it; (2) requiring Chapter 1 services to be aligned with the regular educational program so Chapter 1 will help low-achieving students to learn the regular curriculum; (3) conditioning receipt of Chapter 1 funds on schools implementing strategies from the effective teaching and schools research; and (4) providing new funds for states to develop model curriculum guides for a strengthened academic program, a testing program to assess student progress in that program, and supplemental instructional  strategies and materials to help educationally disadvantaged students. A list of references is included. (BJV)",

        "description":"In order to improve desegregation of the elementary schools, and the low achievement level of elementary schools with high concentrations of poor and minority students, the Massachusetts Board of Education placed a coordinated approach to improving urban schools first among its objectives. The following educational objectives were set for each school: (1) strengthening overall educational leadership; (2) identifying student strengths and needs, and providing programs and services to meet them; and (3) enabling school staff to acquire additional skills to manage and make coordinated, effective use of local, state, and Federal resources. Lessons from Massachusetts' desegregation efforts and from compensatory programs are discussed. Efforts to improve education should be focused on  the school, not the school system or the student. The development of a coordinated strategy to improve education is outlined, and the state-level actions necessary for implementing such a strategy are identified.

        "description":"The history of schooling is a mix of constancy and change in policies, organizational structures, school practices, and classroom pedagogy. Over the last century and a half, well-intentioned and serious reformers, using Federal, state, and local policies, tirelessly and repeatedly tried to improve schooling. Classroom and school practices such as lecturing, using textbooks, grouping by ability, and rating teachers' performance were present in the 1890s, the 1930s, and at the time that Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (1965) became law. Understanding what is constant and what changes in American classrooms and schools is essential foreknowledge for any policymaker interested in improvement. This paper provides a historical review of classroom organization,  elementary and secondary school structures, conflicting district and state goals and policies. The structure of schooling and its effect on the poor and children of color are discussed. State efforts at school improvement are reviewed. Five lessons from state and Federal improvement efforts are drawn. The goals of reformers over time are analyzed. A brief list of references is included. (BJV)",
