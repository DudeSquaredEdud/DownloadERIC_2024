        "description":"The study undertook to teach and fix the reading of meaningful symbols (hiragana, the Japanese syllabary alphabet, and kanji, Chinese characters) to a mildly retarded 7 year old Japanese boy. The phonological method was used to teach hiragana and pictures were used to teach kanji. Behavior modification using reinforcement and time out was employed. Results showed that the boy retained 90% of the letters taught by the phonological approach but was unable to retain the kanji numbers because his concept of numbers was as yet unformed. All reinforcement techniques and the time out procedure enhanced learning. Following treatment the boy's behavior changed; he correctly wrote the letters he had acquired, stopped getting out of his seat during class, and stopped crying so easily.  (PHR)",

Following an introduction by K. Wyatt, a paper titled &quot;Categorizing Children and Funds&quot; by M. Reynolds addresses the problems associated with categorizing exceptional children and with tying the funding to children who are identified with a label. Dr. Reynolds advocates the funding of personnel or programmatic units which would have great flexibility in delivering services to all high risk children. In &quot;Issues in Early Childhood for the Handicapped,&quot; J. Gallagher stresses the value of early childhood programs and outlines the structural problems presenting barriers to the establishment of eary childhood  programs. He calls for multidisciplinary approaches to the problem with CEC assuming the leadership in initiating a broad reaching interdisciplinary plan for extending preschool programs for handicapped children. The final paper, &quot;A New International Role for CEC&quot; by S. Ashcroft, makes 11 proposals for increased CEC involvement in international special education leadership. Following each paper are excerpts from discussions by prominent individuals in the field of special education. (SBH)",

For the purposes of this study, Shaw and Wright's definition of attitude was accepted, that is, an evaluative reaction of the affective order. The four parts of the study describe the following: (1) the preparation of the instrument; (2) the reaction of the adolescents to a number of photographs and visual stereotypes illustrating the two principal Canadian cultures; (3) an analysis of the importance of attitude and aptitude in learning a second language; and (4) an inventory of the variables that can influence linguistic attitudes. Results seem to indicate the need to look for new factors affecting attitude, while accepting some of the traditional  influences.

        "description":"The existence of a global language proficiency factor is discussed. This factor, cognitive/academic language proficiency (CALP), is directly related to IQ and to other aspects of academic achievement. It accounts for the bulk of reliable variance in a wide variety of language learning measures. Three propositions concerning CALP are reviewed. (1) CALP can be empirically distinguished from interpersonal communicative skills such as accent and fluency in first language (L1) and second language (L2). (2) CALP proficiencies in both L1 and L2 are manifestations of the same underlying dimension. (3) Because the same dimension underlies CALP in both L1 and L2, older learners, whose proficiency is better developed, will acquire L2 CALP more rapidly than younger learners. The relevance of  this analysis for the concepts of semilingualism, code-switching, and bilingual education is outlined. Semilingualism is a manifestation of low CALP in both languages. CALP will be less active and effective when the L1 and the L2 are very dissimilar. In the presence of negative affective variables such as low motivation, CALP will not be applied to learning L2. If motivational involvement and adequate exposure to an L1 or L2 exist, CALP will be promoted in both languages regardless of which is the language of instruction. (PMJ)",

        "description":"Attitudes of four groups of elementary school students toward 10 socially relevant concepts, e.g., &quot;self,&quot;&quot;monolingual French Canadians,&quot;&quot;bilingual English Canadians,&quot; and other areas are studied. Two of the groups were grade five and six English-speaking Canadian Students who had participated in either an &quot;early&quot; or a &quot;late&quot; French immersion program. For purposes of comparison, an otherwise comparable group of English-speaking Canadian students with no French immersion experience was included, along with a group of French-speaking Canadian students in a totally French-language school program. The paired dissimilarity ratings of the 10 concepts were subjected to multidimensional scaling analyses and analyses of variance. The results indicate that while language and ethnicity  (French vs. English) were important dimensions along which all four groups judged social similarities, extensive experience with the other group's language (as exemplified here in &quot;early&quot; French immersion experience) led to a reduction in the extensity of the language-ethnicity dimension. It also reduced the differences perceived between self, one's own ethno-linguistic group, and the relevant other ethno-linguistic group. (Author/SW)",

        "description":"&quot;Subtractive&quot; bilingualism in Northern Belize is analyzed based on an extension of a model by Wallace Lambert. The impact of English language instruction on Spanish speaking children in Corozal Town, the northernmost urban center in the British colony of Belize, Central America, is described. This description extends an earlier account of education and bilingualism there (Rubinstein, 1979) and seeks to make explicit the links between social and cognitive processes in the development of Spanish-English bilingualism in Corozal Town. Lambert's distinction between additive and subtractive bilingualism is considered, and an attempt is made to distinguish between different types of subtractive bilingualism, the processes that underlie them, and the environmental conditions in which  each may occur. A random sample of 56 Spanish speaking children between the ages of 5 and 17 was divided into two groups stratified by age and sex. One group was tested and interviewed in Spanish, and the other was tested and interviewed in English. It is concluded that the learning of English by Spanish speaking children in Corozal Town is socially subtractive because of the milieu in which it occurs: English is often taught with the intention that it replace students' first language (not that it supplements it), and this view is shared by many adults and children. The cognitive enhancement view of bilingualism does not recognize that the social setting of the bilingual experience may have cognitive consequences. (SW)",

        "description":"Language-related attitudinal differences between two bilingual students at the University of Texas at El Paso are examined. The student designated &quot;R&quot; is found to exhibit language loyalty to both English and Spanish. Spanish is his language of choice chiefly when his conversational partner expects Spanish. Student &quot;L&quot; maintains preferential loyalty to Spanish, which he uses invariably with all Mexican- Americans. R and L were raised in similar families, schooled in apparently identical environments, and live in the same neighborhood. Standard sociolinguistic questionnaires provide no explanation for the attitudinal differences between the two. Closer examination of the students' background leads to the conclusion that the differences stem from two factors. First, though both  students' mothers are virtually Spanish monolingual, R's mother left her middle-class Mexican home in her twenties, after receiving a high school education, while L's mother left her working-class home in her teens, after receiving an eighth-grade education. Second, L, unlike R, spent his first eleven years and received his elementary education in El Paso's Segundo Barrio, a slum district. These findings imply that portraits of one's subjects, based on close personal acquaintance, can be a more effective research tool than standardized questionnaires. (JB)",

        "description":"In May 1979 a survey of ten California public postsecondary institutions was undertaken, at the request of the state commission, to learn the impact of enrollment and financial uncertainty on the institutions. Surveyed were these community college districts: El Camino, Mt. San Jacinto, San Jose, San Mateo County, and San Diego; also surveyed were the California State University at Dominguez Hills, California State University at Hayward, San Diego State University, the University of California at Davis, and the University of California at Los Angeles. Questionnaires were sent to the chief executive officers, and field interviews were conducted. Results are discussed in this report under five chapter headings: (1) the character of uncertainty (enrollment, budgetary, and other  factors such as collective bargaining, accountability requirements, student preparation, shifting student interests, physical plant, and unclear governmental policies) and its differential impact on segments of the institution's community; (2) the concept and context of stress as it is studied here; (3) institutional response; (4) institutional processes for the orderly resolution of program planning and budgeting issues (governance, budgeting, planning, and program review); and (5) concluding observations regarding institutional procedures and autonomy, coordination and control, state government, and community services policy. It is suggested that virtually all of California's public higher education institutions will survive as organizational entities; but to do more than simply  survive, they must maintain program quality and processes that impose order on uncertainty to the extent possible. Advisory committees for the survey are listed. (MSE)",

        "description":"A 16-item questionnaire was used to survey 60 college and university presidents and 61 board chairmen in six Middle Atlantic states in order to explore distinctions between the policy and the administration functions in the president-trustee relationship. Personal intrviews were conducted with ten of the chairmen and ten presidents as a followup to the questionnaire. Respondents in both survey and interviews disagreed on a number of the issues as to whether they are policy or administration functions. For example, 65 percent of the trustees labeled the board's engagement of a consultant to review institutional direction as a policy issue, the same percentage described the elimination of a department as administrative. Presidents divided almost evenly on both these matters. In  addition, many respondents were inconsistent within their own responses. The survey demonstrates the difficulty inherent in using the policy-administration distinction to clarify or explain the president-trustee relationship. The issues are so interrelated that it is difficult to divide responsibility on this basis. Rather, personal relationships emerge as the most important aspect of the relationship. Consequently, an evaluation of the relationship should include the ability of the chairman and the president to work cooperatively in fulfilling their respective responsibilities in governance. The trustee-presidential relations survey questions are appended. (Author/MSE)",

        "description":"Using two complimentary data sets, the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 and the Study of Academic Prediction and Growth, the conventional interpretation of educational plans as motives and thus determinants of educational attainment is questioned. It was found that when questioned about their educational loans: (1) as many as 20 percent of youth supply extemporaneous responses; (2) another 20 percent report goals of quite recent formulation; and (3) the remainder report long-term commitments (of at least two to five years). The last are so long-standing as to make suspect the causal ordering used in most models of adolescent attainment. That is, such plans are not properly considered as the products of high school experiences. It is also documented  that senior year measures of educational goals are often quite contaminated by prior knowledge of one's actual prospects for college. Finally, the analyses make suspect the assumption that educational plans reflect exclusively, or even primarily, underlying motivation or achievement orientation. This finding makes it difficult to sustain the customary interpretation of the influences of student &quot;plans.&quot; (Author/MSE)",

An analysis of the outlook for enrollments follows. Data are given on enrollment trends since 1951, according to sector (public versus private), institution type, and degree level and subject area. Demographic profiles illustrate a forecast of enrollment trends through 2,000. The geographic distributionof the traditional college-age population is outlined, and graduate and professional education populations are also discussed. Financial data on recent funding and funding trends in private and public institutions and on faculty illustrate a discussion of revenue and fiscal capacity,  especially as they are affected by the federal government. It is concluded that increasingly intense competition for students will be important in higher education economics in the 1980s, and there will be continuing efforts to economize. The intellectual vitality of the faculty is seen as important to the health of higher education, though the demand for new, younger faculty members is foreseen to be very small in the near future.

Information regarding access to higher education for the poor, minorities, women, and the middle class is presented, and the source of funds for financial aid and the methods of distributing those funds are discussed. In the private sector, private money provided the subsidy while in the state systems public institutional support permitted tuition to remain relatively low, and expansion of capacity made it possible for virtually anyone seeking a place to find  one. The federal government is a relatively new part of this enterprise, but in a fairly short period of time its role has grown enormously. Promoting equality of opportunity has been the federal government's single most visible and identifiable goal with respect to higher education. Information about participation in higher education based on family income, race, family income and aptitude taken jointly, and sex is presented. The state of the job market for college graduates is briefly considered. The determination of a student's need for financial aid includes taking into account the expected parents' contribution.

A review of the economic outlook for higher education in the near future is given, with attention to enrollment trends, rising costs, and age distribution for faculty for 1972 and projected for 1990. Competition for students is discussed. The current debate over whether the economic burden on families is increasing is discussed in detail, illustrated by data on students costs in a number of institutions. Pricing and eligibility policies and formulas are discussed and charted. Elements of the discussion are student expense budgets, expected parental contribution, and public versus private sectors. It is noted that the current system of student financial aid has two important  characteristics to consider: (1) it is a thoroughly developed, pervasive, and well-functioning system of price discrimination; and (2) the system's outcome depends on two forces: those establishing prices and those establishing policy for adjusting them, which in higher education are often separate groups. It is concluded that the present system has these results: it helps eliminate the tuition gap; and the expected family contribution as a percentage of family income is at a maximum for the family that just fails to qualify for aid. Several problems are foreseen in the future of the current system: sensitivity to student costs, and competitive pricing; loss of financial privacy of families of applicants for aid; efforts to depart from the need-based system to attract students; and a need  for fairness in treatment of independent students.

Major factors seen to affect the research universities are financial resources and their ramifications: complex competition for state funds; alleged over- and underproduction of highly trained personnel; inadequate means for assessing costs and benefits of graduate education and research; and inconsistent criteria for establishing and dismantling graduate programs. The high  undergraduate dropout rate is viewed as contributing to the problems of research universities, and may be a result of these factors: the decline of general education, emphasis on graduate programs, emphasis on faculty research and publication, and growing departmentalization. Other factors affecting the future of these institutions are competition among universities and collective bargaining for the faculty. (MSE)",

Finance, enrollment, and competition are the three major elements seen to threaten these institutions' futures. They face an uncertain financial future since historically they receive less federal and state funds than their chief competitors, the comprehensive colleges and universities. The small colleges may have to change their characters and constituencies in order to compete for funds. Some options are discussed, including lowering faculty salaries or using unrestricted endowments for operating costs. Enrollment decline may also be especially great in these traditionally nonvocational colleges. In the  area of competition, the major difference between the small colleges and their rivals the two- and four-year public colleges is that the former can offer greater diversity. It is noted that the new roles and loss of diversity accepted by small colleges in reaction to enrollment declines may have spawned unfortunate compromises. (MSE)",

The pressures of continued bugetary constraints will be felt in every phase and at every level of the academic community, and the responses to these pressures will, in large measure, determine the complexion of private higher education into the next century. The ability of management to be meaningfully responsive in such an environment will be greatly influenced by: (1) the level of involvement--top management actively participating in establishing priorities; (2) the systems available--rapidly changing technology causing resultant changes in policy/procedural and people systems; (3) successful communication--information dissemination depending upon formal and informal channels and consistency in  decision-making. This exploration of the interdependencies of these elements in a mid-sized private institution utilizes the perspective that decision-making is the vital art in meeting the needs of educational management as it confronts the issues of the 80's.

The focus is on the performance of the user and the system in individual interaction sessions with the basic data of interest being the number and rate of characters sent by user and system, and latencies or delays prior to and during transmission by either party. Analysis of the data consists of grouping according to two independent criteria: maximum operating line speed of the terminal and type of application. The data are grouped according to these  criteria and cumulative frequency distributions are computed for each of 14 parameters of the model. Non-parametric tests are used to determine the significance of differences in the distributions of different sets of data. The methodology itself is the major contribution of the study, providing a quantitative way to investigate a variety of phenomena associated with interactive computing. The most interesting specific finding from the data collected is the increase in output data length as the terminal speed increases. (Author/RAO)",

An experimental study asked 77 undergraduates to master and utilize one of three forms of an algorithm: a prose discourse, a flowchart procedure, or a mastery-inducing flowchart technique. Also examined were the effects of the presence or absence of the algorithm in subsequent problem solving and the learners' ability to retain the algorithmic content over a period of time. Both test scores and times were subjected to analyses of variance. The results provided strong data for the overall effectiveness of algorithms, showing from 52 percent to over 80 percent accuracy following an average of less than 15 minutes of instruction and  practice. Almost no decrement (only one percent) in performance was observed after a one week delay. Subjects did perform better when allowed continued use of the algorithmic representation, and the flowchart group was much more efficient than the other groups. The interactions suggested differential desirability of instructional strategy depending on the training needs. (Author/JEG)",

The program has experienced a shift away from early efforts to offer specialized instruction in a variety of courses and course sections in the humanities toward development, over several years, of instruction on two levels. The first involves integration of instruction into an English composition course, proceeding to a second level that will involve instructional components keyed to selected courses in the major and minor sequences of various academic departments in the humanities, emphasizing the bibliography and literature of the particular  humanities discipline. Two essential factors will determine future prospects for bioliographic instruction at Ball State University: one is the willingness and ability of the department of library service to produce and use various media methods for instruction; the other is the department's success in organizing its range of instruction and orientation activities, especially the CLRI program and the present general instruction service, into a cohesive and unified program.

The introduction presents a review of the current literature, hypotheses concerning the motivation and methods of adult learning, and assumptions made for this survey. The questionnaire was administered to a national probability sample of 1051 adults aged 18 and over by interviewers on a one-to-one basis. The presentation and statistical analysis of responses to the questionnaire focus on various aspects of continuing learning through self-initiated learning projects: reasons people prefer to learn on their own; how they become involved; learning goals; number, type, and length of projects; suggested means of evaluation; preferred  categories in which self-learning takes place; and use of supporting information for a learning project. Results are discussed in terms of four types of adult learners: (1) combination learners, who conduct their own learning projects and participate in some type of course; (2) self-initiating learners, who conduct their own learning projects; (3) formal learners; and (4) non-learners. Implications for professionals including librarians serving the learning needs of adults are discussed. Appendices contain a 20-page bibliography, glossary of terms, survey questionnaire on individual self-planned learning, and an explanation of interviewing and sampling procedures by Opinion Research Corporation, who administered the survey.

        "description":"Despite the community college's historical commitment to the availability of comprehensive education for all citizens, Hispanics have yet to receive a fair share of programs and services. General demographic data, as well as regional and national longitudinal studies, reveal that Hispanic participation and success in all levels of the educational process are not proportional to the ratio of Hispanics in the total population. In addition, the number of Hispanic professionals in higher education has never come close to being proportional to the number of Hispanics in the total population or to the number of Hispanic students. Even in community colleges, which have traditionally enrolled the majority of Hispanic students, the proportion of Hispanics who graduate is significantly  less than that of Whites or Blacks. To ameliorate this situation, community colleges should rely less upon traditional English-language instruction and provide more bilingual programs. These programs would insure a much needed boost in enrollment, and, at the same time, help the colleges meet the promise of equal educational opportunity. In addition to providing a brief history of the community colleges since 1901 and a discussion of the philosophical bases, functions, and purposes of the community college, the report contains numerous data tables presenting demographic data about Hispanics and other ethnic and racial groups in the United States.

First, the review refers to studies acknowledging the benefits of bilingual education and other studies that reveal the lengthy history of bilingual programs, as well as the rarity of such programs. Next, the differences between \"equal access\" and \"equal benefits\" are discussed, and two models for bilingual education--the Maintenance Model and the Transitional Model--are considered. Subsequently, legislation is pointed to which provides federal aid for the development of bilingual programs, and then, the implications  that ensuring legislation and judicial decisions have for the community college are discussed. Next, the key position of the bilingual teacher aide is analyzed, and studies that have examined the role, responsibilities, training, and attitudes of the bilingual teacher aide are reviewed. Finally, several recommendations are made. These recommendations focus on the importance of bilingual aides, community college responsibilities, the creation of a National Resource Center for the training of teacher aides and paraprofessionals. The functions of this Center are enumerated, and a bibliography included. (AYC)",

Development of the system involved tailoring existing pre-packaged follow-up methodologies to meet GSJC's individual needs and included six steps: (1) identifying goals and associated performance indicators that could be measured using questionnaires; (2) developing and testing three questionnaires designed to gather information from current students (at the completion of each quarter), students who have been out of college for one year, and employers of former students; (3) operationally defining the sample populations appropriate to each questionnaire;  (4) conducting the survey of current students in class and of employers and former students by mail; (5) computer analysis of the data; and (6) reporting the results to administrative personnel. Interim study results revealed four major problems--low response rate, inappropriateness of goals and performance indicators to non-traditional students, lack of commitment on the part of college personnel, and the resultant small impact of the project on institutional planning.

The study focused on: (1) the demographic and financial characteristics of the students; (2) the major differences between curriculum and continuing education students; (3) the extent to which the students were representative of the adult population in NC; (4) how student characteristics had changed over the past ten years; (5) the factors which attracted the students to their institutions; (6) how the students learned of institutional offerings; and (7) what plans the students had for employment or continuing their education. Major findings  indicated that while the majority of respondents perceived their institutions as the major vehicle for educational opportunity, a large proportion were not aware of the availability of support services. Recruitment practices on the part of two-year institutions weighed heavily in students' institutional choice, as did school location and low instructional costs. Enrollment trends showed that the NC colleges serve an increasingly representative cross-segment of the state's adult population, and, at the same time, serve unique sub-populations of non-traditional students.

The study sought information on the existence and details of state-wide policies and how they were established; who is eligible for tuition waivers and who is actually assisted; older adult enrollments in credit courses (for which tuition waivers are more frequently available) and non-credit courses (in which older adult enrollments are higher); and factors, including tuition  waivers, which influence older adult student enrollments. Additionally, the kinds of support services that are available for older adults were identified, as were reasons why these services are not generally provided. The study revealed that the non-credit community education division was usually responsible for coordinating and administering senior programs, and that while courses in coping, survival, and developmental skills are being offered, older adults who need these skills are not being reached. Another area of investigation was funding of credit and non-credit community education programs. Several programs are highlighted in the report. (JP)",

A selected group of community college presidents, instructors, and journal editors were asked to rank order the books and articles they felt were significant to the field. The top 15 works were then listed on a second questionnaire that was sent to 874 community college presidents and 63 university professors. They were requested to rank order the ten works which they felt had had the greatest impact. Space was provided to add works that were not on the list. The  authors of the works that were considered significant by both surveyed groups were sought on lists of community college leaders that were the results of previous studies. Study results, based on responses from 166 presidents and 46 professors, revealed that 12 of the 15 works obtained a median rating of tenth place or higher; none of the 52 titles that had been written in received a sufficient number of high rankings to be included in the top ten works. Only three of the 12 most highly rated works were by authors not included in a list of community college leaders.

The project report first details the process by which the project staff, in coordination with the Broward County Personnel Association, identified the six occupational areas in most need of community college curricula to support them: business data processing programmer; construction secretary; engineering drafting;  electronic technician; head nurse management; and insurance secretary. The survey and interview techniques that were used to identify job requirements and competencies are then detailed, from both the perspective of the supervisors and the employees. The report then discusses the findings for each occupational area, including minimum education required, criteria for promotion, descriptions of job tasks in order of their importance, and recommendations for changes in BCC's curricula. The report includes a review of the literature dealing with occupational curricula at community colleges. (JP)",

These skills, taught by the vocational instructor or by someone with more expertise in personnel management, can be covered in any one of five modes: in a separate class to be conducted in the last half of the spring semester before graduation; in a section or component within an advanced class; in seminars conducted by the college's community services section; as a component of the college's cooperative education, work experience, or placement services; or as a service of the  college's career counseling center. Instructional content will depend upon the mode that is used, but should include a hierarchy of skills, including: (1) those which must be stressed, such as tips for applying for jobs, writing resumes, and handling job interviews; and (2) optional topics, such as management/staff relationships, affirmative action policies, professionalism, and career planning.

Among the measures used were reactions to an unfamiliar infant in a waiting room situation, interest in pictures of babies versus other objects, and sex-role concept and attitudinal questionnaires. Stage of family life cycle affected women's responsivity but not men's. New mothers displayed a heightened, generalized interest in babies which is optimally timed and functional in terms of sex-differentiated role requirements. A possible confounding between cohort effects and stage in the family life cycle was examined and rejected. Traditionally sex-typed behaviors were reinterpreted as life-situation  specific rather than general traits. (Author)",

This presentation focuses on desired traits of caregivers and on the needs of infants. In addition to warm personal qualities, caregivers should have a belief in the personhood of a baby, knowledge of the institutional system in which caregiving is done, a sense of humor, sensitivity to individual differences among infants, ability to play enthusiastically and be creative with an infant, an understanding of the necessity of firm and fair limits, receptivity to early talking efforts and a willingness to model language, and an ability to match  performance with the developmental levels of individual children. Babies need satisfying attachments with the special people who care for them, floor freedom, learning experiences they can assimilate, the opportunity to learn social skills such as respect for the rights of others and helpfulness, and adults who are sensitive to their present levels of competence and who provide appropriate environements, experiences and toys. A baby whose learning is precious to the caregiver has a firm base from which to grow. (Author/RH)",

The study was conducted with 144 second graders across three reading levels from a suburban public school. Stimuli were 40 words chosen from the concrete nouns in the Pavio, et al. (1968) list and simple line-drawing visuals representing each word. Stimuli were slide projected onto a screen for three seconds. After each slide the screen was blank for three seconds to allow subjects to think according to instructions of the object or word. A randomly ordered and  counterbalanced criterion test composed of 40 multiple-choice items--20 word items and 20 picture items--was administered two minutes after presentation and again in alternate form after three days. Results for memory strategy, presentation mode, reading level, test mode, immediate and delayed test performance, and variable interactions are presented. The data indicate that memory is better for pictures than for words in both immediate and delayed tests, but the \"think picture\" strategy was not effective on the delayed test. Low reading group subjects. who had used the \"think word\" strategy performed slightly better than \"think picture\" counterparts on the immediate test and substantially better on the delayed test.

Each section contains an overview followed by a statement of nutritional goals, a child-oriented planning chart, activities, and ideas for evaluation. The nutrition goals will not all apply to all children at any one time. The planning chart allows the teacher to select units in terms of several learner characteristics. Suggestions for involving parents is the last component within each of the activity sections. The evaluation section contains suggested techniques for assessing the nutrition outcomes.

Data based on standardized achievement tests (Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills, CTBS) were gathered from approximately 95 third graders over a two-year period for each of the three schools. In addition, a control for intelligence was obtained by analyzing a discrepancy score based on predicted achievement, rather than actual grade equivalent. One way analysis of variance on discrepancy scores revealed significant differences for the subtests of Reference, favoring the  model &quot;open&quot; school, and Social Studies, favoring the higher socioeconomic &quot;traditional&quot; school. Analysis of discrepancy scores, collected at the beginning and end of a two-year period, showed five out of the seven CTBS subtests favored the model school. The study stressed the importance of examining not only the method of instruction, but also the socioeconomic factor and the teacher variable. (Author/MP)",

Emphasis was placed on compiling a list of empirical and professional literature on child care facilities and outdoor play environments dealing with the following issues: (1) the role of the physical environment in child development and in overcoming developmental disabilities; (2) child care workers and family child care homes; (3) outdoor playgrounds of various types, including adventure playgrounds and comprehensive playgrounds; and (4) the role of the overall housing and neighborhood environment in children's play and development. Additional information on children's environments included children's hospitals, recreation  centers, elementary and secondary schools, libraries, housing, zoos, science museums, and designing for handicapped children. Over 1500 items--books, reports, and articles--are included in this bibliography. (Author/RH)",

In general, sex differences were found to be minimal, and were significant on only three out of the eighteen variables investigated. Results indicated that males were rated by teachers and observers as having significantly more classroom behavior problems and as being more aggressive. Males and females scored differently on only one performance measure, that of visual discrimination, in which case females made significantly fewer errors. Measures of both tonic and phasic arousal levels failed to differentiate between the two sexes. Implications of research efforts which essentially reveal stronger similarities than differences between  male and female children are discussed. (Author/MP)",

Findings include the following: (1) falls are the most common type of playground equipment accident, (2) the proportion of all injuries which involved each of the major types of playground equipment (swings, slides, climbers, etc.) is roughly equivalent to the proportion of all playground equipment represented by each major type, (3) falls to paved surfaces account for a disproportionately high number of injuries and severe injuries relative to the amount of paved surfacing in use, (4) about five percent of total accidents involve either malfunctioning or  broken equipment, (5) equipment modifications might have reduced injuries by 55,000 in a one year period, and (6) equipment spacing and playground layout and design may account for as many as 8,300 injuries. In this study, analyses by hazard pattern and by type of equipment were conducted. Study results for location, equipment condition and material as well as deaths related to public playground equipment are reported. Data tables, an analysis of technical requirements submitted by the National Bureau of Standards, study methodology, and a list of 293 special study cases are appended. (Author/RH)",

The MLCS is a comprehensive system for classifying the functional content of maternal language addressed to children whose mean length of utterance (MLU) does not exceed 3.0. Development of this scale was based on a thorough review of classification schemes used in the mother-child language literature, and on an examination of several videotape recordings of mother-child interaction to identify functional language parameters for which no categories were available. Interrater agreement for the scale was determined on a sample of 12 mother-infant dyads. Children were between  9 and 24 months of age. Audio recordings and a running narration of the stream of behavior were made while the mother and child engaged in spontaneous play in their home. Each maternal utterance was coded according to the MLCS by two independent raters. The overall agreement between raters on over 4,000 utterances was 93%. (Author/SS)",

Each individual was subsequently given an opportunity to act charitably for a recipient group which was identified as either (1) the same group of children who had been previously described in the presentation or (2) a different group. Individuals in the control group were shown a presentation of an affectively-neutral topic prior to the opportunity to help. Highly empathic adolescents were found to be more charitable than their relatively less empathic counterparts. Moreover, the findings indicated that empathy for a particular target,  once aroused, may &quot;transfer&quot; and subsequently enhance charitable behaviors towards recipients who did not serve as the original source of the individual's concern.

Health care was chosen as the focal point of the first of a series of initiatives to make federal programs work better in rural areas. Other White House initiatives were undertaken in the areas of housing, water and sewer, transportation, communications, energy, federal-state cooperation, and economic development. As a result of the August 1977 merger of  the Rural Development Service into the Farmers Home Administration, new initiatives to implement its new policies and redirection emphases included policy management support for research, technical assistance, and rural advocacy; state plans and outreach targeted at the most distressed rural people and communities; joint investment strategy agreements; service delivery and program improvement measures; and an area development assistance planning grant program.

In order to provide data for the Postal Rate Commission (charged with reviewing appeals from patrons of post offices which the Postal Service has decided to close or consolidate), this research paper reports the sociological implications and community effects resulting from the closing of a post office in a small rural community. Data were derived from interviews with 151 residents in 37 communities in 19 states and in all 5 U.S. Postal Regions. Conclusions focus primarily on the viability of the community whose  post office may be closed. If the community shows signs of being a strong one, then the closing of its post office would cause significant, perhaps irreparable, harm. If, however, the community exists in name only, with few people supporting or being served by its post office, the closing of such a facility would have little adverse effect. Twenty-one vital signs, principally tests of the vigor of a community's relationship with its post office, are presented to assist the Postal Service in determining community viability. (NEC)",

        "description":"Experts and concerned citizens from New York to California met in an effort to understand and confront the challenges facing Spanish-speaking people in their struggle for education and for finding their proper place in American society. The problems and character of the Spanish-speaking Americans, as reported in this symposium, do not fit common stereotypes. The people are harrassed by poverty, unemployment (at a normal rate two to three times the national level), disease, communication barriers, educational barriers, cultural barriers, and beaurocratic barriers. The problems with which Spanish-speaking Americans are doing battle are not theirs; they are the problems of the nation. When the solutions are finally found, they will be a major contribution to the world society where  minority-ism is nearly a universal phenomenon. Major addresses focus on the topics of ethnic cohesion vs. assimilation, the power of education vs. the power of government, and Utah's efforts with Chicano problems. Workshop discussions examine definitions and label acceptance of the term Chicano; law enforcement (police-minority relations, responsibilities of the legal system, and political influence); health and medical services; Chicano studies curriculum in higher education; barriers in employment, education and government; characteristics and significance of Mexican-American literature; and perspectives on bilingual and bicultural education.

Conclusions drawn from the data are that a need exists for an off-reservation boarding school program for students with unusual social-emotional learning handicaps and that the program should provide a quality family/home living component. The second section proposes and evaluates the following alternatives: (1) continue Pierre Indian School's 1972-73 program and upgrade it with appropriate staff and renovation of the  physical plant; (2) close the school, reassign the students, and design programs in each of the area boarding schools in the Aberdeen Area as already serving Indian children with learning handicaps and provide a qualified specialist to help schools meet special needs; (4) establish group homes on reservations to serve students with special needs; (5) obtain special education services on a contract basis; and (6) proceed with the present program at Pierre Indian School and make systematic improvements in spite of staffing and budget constraints.

        "description":"As tribes and individuals, Indians claim dual rights in American society. Granted full citizenship in 1924, Indians are entitled to all protections and benefits enjoyed by other citizens, including free public education for their children. As the original inhabitants of the United States, Indians also claim rights accruing to no other population groups based on treaties signed between individual tribes and the Federal Government between 1778 and 1871, acts of the U.S. Congress to implement the treaties and provide for the general welfare of Indian people, and court decisions upholding the validity of treaties and special legislation to deal with Indian matters. This summary, written for the layman with special emphasis on education, reviews the treaty guarantees made by the  Federal Government and the services actually provided under the guarantees. It summarizes congressional intent, from the end of the treaty period to the present, in assigning responsibilities for Indian affairs to a number of Federal agencies. Finally, it examines the consistency with which the courts have upheld the concept of dual Federal responsibility to Indian citizens, as expressed in treaties and general law. As the nation seeks to redress past failures and to develop a Federal policy responsive to Indian needs in the years ahead, it should be recognized that the legal and judicial history tends to support the Indian claim of dual rights--both by treaty and special Congressional acts and by inherent rights of citizenship.

        "description":"The most obvious and difficult problem facing educators of migrant children is that of frequent interruptions in the child's education caused by his migration. Various solutions have been put forth over the past three decades; these have included providing mobile schools and staff, residential schools, uniform record transfers, interstate credit exchanges, and special curriculums. Most attention has been given to bringing continuity to migrant children's education through the transfer of uniform records between schools. Interstate planning has increased markedly in the past decade since the availability of migrant education funds under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, but planning remains piecemeal with no effective coordination at the federal level. The most notable  efforts to deal with the question of educational continuity have taken place outside the public school system. The public schools have concentrated on finding ways to fit the child with a disordered life style into an orderly school system and have become overly concerned with sequenced learning, test scores, daily attendance, and proper records. Migrant educators need to develop new techniques to take advantage of the natural continuity which exists within the child and his family. While schools change, curriculums change, and records disappear, the child always has himself and his parents; he has what he knows and what he is able to do. (Author/JH)",

The papers served as the focus of the seminar, the goals of which were to review, critique, and publish the papers and to establish and publish recommendations  for a federal agenda on rural education. Participants approved a total of 28 recommendations calling for action to end neglect and descrimination against rural areas; provide special support for dealing with the unique problems of rural education; and recognize education as a critical component of any rural development strategy.

An additional 229 voiced their opinions by mail. In varying levels of agreement (from 94.9% to 60.1%) participants validated all 28 recommendations as feasible activities for a Federal Rural Education Initiative. Although agreement was fairly consistent geographically and across rural populations, a minority of the rural constituents consistently  questioned the role of the federal government in rural education. Judging from response to the recommendations, priorities of the constituency regarding rural education appeared to be centered in the areas of funding, research, delivery systems, information dissemination, and vocational training. With regard to federal programs in general, respondents repeatedly stressed their desire for state and local control of decisions affecting their rural schools, and noted that existing federal programs placed greater administrative burdens on and are less flexible in small rural schools than large urban schools.

Four conditions were portrayed by two male interviewers (Indian and non-Indian) and typified trustworthy and untrustworthy interview performance. Subjects then rated the counselors' perceived levels of trustworthiness on the Counselor Effectiveness Rating Scale and the Counselor Rating Form. Results indicated  that the role manipulation of trustworthy interview behaviors was successful and that the ethnicity of the counselor may not be important provided that the non-Indian counselor is trained to use culturally appropriate interview communicative and trustworthy behaviors. With this information counseling psychologists with training responsibilities should be better able to provide practice for students in training in identifying and enacting verbal and non-verbal behaviors indicative of counselor trustworthiness with American Indian clients.

Each treatment level consisted of self-instructional modules in which the Aschner, Bloom, or Sanders category systems were presented. Standardized gain scores were compared for each treatment, and results indicated that the Aschner-based question classification system had some advantages over the other two systems in terms of improving ability to recognize and classify questions based on cognitive levels and a more positive attitude toward using the classification system.

        "description":"Discussed are the effects that cognitive level of teachers' questions and questioning strategies may have on student achievement. Thirty-two preservice elementary teachers were stratified by the grade they were teaching, either primary (grades 1-3) or intermediate (4-5), and randomly assigned to treatments. Treatment levels consisted of mini-lessons in which questions were asked as follows: only high-level questions, only low-level questions, or a mixture of high and low questions. Questioning strategy was either multiple response questioning, in which the same question was redirected to a number of students, or single response questioning, in which only one response was accepted before asking the next question. Results indicate no significant difference among the three treatment  levels on any of the criterion measures, but that redirecting questions is an effective strategy when working with small groups of children. It is further implied that the potency of redirected questioning diminishes as the cognitive demand of questions increases. (CS)",

The assessments were conducted in 1969-70, 1972-73, and 1976-77. This paper focuses on changes in science knowledge of young adults from the second assessment to the third assessment and compares performance of young adults with that of 17-year-olds. Results report a uniform decline in scientific literacy among young adults and 17-year-olds, with no difference between the two groups in their performance on science exercises. Observations are also noted regarding patterns of responses as to gender, minority groups, and social factors. (CS) Primary type of information provided by report: Results  (Change).",

In this work, Kalmykova traces the history of the use of the analytic and synthetic methods in her country, explores elementary classroom situations involving teachers who had various degrees of success in problem-solving instruction, makes hypotheses regarding the use of certain techniques, and concludes with suggestions for &quot;productive&quot; methods to be used in the classroom.

In the second chapter, transformations are expressed as linear and linear-fractional functions of a complex variable. In the third chapter, the foundations of geometry are presented from the standpoint of group theory. (Author/MK)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to design a unit on percent for adult remedial students based on the principles of Piaget's theory and to evaluate the effectiveness of the unit as a means of improving one characteristic of formal operations, the ability to use porportion. The subjects consisted of 89 undergraduate remedial mathematics students at a branch of the City University of New York. Results indicate that there seems to be a relationship between learning percent and improving the ability to use proportions. Moreover, it would seem that an instructional unit can be developed which implements some of the heuristic principles of Piaget's theory and which simultaneously improves one characteristic of formal operations and develops basic mathematical principles. In addition, it  appears that Piaget's theory can be successfully applied to the instruction of adult remedial students and that this theory can be implemented in an actual classroom situation involving instructors of remedial mathematics courses.

While just these kinds of knowledge would be adequate for an ideal solver, human solvers appear to need and use other kinds of knowledge. First, many errors seem to indicate that single operations of algebra are often represented as collections of parts which may have independent status. Second, operations seem to be connected, often inappropriately, with a general scheme for symbol manipulation. Third, various kinds of knowledge are brought into play to detect errors. Evidence about the role of these kinds of knowledge, found in the solutions and comments of college students, is discussed, and some implications  for instruction are considered. (Author/MK)",

Instead, it was based upon the Madison Project strategy of paradigmatic learning experiences, and was presented to students via a computer system having a good audio-visual interface between computer and child. Several independent  third-party evaluations of the computer-based curriculum have been carried out. These evaluations indicate positive results for the curriculum in terms of achievement and attitude. (Author/MK)",

Responses were obtained from samples of nine populations, including teachers, supervisors, and other professionals in mathematics education, plus principals, school board members, and PTA presidents. First-round surveys concerned curricular preferences about fractions and decimals; algebra; whole numbers; geometry; probability and statistics; ratio, proportion, and percent; problem solving; measurement; and computer literacy. Results from these areas were reported in terms of goals, content, methods, resources, appropriate times and students, and calculators. Data were also analyzed to yield information on such topics as applications and individualization.  Second-round surveys sought to determine curricular priorities. These items were grouped according to focus; for example, development of new materials for specific content or use of additional time. The report provides vast amounts of specific information relevant to mathematics curriculum in the 1980's. Similarities and differences between samples in the perceived desirability of different curricular alternatives for the 1980's are indicated.

Also investigated was whether there is a relationship between ability to do proportional calculations and Piagetian cognitive level. Results indicate that the course was effective in increasing students' ability to solve everyday problems, but that there was no difference in problem-solving ability of students who had taken  the course. Results of the Piagetian investigation indicate that students can be taught to solve both concrete and formal proportional calculations independent of their cognitive level when the variables are familiar to the students.

        "author":["Singleton, John"],
        "description":"The paper explores the social and cultural processes in the schooling rituals of graduate students in anthropology. Four areas of concern are noted. The first area concerns rites of passage and professional competence. The author explains that the period of graduate professional schooling represents the second stage of a rite of passage after one has been separated from the crowd (admitted to graduate study) and before the time of incorporation into the new social identity of an anthropologist. The problems inherent in this area are that the models of ritual initiation and institutionalized ordeals (testing and evaluation procedures) do not simulate or stimulate the competencies needed by a creative professional. The second area involves socialization to bureaucratic dependency.  Presently, the goal of most anthropology departments is to turn out initiates who will succeed in the fierce competition for prestigious university appointments; applied jobs are for those who don't capture an academic slot. The third area is the contradiction between deductive teaching methods and the need for the anthropologist to conduct inductive research. The recruitment of inexperenced graduate students reinforces the tendency to teach didactically. The author suggests recruiting people with previous cross-cultural experience and with some history of an ability to survive on their own. The final area concerns the need for playfulness as a strategy for the initiation and continuing education of the anthropologist. The conclusion is that playfulness can be a productive intellectual  tool. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"A guide is designed for elementary school teachers with handicapped students in their classrooms. Seven sections comprise the document. Section I discusses the implications of mainstreaming for classroom teachers. Discussed are 1) the physical and social isolation of the handicapped students in the 1960s; 2) the impact of Public Law 94-142 which underscores the rights of these children to public education in a setting which includes children who are not handicapped; 3) practical and ethical considerations; and 4) identification of the handicapped. Section II lists social studies goals for the handicapped learner relative to knowledge, skills, values, and social participation. Section III discusses social studies instruction for handicapped students with learning disabilities,  hearing impairments, emotional handicaps, visual impairment, speech and language disorders, and physical disabilities, and for those who are mentally retarded. Section IV provides methods of assessing achievement in relation to the goals stated in Section II. Section V discusses providing for individual differences by listing sources of help for teachers (peer tutors, cross-age tutors, and volunteers) and strategies such as grouping. Section VI suggests teaching \"regular students\" about handicapping conditions through learning experiences, children's books, films and videotapes, and simulations. A brief list of resources is provided. The final section presents evaluations of social studies textbooks and federally funded curriculum projects for the handicapped. Related resources available  from ERIC and Exceptional Child Education Resources (ECER) are listed. (KC)",

Emphasis is placed on the task that confronts the student while reading social studies and on the teacher's role in helping students improve their reading skills. Vocabulary is identified as the major factor contributing to reading difficulties. Five categories of vocabulary are discussed--standard (normal words used in reading and/or conversation), transitional (one meaning in a student's real life situation and another in social studies), technical (seldom encountered except in social studies texts), changeable (meanings vary within the context of social studies), and phrases (groups of words which do not function in an adjective-noun relationship. Suggestions to remedy  problems associated with these categories of vocabulary words include preparing slow readers with more advanced peer tutors, preparing guides to direct students to ideas within specified paragraphs on particular pages, offering oral as well as written examinations, exploring multiple meanings of words with students, and exposing students frequently to non-familiar words.

        "description":"The paper discusses a study in which a cognitive mapping test was used to evaluate the effectiveness of different teaching methods used in a college level introductory economics course. Cognitive style mapping is a method of studying learner characteristics in order to individualize instruction. The hypothesis was that certain cognitive learning styles would determine whether students would benefit from a simulation/gaming or a lecture/discussion section. Data regarding cognitive learning style were obtained by administering a cognitive style questionnaire. Questions focused on whether students gained meaning from spoken or written words, could place themselves in other people's position, were strongly influenced by peers, and made their own decision. Student grades served as the  measure of economic knowledge obtained in the course. Statistical analysis of questionnaire responses and course grades indicated that most students preferred one teaching method over the other and achieved higher grades on tests when the course was taught by the method they preferred. The conclusion is that teachers should use cognitive mapping tests to help determine the type of instruction which will benefit various types of students. (DB)",

        "description":"Employment potential in developed and developing nations is analyzed from an economic viewpoint. Estimates by the International Labor Office are that the global labor force will grow by about 900 million people from 1980 to 2000. It is projected that these 900 million people will join the current labor force including approximately 50 million unemployed and about 300 million underemployed. Accurate measures of employment are difficult because different countries count employment in different ways and often employ statistics of poor quality. The employment problems of poor countries center of low productivity and low earnings--both problems related to lack of technological advancement. In industrial nations, on the other hand, employment problems are exemplified by accelerating  wage costs, inflation, and unit labor costs which are too high to compete with production from developing nations. To deal with these employment problems, policy makers must tailor economic strategies to meet specific needs. For example, policy makers in industrial nations might stress adjusting to long term trends such as slower growth, slowing the inflation rate, and targeting more funds to employment programs. In developing nations, policies should emphasize productivity, capital investment in labor-intensive industries, and massive agricultural aid. (DB)",

The hypothesis was that subjects who used certain (effective) learning procedures would perform better than subjects who stressed other (less effective) techniques. The effective procedures set comprised techniques for learning spatial information, using self-generated feedback to guide subsequent study behavior, and partitioning the map into sections. The less effective procedures set comprised subjects' random learning techniques, random sampling, and unrestricted focus of attention. Methodology involved directing 43 college students to learn and reproduce maps according to their own techniques. Subjects were then divided into three groups and instructed to participate  in a second map-learning task in which they used 1) procedures previously determined as effective learning aids, 2) procedures unrelated to learning success, or 3) their own learning techniques. Findings from a comparison of performance on the first and second map-learning task indicated that performance improvement was directly related to the frequency with which subjects used procedures designated as most effective learning aids. The conclusion is that students can improve learning effectiveness and performance of complex tasks such as map learning if they use procedures designated as effective learning aids. (DB)",

Part C provides funding for innovative programs and projects that adopt the validated programs of other cost effective educational projects. Questionnaires were sent to state social studies specialists requesting information on the nature of social studies programs, the location of these activities, and the level of monetary support. Projects reported include citizenship, consumer, environmental, law, and multi-ethnic education; social studies and reading; global education; racial awareness; and oral history. Findings indicate that few projects directly involved students; evaluation components  revealed little direct student performance measures; and implementation strategies involved little teacher input. Also, although curriculum materials developed under this act have proven to be important supplements to texts, most material is difficult to obtain. The variety of programs reflects the areas of most concern to both state and local educators. Finally, the average percent of Title IV monies spent on social studies is 5.9 of total available funds. The conclusion is that since social studies is currently not among the high priority funding items of Title IV C, it may have to ally itself with other curriculum areas and look for other sources of funding.

Moral behavior is interpreted to include behaving in ways which are helpful to others in need or distress and refraining from behavior which is physically or psychologically harmful to others. Questions investigated included 1) do people who reason at more advanced levels act differently in moral situations than those who reason at less advanced levels? 2) do people who reason at the same stage behave similarly in moral situations? and 3) do people act in accordance with what they say they will do in moral action situations? Social science literature, and, particularly, social psychological  research studies, are reviewed regarding their treatment of these concerns. Findings indicated that there is some support for the notion that the level of moral reasoning is associated with an increase in frequency of moral behavior and that there exists quite a discrepancy between what people think they would do and what they actually do in moral action situations. Additional research is reviewed regarding factors in addition to moral reasoning which influence moral behavior. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"Problems for the biographical researcher in conducting oral interviews with primary sources are discussed. Successful biographical research using oral history must be thorough and honest. A major problem in getting candid information from primary subjects may occur if quotations touch upon areas considered personal or controversial. Other problems concern the reaction of subjects to tape recorders, gaining the trust of subjects, getting too close to the subjects to maintain objectivity, and keeping records of interviews. The research method must be adapted to the personality of the subject. For instance, some personalities change when a microphone appears before them. Also, voluminous note-taking or tape recording may be hampered considerably if the subject is a \"put on\" artist  who delights in weaving intricate narratives. Another problem concerns the researcher's reporting correctly the language of the conversation, especially over a long period of time. This problem corresponds to that of the accuracy of the recollector's quotations of past conversations. Because of these inaccuracies, it is wise to get at least two accounts of an event. Family or personal opposition to the project and determining who is really an authority in a given case are other problems. Finally, the researcher must constantly assess his objectivity by questioning whether he is showing bias toward either side of a controversial issue, if he is justified in doing so, if the other side is represented, and if the subject should be abandoned.

The major objective is to help students answer the question, &quot;How much control can a person exercise over her/his own life?&quot; Students learn about the ways women have lived their lives and perceived their choices, and relate this information to their own lives and choices. The document is presented in five chapters. Chapter I, an introduction to the curriculum, discusses origins of the project, rationale, content, and teacher preparation. Chapter II is a unit on socialization and its impact on personal choice. Chapter III, the major part of the document, consists of four topics as well as an essay entitled &quot;Women's Power.&quot; Topics cover the  traditional, historical, personal, and changing roles of women in Africa (Nigeria), women in China, African-American women, and Chinese-American women in relation to societal influences and economic, political, and personal power. Chapter IV discusses oral history interviewing, while Chapter V deals with students' expectations of themselves in their personal lives. Each of the content chapters include an introduction, educational objectives, readings, teacher notes, teacher background material, and various learning activities interspersed throughout the text. Activities include reading, film viewing, listing, comparing, discussing, and interviewing. An annotated bibliography of books and audiovisual materials for students concludes each chapter. (CK)",

A second results from the perception of a negative discrepancy between present capabilities and desired performance.

        "description":"Research on classroom teaching is discussed within the conceptual framework of the analysis of student classroom tasks. Three types of learning tasks are illustrated: understanding; memory; and routine problem-solving according to an algorithm. It is contended that most classroom research projects study teachers' and students' actions, rather than learning tasks; it is assumed that learning is taking place as a result of these actions. Furthermore, there is more emphasis on how much is learned than on what is learned. Two important questions concerning teaching models are discussed: what are the actual tasks posed for students and teachers in classrooms?, and why do these tasks exist? After discussions of classroom task goals, ambiguity and risk concerning task accomplishment,  and the role of students and teachers, three conclusions are presented: (1) there is not a direct cause-and-effect relationship between specific teacher behavior and student achievement, rather, teacher behavior is shaped by interaction with students; (2) learning tasks directly shape achievement; and (3) learning tasks do not always take place in the classroom.

The selection of the proficiency skills (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) was supported by changing views in language assessment and by legislation. Andrew D. Cohen's language model was adapted as a theoretical frame of reference. The battery was developed with a recognition of the interrelationship of native and second language skills. Receptive and expressive components of ESLAB included the Oral Screening Test, Oral Competency Test, Aural Comprehension Test, Dictation Exercise, Structural Competency Test, and Informal Reading Inventory. To ascertain ESLAB's statistical stability, 59 Hispanic inner-city bilingual students  in grades 7 and 8 were tested. Each of the tests was subjected to item analysis, involving item difficulty and item discrimination. Face, content, predictive, and concurrent validity were established. Internal consistency and interrater correlations for the expressive subtests were also attained. Overall, both the receptive and expressive subtests of the ESLAB pilot edition proved to be valid and reliable measures of language proficiency. (Author/GDC)",

In this paper, it is shown that most of these indices are special cases of two generalized indices of agreement: one that is corrected for chance, and one that is not. The special cases of these two indices are determined by assumptions about the nature of the agreement function or, equivalently, the nature of the loss function for the testing procedure. For example, indices discussed by Huynh, Subkoviak, and Swaminathan, Hambleton, and Algina employ a threshold agreement, or loss, function whereas, indices discussed by Brennan and Kane and Livingston employ a squared error loss function. Since all of these indices are  discussed within a single general framework, the differences among them in their assumptions, properties, and uses can be exhibited clearly. For purposes of comparison, norm-referenced generalizability coefficients are also developed and discussed within this general framework. (Author/CTM)",

The instrument studied, the Language Assignment Umpire (L.A.U.), is designed to identify language dominance by means of four oral tasks of sentence memory, synonyms, antonyms, and digit-reversal. The validity of the L.A.U. is considered in determining language proficiency as well as language dominance. Lexical difficulty and counts of phonemes, syllables, words, and morphemes are examined for a linguistic analysis of the L.A.U. The sentence memory task is examined for the syntactic  complexity of its items. Statistical analyses are reported for a variety of correlations at both the intra-test and external criteria levels. A brief discussion is included of the results of a study in which the L.A.U. and other language data were used to determine the effectiveness of the Rochester, New York bilingual program.

The original test was designed to quantify aphasic patients' ability level on common communicative tasks and consisted of 18 ten-item subtests. Each item resulted in a proficiency rating, ranging from one to sixteen. Two shortened versions of PICA were developed, containing five items selected from each of the original eighteen subtests; these new tests were one-half as long. Subjects were 50 adults (aged 26-78) whose language handicaps were associated with cerebrovascular accident or trauma. Both the original PICA and a new short-form test were administered. Reliability of all test forms was computed, as well as the  intercorrelation of short-form scores with various subtest, modality, and overall scores of the original PICA. Results showed that indices of central tendency and variability were virtually equal on both short forms and the long form across all subtests, modalities, and overall score. Test reliability, means, and standard deviations of all forms were also highly similar. Thus, use of the short forms was supported.

The Southern Regional Education Board (SREB), supported by a grant from the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education, worked closely with teams of faculty and administrators in workshop and consultation settings to help them design evaluation approaches which were more comprehensive and systematic. The vast majority of the institutions made significant progress toward accomplishing their goals. In general, institutions with the most ambitious goals made the greatest progress. Seven characteristics, most notably support and involvement by top-level administrators, influenced the progress and  probability of lasting impact. Full and extensive faculty involvement also proved essential. Certain project activities, in particular the campus visits by project-sponsored consultants, proved significantly helpful. Participants learned several things about the politics of change, as well as about faculty evalution. A regional, interinstitutional approach provided valuable stimulation and access to expert knowledge. (Author/CTM)",

Portrayal supplements traditional reporting by utilizing subjective, anecdotal, or impressionistic information, in an appropriately communicable form, to enrich the description of program transactions, settings, and outcomes. It is distinguished by a sensitivity to unusual effects and atypical results and is primarily concerned with program transactions. Portrayal is more than description; it is expected to be dynamic, creating a new reality or surrogate experience which allows audiences to obtain exposure to and understanding of program transactions. In this paper, excerpts from recent examples of program portrayals are used to illustrate the characteristics of this  technique: participation of the evaluator; expectations; unobtrusive design; use of contextural description to stimulate reflection, empathy, and understanding; and attention to action, chronology, and stage setting. The implications of portrayal as a personal reporting style are also discussed. (BW)",

Three conclusions are reached: (1) a substantial proportion of New Jersey students entering college are not proficient in the basic verbal and mathematical skills necessary to perform college-level work; (2) deficiencies are present at both two-year and four-year institutions; and (3) the level of proficiency required to complete three years of high school iinstruction in English and mathematics is considerably lower than the proficiency expected of entering freshmen.

Problems and uses of status attainment and difference scores as indicators of schooling effects are discussed first. Study approaches to schooling effects are divided into two broad categories: experimental and nonexperimental. Methodological issues related to the experimental approaches are discussed in relation to two types of designs: experimental group only designs and control group designs. Problems related to the nonexperimental approaches are reviewed according to: partitioning of explained  variance, comparison of regression coefficients, nonlinear regression methods, and causal models. Issues and problems related to the units of analysis are presented by contrasting two positions: that data should be analyzed at the individual student level, and that data should be analyzed at the classroom, school, or district level. A third position is reviewed: that multilevel analyses should be performed because schooling effects might result from many sources at many different levels. Finally, some methodological trends are identified and their implications for further schooling briefly considered. (Author/CTM)",

        "description":"Although unreliable and not predictive of medical school performance, the admission interview continues to be used extensively to collect noncognitive data about medical school applicants. A procedure is suggested for assuring that a group of interviewers assigned to an applicant does not unfairly help or hinder the candidate's ratings. At least 3 medical school faculty interviewed and rated 231 applicants as exceptional, acceptable, minimally acceptable, or unsuitable; reliability between raters was low. To minimize this problem, a difficulty-consistency index was developed for classifying interviewers, and a rule-of-thumb was proposed for assuring fairness in assigning interviewers. Data from one year's applicants show that 48 of 148 candidates who were actually admitted to the  class of 1983, were interviewed by a group of interviewers with an unsatisfactory difficulty-consistency total.

The Rasch model and its theoretical limitations were described. The three other equating methods used were: linear observed score equating, linear true score equating, and equipercentile equating. Data used in the study were obtained by testing 6,000 students in grades three through eight with the norm-referenced California Achievement Tests, Form C (CAT/C), reading and mathematics, and with tests made up from items from two Rasch calibrated item banks in reading and mathematics. The results of the four equating procedures were compared with actual observed score distributions on the  CAT/C for each item bank raw score. All four equating techniques yielded similar results with the least accuracy at the low end of the score distributions. It appeared that use of the Rasch model was feasible, but the accuracy of the results it produced was questionable. (Author/CTM)",

Included are brief discussions of application submission, grant competition, and project monitoring and technical assistance. Information presented is based on Federal and State data, program records, interviews, and case studies of eight Basic and Pilot projects in seven districts for 1976-77. The study found that despite successful efforts by the Office of Education to direct the larger ESAA awards to school districts with greater desegregation needs, this region as a whole had a low need for desegregation aid, since little recent desegregation had taken place. In terms of grant size, Region II was found to be receiving large sums of money, despite  the modest nature and extent of desegregation plans and the predominance of compensatory education activities not closely related to school desegregation needs. Further, review panels rated magnet school projects very highly, although the applicability of and local support for such projects was questionable. Regarding funding, delays by the Office of Civil Rights and the Office of Education were discovered to have caused numerous implementation delays in Region II projects. Little reliable information was found regarding technical assistance and monitoring. (Author/GC)",

However, recent studies of this process, called normative social influence, have failed to support the above assumptions. Another possible influence on some academic gains in desegregated classrooms may be due to informational social influence, through which minority students  may adopt behaviors that facilitate achievement without changes in personality. School desegregation as it is typically implemented does not create circumstances in which normative social influence can affect academic performance. Where minority students do exhibit gains, they are more likely the result of informational social influence and/or improved facilities. Cooperative learning techniques have also been shown to produce academic and attitudinal benefits in desegregated settings. (RLV)",

Given the wide academic range of students now attending CUNY, compensatory models are being developed and evaluated in order to effectively deal with skill deficiencies. Baruch College, CUNY, has developed a compensatory program, Communications Skills (CS), especially for the unprepared student. Initial placement tests determine which courses a student is allowed to take. Those scoring in the bottom third are assigned to two semesters of CS, which uses a holistic approach to building college language facility. A team of reading, speaking, and writing faculty meets with approximately 15-20 students for  nine hours weekly. The academic history of two groups of entering CS students was followed to determine the effectiveness of the program. An analysis of the retention rate and of the academic averages of the two groups strongly supports the efficacy of the program. About one third of the CS students have registered for a fifth semester at college, a figure which compares favorably with non-CS students. (RLV)",

In response to this situation, Congress in 1977 enacted the Youth Employment and Demonstration Projects Act, the first comprehensive job and training legislation devoted solely to youth unemployment. One of the initiatives established under this Act is the Youth Incentive Entitlement Pilot Projects, also known as the Youth Entitlement Demonstration. These projects are intended to demonstrate the efficacy of combined work and education or training as a remedy to high youth unemployment, low labor force participation and excessive school dropout rates. The Entitlement Demonstration is targeted for youth between the ages  of 16 and 19 who reside in low-income households and who have not received a high school diploma or its equivalent. Survey results indicate that Entitlement demonstrations are serving the youth population most in need and are using innovative approaches to providing jobs while discouraging the dropping-out of school. The success of these approaches is likely to depend upon: (1) youth perceptions of the attractiveness of the job offer; and (2) the extent to which program operators are able to provide meaningful job experiences, accurate monitoring of school and work performance, and believable deterrents to participant non-performance.

        "description":"The data for this report on school dropouts in New York City were collected by means of in-depth interviews with high school staff members, students, and dropouts. A total of 229 persons were interviewed in 53 high schools with dropout prevention programs distributed throughout the city. All respondents were asked approximately 50 open-ended questions which allowed them to comment freely on a wide variety of issues. The report is divided into four major sections. The first section discusses problems that lead to dropping out, student perceptions of dropout prevention programs, the importance of early dropout prevention, and the evidence that dropouts can be successfully remediated. Section II is subdivided into eight chapters, each discussing reasons for the dropout problem as  understood by staff members in the interview sample. Included in these chapters are discussions of attendance, academic failure, and discipline. Section III presents a discussion of the common elements of successful programs and the problems which have caused some programs to be i***fective. Recommendations for elementary, middle, and high schools are presented in Section IV. (Author/RLV)",

        "description":"The most recent evidence available indicates that prejudice against minorities and women is still widespread in America. Schools have not only failed to combat these prejudices, but they have often served to actively promote them. Textbooks generally ignore the position of minority Americans in contemporary life and often discuss minority history from a distorted perspective. The assimilationist ideology deemphasizes cultural differences, while the cultural pluralist ideology exaggerates them. Some combination of the two would work best for curriculum reform. Publishers and schools have responded to the problem of textbook bias by romanticizing about reality and avoiding controversial issues. Textbooks should not avoid, distort, idealize, or romaticize about controversial issues  related to minorities. Research in the area of textbook bias demonstrates that: (1) racial prejudice has a negative impact on the development of minority children; (2) certain reader traits can either enhance or minimize the effects of reading on attitude change; and (3) nonacademic aspects of reading content, including sex-typing and minority representation, influence a wide range of factors related to children's achievement in school. Methodological and conceptual shortcomings plague much of this research; there is a clear need for additional research in this area. (Author/RLV)",

Data are presented for public and non-public school enrollment for both black and white students, and changes in enrollment are reported by type of school, geographical location, and former status and exempt status of the school. Residential changes for both black and white families are reported by those who moved out of the county, those who moved within the county, and those who transferred their children to non-public schools. Results of surveys of parents concerning desegregation,  busing, and quality of education are correlated with the age and socioeconomic status of the parents. The data collected are discussed and analyzed, and recommendations are made for future desegregation planning. Appendices provide demographic data, a chronology of desegregation events in the county, maps and charts of the area, procedures for calculating expected enrollment, interview schedules and results, parent surveys, and statements on school integration, racial justice, and reconciliation by a Catholic Archbishop.

The program was designed to provide (1) career awareness and exploration experiences for grades 9-12; (2) salable skills experiences for eleventh and twelfth grade students and a salable skills-oriented program for possible dropouts; (3) guidance and counseling; (4) ways of using school and community resources to full advantage; and (5) placement and follow-up services. Student achievement was evaluated via pre- and posttesting. Programs were  expanded and shared with other schools in the counties; other program components were added, including expansion of guidance and counseling to include a teacher advisory system, staff training for future use of the Life Career Development System, increased use of community resources, implementation of a community-based EBCE (Experience-Based Career Education) model, and development of a model centralized resource information system.

The monograph is divided into seven chapters. Subject areas included are (1) philosophy and purposes of OJT; (2) historical development of OJT policies; (3) considerations in developing and operating OJT programs; (4) considerations for marketing OJT contracts; (5) OJT contract design; (6) OJT program alternatives, innovations, and flexibility; and (7) conclusions and recommendations. Suggestions and examples are given involving such concepts as incentive payments, variable reimbursement rates, and contract  extensions. Specific tailoring of contracts to individual trainee needs is explained. Also, some opinions are provided on the use of voucher systems wherein trainees develop their own personalized training programs. It is recommended that prime sponsors should give priority to establishing and maintaining a good management information system, give priority to disadvantaged clients, consider personal voucher contracts, strive for more meaningful employment opportunities in OJT contracts, and plan and utilize OJT to a much greater extent.

Barriers to their educational efforts include inadequate transportation, lack of money, poor health, program scheduling, and the attitude that learning is for others. Available educational, employment, and volunteer opportunities can help older adults cope with changing physiological and psychological needs, find personal satisfaction, and continue their usefulness to the community. Different emphases and methods of delivery can be used to reach older persons: mass media, correspondence courses, community outreach, educational brokering, and counseling; all of these have been used effectively. Through legislative  changes, federal and state coordination, the development of new services, and greater public awareness of the needs of older adults, educational opportunities are a reality. However, formal and informal efforts must continue to be intensified. It is in the national interest that educational resources be developed and augmented to the end that lifelong learning opportunities for all citizens, regardless of previous education or training, be widely available to promote our nation's continued vitality.

James A.

Such problems exist as fragmentation, a lack of communication across efforts, and a lack of continuity in time. There does not even appear to be adequate information on the nature and scope of the enterprise in the rural area. None of the state surveys reviewed distinguished rural from urban participants of individual communities or counties. Few of the surveys took into account, in any systematic way, learner-initiated individual study or informal learning networks among individuals. Few of the programs described in the literature have tried seriously to discover and work within local folk traditions of communication, education, or even  local perceptions of the problems involved. Research needs in several areas are apparent: (1) better inventory of current participation; (2) generalizations about what works and under what conditions; (3) methods appropriate to people with limited literacy; (4) maximizing the resources already present; and (5) ways to incorporate these needs into programs in such a way that the programs belong to the people they serve.

Guidelines are presented for the selection and preparation of personnel responsible for programs in which students are placed in work settings. Program purposes and goals are discussed for the following divisions: personnel responsible for coordination, vocational education programs, academic experiential programs, experience based career education (EBCE), work experience programs for special needs students, coordinators of programs for out-of-school youth, and postsecondary internship supervisors. Major duties, tasks, and functions are outlined for such concerns as coordinating community resources, developing career opportunities for women and minorities, and  complying with labor laws. Competency requirements for staff are also examined, along with the training needs of the various staff positions. The summary presents recommendations for program personnel, including the following: (1) delivery systems for training personnel should be responsible to their special needs and take into account prior experience and expertise; (2) training is needed at the preservice as well as inservice level; and (3) inservice training must be specific to the needs of the learners with regard to content, instructional format, scheduling, and compensation.

        "description":"The extent to which the adult basic education (ABS) target population was being reached by Pennsylvania ABE programs was examined along with characteristics of the target group members. To estimate the size of the target population and describe its demographic characteristics, census data from the &quot;1976 Survey of Income and Education&quot; (SIE) were used. ABE student data were taken from the 1978-79 Pennsylvania report which analyzed information forms on every ABE enrollee in state-funded programs. The target population was defined, following federal guidelines, as persons ages sixteen and over, not in school, and having less than a high school education. Comparisons were made between them and the non-target population (others being served by ABE programs). The target population was  estimated at 2.7 million, 31% of the over-sixteen population. Findings show 1.2% of the population in communities was served, with the percentage higher for minorities, women, and institutionalized adults. Percentage of least educated target group members (those having completed grades 1 through 4) reached was 4.7 percent. Generally the target population was more likely to be older, married or widowed, and unemployed than the non-target group. It was concluded that given the age characteristics of the target population it may be unrealistic to expect that a large portion can be served and that programs geared toward improving employability may not be relevant to them. Results raise serious questions about the advisability of concentrating resources on the least educated group as  regulations suggest. (Implications for recruitment and resource allocation are discussed.) (JT)",

        "description":"The determination of those factors of motivation and hygiene which led to job satisfaction/dissatisfaction of forty-five randomly selected community education coordinators in six mid-Atlantic states was the primary purpose of this interview-oriented research study. A second purpose was to examine the relationship between age, gender, marital status, and length of service to job satisfaction/dissatisfaction. The study built on Frederick Herzberg's research and used his &quot;critical incident&quot; interviewing technique. Results tend to support the hypothesis that Herzberg's Motivation-Hygiene Theory can be applied to community education coordinators. Interview responses revealed that achievement, interpersonal relations with subordinates, and recognition were the factors which motivated  them most to strive for a high level of job performance. Lack of achievement, however, was frequently associated with dissatisfaction as well. Policy and administration, interpersonal relations with subordinates, supervision, and working conditions were the factors which caused the greatest job dissatisfaction. More careful attention to the nurturing of the sources of job satisfaction and to the reduction of sources of job dissatisfaction should bring about increased program and job performance, lower turnover and absenteeism, and greater opportunities for self actualization on the part of the coordinators.

The program, call ExCEL (Exploring Careers through Experiential Learning), aimed to provide student experience in community learning sites and to integrate this with acquisition of cognitive, interpersonal, and affective skills gained through participation in a series of planned activities. Efforts were made to tailor the program to meet individual student needs and interests and to minimize sex-role stereotyping on the part of staff or students. Program process objectives were met at each site and two areas of program impact were examined--student outcomes (ajudged in comparison with nonparticipating control groups)  and participant-perceived effects. There were positive, significant changes in student attitudes, although there was little gain seen in the areas of basic and life skills. Participants and staff found the program beneficial. (CP)",

Two adjacent counties of similar demographic composition in northeastern Oklahoma participated in the study. All eighth-grade students were administered &quot;Planning Career Goals,&quot; an instrument that measures and correlates interests, information, and abilities related to occupations on a pre- and post-test design. The experimental schools had access to the test  results, the control schools did not. Some schools within the experimental and control schools had designated building facilitators; some had access to incentive pay, some did not. The variable of the building facilitator was also analyzed in the treatment of the data. The results of the statistical analysis did not reveal any significant differences between the control and experimental populations. The short interval of time (nine months) may have affected the outcome. It was also concluded that the diagnostic information and the building facilitators did not significantly contribute to the growth in decision making of the 501 students in the study. (Author/BM)",

Project objectives were to (1) identify use of retired persons as support personnel, (2) identify materials used in volunteer programs to develop guidelines for recruiting, training, and involving retired persons, and (3) develop vehicles for  national dissemination of materials. The concept was tested and demonstrated at two colleges in Ohio--Sinclair Community College in Dayton and University College of the University of Cincinnati. All participants--students, volunteers, and supervisors--evaluated it as a positive experience. Project materials were developed into a resource handbook which is available separately (see note). (Extensive appendixes, amounting to over one-half the report, include a synthesis of organizations, and the evaluation program. (YLB)",

Three communities with different ethnic blends, similar income levels (middle to lower-middle), and moderately high unemployment rates were selected as project sites. The outreach program, which reached approximately 2,000 participants with consumer education information, included the use of a mobile unit, a home-study course, work-site educational programs, paraprofessional counselors, and a closed circuit television network. The following are some of the project  objectives which were achieved to the extent that the majority of those participants who responded to the follow-up studies had changed their practices: (1) participants will spend their money more wisely and use their new knowledge and skills to extend and increase their resources to raise their standards of living; (2) participants will learn to develop a personal money management plan; (3) participants will understand the concept of consumer credit and its advantages, disadvantages, and wise use; and (4) participants will understand the various types of insurance policies available and know how an insurance protection program can be adapted to their personal needs.

Section 2, Worker Perceptions of Skills Necessary for Survival in the World of Work, describes a study that identified twenty-seven specific skills workers need to maintain their jobs. The third section presents a study that examined the opinions of cooperative education students and parents concerning the teaching of skills necessary for survival skills in the world of work.  Section 4 reports on a study that investigated the opinions of teachers, counselors, and administrators concerning the teaching of occupational survival skills. The fifth section reports on a study that identified teaching strategies which are appropriate for teaching each survival skill. The final study, Differences in Students' Attainment of Occupational Survival Skills and Career Attitude Maturity, focused on the uses of the occupational survival skills materials with three student groups: cooperative education students, special needs students, and Comprehensive Employment and Training Act students.

        "description":"Instructional System Development (ISD) methodologies and practices were examined in the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force, each of which prescribes the ISD system involving rigorous derivation of training requirements from job requirements, selection of instructional strategies to maximize training efficiency, and revision of instruction until training objectives are met. Procedures included (1) analysis of guidance documents used in all services for conducting ISD, (2) questionnaire survey of 209 units, agencies, and schools where training is developed, and (3) interview of training developers at thirty-three organizations to determine how fifty-seven courses were designed. The major finding was that ISD is not being used. The iterative and derivative character of the ISD  methodology can insure that training will be relevant to job requirements if its procedures are carried out. In practice, however, many ISD components are omitted so that the process is not truly derivative. The elements of ISD actually being practiced involve modern training technology for job analysis and self-paced instruction. Evidence shows that although the products of ISD can be mandated the ISD process itself cannot because training is both developed and evaluated within the training subsystem, whereas the consequences of training occur in operational units. It is thus recommended that operational commands be given a larger role in identifying job requirements, establishing training requirements, and evaluating the performance of training graduates. (Recommendations are presented  for nineteen specific steps in the ISD process.) (JT)",

Particular attention was given to an assessment of instructor management of II by computer. First, all relevant Navy instructions, directives, and guidance were reviewed and an assessment made of their impact on the implementation and management of II in the Navy. Next, key summary articles dealing with the effectiveness/efficiency of II were reviewed in an attempt to establish a consensus concerning the utility of this instructional strategy. Third, visits were made to key sites in the Navy  and other military services where information pursuant to the establishment of a comparative data base on II was obtained. Finally, findings and recommendations were developed on all information obtained. The major conclusion of the study was that the Naval Education and Training Command should continue to use II in Navy technical training. Specific recommendations for the improvement of II were provided in the areas of management information systems, training of instructors and managers, terminology, student-instructor incentives, cost benefit analyses, and further study requirements.

        "description":"To examine the economic efficiency of initial military specialty training, procedures were tested for estimating the effects of that training on posttraining job performance. The approach chosen was an application of human capital theory in which the costs of on-the-job training and the returns to training are measured by comparing the trainee's pay and net productivity. The key element in implementing this approach is the estimation of on-the-job productivity. The data used to explore the tradeoff among training courses of different lengths consisted of enlisted supervisors' estimates of the net productivity of trainees at different points in their first term of military service. These estimates were used to construct profiles of the time path of productivity. All the  productivity curves for the six specialties examined showed a positive slope that tended to decrease over time (the rate of improvement declining with experience). Moreover, comparisons among specialties tended to conform to expectations, both when comparisons were made between specialties in the same service and when between comparable specialties across services. Although further research is required before conclusions can be drawn regarding efficient mixes between formal and on-the-job training, the results suggest that it is possible to draw meaningful conclusions from data based on the carefully constructed ratings of supervisors. (A number of productivity paths are presented to show the general character of the data collected.) (JT)",

Data is based on the work histories of mature women obtained from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market Experience for the ten years from 1966 to 1976. The data suggests that it is becoming increasingly uncommon for a woman to remain a full-time housewife throughout child-rearing years. Slightly over one-third of married women work continuously during this time and the percentage is gradually increasing. Less than fifteen percent of black married women were outside the labor market continuously  during the most recent five-year period reported. For white women, changing family composition and changing attitudes toward women's roles were the most important factors contributing to the trend toward greater work attachment. (LRA)",

The primary analytical problem was to decompose the difference in the mean level of pay in any two sectors into the following components: human capital composition, unionization, occupational skill requirements, and a residual. Analagous decompositions were made for racial (white/black) differences in pay. The results of the decomposition suggest that the primary factors producing a monopoly sector pay premium are (1) a greater ability and willingness to pay high  wages due to greater economies of scale, market and political power, and a greater interest in developing a stable work force and (2) higher levels of unionization. In contrast to several previous studies, the relative disadvantages of black men were found to be somewhat greater in the competitive sector than in the monopoly sector. A significant portion of the disadvantage is due to the allocation of blacks, relative to whites with similar characteristics, to jobs requiring less skill. (YLB)",

In 1978 Congress added to Title 3 of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act a special program to assist displaced homemakers in making a successful entry into the labor market by providing employment opportunities, job counseling, job training, and other supportive services. Data from 1972 and 1976 National Longitudinal Survey interviews revealed that in 1972 between three and four percent of women in all age groups from thirty-five to forty-nine were potentially eligible for the displaced homemaker program. In 1976, eligibility rates were  higher by more than one percentage point for comparable age groups. In addition, it was found that since her first marriage the average eligible woman had spent about seventeen years out of the labor force and had worked six months or more for about nine years. Over one-third of the total eligible population and nearly one-half of the unemployed group had ten or more years of substantial work experience. (LRA)",

Depending on the approximate time of day they worked, respondents were classified into four categories of workers: day, evening, night, and split shift (working hours interrupted by a period of nonworking hours). The majority, day workers, were in general more prestigious, well-paid positions which require more education. Females or young persons (18-20) comprised more of the shorter hour, lower wage evening or split shift workers. This group, as well as night workers, were more likely to live in urban areas outside the South and were employed in manufacturing, transportation, service, wholesale, and retail sales  industries. Evening workers were more likely to be unionized. Night shift workers had worked at their jobs approximately as long as day workers. Almost no women worked in agriculture and construction while transportation and public utilities tend to employ females during the day but men at night. The opposite was characteristic of wholesale and retail sales, except that young men (19-29) often worked at night. Finance and insurance industries employed men more often on split shifts, employing females and young men during the day. Shift worker personnel and job related characteristics appear to be a function of both industry and occupation. (MEK)",

Public and nonprofit institutions consider job preparation their primary goal in addition to skill upgrading and teaching practical skills. Graduation rates of their primarily minority group students appear to be extremely low. They lack sound labor market information for program planning and pay little attention to student placement. Their strengths are geographic accessibility, low tuition, and minimal entrance requirements. In contrast, private schools have more stringent enrollment requirements, better linkage with the labor market, and high rates of  program completion and job placement. Apprenticeship programs have the most stringent entrance requirements, serve a narrow range of students, and best exemplify vocational program planning based on labor market demand. Vocational education problems in Alaska occur primarily in publicly supported institutions.

Their founding in 1950 coincides with legislation on workers' management which brought to the foreground educational needs of ill-educated workers expected to participate in self-management. Bases for the curriculum were general, socio-economic, and vocational emerged as institutions which adapted to workers' needs in program length, scheduling, location, and methods. From 1958-60 they received increasing recognition and support. Financing problems in a self-managing society were reflected in WUs dependence on the commune sociopolitical and worker in WUs dependent on the commune sociopolitical and worker  organizations, and communities of education. A tendency to change the concept of WUs into schools or services reflecting the demands of the financiers that were to continue into the seventies resulted. The influence of liberal, nationalistic, and other anti-self-managing forces led to a difficult period (1969-72). Funding dried up; the union with worker organizations decayed. In the early seventies education of the population for defense was added to the curriculum. Basic adult education became one of the most important programs. WUs are currently undergoing transformation to continue to meet the educational, cultural, and social needs of adult workers. (YLB)",

        "description":"A career continuum has evolved with career education being the preparatory phase in the schools and the quality of working life or career development in the profit and nonprofit sectors representing the participatory aspect. Historically, career education has emphasized preparatory processes providing learners with attitudes, knowledge, and skills needed in a fluid world of work. The concept of quality of working life addresses the qualitative relationship between worker and workplace. Its advocates see as fundamental (1) reasonable compensation, (2) job security, (3) a safe and healthful work environment, (4) recognition for achievement, (5) due process in work-related problems, (6) participation in decision making, (7) responsibility for and autonomy over work, (8) flexible  time arrangement, and (9) emphasis on education, training, and career development. Welding career education and the quality of working life into a career continuum enables learners and workers to make work a meaningful part of their lives. Work, work values, and career occupy important positions in any concept of a career continuum. A new set of work values increasingly requires challenging, satisfying work available upon completion of career education. Career, a lifelong endeavor, suggests adult growth, development, and socialization. Increasing understanding, communication, and cooperation between career education and quality of life proponents must occur to make the career continuum concept operational. (YLB)",

Career education coordinators participating in a miniconference recognized parents' rights and responsibilities in their child's career decision making but differed as to parent interest. They recommended informing parents about general as well as specific topics in education, involving them in the delivery of education, clarifying the career development process, and developing parent interest and involvement. Some specific efforts in local communities to increase parental involvement have already been put into practice. Implications drawn from  participant recommendations and discussions of current practice are (1) career education implementation efforts must reach all parents, (2) not all parents must participate for them to be an important component; (3) youth whose parents do not participate must be served; (4) parents should gain basic understandings of career development and basic skills in acquiring and using career information, (5) the collaboration of parents with counselors and teachers must be closer, (6) parents should help children see the presence and value of work within the home/family structure, and (7) parents should emphasize productive use of leisure time.

        "description":"Research developments in learning theory over the past fifty years have led to principles of behavior which have been shown in innumerable applied settings to be valuable in analyzing and modifying human behavior. When applied to flying training using simulators, these principles suggest that a significant contribution could be made in improving the way in which instructor pilots teach new students via more effective use of simulator functions. In addition, flying skills could probably be acquired more readily if tasks were presented in a more systematic manner, taking the principles of learning into account. When the simulator is conceptualized as merely an inferior copy of an aircraft, its potential as a teaching device (perhaps superior to the actual plan, in this regard) is  likely to be overlooked. Thus, a behavioral analysis of optimal conditions of learning would make a major contribution to both the design and use of current and future flight simulators.

Navarro College and three other cooperating two-year colleges have developed the curriculum for solar engineering technicians as well as course descriptions and are developing the proposed solar courses. Support courses were selected to provide prerequisite skills or knowledge, to satisfy requirements for associate degree programs, and to assure balance between technical, laboratory  courses and academic preparation. The course outline provides for an integrated laboratory lecture format with general goal statements, titled modules, specific performance objectives, and laboratory activities. The program is designed for high school graduates who will attend college full-time and those currently employed desiring skill upgrading. Instructors will be regular college faculty and technical and vocational instructors hired specifically to teach the technical solar courses. A national advisory committee provides guidance and evaluation. The remainder of phase 1 will include completion, editing, printing, use, and revision of course guides and the complete curriculum package. (YLB)",

Among the findings was that all states require certain qualifications if not certification or licensing for administration of vocational education programs.

Thirteen of fifty states have established work experience requirements ranging  from 1,000 to 3,000 hours. For 24.6 percent of the states, general administrative certification suffices.

Major themes running through the various legislative proposals will result in a reduced emphasis on fiscal controls, encouragement for process-oriented requirements, better integration of federal programs, and improve federal-state-local coordination. Some additional emerging policy issues are the relationship of formal education authorities to the Youth Employment and Demonstrations Project Act (YEDPA), tax credits on tuition, a cabinet level department of education, educational quality-accountability testing of basic skills, and jobs (creation of new employment). With respect to education in particular, the executive branch is skeptical about its  value and a recent informal poll of congressional staff aides revealed the following assertions or allegations: vocational education (1) provides irrelevant skills and is delinquent in providing basic skills, (2) maintains old categories over new job areas, (3) is run by an unresponsive establishment, (4) is dominated by rural and agricultural interests, (5) is discriminatory, (6) focuses too much on high school programs, (7) is delinquent in statistical program evaluation, (8) lacks effective statewide planning, (9) frustrates coordination at all levels, and (10) is too institution-oriented to school-age populations.

The author examines four major issues related to work focused guidance: (1) work or employment as an outcome of guidance, (2) work activity or work setting as a guidance technique, (3) the preparation of guidance personnel for work focused guidance, and (4) the meaning of work in relation to the guidance process (i.e., work as earning a living or as a means of achieving personal goals). The concepts of \"occupational\" or \"vocational guidance\" are examined in  contrast to \"career guidance,\" seen as a program rather than a service. The implications of this shift in relationship to federal employment and training legislation are discussed with focus on implications for research and development. Finally, seven questions are posed for research on services to youth in transition with emphasis on the need for attention to subpopulations. (PV)",

        "description":"Divided into four chapters, this monograph focuses on strategies that meet equally the common needs of all students and the unique needs of special students. Chapter 1, Preparing to Meet the Needs of Special Students: Let's Look at Our Responsibilities, identifies special needs populations and presents a list of responsibilities for teachers, counselors, and administrators in helping the special needs learner to succeed in a vocational program. The second chapter explores ten educational needs common to all learners and discusses basic strategies that may help teachers, counselors, administrators, and others to perform effectively with the special student. Chapter 3 provides lists of unique needs of seven special groups and presents strategies for meeting them. Special groups  included are (1) American Indians, (2) individuals with limited English proficiency, (3) inmates of correctional institutions, (4) minority groups, (5) gifted/talented students, (6) handicappeo students, and (7) migrants. The concluding chapter gives steps to improve access to vocational programs and to improve student performance. (LRA)",

The manual includes information which can be used in carrying out three planning tasks: (1) formulating program goals and objectives; (2) planning the allocation of resources for the achievement of goals and objectives; and (3) monitoring and evaluating a plan. The uses of demographic  and related information in vocational education planning are given special treatment. Topics include use of demographics and census data for identifying economically depressed areas, areas of high unemployment, and planning regions, and use of it for distribution of funds according to economic and social factors or student accessibility. Examples are also provided of how data analysis techniques and display procedures can be applied to vocational education planning. General concepts are discussed (e.g., sample vs. population and descriptive vs. inferential statistics) as well as specific analysis methods (e.g., multiple enumeration, relationship analysis, and curvilinear trends and regression) and such display techniques as tabular, graphic, line graphs, pie and column charts, pictorial  displays, and statistical maps.

        "description":"The literature on factors influencing nontraditional enrollment choices may be approached in this order: background information on the labor force and vocational education, factors influencing nontraditional enrollments, and strategies for increasing nontraditional enrollments. Despite an increase of women in nontraditional occupations, research shows that occupational sex segregation and related wage disparities continue to exist. The problem can be traced to male-dominated and -oriented training programs. Studies of nontraditional students reveal interest and ability as influential enrollment factors; parents are the most important other people involved. The literature on sex role socialization indicates that family members, the mass media, and all elements of public education  influence vocational choices. All have been criticized for perpetuating rigid sex roles. The order of influence of \"significant others\" on occupational preference is parents, peers, teachers, and counselors. Personal factors to be considered in nontraditional choices are ability and interest. An extensive literature on strategies for increasing nontraditional enrollments provides suggestions for programming from the prevocational level to the recruitment of mid-career students at the postsecondary level. Much information is available in the need areas of information, policy planning and implementation, occupational awareness, self-awareness, sex fair counseling/curriculum development, in-service programming, and collaborative efforts.

        "description":"Three broad statements summarizing nine axioms underlie a conceptualization of the character of behavioral and social research: (1) social and behavioral science is inherently reflexive, (2) ethics and epistemology are inseparable, and (3) the inherent complexity of behavioral and social phenomena must be reflected in the models developed to guide the support of productive educational research and development (R&D). The idea of differing epistemologies suggests that ignorance of or failure to recognize the worth of others' work leads to conflict between practitioners and researchers, research administrators and politicians as well as to slow adoption of research. A promising interaction model for educational research focuses on the outcomes of research and those who have a stake  in the outcomes. Relationships between \"stakeholders\" and outcomes vary. The form of an outcome is related to accessibility to stakeholders; stakeholders may have several relations in respect to a research outcome--primary, secondary, or tertiary. Policy implications flowing from the model lie in three main areas: the legitimization of a broader array of R&D activities, functions, and actors; decentralization of authority and responsibility for educational R&D; and the demand for much more careful analysis and attention to policy in its own right.

        "description":"Two focuses of a discussion of literacy and vocational competence should be the need for a more profound understanding of literacy and the relevance of that understanding for studying reading in vocational settings. A developmental model of the acquisition of literacy considers reading a second signaling system for speech. People who become literate learn to perform tasks with written language they previously could perform only with the spoken language. A second view of the written language points out that it differs from spoken language in two critical ways: it is permanent, and it may be arrayed in space. Written language can be consulted as an \"external memory\" and makes possible reading-to-do and reading-to-learn tasks. An exploratory study using reading-to-do tasks developed  a job reading inventory to (1) identify the reading tasks performed in jobs and (2) determine the level of general reading skill needed to perform them. Results showed a strong relationship between reading ability and ability to perform job-reading tasks. The inventory approach remains unvalidated. A sound theory of literacy in vocational settings must antecede establishing minimal competency levels. (Questions and answers are appended.) (YLB)",

Drug abuse prevention means helping young people develop personal strengths and values to reduce the chance that they will hurt themselves or others by misusing drugs or other chemical substances. This pamplet can be useful for parents, teachers, students, administrators, guidance personnel and community members. Topics focus on why people abuse drugs and how to develop community drug abuse prevention programs. Facts are provided in a straightforeward manner about social drugs, stimulants, depressants, sedatives, narcotics, hallucinogens and inhalents. Resource information is given for  nationwide drug abuse prevention programs, with addresses and services available; also provided are names and addresses of the 50 single state drug abuse prevention agencies.

In their play encounters with the child parents learn ways of being with the child that show empathy and caring as well as the way their playroom actions toward the child reflect their own conflicts as persons and spouses. This describes a case study on training a single set of parents to engage in weekly scheduled one-half hour play encounters, in a clinic playroom, with their child. During the play encounter, the parent is instructed to stay within two to three feet of the child and maintain as much eye-to-eye contact as possible, with verbalizations consistent with play therapy procedures. Results of the procedure indicate that parents can learn to: (1) alter their  behavior twoard their own children; (2) be more acknowledging of the validity of their children's (and each other's) feelings, thoughts, needs and wishes; and (3) negotiate and compromise in their conflicts with their children and each other.

It combines a program of social action with emphasis on functional relationships between the home and impinging social systems. The major features of the program include the following: (1) comprehensive services (social, psychological, and medical); (2) home visitations; (3) home learning activities and corresponding parental teaching behaviors; and (4) parental committees and meetings which are organized to facilitate parental involvement. The data that have been collected to measure these program areas have shown that the model has had a positive impact upon children and their achievement as well as upon their families, school, and community.

        "description":"The utility of self-control procedures and covert sensitization as alternatives to rapid smoking in smoking cessation was tested in two studies. Subjects (N=33) were at least 21 and had smoked a minimum of one pack per day for five years or more. Relaxation training and discussion of goals were presented to subjects. In Study I, both groups received a self-control manual and coaching to develop individualized self-control strategies; one group also received covert sensitization. Results indicated that covert sensitization added nothing to the effects of the self-control package. In Study II, one group received the same combination as in Study I, while the second group received the basic package with cue extinction procedures. A third group received a combination of both sets of  procedures. The higher abstinence rates for the self-control and cue extinction groups refelct improvements in the way meetings were conducted and procedures presented. The low abstinence rate for the combination group likely reflects problems associated with presenting too much material in the two weeks prior to cessation. (Author)",

Results of Study I revealed that when differences in social desirability were statistically controlled, females were significantly more neurotic than males, and disclosure flexibility interacted with dispositional level of disclosure. Those medium disclosers who were willing to disclose in accordance with social norms were significantly less neurotic than those whose disclosures deviated from the norms. Results of study II, which examined the effects of disclosure on measures of loneliness, ratings of social  skills, and social activity, found that dispositional level of disclosure was inversely related to loneliness and interacted with disclosure flexibility. Appropriate medium disclosure across situations was more highly associated with lower levels of loneliness than inappropriate disclosure. Peer- and observer-ratings of social skills were positively related to dispositional disclosure, but not to disclosure flexibility or level of loneliness. Among lonely subjects, there was a trend for disclosure flexibility to be associated with different levels of social activity. (Author)",

Results of the surveys indicated that counseling and student services personnel need to: (1) develop skills in  counseling special populations and areas of negotiations and bargaining; (2) plan programs and services which respond to the needs of all individuals; (3) improve working relationships with all educational personnel and communicate what they are doing and are able to do; and (4) become more aware of the importance of studying the future.

Equal access to education and expanded opportunities for life-long and continuing education for all individuals were also rated high  in action priority.

The last section of the report  discusses ten conclusions, among which are that presenting new information in well-learned structural organizations can facilitate learning that information, that eliminating redundancy and irrelevant commentary from newspaper stories facilitates assimilation and retention of important facts, and that annotating texts with references to related facts that have occurred in previous texts facilitates general inferential reasoning from the texts.

The complexity hypothesis predicted that a verb with many subpredicates would lead to poor memory strength between the surrounding nouns. The connectivity hypothesis predicted that verbs with many subpredicates would lead to greater memory strength between nouns in cases where the additional subpredicates provided semantic connections between the nouns. In the experiments, the subjects recalled subject-verb-object sentences, given subject nouns as cues. General verbs with relatively few subpredicates were compared with more specific verbs whose additional subpredicates either did or did not provide additional connections between the surrounding nouns. The level of recall of the  object noun, given the subject noun as cue, was predicted by the relative number of connecting subpredicates in the verb, but not by the relative number of subpredicates. This finding supported the connectivity hypothesis over the complexity hypothesis. The results are interpreted in terms of a model in which the verb conveys a structured set of subpredicates in a connective memory framework. (Author/RL)",

        "description":"In a study that examined the conditions that were likely to facilitate error detection, it was hypothesized that poor readers' comprehension monitoring abilities would improve if they were given assistance in selecting the appropriate schema for understanding a passage. When the hypothesis was tested with 20 sixth grade students in an error detection task, however, no evidence was found to support the notion that schema activation would significantly improve poor readers' error detection abilities. The results did indicate that while good readers were significantly better at error detection than were poor readers, a surprising number of children failed to report some very blatant errors. Although these results are in agreement with earlier studies using the same task, it seems  questionable to conclude that sixth graders are lacking in metacognitive abilities. An analysis of the results indicates five major difficulties in using the error detection paradigm: determining why subjects do not overtly respond to the presence of errors in the text; determining which criteria for comprehension subjects have chosen to apply; adequately specifying the kind, magnitude, and placement of target errors; overrelying on probes as dependent measures; and overrelying on subjects' verbal reports about their own cognitive processes.

Offering an account of what makes metaphors &quot;metaphorical&quot; (a way of understanding what metaphors are), the report also discusses some of the psychological processes associated with the comprehension of metaphor (how the understanding of metaphors might come about). The report deals with a number of questions, including: What are metaphors? How do they work? Why are they important in literature? Are they important in nonliterary language? What is involved in appreciating a metaphor? What is involved in producing one? What are the constraints on the development of the comprehension and production of metaphors by children?

        "description":"This report first demonstrates that the concept of accessibility is central to many theories of psychology from quite disparate domains and notes that a distinction of multiple and reflective access also seems to be part of many theories. It then suggests that no theory of intelligence can be complete unless provision is made for the operation of second-order knowledge, that is, knowledge about what we know (reflective access) and flexible use of the routines available to the system (multiple access). The second part of the paper considers the evidence that diagnosis or retarded and learning disabled children's learning problems based on process theories are fundamentally diagnoses of restricted access. It argues that training studies, whether successful or not at inducing  transfer, provide rich support for the hypothesis that the slow learning child has peculiar difficulty with the flexible use of knowledge. The final section of the paper discusses the implications of this position for the design of training programs aimed at alleviating the problem of accessibility. The developing technology available for programing transfer of training and the importance of interpersonal settings--particularly mother/child interactions and socratic tutoring--as cognitive support systems for learning are also outlined.

They are: the solitary nature of most writing tasks, a lopsided emphasis on low-level details of text such as grammar and spelling, and the isolation of writing from reading in the classroom. The paper describes a set of educational devices that attempt to change these aspects of writing instruction: the Story Maker, based on the notion of story trees with which children compose stories by making choices among story segments; and the Pre-Fab Story Maker and the Story Maker Maker, which allow children more creative input into the story-making process. These three tools are described both as suggestions to teachers for  innovative classroom language activities and as concrete examples of the implications of the theoretical framework developed in the paper.

It then discusses some general cognitive skills underlying all the various manifestations of metalinguistic awareness. It suggests that the metalinguistic skills that emerge during the preoperational stage reflect the child's focus and abilities during this period and that changes in reasoning that emerge with the  onset of concrete operations result in success on more complex metalinguistic tasks. Developmental changes in children's performance on the diverse set of skills considered metalinguistic in nature are cited as evidence in support of these claims. (FL)",

The ability to speak is one genetically produced aspect of being human, and research studies based on the assumption that speech is innate to humans have found that infants appear to pay particular attention to speech sounds as compared to other sounds of similar complexity, infants do not need to be coached in the motor skills involved in producing sounds, and the early language of children is universally similar in both grammatical form and meanings expressed. There are also biologically given capacities related to language--differences between individuals that influence language acquisition--that are activated through experience. Behavior  genetic analyses using studies of twins reflect differences due to genetic influence in a particular environment. The study of hereditary influences is essential to building theories that supply information for future decision-making regarding children's individual learning differences. A genetic predisposition does not mean that environmental intervention is of limited value, but rather that a different environment in structure, kind of stimulation, and frequency and nature of reinforcements may be necessary for a child with that predisposition.

Also discussed are the reader's responsibilities, including the selection of a fitting text that generates meanings that do not distort the author's message, bringing to the text conceptualizations that support a reasonable interpretation of the text rather than result in an abandonment of the author's message, employing strategies that are sensitive to the purposes of the text,  responding to the text as it exists in context rather than apart from it, and recognizing that a text represents an author's viewpoint.

Unlike past research results, the superior students' mean proportional recall at several subordinate levels of the content structure was equal to their recall at more superordinate levels. The second experiment investigated this phenomenon further with a more heterogeneous population of fourth and sixth grade students with average or below average reading skills. These subjects read and recalled two passages that contained certain semantic relations (&quot;covariance&quot; and &quot;collection&quot;  rhetorical predicates) at several subordinate levels of their respective content structures. The results again showed that readers with greater reading skill (the sixth graders) recalled proportionately more information at the selected subordinate levels than the less skilled readers (fourth graders).

Four tapes of teacher conferences with two students from the first and last of a semester were analyzed in depth. It was noted that the students seemed to have two major concerns that they repeated over and over again during the conference and that these concerns seemed to change as the semester progressed. During the first conference the student with stronger verbal ability issued more invitations to discuss strategy and the student with weaker verbal ability issued more invitations asking for information. The preliminary hypothesis was that students must have what  they consider to be a comfortable level of control over linguistic conventions before they can begin to think about basic strategies. During the final conference of the semester, the pattern of seeking information or strategies reversed itself. The weaker student, approaching the level of the stronger student at the beginning of the semester, asked about strategies, and the stronger student asked for more advanced information about the finer points of style, showing a progression in the learning process.

The findings discussed do not reveal definite reasons for inaccuracy, but several possible error sources are delineated: amount of reporter involvement, type of news, psychological factors (stress, news reporters' fantasies, open/closed-mindedness, tendency to evaluate others by whether they are \"like\" the reporters), the editorial process, writing style, imprecision of language, and time and competitive pressures. A summary of a research study on \"sibling\" newspapers--competing newspapers with the same owner--is also included. (AEA)",

Secondary purposes of the strategy are to help students deal with their own identities, to improve their general language and essay writing abilities, and to heighten their appreciation of the writing of others. The seven steps of the teaching method are: (1) begin with a provocative discussion from which a purpose for writing is generated; (2) record the student's essay or have the student write it; (3) select one or two essays to edit jointly with the student, being sure the student understands the class will be the audience; (4) prepare comprehension questions on the student-written essay at literal, interpretive, and applied levels; (5) prepare two or three language usage  exercises to point out the weaknesses and merits of the student's style; (6) have the class read the essay, do the comprehension check, and discuss their answers with the student/author; and (7) have the class complete the language exercises.

        "description":"Random samples of 786 Indianapolis, Indiana, residents and 413 residents of The Netherlands were interviewed in a study of media-related gratifications. Although the Dutch and American cultures and media systems differ considerably, a number of striking similarities emerged in the findings of this study, including similarities for the relative salience of the different needs, the relative frequency of media use in responding to the different needs, the specific media most often used to respond to different needs, and relative levels of satisfaction with media performance in response to specific needs. In Holland, mass media tended to be used more frequently for the more important personal needs, with the more salient needs producing greater relative satisfaction from media use  for those needs. In Indianapolis, the media were used more frequently to respond to a need, the higher the satisfaction, but the media were not used relatively often for the more important needs. Diversionary needs were the strongest need predictors of general television exposure in both places, while cognitive needs were the strongest need predictors of general newspaper exposure. The data indicated that personal needs should be considered when trying to predict the frequency and kind of media use. (Author/RL)",

        "description":"One hundred mother/child dyads were involved in a study to provide empirical evidence on parent/child interaction in grocery stores and on the contributions of Saturday morning television commercials to those interactions and to the purchase of candy and cereals. Data were collected in 15 supermarkets in two midwestern cities. First, the mother/child dyads were unobtrusively observed during the purchase of candy and cereal. After the observation, children were interviewed concerning the frequency of their exposure to Saturday morning television while mothers responded to a written questionnaire about their children's reactions to television advertising. The results indicated that children took the initiative for purchases of candy and cereal a majority of the time and that  regardless of who initiated the interaction, the other party would likely comply with the request. Amount of exposure to Saturday morning television immediately prior to a shopping trip was the only statistically significant predictor of whether children would initiate a product request. (FL)",

A total of 270 100-word samples were collected from the Chicago &quot;Tribune,&quot; the New York &quot;Times,&quot; the Memphis &quot;Commercial Appeal,&quot;&quot;Cosmopolitan,&quot;&quot;Atlantic Monthly,&quot; and &quot;Harper's Weekly.&quot; All these media were published during the three sampled time periods--1904, 1933, and 1965. The Flesch readability formula showed that the three newspapers were significantly less readable than the magazines across all time periods. The readability of the magazines corresponded to a level at which some high school education would be needed to understand the material. No significant differences between magazines were found across time periods. Newspapers, however, were found to  vary between sample periods; they were more difficult to read in 1933 than in 1904 or 1965. The newspaper readability levels corresponded to a &quot;difficult&quot; classification on the Flesch scale, with estimates that some college would be necessary to understand the material. The findings indicated that the newspaper is as readable today as it was in 1904, although the complexity of the language used has increased. (RL)",

Such an approach to poetry interpretation repudiates the philosophy of the New Critics that states that a reader should ask \"how\" and not \"what\" a poem means and that it is wrong to limit a poem's meaning by identifying it completely with authorial intention. However, such an approach permits students to read poems in their biographical and historical context and to gain practice in stating a thesis clearly (their interpretation of the poet's original intention) and to  defend that thesis with proper evidence. It also allows them to accomplish a literary critical paper and a library research paper in one assignment. (AEA)",

Four of five propositions derived from an interactive communication theory of the acculturation process were supported. The Indochinese refugee's interpersonal communication with Americans was positively related to a positive self-image, to perceptions of similarity between self and Americans, to lower feelings of alienation, and to greater English competence. Although the proposed relationship between the immigrant's acculturation motivation and interpersonal communication with Americans was not supported, the low reliability of the measurement items used in that portion of the  survey discourages a decisive conclusion.

        "description":"Commercial broadcasting seeks to maximize profit by developing a strong position in the marketplace and by attracting the audiences advertisers are likely to pay the most to reach. Broadcasting also serves many societal functions: it sells products, serves as educator and babysitter, and entertains and sedates. More people will be served by broadcasting where, as a system, it is diverse and supplies the audience with many choices. The structure of broadcasting in the United States is shaped by the regulatory environment in which it operates. Currently, this environment includes regular renewal hearings at which stations may be required to provide some indication that their operations are in the public interest. Some regulatory alternatives to current regulations now being  considered would extend the terms of licenses for radio and television, loosen ownership limits, reduce content regulation, and raise license fees. An alternative proposal to use regulations and fees to increase diversity includes encouraging technology to make use of narrower bands, subsidizing socially desirable program categories, encouraging diversity in ownership, helping fund alternative program production sources, and providing guaranteed insulated funding for noncommercial broadcast stations and production centers.

        "description":"This article presents an abbreviated report of a study to develop a model for achieving student participation in the governance of senior high schools. It also presents a blueprint for the implementation of this model in existing schools. For the study, a survey was done of a representative sample of senior high school students, teachers, and administrators in the Calgary public school system. The survey revealed that students are not now participating in decision-making concerning the governance of schools. Findings also indicated that students, teachers, and administrators look favorably on more sharing of decision-making concerning school rules and regulations but not concerning curriculum and evaluation. Researchers concluded that a model for increased student participation  should not radically alter the existing organizational structure of the school. The model of participative decision-making derived from the study and presented here is the &quot;control assembly.&quot; The control assembly is an elected body intended to serve as a forum at which differing views may be presented, debated, and amalgamated into a jointly shared long-range planning decision reflecting the views of students, teachers, and administrators.

The accounting system has been designed to be easily adaptable to the reporting requirements established by the Food and Nutrition Service of the United States Department of Agriculture in their publication entitled &quot;Financial Management-Cost-Based Accountability.&quot; The federal government's cost-based accounting program's basic goal is to insure that all costs incurred in the operation of a school food service program are properly allocated to the various food service programs being offered by a school system. In order to accomplish this allocation, it is necessary for the school system to collect basic cost  information and maintain appropriate records. The accounting system is structured toward appropriation accounting; accordingly, budgetary accounts are provided for in the manual. The manual also provides procedures for recording depreciation expense. (Author/MLF)",

A review of the literature in part 1 indicates a lack of empirical studies of instructional program effects, compared to other areas of education. Part 2 discusses a survey of 320 school districts across the country concerning the effect of enrollment changes on staffing patterns, instructional issues, demographics, and specific curriculum areas. The results of the research (part 3) show that as overall school enrollments decline, so do student enrollments in various courses of study, especially language arts, social studies, and science. In order to retain these courses, the study suggests educators experiment with different instructional modes and  employ educational technology to diversify instructional alternatives.

        "description":"This paper explains the use of intrinsic analysis procedures developed, as part of the Pennsylvania School Improvement Program (PSIP), to evaluate and choose curriculum materials and instructional programs. An intrinsic analysis, as distinct from an evaluation using outcome measures or classroom processes, employs research criteria to make decisions about the adequacy of curricular components. The intrinsic analysis looks at four elements of the Cooley-Lohnes Model for assessment of classroom practices: motivators, opportunity, structure, and instructional events. It also draws upon the Process Individualized Curriculum (PIC) model of curriculum design. When using this analysis of curriculum materials, the investigator first assesses whether the materials provide the conditions  that research suggests are motivating to students. Second is an evaluation of the intensity of the cognitive activity provided. Analyzing structure involves examining structure, sequence, placement procedures, testing adequacy, and exemplary appropriateness. Finally, instructional strategies are analyzed for appropriateness, consistency, provision for higher level skills, and adequacy of teacher manuals. (Author/JM)",

Studies reviewed include those in which drawings and paintings served as tools for identifying and teaching concepts and cognitive skills traditionally associated with language, those in which special art procedures substituted for language in developing concepts such as space and order, those in which art procedures served aesthetic and therapeutic goals concurrently, and those justifying the high teacher expectations of the art  abilities of deaf students.

Each of the six children mastered all of the discriminations that were taught. Results showed that the children varied in the extent to which they attended to the spoken words used during training. For two of the six children correct discriminative responding had been controlled solely by the signs, while spoken words had remained nonfunctional.

Methodology included review of respite care regulations in 12 states, site visits and a survey of Massachusetts programs, and a survey of 339 families with developmentally disabled members. The project found that respite care is not well developed as a support service to families in any state although recognition of respite care as a necessary community service component is growing. Ten program models for delivery respite care were identified: respite placement agencies, group day care, community residences, residential treatment facilities, group residential care, nursing homes, private in  home care, state facilities camperships, and funding conduit. The majority of families (70%), however, reported preferring home based care over other models. Obstacles to respite care identified by families included reluctance to leave their family member with a stranger and lack of knowledge of what types of services were available at what cost leading to the recommendation that more publicity and community education about respite care should be conducted. Problems with quality of care were identified for most program models and recommendations are made for improving services. (Author)",

It is explained that the differences causing severe communication handicaps will affect which aspects of language processing and which aspects of language will be affected. Suggestions are made as to why some individuals who have great difficulty in acquiring spoken language might acquire sign language, e.g., the use of signs (such as rocking a baby for the word baby) which bring the referent to mind. It is concluded that teaching signed systems may be a winning effort regardless of presumed or real cognitive-linguistic limitations. (Author/PHR)",

The plan establishes a system that identifies children in need of special education, places children in the programs best suited to their needs, evaluates each child's progress periodically, moves key educational decisions from the state to the local level, and provides parents with opportunities to influence decisions about their child's education. The Master Plan's development is reviewed, and its goals are considered. Other aspects examined include student placement, resource specialist programs, parent and student rights, funding, evaluation requirements, community advisory  committees, and staff training. Six Responsible Local Agencies (agents responsible for coordination of the Master Plan) are described in terms of such facets as identification, volunteers, inservice training, advisory committees, and parent recruitment. Some problems arising from the Master Plan are discussed, along with its positive impact on teachers, handicapped and normal students, parents, and society in general. An appendix discusses federal law regarding the education of the handicapped. (DLS)",

An integrative scheme is offered from evidence of child abuse literature, experimentally induced infant crying effects, attribution theory, and learned helplessness. It is suggested that infant crying often has causes beyond caregiver control, such as birth status, temperament, and handicap. The author suggests that unpredictable soothing success coupled with a caregiver's belief that the infant is personally responsible for its actions can lead to infant abuse. Successful intervention should aim at assisting parents to redefine their situation and releasing them from beliefs of infant trapped helplessness. (Author/CL)",

        "description":"Strategies are developed for understanding how language variation limits communication. Methods of measuring communication are discussed, including an intelligibility measure used in the Solomon Islands. The analysis of data gathered using communication measurement is discussed. The result of the analysis is a determination of the number of vernacular language programs needed in a given area, and the proper location for those programs. The measurement of communication and the methodology for finding centers of communication lead to a proposed model of communication. This model suggests that interdialectal understanding depends on the linguistic similarity of two dialects and on the the social relationships between speakers of the dialects. Data from ten field studies on  linguistic similarity are analyzed to explore the relationship between lexical similarity and intelligibility. A model for expressing this relationship is proposed. Social data from Santa Cruz in the Solomon Islands are considered in the formulation of a more comprehensive model embracing social and linguistic relationships. Predictions from this model are demonstrated to be over 90% accurate. A bibliography is appended. (JB)",

It also attempts to isolate problems characteristic of lexicometry in general and German lexicometry in particular, and it addresses the question of a possible evolution in German lexicometry, particulary with regard to criteria for selection. The research covers three stages: (1) a compilation of all works in German lexicometry; (2) an analysis of the available literature from Kaeding (1898) to Pfeffer (1971); and (3) an analysis of the work of Kaeding  and Pfeffer. The authors between Kaeding and Pfeffer are divided into two groups, those who have used Kaeding's compilation and those who have not used it. The conclusions are both theoretical and practical. They concern the quality of German words, the method, problems, deficiencies, and evolution of research in lexicometry, the utility of the research, and suggestions for further analyses. (AMH)",

In line with the primarily pedagogical objective, the experimental material was an oral test on simple French interrogatives recorded by students on the level of &quot;francais fondamental.&quot; To illustrate the process used, the method of analyzing one student's errors is described.

        "description":"Part One of this guide explores issues in English proficiency testing. Tests are discussed in terms of the aspect of language tested, and of different kinds of test tasks. The following kinds of test task defects are treated: (1) tests that required literacy skills, (2) tasks that reduce to a vocabulary test, and (3) errant notions of linguistic complexity. Inherently faulty approaches to testing are discussed, including mimicry, testing passive comprehension, inferring lack of control from lack of performance, and using self-reported data. The value of specific test tasks (e.g., vocabulary test) in determining overall language proficiency is questioned. Linguistic artificiality in tests (e.g., demanding that answers be in complete sentences) is viewed as requiring matelinguistic  knowledge from students. The implications of second language acquisition for language testing are discussed. Discrete point tests are contrasted with integrative tests, and the degree of correspondence between test content and order of acquisition of language skills is examined. Examples from specific tests are used throughout the guide. Part Two consists of an annotated catalogue of English proficiency tests. Each test is cross-referenced to relevant discussions in Part One. (JB)",

This was the first nationally standardized test taken in China since the Cultural Revolution began in 1966. The examination contained tests in eight subjects: mathematics, physics, chemistry, politics, history, geography, Chinese language, and foreign language. This report includes English translations of the official review outline for the 1978 examination (essentially a syllabus designed to help students prepare for the examination) and the actual tests in six of the eight subjects (geography, Chinese language, and foreign language other than English are not included). Commentaries by American specialists on the material related to the various subjects assess the  level of knowledge reflected in the available 1978 Chinese materials and, as feasible, compare it with the level of knowledge in that subject expected of prospective college entrants in the United States who have completed the usual college preparatory course in American secondary education. Commentators also compare the content of the 1978 outline with the relevant portion of the national college entrance examination outline used in China in 1959 to determine what changes may have come about in each of the eight subjects as a result of the Cultural Revolution and to provide information about academic standards since the Cultural Revolution. The scope of material covered by the examination and the preparation for and conduct of the examination are also summarized. The commentators are  Michael Lindsay, Frederich W. Mote, Frank J. Swetz, John W. Layman, Marjorie Gardner, Chang-tu Hu, Clifton W. Pannell, and Timothy Light. (SW)",

An interactive perspective of child development that sees a handicap, disability, or dysfunction as a result of a mismatch between the child and the situational characteristics was adopted. Disability was descirbed as a deviation in body or functioning that  resulted in a functional inadequacy in view of environmental demands. The model was designed to be easy to advocate and also capable of dissemination and reformation in places with different program development requirements. Information is presented on the following project components: learning objectives in elementary and intermediate statistics, research design, measurement and assessment, and evaluation research; objectives of the interdisciplinary training committee, the names and qualifications of the training committee members, and colloquium and seminar topics; activities of the research practicum; and outcomes of the project evaluation.

It is assumed that funding will continue to be primarily based on enrollment, but that a complementary feature might be built into the formula to promote institutional diversity and improved instructional performance. During the first project year, faculties at 11 Tennessee institutions developed institutional-wide instructional goals and  associated indicators for measuring performance on those goals. The second project year involved collecting data on the indicators and exploring ways in which project results might be incorporated into the allocation process. Indicator profiles are included for the following four colleges: Columbia State Community College, The University of Tennessee at Knoxville, The University of Tennessee at Martin, and The University of Tennessee at Nashville.

Sources of supplemental income are described, and income variables are related to characteristics of individual faculty members, their institutions, and their disciplines. The analysis was based upon the l975 survey of the American Professoriate (Ladd and Lipset, 1975) which included approximately 4,000 responses of faculty from 111 randomly selected institutions. Separate analyses were performed on responses of faculty from doctoral universities and from faculty at all institutions granting a baccalaureate or advanced degree, including the doctorate. Institutional base salary was primarily determined by academic rank, and to a much smaller extent by academic discipline and contract length. The amount and source  of supplemental income, on the other hand, depended more on discipline and less on academic rank. Faculty from doctoral universities received higher base and supplemental salaries, particularly higher than those faculty from liberal arts colleges. School quality (in terms of SAT test scores, revenue, and research dollars) was positively related to both base and supplemental incomes, as was school size. The research productivity of each respondent was also positively correlated with base salary, supplemental income, and the likelihood of reporting most sources of supplemental income other than additional teaching.

Earnings were assessed for a total of 16 occupational groups by geographic location, age, sex, and race. To be eligible for the survey respondents were required to have completed six or more years of college and to have worked full-time in 1976 in a job classified by the Census Bureau as \"professional.\" The results indicate that college faculty as a group earn an average income  only slightly below the mean earnings of the total sample of professional occupations. When adjusted to reflect the specific effects of occupation, the results indicate that college faculty earn approximately $600 less than university and school administrators. Relatively small effects on earnings were noted for the race and sex variables. Scientists, engineers, and social scientists did earn incomes significantly higher than comparable academics. The data are extensively tabulated and the methodology explained. (SF)",

        "description":"The need for more consistent and comprehensive procedures for evaluating faculty performance is discussed in this newsletter. Declining student enrollments and financial restraints have created a &quot;no growth&quot; climate on campuses and it is suggested that this environment will require a two-thirds drop in the demand for new faculty at a time when the annual supply of Ph.D.s is increasing. Therefore a systematic faculty evaluation procedure is suggested that offers administrators a method of ensuring faculty quality and provides assistance with decisions concerning promotion, salary, tenure, and termination. The use of evaluation for faculty development and instructional improvement is also emphasized. Various techniques utilized by faculty improvement programs are mentioned and the  connection between the quality of teaching and improved student learning is examined. Areas of faculty evaluation often include instruction, research, professional growth and development, student advising, university service, community service, administration and management, departmental service, and publications. A model of an evaluation system for assessing individual faculty members is presented. Multiple sources of data are identified for use in faculty evaluation. These include deans, vice-presidents, department chairmen, other faculty, self-evaluation, and students. Several recommendations for developing evaluation procedures are included. (SF)",

        "description":"A sample of 2,564 black college students attending 19 predominantly white colleges in the south were surveyed to determine their attitudes and opinions about their institutions. The students were generally female, under 21 years of age, single, and enrolled full-time. The survey focused on four areas: campus life and activities, college choice, minority student recruitment, and problems in attending a predominantly white institution. In general the respondents felt that their institutions were not making enough of an effort to recruit and maintain minority faculty and students. They felt that the most important factor in recruiting minority students was increased financial aid. The black students thought more consideration should be given to minority student interests and that  there should be increased minority participation in planning and developing special programs. Overall, the black students indicated that they chose to attend a predominantly white institution because of its recognized quality and reputation. The respondents indicated that they felt they had an additional burden to bear as minority students on white campuses. The survey also indicated a high persistence rate for these students. It is recommended that the traditionally white institutions commit themselves to meeting the special needs of minority students. Appended are an explanation of the research methodology, data tables, and the survey questionnaire. (SF)",

Specific areas of focus are recommendations concerning Title III, strengthening developing institutions; institutional eligibility; the administration and management of student financial aid programs; the allocation of student aid funds to students, states, and institutions; and grant aid to students through the Basic Grant and the Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant  programs. The administration is proposing: a packaging framework for student financial aid; a single student aid application form; a single needs-analysis system; a new formula for state-matching in the State Student Incentive Grant Program; and the elimination of the initial year-continuing year distinction in the Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant Program. The administration is also proposing to modify the Basic Grant maximum award and the reduction schedule, to permit the use of average rather than actual costs of attendance under the Basic Grant program, and to increase the maximum Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant Award.

        "description":"The role of endowments in academic finances of higher education is examined. Two effects of the decline of endowment funding, their failure to keep pace with inflation and loss of income for innovative programs, are cited. The historical role of endowments in institutional finances is reviewed. Present concepts of endowment management are discussed, including the &quot;total return&quot; investment approach and management objectives in the areas of spending policy, portfolio diversification, and endowment growth. The possible effects of ethical issues on endowment funds is illustrated by the South African-related investments. Decisions to divest all South African stocks cause a number of problems for institutions, not only possible loss of revenue due to divestiture costs and lack of sound  investment possibilities but also possible loss of potential contributions from business. A current attitude among college and university investors is that their presence in South Africa can contribute to changing current conditions. It is concluded that the decline of endowments' contributions to general institutional revenues is part of the general financial problem in academe, and that current policy seems to dictate a more balanced management approach that would protect endowment principal and seek profit by diversifying the portfolio into several different types of financial markets.

        "description":"What is taught, what is learned, and how they relate to graduate employment are examined in an effort to interpret the trend toward vocationalism within higher education institutions. It is suggested that tightening of the graduate labor market inaugurated an accelerating trend toward vocationalism that has contributed to a deterioration of academic values and a demoralization of college faculty. The teaching responsibilities of colleges are discussed and divided into general knowledge, disciplinary knowledge, and instrumental knowledge. Instrumental knowledge is described as practical or vocational instruction. A general trend away from disciplinary majors in favor of the instrumental subjects is discussed. The values and outcomes of general, disciplinary, and instrumental  education are explored and it is concluded from the research that the large increase in instrumental graduates does not represent a better articulation of education and employment, nor does it constitute a productive social investment. Therefore it is suggested that the traditional mission of American undergraduate education--disinterested learning for cultural enrichment and intellectual development--now appears in danger of being displaced by vocational programs of dubious value.

One set of experiments on the interactive cable system located in Spartanburg, South Carolina, was aimed at adults who had not completed their high school education; the other study, which substituted data terminals for telephone interaction, was aimed at parents interested in the principles of child development. These experiments were designed to determine whether sufficient numbers of students would be attracted to and enroll in courses that rely on home terminals, and if these students could use the system to make satisfactory educational progress. The studies also explored the continuing debate over the federal  government's role in supporting and regulating interactive cable service. Results were positive for both cable interaction processes and educational effectiveness, and telephone interaction was found to be preferable to data terminal interaction. It is suggested that the recent and continuing removal of restraints on the growth of the cable industry may be sufficient to allow home cable education to prosper. (Author/CMV)",

        "description":"This library skills program, which is offered by Slippery Rock State College (Pennsylvania) as part of its Vacation College program, was developed for adults who have been out of school many years. The vacation college concept of leisure and life long learning emphasizes the learning of recreational activities, along with more practical and intellectual courses such as the library skills program, in a relaxed informal manner; the course is low cost and of one week's duration. The major concern of the library skills program, which is designed to raise the level of consciousness of the participants towards the library and its services, is to make the course enjoyable as well as instructional for persons on vacation and out of school. Five one and a half hour sessions use a mix of  tours, demonstrations, slides, films, discussions, and lectures to achieve understanding by the participants of the resources, services, roles, objectives, and problems of the library. Evaluation of the program shows it to be enjoyable and rewarding for the participants and the instructors. Appendices provide a brief questionnaire, a participant's handbook, and a bibliography.

Designed for teacher training institutions, curriculum laboratories, resource centers, and adjunct collections in school libraries, this scheme can be used separately or to supplement standard classification systems, which, while they have provision for textbooks, do not make plain the curricular relationships involved. Underlying usage assumptions for the scheme are (1) the collection does not circulate, but is maintained as a unit; (2) the books must be so classified as to indicate their use in the curriculum; and (3) the textbooks must be shelved as  classified if the open shelf method is used. The notation is mixed, combining upper case letters with decimal numbers, utilizes cuttering by publisher rather than by author, and allows the formation of call numbers. An outline schedule for small collections and a full schedule for larger collections are provided, as well as a subject index to the classification scheme. (RAA)",

The description of the inpatient care support system includes use of computers in hospital information systems, clinical laboratory systems, radiology, electrocardiography, patient monitoring, and emergency medical care. The section on the outpatient care support system includes use of this technology in ambulatory medical record systems, the physican's office, and telemedicine.  In addition, this report describes information support activities, including computerized databanks, computer-based consultation, special hardware, and specific projects aimed at transferring proven technologies to health care settings.

Online authoring aids were developed to be used on the PLATO IV Computer-Assisted Instruction (CAI) system, as well as off-line versions, to assist the author in preparing materials for both CAI and non-CAI delivery of instruction. The three levels of evaluation conducted included an informal evaluation on existing IPISD materials, a formative evaluation of the newly  developed authoring aids, and an evaluation of the instructional materials produced. Findings were positive--user acceptance of the authoring aids was high, and the time required for development of test and lesson material was significantly reduced. Based on these findings, the development of such aids for additional blocks of the IPISD model have been initiated. Flowcharts for both the two blocks studied and the authoring aids are provided, and a 97-item bibliography is attached. (BBM)",

        "description":"Society suffers from the underutilization of more than half of the talents available to educational administration because of discriminatory attitudes against women which are reinforced in the school setting. Indeed, a 1970-71 nationwide survey showed that while 67% of all public school teachers were women, women held only 15% of the school principal positions. Similarly, a study of 37 randomly selected community colleges in six states (California, Illinois, Florida, Maryland, Texas, and Arizona) revealed that only 98 women held administrative positions at these colleges between 1973 and 1976. Of these, 51 were chairpersons and none were presidents. Most were in traditionally female disciplines, such as home economics and nursing, and only 20% held Doctorates of Philosophy.  Discriminatory practices and attitudes contributing to this problem include invisible barriers, such as word-of-mouth recruitment techniques, and myths, such as the belief that women administrators are absent from their posts more often than males. Concrete steps should be taken to combat this situation at national, university, community college, and personal levels, e.g., support of legislation eliminating sex barriers, encouragement of women to attain advanced degrees, active recruitment of women for administrative positions, and encouragement of women to aggressively pursue administrative jobs.

Support services, including peer-level tutoring, personalized supplementary instruction, intensive study skills training, and peer-reinforcement in tutoring, are also discussed in this section. The final section of the report focuses on the student-centered aspects of IN, i.e., assessment activities during registration to identify prospective IN students, the voluntary nature of IN, appropriate learning strategies, realistic advisement, and career counseling.

        "description":"Anthropology and interdisciplinary social sciences (ISS) education at two-year colleges are examined as revealed in a study of science education conducted by the Center for the Study of Community Colleges that involved a review of the literature, an examination of the catalogs and class schedules from 175 institutions, and a survey of 1,125 science instructors. Part I of the report discusses the literature review findings in terms of: (1) rationales for interdisciplinary survey courses in social sciences; (2) methods of providing ISS instruction to both transfer and terminal students; (3) the pros and cons of team instruction; (4) specialized ISS courses such as gerontology and environmental studies--and in relation to anthropology courses--(5) the small role of anthropology  within the community colleges; and (6) innovative instructional approaches. Part II analyzes ISS and anthropology curricula and instruction as revealed in the catalog and schedule study and the instructor survey. Frequency of course offerings is considered for eight ISS and seven anthropology components. Additionally, faculty characteristics, enrollments, course objectives, classroom and out-of-class activities, grading, instructional materials, and areas for improvement are considered. Part III summarizes conclusions and recommendations. A bibliography, a list of surveyed institutions, descriptions of each of the disciplinary categories, and the questionnaire are appended. (JP)",

The survey report concludes with recommendations for the establishment of a uniform state transfer policy and for refinements in current procedures to increase student awareness of the transfer procedure.

Measures of socioeconomic impact, such as personal income, occupational status, levels of education, are discussed and studies focusing on these measures are cited. Additional studies are pointed to which define economic impact in terms of local services and capital expenditures, jobs, employee salaries, local expenditures by staff and students, and property tax revenues. The concept of human capital and the different ways it can be measured are then introduced. The paper concludes with a five-component model which provides specific measurement indicators and categories in which data can be placed. The components are: (1) social mobility, which is  defined in terms of comparative measures of income and employment of two-year college graduates and other groups; (2) cost benefits, comparing the cost of institutional programs and services and the market value of graduates; (3) economic development, which considers the college as a provider of trained manpower for the regional labor market; (4) community renewal, which assesses the college's impact on community demography, employment, social organization, and taxable property; and (5) social control, which assesses the absorption and conversion of undeveloped manpower into human capital to meet community needs.

        "description":"Community colleges, in order to maintain a credible place within higher education during the 1980's, will have to integrate arts and sciences instruction into a curriculum provided for an increasing percentage of non-transfer students. This increase, due to an expected intensification of the competition from universities for a shrinking pool of 18-year-olds, will result in an increased emphasis on remedial, vocational, and community education. In the face of this shift from transfer education, community colleges should guard against the expansion of quasi-educative activities devoid of instructional content and goals. Such activities, including recreational programs, fairs, and the offering of credit for experience, fall outside the definition of formal education and reduce  institutional credibility in the eyes of the public. Further, colleges must abandon the practice of limiting liberal arts education to academically inclined transfer students. This can be accomplished by: (1) sharing in the activities of liberal arts organizations such as the Community College Humanities Association, (2) providing interdisciplinary liberal arts courses, (3) offering liberal arts non-credit options, and (4) incorporating liberal arts instruction into vocational and remedial programs.

Only the employers of occupational graduates in full-time jobs related to their program of study were involved. These employers were asked, on a specially prepared questionnaire, to state opinions on the educational requirements of the jobs held by HCC graduates, the adequacy of the job preparation of the graduates, and the quality of their vocational training. Of the 34 questionnaires mailed, 32 were returned. Major findings indicate that almost half (46.7%) of the jobs held by the graduates required an associate degree, and that the associate degree was preferred for another 23% of the jobs. Over 89% of the  employers indicated that the college's preparation of graduates for the performance of job skills was adequate or more than adequate, while 100% gave the same ratings to the ability of the graduates to learn new techniques and effectively communicate with superiors. A majority of the employers (81%) rated the overall vocational training of the graduates as good or very good, and 100% indicated that they would hire another HCC graduate.

One hundred twenty intact families participated in the study. Forty families consisted of parents and an only child aged 3 1/2 - 4 1/2 years and 80 were three-child families with a middle child aged 3 1/2 - 4 1/2 years. In the latter group, half of the families had fewer than three years' spacing between oldest and middle children and half had greater than three years' spacing. Half of the families were working class, half were middle class. Parent questionnaires and interviews and seven tasks for assessing the child's  representational abilities and problem-solving competence were employed. Results implicate social class and family configuration factors in the development of children's problem-solving abilities. Children from different family configurations demonstrate different strengths and weaknesses relative to other children, depending on the problem in question. At times, the results obtained contradict common stereotypes associated with family characteristics. For instance, only children tended to generate passive strategies less often than children with siblings. Passive approaches to problems and memory abilities differentiate the three family configuration groups. (Author/RH)",

Three levels of subjects were investigated: 23 day care centers in Lansing, Michigan, day care staffs and families of children enrolled. Three questionnaires were developed to obtain data on demographic and attitudinal variables. A director's questionnaire focused on demographics of the centers. A staff questionnaire included a work satisfaction scale. The family questionnaire sought information on how parents assessed and chose a center. Several attitudinal scales were included in both the staff and the family instruments. Sex role differences, sex role socialization, ethnic perceptions, coorientation, interaction network academic expectation and satisfaction measures were employed.  Questionnaires and standard statistical summaries for each item in each of the three questionnaires can be found in Appendix B. Descriptive and interpretive analyses of the data are presented in separate sections of the study. It was concluded that institutionalized day care is increasingly accepted by families who utilize day care centers. Skill as care-givers stems from systematic academic experience, not from direct experience of a parentinq role. Differences exist in the way the role of the day care center is defined in relation to the family system. Letters and printed materials, questionnaires and statistical summaries are appended.

        "description":"The TV viewing situation involves an active transaction between the child, the TV, and the TV viewing environment. The TV viewing transaction is a blend of passive and active cognitive activities. Children begin to watch TV systematically at around 2 1/2 years of age because at that time they have the cognitive ability to aappreciate the meaning of the dynamic flow of images and sounds it presents. Evidence exists that preschool children look at the parts of a television program that are understandable, and that they engage in alternate activities such as toy play when the program momentarily is not understood. Preschoolers also use their peers' behaviors as cues for directing their visual attention in the TV viewing environment. One passive aspect of TV viewing may be called\"attentional inertia\": the longer a TV viewer continuously maintains visual attention to the television, the more probable it is that he or she will continue to do so. Although in general the young child stops attending to incomprehensible program material, attentional inertia may occasionally lead the child to new cognitive discoveries. TV viewing in young children is not simply the mesmerizing passively receptive activity it is represented to be in popular books. Directions for further research are suggested. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"Twenty-two family day care providers and twelve home visitors from seven Massachusetts agency-sponsored family day care systems completed two-part questionnaires investigating their perceptions of their own and each other's ideal and actual &quot;on the job&quot; behavior. Provider-questionnaire items focused on (1) physical environment of home, personal prossessions, routine; (2) materials and activities; and (3) interpersonal relationships. Visitor-questionnaire items focused on (1) frequency and duration of visits; (2) visitor roles: administrator-liaison, consultant, model-educational aide, relief; (3) interaction during visits; (4) process of visits; (5) nature of feedback. In addition, semi-structured interviews explored providers' views on adjustments within the home and with family  and neighbors, their relationships with natural parents, their relationship with visitors, and their feelings about their work. Visitors were asked about the evolution and objectives of their role, about problem-solving with providers, and about their feelings about their work. Without directly assessing the behavior of providers and visitors, this project takes the preliminary step of exploring attitudes in order to develop training-support systems congruent with the particular circumstances of home-based child care. Questionnaire results suggest that providers and visitors, for the majority of items, share perceptions of the ideal provider and the ideal visitor, and of the actual provider and actual visitor. The questionnaire is appended. (Author/RH)",

Subjects were 23 Japanese normal infants (11 males and 12 females) who were individually tested once a month from the age of six to 13 months in laboratory settings. Small toys and three white opaque cubic boxes were used as hidden objects and covers, respectively. The subjects' spontaneous search behavior was observed after hiding a toy under one of the three boxes on a table. Fixation time to either of the three boxes was measured, and the entire procedure was videotaped. Cross-sectional data revealed the general developmental process of search behavior. Results indicate that the developmental process of search behavior is from nonmanipulation  despite fixation to trial and error manipulation and then to goal-orienting manipulation. However, more than half of the subjects fell in a Redundant pattern of development. Males' search levels were significantly higher than females' at 6, 7, 9 and 11 months of age. These findings and additional results were discussed in relation to previous studies on object permanence and general cognitive development in infancy. (Author/RH)",

The first phase, the Child Development Program Evaluation (CDPE) was designed to provide a standardized system for the assessment of 16 components of the day care delivery system. Three instruments were produced to assess compliance with federal requirements, state standards and professional recommendations. The second phase, the Ecological Paradigm for the Delivery and Assessment of Child Care (ECOPAD), is designed to provide the accountability needed in the Bureau of Child Development Programs. The emphasis of this model is to  integrate data across three component areas: program services, statistical reporting and fiscal costs. Use of the CDPE and ECOPAD in combination is thought to provide a relatively objective evaluation of the total impact and cost of a social services program. (Author/RH)",

Provision of health care for many needy children depends on their elegibility for Medicaid; however, Medicaid is not available to all disadvantaged children in need of health services. Section Two argues that because its mandate covers all eligible poor children, the EPSDT program is able to meet the health needs of all youth from low income families. The program status, screening effectiveness, program design, inter-agency relationships and related benefits of the program are discussed. Section Three explores  aspects of program implementation including states' roles, cost and quality of EPSDT services, and program administration.

        "description":"The objectives of this research effort were 1) to develop a methodology for assessing the impact attenuation performance of surfaces in relation to head injury, and 2) to test surfaces commonly installed under playground equipment to determine which surfacing materials, if any, are capable of providing protection against head injury that might result when a child falls from equipment and impacts the surface. Due to the large variety of surfaces that can be installed under equipment, it would be impractical to test all such surfaces. Therefore, it was decided to test eleven commonly used surfacing materials, with some materials comprising two or three surfaces depending upon the depth of materials. The impact attenuation performance of surfaces, in relation to head injury due to  falls from playground equipment, was tested by dropping an instrumented American National Standard Institute (ANSI) headform on the surface and measuring the acceleration response of the headform. As the impact attenuation performance criterion, it is proposed that a surface should not impart a peak acceleration in excess of 200 g's (acceleration due to gravity) to the instrumented ANSI headform. Surfaces composed of six inches of loose materials such as pine bark, sand, shredded tires and shredded wood bark imparted peak accelerations which were below this limit for drop heights up to 10 feet. Surfaces composed of one layer of unitary material exceeded the criterion at drop heights of 5 feet or less. (Author/RH)",

The standard applies to swings and straight slides intended for use as public playground equipment. The following six topics are covered by the standard: (1) swing assembly structural integrity, (2) swing assembly moving impact, (3) straight slide surface incline, (4) straight slide surface exit region, (5) straight slide surface side height, and (6) straight slide ladders and stairways. Equipment of this type is typically located in play areas of parks, schools, institutions, multiple family dwellings, private resorts, recreation  developments, and other areas of public institutional use. The safety standard does not apply to amusement park rides and equipment, equipment normally intended for sports use, or to home playground equipment. Supporting rationale for the standard is extensively discussed. (Author/RH)",

Information is based on the college records of those Natives who entered college for the first time at the University of Alaska at Fairbanks (UA), Alaska Methodist University, or Sheldon Jackson College during the sample years 1963-64, 1968-69, and 1971-72. Major findings indicate the number of Alaska Natives entering these colleges increased four times from 1963-72; the number succeeding (attaining a 2.0 grade point average for at least 7.5 credit hours per semester) increased five times; an average of only twenty-two Natives per year received a four-year degree from colleges  in Alaska or elsewhere during 1969-72; Natives from private church-related boarding schools are entering and succeeding in college at a significantly higher rate than Native students from other types of high schools; and while progress has been made in increasing Natives' college entrance and success rates, their rate of success is still substantially below that of white students. Substantial improvement may be gained by changing nonacademic aspects of school environment to strengthen individual characteristics such as self concept and sense of life direction. (Author/NEC)",

The legislative mandate of the OPR includes encouraging, promoting, and engaging in educational endeavors; this responsibility is met by construction and operation of nature centers, creation of on-going interpretive programs in large state parks and urban parklands, and development of urban cultural parks. Two nature education centers are now in operation, three additional centers are under construction, and two cooperative pilot programs are training teachers in  environmental education. Many traditional interpretive programs are maintained, e.g., nature trails with brochures for self-guided walks; and non-traditional programs have been developed for the visually and physically handicapped and for children of migrant workers. A statewide system of urban cultural parks, created by state legislation in 1977, will be developed to increase recognition and appreciation of urban cultural and natural resources. This program, in conjunction with urban parklands, is designed to provide New York's growing urban population with accessible open spaces and rewarding experiences in the out-of-doors. (JH)",

For those who speak English as a second language, a further barrier is added. American Indian women are one group in need of special programs to create an awareness of their job rights and to increase the accessibility of employment and training opportunities for them. In response to a successful conference on &quot;Employment Awareness for Indian Women&quot; held on the Shiprock, New Mexico, Navajo Reservation, this guide has been prepared to aid in conducting similar projects elsewhere. While not intended to be a comprehensive &quot;how-to&quot; instrument, the guide is adapted to the  status of Indian women and highlights those parts of the conference program needing special consideration: strong community participation in planning phases, an opening session speaker who is a known leader, availability of bilingual interpreters, minimal or no expense to participants, briefing sessions for resource people, and follow-up mechanisms. In planning such programs, it is essential to have a knowledge of the unique legal status of Indian tribes so that provision can be made to have that issue addressed. Situations and conditions vary from reservation to reservation, making flexibility and adaptability a major requirement for the use of this guide. (Author/NEC)",

In the Sixth Annual Report seven recommendations are brought to the attention of Congress. The first three deal with NACIE's concern with the changeover to the newly-created Department of Education. NACIE recommends that (1) the organizational structure of the Office of Indian Education remain a distinct and separate organizational entity within the Department of Education, (2) that Indian Educational Programs  contained in Title IV of P.L. 92-318 remain separate and distinct programs, and (3) that NACIE remain in tact and continue its advisory duties. Recommendations also are made for funding tribally controlled Community colleges and for a study to investigate the utilization of a telecommunication Satellite for Indian education related programs. The final recommendations deal with NACIE itself: that appointments be done within three months after a position is vacated and that the annual report be submitted on September 30 of each year rather than March 31. Included is a state-by-state accounting of the distribution of Title IV funding and the Indian Fellowships for FY 1978 managed by the Office of Indian Education. (DS)",

An introductory chapter provides a history of the study and identifies broad issues affecting the research, e.g., recent tribal government expansion and population increases on reservations. Research findings, based on field study and analysis of program documents, are reported under three topics: (1) reservation planning in general and reservation manpower planning in particular, (2) the linkages between CETA programs and economic development observed on the 25 study sites, and (3) the constraints to  linkages imposed by the administration of the CETA program and the various other federal funding programs that provide support to reservation-based economic development. Nine exemplary program elements are identified; each illustrates feasible ways of integrating CETA and economic development. Study recommendations provide specific suggestions for long-range policy, for improvement in administration of the Indian CETA program, and for further phases of this study.

A recent American Public Health Association study of 180 health projects in developing countries reveals that 92% of the projects are offering some sort of health education service, indicating the serious emphasis placed on the health education component. Methods being utilized to make health education a more effective part of the primary health system include radio campaigns in Tanzania and Assam, India, effective because the use of radio can overcome geographic and literacy barriers, and audio cassette programs for both group and  individual listening in Guatemala and India. A Columbian program uses cassette communication for paraprofessional continuous training and provides a simple, low cost, portable, durable, flexible, and accurate means of health education. A Guatemalan project uses cassette and record/playback systems to assist student doctors in expanding the quality and quantity of their contacts with rural people. The health education programs outlined have substantial potential but unless there is strong political commitment to the systematic use of communication and administrative record keeping, it will be difficult to implement and assess innovative health education strategies.

        "description":"Although not often considered in the past by planners because their economic contributions are not performed for money, rural women are contributors to the development of their countries. The urgency of reaching women with important information to break the cycle of poverty is now being recognized by the major development agencies. While there are many physical and cultural barriers to the education of rural women, the case studies described in the report illustrate ways of approaching these problems. The use of paraprofessionals and audio cassette technology is combined in several patterns in nations including Mexico, Guatemala, Columbia, the Philippines, India, Thailand, Bangladesh, Iran, Sudan, Tanzania, and the United States to reach and communicate with rural women and their  families about such subjects as health, nutrition, family planning, and agriculture. Program format varies from serial dramas, stories, music, talks, interviews, and short announcements, all with the intent of encouraging listening, learning, and action. Key elements of the program strategy are dramatization, authority, reinforcement, localization, entertainment, questions, brevity, semi-sequential flow, and repetition. The examples cited are primarily simple systems that should be affordable by governments anywhere which take seriously the welfare of their poorer rural population and provide opportunities for rural people themselves to have a role in community improvement programs.

        "description":"Recreational land development in the United States falls into three general categories with the first two being more popular: (1) unimproved recreational subdivisions, largely speculative investments; (2) improved second home projects, used both for recreation and speculation; and (3) high amenity resort communities, recreational areas for higher income families. At least 10 million recreational lots currently exist, mostly in Florida and Texas, but also in Pennsylvania and the Southwest. Recreational land development is a controversial topic as it has implications for environmental, economic, and social impact. Environmentally sensitive areas are often targets for development projects, which can produce air and water pollution, erosion, and solid waste problems. While  development projects initially stimulate local economies via taxation, the effect may reverse itself in later years. The culture and lifestyle of a rural area may change with an influx of sophistication, bringing with it increased crime, traffic, and crowding. Consumer victimization by fraudulent land development companies is all too frequent. Local and state governments should take advantage of the current lull in recreational land development to pass legislation and establish procedures and regulations regarding such development. (SB)",

The subject matter of this partly annotated bibliography not only covers the agricultural contributions of the American Indian, but also discusses aspects of technology, settlement patterns, economics, family organization, and religious ritual as they relate to agriculture. It begins with 75 comprehensive historical, anthropological, and bibliographical references. The second section deals with the agriculture of particular regions and cultures. A unit on Meso America has a separate unit devoted to the Aztec-Maya. Other units are on Canada and South America. The unit on the United States is subdivided into  regions including the Southwest, Northeast, Southeast, Northwest, Great Lakes, Plains, and California. The third section of the bibliography covers specific Native American Crops, including corn, wild rice, cotton, cucurbits, tobacco, and beans. The section on livestock includes a separate unit on wild turkeys. The last three sections deal with agriculture on Indian reservations in the U.S. and Canada, uncultivated plants, and irrigation. The materials listed include children's books, magazine articles, dissertations, books, scientific reports, and government documents. Most were written between 1940 and 1977. (DS)",

        "description":"Education and vocational training have long been regarded as the most direct paths to employment and to greater participation in the economic benefits of Canadian society. Until the educational disparities between Indians and non-Indians have been removed, the most damning indictment of the failure of British Columbia's educators will continue to be existence of native Indians as the single most poorly housed and most frequently unemployed, unhealthy, alienated, impoverished group of British Columbians. Many studies have commented upon the low levels of education prevalent in British Columbian Indian communities. Median level of education reported among British Columbia adult Indians in the 1950's was grade five. By 1971, 18.9% of the adult Indian population had less than five  years of schooling, while 41.37% had greater than nine years. Three factors contributed experience of native adults between 1961 and 1971: the 46% increase in the adult population, with a proportionately larger number of more educated young adults; the decline, due to mortality, of older adults who had little or no education; and the significant increased participation in academic upgrading programs (9,133 enrollees from a population of approximately 30,000 adults from 1964-1976). Evidence from the 1971 census data indicated that rural Indians with higher levels of education are moving to urban areas and those living in urban areas tend to complete more years of schooling.

Folklore tradition can include school fight songs, ghost stories, children's games, ethnic jokes, jump rope rhymes and family recipes, as well as quilting techniques, ballads, or tales. All of these types of folklore are discussed and illustrated in this lengthy manual. Although designed specifically for collecting folklore and folklife in Ohio, the manual would be of interest to anyone interested in American folklore. The first portion is devoted to folklore collection and discusses the equipment needed, ways to approach people, kinds of folklore that might be collected, and interview  techniques. A chapter on how to set up a collection project describes field techniques, release forms, notations on circumstances surrounding each interview, transcription methods and analysis. Two chapters suggest the family and children as good places to begin collection because of the rich quantity of material available. Much of the manual is devoted to folklore already collected by both high school and college students. This collection includes chapters on the folklore of teenage and college students, occupations, the general population, rural and Appalachian people, African-Americans, and other ethnic groups, including the Mexican Americans and Italian-Americans.

Strong ideological bonding is characteristic of the parts, primarily the disciplines. The larger aggregations are made whole mainly by formal superstructure, many linked levels of bureaucracy from campus administration to multi-campus organs to regional or provincial machinery and up to the national level of administrative and political oversight. Ideologies exist in the superstructure but more as doctrines that loosely legitimate diverse activities than as sets of specific ideas that give commonness to their holders. The newer ideas are broad in scope and necessarily diffuse, stretching over diverse  clienteles, programs, and connections to job markets, providing little link with the traditional academic community. This is not the end of ideology in the academic world, but a vast reshaping. Structural changes in education weakened ideologies of the whole while strengthening those of component parts. Academic ideologies serve as an emotional bonding and moral capital, but are increasingly pluralistic, tied to the primacy of the discipline and the profession. (Author/MSE)",

        "description":"A comparative analysis of enrollment influences in four countries is presented. From the enrollment histories of the 1970's in Belgium, France, Japan, and the United States several generalizations are drawn: (1) while demographic growth in young people produced difficult labor market conditions at all levels of educational preparation, college graduates in particular felt a decline in career prospects, a situation made worse by general economic depression after 1973; (2) total private demand for traditional or long university study ceased growing by mid-decade; (3) ability and socioeconomic factors in educational demand varied in the four countries; (4) educational and career demand from all ability levels has caused increasing meritocratic selection in programs with surest and  largest career rewards; (5) for students with neither high ability nor high socioeconomic status educational demand has largely been diverted to shorter programs or non-university programs; (6) where the time and effort necessary for postsecondary study is variable and costs are low (France and the United States) the phenomenon of &quot;discounting&quot; occurs, or a reduction in the investment of student resources commensurate with lower anticipated career rewards; and (7) though a portion of educational demand can be accounted for by technological advancement, much of this is the product of the penalty effect, credential inflation, and the promotion of certain types of education to postsecondary status. These factors put into a different perspective the earlier vision of universal higher  education: a significant proportion of young adults have talents best developed outside the classroom. A growing proportion of graduates will cause incentives for graduate careers to regress toward the mean, weakening the principal motivation to seek postsecondary education. In these four nations it is felt that the limits of mass higher education have been reached. (Author/MSE)",

Areas are identified in which administrative difficulties most commonly occur, and methods and procedures to insure sound, proper, efficient management of the programs are discussed. The areas covered are: the need for placement of financial aid offices at an administrative level reflecting their importance in the institution; adequacy of staffing; accurate and adequate recordkeeping for timely reporting; intrainstitutional communication; the need for procedural  outlines and clear delegation of responsibility; the need for each staff member to have a thorough understanding of the aid programs and the lines of responsibility within the office; and the need for efficient loan collection. Numerous charts, tables, and forms are included as samples, with directions for their use. Specific directions are given for different aid programs. Appended are an agreement form covering institutional participation in the federal programs, the federal terms of agreement for computation and disbursement of Basic Educational Opportunity Grants, and excerpts from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare Audit Guide.

        "author":["Estler, Suzanne"],
        "description":"The consequences of using analytic methods usually associated with rational management for university decision-making related to sexual equity are examined. The research consists of two case studies concerning faculty appointments and nonteaching professional staff salaries. The concern is with how long-standing situations come to be seen as organizational problems, the use of quantitative tools to infer the presence or absence of equity in the situation, and the impact of these processes on organizational decision-making. This study is designed to add to the literature related to systematic analysis by looking at a setting and an issue characterized by a great deal of ambiguity. The first case reviews the development of a pool model to analyze sexual equity and surrounding  events related to the appointment of faculty from the late sixties until 1976. The second case focuses on the use of a regression model for assessing equity in librarian salaries. It is concluded that ultimately the effectiveness of rational analysis, although associated with hard technology, is dependent on an interplay of human values and beliefs, organizational structure and norms, external influences, and unpredicted events. Short-range and long-range strategies that may improve the ability of management to promote organizational changes increasing equity in employment opportunity and rewards on the campus are listed.

        "description":"Women over age 25 represent a substantial age group that may be recruited to bolster undergraduate student recruitment efforts at Northwestern University and similar institutions of higher education. By 1990, the number of recruitable 18-year-olds will fall by 20 percent nationwide, causing financial hardship for many private colleges and universities that do not actively recruit older students as well. Ten percent of the approximately 140,000 women over 25 living on the North Shore of Lake Michigan are singled out as a major target group for recruiting by Northwestern University because of various demographic, economic, technological, political/legal and cultural factors. The barriers older women perceive in a youth-oriented student environment are explained, and there is a  brief history given of past efforts to recruit older women into other institutions offering extension courses and adult education programs. Future undergraduate recruitment efforts at Northwestern University should encourage older students to apply by creating a primary demand for undergraduate education at all age levels. Pre-application, pre-admission and post-admission policies and educational literature can be easily modified to accommodate the needs of older women. A number of short-range and long-range marketing plans are also suggested that will attract older students back to college, particularly older women. A bibliography is appended, along with lists of local sources and persons interviewed. (DC)",

        "description":"The increasing complexity of management and planning within institutions of higher education has fostered the development of more sophisticated theories of management in higher education. Such complexity has also encouraged the development of a number of academic planning tools and models to aid administrators in management through access to data and projections of the consequences of their decisions. The use of such models and the need for increasingly sophisticated planning seems bound to increase if institutional vitality is to be insured in a period of reduced resources. Such management complexity increases the specialized skills required to manage institutions and seems likely to result in additional conflicts between administrators and faculty over governance issues.  Academic planning does not produce solutions to all the problems that confront institutions, especially those that relate to social issues such as access and sexual equality. Yet by understanding the complexities of academic management and by the ability of academic planning to provide a means for the development of incremental change reflecting the concerns of the university community, an arena for the resolution of conflict within the university can be established. It is toward such ends that academic planning and academic management must strive. (Author/MSE)",

        "description":"Federal action that has influenced, either directly or indirectly, the curriculum of higher education is examined. The purpose is to better comprehend the process by which educational policy decisions are reached by the government and what institutions of higher education have to do with this process. A review of recent federal funding programs in relation to degree expectation by field and level (in 1975-76 and projected to 1985-86) shows a positive correlation between fields receiving significant federal support and tendency of students to choose those fields, as well as a decline in students majoring in selected fields that lack federal support. It is noted that the federal government is increasingly considered the major spur to educational innovation, although funding levels  for innovation in nonscientific fields and for encouraging institutional diversity are extremely low. A result has been the compelling vocational thrust of the contemporary undergraduate curriculum in private and public institutions, and, unintentionally, a decline in general education. Several recommendations are offered, including that: (1) there is a need for federal policy initiatives to be developed regarding the impact of federal funding on college and university curricula, and (2) institutions of higher education should evaluate whether they are relying too heavily on federal initiatives to define their educational mission.

        "description":"A study was undertaken in six fall 1978 courses at a large midwestern university to examine possible biasing influences on student ratings of instruction brought about by pre-course expectations of the course. Student and course demographic variables were analyzed as possible determiners of affective entry into the course. These data were examined for influence on student ratings of instruction. It was asked whether or not evaluations are more influenced by student expectations than by student background or course circumstances. Finally, data were examined for bias due to these out-of-class factors versus attitude change due to instruction. It was found that students brought to the courses expectations for and opinions about the instructor and course. These levels of affective  entry were created or influenced by several student and course characteristics. Higher grade level students more often brought positive expectations of course and instructor. Electives or courses in the students' major field tended to contain students with high expectations. Pre-course gossip about courses also tended to be more positive than negative. Results suggest that faculty are in greater control of student evaluations than are the pre-course opinions of students or the demographic characteristics of the students or course.

Groups of 4,573 enrolled students and one year later, 1,228 alumni from 22 departments responded to 11 satisfaction items concerning instructional, curricular, advising, and functional aspects of their major departments. The purpose was to assess: (1) whether the factor structure of alumni ratings of major departments is similar to that of enrolled student ratings; (2) whether alumni report degrees of satisfaction different from those of enrolled students; and (3) what the influences are of job-related variables on alumni attitudes toward their major programs and the university in general. The results suggest that former  students continue to assess their major programs in the same way after graduation. It was found, however, that alumni were more satisfied with integration of courses, classroom evaluation procedures, and accessibility of instructor than were enrolled students, but less satisfied with vocational guidance. The alumni survey is thus seen as a valuable source of additional information, and is worth the additional expense to administer. (MSE)",

The three presenters, Ron Gross, Tom Hebert, and Allen Tough, and audience members discuss learning, schooling, discovery, motivation, public policy, and how all of these affect values and the quality of life. Nonformal, nonaffiliated learning--which takes place at home or in informal settings like libraries, enthusiasts' clubs, and organized networks of learners--is considered. Surveys of deliberate efforts by adults to gain some very definite knowledge and skill have found that 20 percent of adult learning is planned by a professional who leads a class or group, while 80 percent of adult learning is planned by the learner. Also included in the 80 percent are self-help groups of peers with the same  problems or interests. Ways to facilitate the entire range of adult learning, including helping learners locate materials or information sources, are suggested. The philosophy of a group called \"Writers in the Public Interest\" is described. Suggestions on how to support independent self-directed learners and their \"Invisible University\" are offered. Other topics that are addressed in the forum include: the activities of people who are knowledgeable about a particular area, such as trains/transportation; the capacity of libraries to meet the needs of independent learners; and academic credit/degrees versus noncredit/independent learning.

        "description":"Some of the issues concerning the evolving relationship between state and federal agencies in the field of student financial aid are examined, with attention to the State Student Incentive Grant Program (SSIG). After tracing the history of the SSIG, the following issues are considered: SSIG portability; state control of fraud, abuse, and error; financial aid to nonprofit institutions, allocation formula; state capacity for student assistance; computation of state subsidy; and perspectives on student aid by state planners. It is suggested that the SSIG program was initiated to attract states into providing student financial aid at the state level, and this effort has been successful. Four alternative models that could be legislated to encompass future roles of the program are  described. It is claimed that the federal policy-makers would like to see grants available to students attending school out of state, but states are concerned about sending students out of state when public colleges and universities are increasingly underutilized. There is increasing concern that funds are being awarded improperly and that institutions have mishandled funds in some instances. The federal government wants to include all nonprofit institutions but the states want to be able to be more selective. An index of state effort in support of postsecondary education is described, and the flow of dollars within a funding system is examined. The complexity of state-federal relations in higher education is suggested. (SW)",

Using a ten percent random subsample of original data compiled by Alexander W. Astin for the Cooperative Institutional Research program, the researchers present extensive tabulations of black students' responses to questions assessing high school preparation, college access, reasons for attending college, financial aid, family background, degree aspirations, career aspirations, self-ratings, and life goals. It is shown that black male and female students tend to be older than white students upon graduating from high school. Independent of income, black male students in black institutions tend to indicate  better high school preparation than blacks at white institutions or whites. More blacks attend institutions closer to home than do whites, and blacks at black institutions are more likely to attend a college nearby because they wish to live at home. Blacks at white institutions are more likely to have financial aid than whites and blacks at black institutions. A higher proportion of black students in white institutions report parental incomes of $15,000 or more than blacks at black institutions. Blacks at black institutions rate themselves higher on academic achievement related traits, whereas blacks at white institutions rate themselves high on athletic ability and on popularity with the opposite sex. All students, black and white, consider \"becoming an authority in my field\" as the most  important goal in life. An appendix lists sample weights and norms and includes a copy of the survey form.

        "description":"Factors influencing students' choice of institutions are examined in Part A of the SISFAP studies. The principal empirical base of the study consists of a large-scale longitudinal data file that assesses students' college choices at three time points: the beginning of the 11th grade, mid-way through the 12th grade, and college entry. Multivariate analyses of the data were conducted to determine how the students' institutional choices are affected by (1) student characteristics, (2) the characteristics of the students' higher education environment, (3) state and federal financial aid programs, and (4) student aid packages offered by institutions. Chapters examine: the design of the study; consistency and change in choice behavior; summary of regression analyses; effects of student  characteristics; higher education environment; impact of state programs; Basic Educational Opportunity Grants; and effects of financial aid offices. Appendices contain procedures for matching and merging data files, reliability of college admissions test and questionnaires, documentation of the 11th-12th grade-entering freshman longitudinal file, and recent trends in postsecondary access and choice. Among the conclusions were these: although 41.7 percent of students who eventually attend college express no college preferences when they start 11th grade, many of them end up applying to only one college; two students in five apply only to the institution that they enter; student ability appears to be one of the most important factors in college choice; distance from home is a major factor;  and Orientals and high-ability students have the most success in implementing early choices.

Conceptualization of the evaluation process in higher education is discussed on two levels. A collection of nine similes for understanding evaluation is examined in terms of major activities, advantages, and disadvantages: evaluation as: (1) measurement; (2) expert judgment of worth; (3) assessment between performance and objectives; (4) the basis for decisions; (5) a goal-free process; (6) conflict resolution; (7) complacency reduction; (8) a change agent; and (9) ritual. Consideration is given to three types of formal evaluation models: the experimental, ecological, and eclectic approaches. The program evaluation  process considered most restricting, that built into the budget process, is examined in detail. An investigation is also made of the purpose and practice of evaluation according to organizational level: state legislative audit, review by a state coordinating board, multicampus scrutiny, campus program evaluation, accrediting review, and departmental study. Factors that affect usefulness of program evaluation reports--such as timing, comparisons to similar units, and format--are discussed. The Florida State University system is described. Speculation about the future of the practice is made by examining present practices in diverse policy areas: nontraditional delivery systems, government revenue reduction schemes (taxpayer advocacy), management, regulation of professions, and consumer  protection.

        "description":"The task of designing future postsecondary education policy in fiscal year 1981 is discussed in relation to two unique conditions. First, the federal role as a provider of student assistance was increased dramatically in 1978 by passage of the Middle Income Student Assistance Act, and the full costs of implementing MISAA are coming due. Second, the Congress faces increasing pressure, both internally and externally, to reduce federal spending. The tradeoffs are discussed: federal benefits can continue to be distributed broadly to postsecondary students, resulting in substantially increased federal expenditures, or funding can be reduced. Under current law, the reduction would affect lower- and moderate-income students more than others. New legislation could target federal  assistance more directly on the most needy students, so that cost reductions would be borne more by middle-income students and their families. Data charts illustrate detailed examinations of the options at issue. Chapters focus on: the purpose and impact of federal postsecondary education policy; reauthorization and funding of federal grants to students; reauthorization of student loans; efforts to remove nonfinancial impediments to equal educational opportunity; and overall budget implications of future federal policy for student assistance.

It is contended that faculty reputations continue to be important to instructional images and professional advancement of the individual and are dominant in many systems of faculty evaluation. The contradiction when faculty are evaluated on the basis of performance and then rewarded on the basis of reputation is noted. The determinants of faculty salaries appear to be a complex mixture of status or rank, preparation or background, research or scholarly achievement, and professional reputation. Additional trends and factors that must be considered in planning for effective reward systems include inflation, the changing missions of many institutions, and affirmative action and other efforts to reduce  discriminatory practices in higher education. One weakness of current faculty development programs is their lack of firm linkage to institutional incentives and rewards. Among the possible approaches that might be effective for faculty development and the improvement of instruction would be the establishment of pay scales that are truly meritorious. (SW)",

The satisfactions of an academic career included relationships with students, the act of teaching, and interactions with colleagues. The major dissatisfactions included: effects of financial cutbacks; lack of recognition and reward (non-salary); lack of time for research, teaching and service responsibilities; and low salary. Among the satisfactions with the Indiana University School of Dentistry were  academic challenge and freedom, relationships with colleagues, the school's national reputation, and relationships with students. Dissatisfactions with the school involved the decline in the quality of education offered, effects of financial cutbacks, low salary, and administrative and departmental organizational problems. More than three-fourths of the respondents had no systematic method for assessing their teaching effectiveness.

Women agricultural majors were found to be playing a role in the recent growth in enrollment. Females were found to be less likely than male students to have parents who own farms. It is claimed that agricultural education in the university is losing its rural tradition, and the female student is a key actor in the process. The desire to work with animals or some equivalent orientation seems to be an important career motivation for many women students. For both men and women in the study, there seems to be a strong emphasis for the desirability of rural residence and rural lifestyle associated with the selection of agriculture. The survey also includes  information about the sex-role attitudes of the students, which may have an impact on colleges of agriculture. This new enrollment of women will place demands for changes in curriculum, counseling, and placement. Changes affecting higher education in agriculture are discussed in terms of a particularistic versus a generalistic agenda of learning. (SW)",

Most of the sociological data examine whether women choose paid employment, rather than the kind of employment. Studies in guidance counseling, vocational education, and continuing education agree that more support programs and/or institutional services will be needed if women are to develop nontraditional vocational choices. Few research projects at a national level have sought to examine women's studies programs, and there are no systematic data available on the variety or frequency of career  formats. Studies on services of women's studies programs, the impact of these programs on graduates, and the impact of one or more courses are cited. It is concluded that the data pool currently is too small and not systematic enough to answer accurately the detailed questions on career development, aspirations, and vocational outcomes that were sought in the present research. Four policy issues that relate to research on women's studies and career development are discussed, and a bibliography is presented. (SW)",

A review of the relevant literature, which was the basis for the original research implemented by Rand, indicated that the telephone was the preferred means of collecting data on  citizen media use and political knowledge.

Teacher training colleges have their own low cost production units, two cities have all their schools linked on a closed circuit cable system, and the BBC broadcasts on open circuit one or two series for teachers each year. The largest user of TV and radio for inservice teacher education is the Open University, which provides specially designed multimedia courses leading to a degree. It increases the stock of teachers by allowing working adults to study part-time, and it provides courses to improve the pedagogy of existing teachers. TV and radio are only a small part of the Open University system, the main core of the teaching being specially prepared printed correspondence  texts; television and radio tend to be used for functions difficult to achieve through print. Finding sufficient transmission time so all students can view a course is a difficulty, and the facility to transmit a program twice at different times is crucial. Radio is not as well used as television; teachers, in particular, do not use these media as much as other students. However, television is heavily used by students, who do benefit from viewing and listening, and the Open University has a low dropout rate. (Author/JEG)",

The study revealed that Fall 1979 enrollment was slightly higher than the previous Fall's; that there were numerically and proportionately more part-time students than in previous years; and that students were generally carrying lighter credit loads. The data showed that while slightly more courses were offered, fewer classes were scheduled. Instructor semester hours increased by 105 semester hours and instructor contact hours increased by 126 contact hours. On the other hand, student registrations and student semester and contact hours were the  lowest in five years. With regard to class size, the study revealed that the number and proportion of classes with less than 11 students had decreased and that the average class size (24 students) was the lowest in five years. Teaching loads remained at about the same level as in 1978: the average semester hours per full-time equivalent (FTE) instructor was 13.3, the average contact hours was 16.1, and the productivity ratio was 308. The faculty-student ratio of one to 20 was the lowest in five years. The report provides tables illustrating faculty load data by college and course. (JP)",

        "description":"A survey was conducted in Spring 1980 of the 1,358 continuing Kapiolani Community College students who had registered as first-time students in Fall 1979. The survey instrument solicited information on: (1) student employment; (2) knowledge of procedures and requirements; (3) evaluation of students' college experience; (4) evaluation of student services; and (5) evaluation of instructional services and academic support. Major findings, based on a 50% response rate, revealed that, in both Fall and Spring semesters, most students (72%) were employed; and 62% held jobs off-campus. At least two-thirds of the respondents indicated knowledge of procedures and requirements concerning registration, advising, transfer of courses, and graduation. The majority of the respondents indicated  that they were \"satisfied\" or \"very satisfied\" with specific and general college experiences. Responses to items related to student services indicated that over one-third did not know about nine of 11 specific services; the most commonly used services were the career resources library and the study skills modules. Respondents expressed overall satisfaction with academic services, though 31% felt unable to enroll in the courses they desired most. More than half of the respondents knew about, but did not use, academic support services. The report includes tables comparing responses by placement test scores, grade point average, program areas, and sex. (JP)",

        "description":"As part of a nationwide study coordinated by the American Council on Education, Los Angeles City College (LACC) conducted a survey of incoming Fall 1979 students to determine their characteristics and opinions. Data collected from 788 students were compared with nationwide findings and with results of similar surveys conducted annually since 1970. Results indicate that 313 respondents (40%) had taken college work previously and that 111 (14%) were not full-time students. Major findings concerning the remaining 364 full-time, first-time entering freshmen reveal that 55.2% were women and that 80% were members of a minority group (compared to 12% nationwide). Opinion questions demonstrated that the LACC freshmen were more conservative than their counterparts of ten years ago; the  percent who agreed that grades should be abolished dropped consistently from 42% in 1970 to 17% in 1979, while the percent that agreed that there is too much concern in the courts for the rights of criminals increased from 45% in 1970 to 55% in 1979. Two-thirds of the LACC freshmen expected no financial aid from their parents, compared to about 40% nationally. Three-quarters indicated that the objective \"to be very well off financially\" was essential, the highest percentage of students to indicate so in years. LACC findings are compared with nationwide results and LACC data are presented for each year since 1970. (JP)",

The dilemma caused by this change is evident in the intensive reexamination of what community colleges should be and in the increasing need to plan programs, allocate resources, and negotiate collective bargaining contracts without any indication of future funding levels. Because this ongoing change threatens academic excellence and the potential for professional advancement that faculty need to perform well, two-year colleges must initiate original responses to these problems, such as the creation of student-centered guidelines for change management  and the utilization of participatory management techniques to involve the entire institution in adapting to changing situations. Colleges must also deal with special problems and concerns, including the influence of pressure groups on legislatures, the need to adopt new budgeting techniques in the face of reduced funding, the effect of increasing tuition on educational access, and the pros and cons of adopting marketing techniques for student recruitment. Other issues intertwined with these problems include the use of institutional research, and the impact of trustee involvement, accountability, and student attrition. (JP)",

Part I of the course explores the interdependence of language, thought, and action through an examination of: (1) the effect that the common use of racially derogatory language has upon one's attitudes and actions toward members of another race; (2) how language is made imprecise by ambiguity, vagueness, and cliches; (3) the mistaken identification of words with things they represent (a common practice in advertising); and (4) the use of emotive language in the place of  descriptive, logical wording. Part II examines, through specific examples drawn from the students' lives, what concepts are and how they function in providing organization and continuity in the human experience. Part III provides students with methods of problem analysis that can be employed in classroom, family, and social settings. Thus, by developing skills in critical thinking, students not only enhance their academic performance, but also take better control of their lives. (JP)",

        "description":"Given today's rapid pace of change in knowledge and lifestyles and the resultant obsolescence of an individual's education shortly after graduation, community college's must plan for and help promote the emergence of a learning society. Basic to the concept of lifelong learning are: (1) the restructuring of the entire educational system to develop and encourage lifelong learners in their first years of school; (2) the utilization of businesses and other non-academic organizations as resources in the learning process; and (3) the increased responsibility on the part of students for self-directed learning. The accomplishment of these goals requires that special efforts, including adult career counseling, equity in financial aid, and more job-relevant education, be employed to help  those economically and educationally disadvantaged students whose past negative experiences with the educational system discourage their participation in adult learning. In addition, colleges must abandon the self-serving view of adult education as a means of protecting jobs and concentrate on providing students with an understanding of themselves as learners, of the need for lifelong learning, and of the methods of selecting from the educational options available to them. These efforts will increase the pool of sophisticated consumers of education and challenge the educational system to achieve high levels of production and quality. (JP)",

The development of such modules must begin with a firm foundation to insure the success of the project. Steps in the preparation for module development should include determining the demands on faculty workload, coordinating humanities and occupational divisions involvement, assessing student interest and course-taking patterns, securing administrative support, and calculating costs and acquiring funding. Only then would it be appropriate to determine module content and locate appropriate materials. An additional seven steps are involved in organizing the module: (1) delineate objectives; (2) establish target student  population; (3) select student activites; (4) choose needed materials and equipment; (5) determine teaching approaches; (6) allocate time and space needs; (7) establish student evaluation strategy; (8) test the module; and (9) evaluate the module implementation. Such systematic planning will lead to the creation of a module that will not only help to revitalize the humanities curriculum, but will capture student interest. The paper cites uses of modular instruction within vocational curricula at various colleges and includes examples of potential modules and a bibliography. (Author/AYC)",

        "description":"Instructors of courses in mass society, culture, and communication start out facing three types of difficulties: the historical orientation of learning, the parochialism of various disciplines, and negative intellectually elitist attitudes toward mass culture/media. Added to these problems is the fact that many instructors have little or no training in the methodology of teaching or the content of mass society, culture, and media courses. The instructional materials and media equipment that are available to instructors for such courses often present difficulties of their own, and many instructors are hampered by their lack of conversancy with the major conveyors of mass culture, that is, radio, television, and popular films. One approach to mass society, culture, and media  instruction, utilized at Cuyahoga Community College (Ohio), involves a variety of activities, such as games, script reading, student audio-visual productions, old films, and field trips, as well as variations in objectives, content, and evaluation methods. During the course the major concepts of mass society are presented directly and succintly as definitions, and readings and activities are designed to provide examples and descriptions of the concept. The descriptive report provides a sample course assignment and is appended by a course outline, an explanation of &quot;concept tests&quot; and a sample, and a week's schedule. (AYC)",

        "description":"This study investigates teachers' gender associations of school-related objects and activities. Thirty-four female teachers, from the preschool level to the seventh grade, were taught three different nonsense words representing the concepts masculine, feminine, and farms (neuter). The teachers were then presented with a list of 24 new words and asked to classify the words according to the most appropriate nonsense syllable. Fifteen of the items were related to school objects and contained no clue as to gender. Among these items, the teachers associated the following with the feminine nonsense syllable: blackboard, child painting, library, open book, a boy and a girl sitting at separate desks, poetry, a spelling lesson, dramatic play with puppets, Dick and Jane, and a workbook.  Teachers associated fewer of the school-related items with the masculine nonsense syllable: pencil, a page of arithmetic, and a map. It is suggested that teachers facilitate the better performance of young girls and hinder the performance of young boys in the early years of schooling by providing a situation in which school is compatible with the girls' concepts of sex-appropriate behavior, but inappropriate with boys' concepts of sex-appropriate behavior.

It is concluded that, in general, current research recommendations for facilities for handicapped children do not appear to be based on empirical findings about effects of environmental variables  on child or teacher behavior.

The initial research phases involved design of a conceptual framework that placed some parameters on the variety of social phenomena studied. Interview data from a sample of rural decision-makers provided input regarding planning processes and the types of project outputs that would meet their needs. The major output of the descriptive social reporting phases involved the publication of a social indicator data book including time-series statistical data for each of nine north central Iowa counties. During 1977 these data were disseminated at a series of county conferences designed  to help participants obtain a clearer idea of what a needs assessment involved and how the process could be undertaken. Systematic approaches to needs assessment (including the social indicator approach), advantages and disadvantages of each approach, pros and cons of citizen involvement, and ways of using the data book in needs assessment were presented. The initial focus of social indicator modeling was a macrosociological model of the determinants of physical health status, developed and tested using data on 99 Iowa counties.

The investigation revealed that during fiscal year 1980 appropriation hearing, the BIA overestimated the Navajo Community College's Indian enrollment. The figure used for the &quot;full-time equivalent&quot; student enrollment resulted in the Bureau's obligating $3.9 million more to the college than allowed by the grant formula. Had the grant formula prescribed by the act been applied, the college would have received about 50% less funding than it received the previous  fiscal year. The report recommends that the Secretary of the Interior immediately review the Navajo Community College's management practices and operating expenses to determine the most equitable method for funding the college and report findings to the appropriate congressional committees for their consideration in making necessary appropriation and legislative changes.

        "description":"Because the New York Outdoor Education Association (NYSOEA) has made significant contributions to the establishment and expansion of outdoor education programs in the state and throughout the world, this guide is directed toward those who want to strengthen their own state or regional association or to create one. The paper provides an analysis of the strategies contributing to the success of the NYSOEA and suggests concrete procedures for establishing comparable state Outdoor Education associations. Sections in the paper describe the organization's purposes and philosophy, programs and service, membership, organization, regional structure and financial considerations. A section on the 24-member Executive Board describes election procedures and lists responsibilities for both  officers and other board members. Another section offers guidelines and policies for planning and implementing workshops as well as a workshop planning checklist. A similar section on setting up an annual conference is also included. The final part of the paper gives ideas for starting a regional or state-wide Outdoor Education association. It discusses invitations to the initial planning meeting, a sample schedule for that meeting, the types of business to be conducted, establishment of the regional network, and incorporation as a nonprofit organization. Appended are copies of forms used by the NYSOEA, including a financial statement as well as several conference registration forms. (DS)",

        "description":"The adventure of adventure education comes in the testing of oneself, in putting self against the environment and in striving to overcome the environment through personal skill. Unfortunately, instead of perceiving the risks in terms of physical and psychological challenges, many schools and other organizations perceive them in terms of liability suits. The aspect of legal liability involved in most of the court cases involving the adventure field is that based on negligence, usually defined in five broad areas: (1) personal liability, which results from the actions of an individual with a direct relationship (program leader, volunteer, service person) to the participant; (2) standard of care, in which the appropriate standard of care for a safe environment is not provided; (3)  conduct of the activity, in which considerations are made as to the adequacy of instruction, the relationship of maturity and condition to safe participation, and safety rules and regulations; (4) environmental conditions, in which the landowner is held responsible for hazards on his property; and (5) contributory negligence, in which the participant himself must assume responsibility for his own actions. The final portion of this document describes how to handle the sequence of events following an injury and lists four methods of financial risk management (avoiding the activity, insurance, retention of the risk, and reduction of injuries).

        "author":["Golins, Gerald L."],
        "description":"The use of adventure based education is a new and relatively unresearched but apparently successful practice in the rehabilitation of juvenile delinquents. Courses offered by schools, state social service systems, juvenile courts, youth service bureaus, and other agencies are generally patterned after the standard Outward Bound course and involve the mastery of such outdoor pursuits as mountaineering, sailing, or river rafting. The gamelike atmosphere, the organization of participants into primary peer groups, the use of the outdoors, the nature of the problems posed, and the style of instruction are five elements of adventure education which impel a juvenile delinquent to alter his destructive ways. Programs are usually designed as cost-effective diversions to long-term  institutionalization or as supplements to existing youth serving agency programs. Both types of program involve referral, orientation, the outdoor expedition itself, and thorough follow-up. Many exemplary programs exist throughout the country. Adventure based practitioners face several major issues: program follow-up; course management and staffing; and evaluation. This document includes an outline of steps in the development of an adventure education rehabilitation program; a sample program schedule; suggested teaching methodology; and a reprint of an article emphasizing the need for adequate follow-up activities.

        "description":"The reemergence in the 1960's of the traditional Indian philosophy of education as preparation for societal productivity coincided with a movement within Indian communities toward more active participation in and self-control of the education of their people. By recognizing the historical right of American Indians to control their own education, the Basic Indian Education Act (PL 95-561) and the Indian Self-Determination Education Assistance Act (PL 93-638) have made these goals a reality and paved the way for the casting off of the policy of coercive assimilation which has characterized most previous national Indian education programs and led to academic failure among Indians. In the 1980's the focus of Indian community controlled education will center on the consolidation of  school contracting procedures in PL 93-638, including obtaining a centralized contractive authority under the Bureau of Indian Affairs; curriculum development in the area of cultural education; and parental and tribal participation in the public schools. This will require a united effort among Indian communities to explore the potential of federal legislation and utilize it to its fullest. Indian communities must also determine how to strengthen community control, sustain educational successes, establish Indian education priorities, and strengthen internal and external resources.

The question is whether small schools are truly better places for educating elementary and secondary students. Although often viewed as being essentially rural in nature, small schools are found in metropolitan areas as well and may include religious schools, prep schools, American Indian schools, and alternative schools. Student enrollment, geographical location, organizational type and funding sources are all factors that must be considered in the study of small schools and their effectiveness. Small schools are often accused of being less efficient than large schools due to their inability to: make quantity  purchases, distribute administrative costs, and provide specialized programs. However, a number of studies indicate the following benefits: (1) small school size has a positive influence on student achievement; (2) students of small schools assume more responsible and important positions within a wider range of activities than do their large school counterparts; and (3) there is greater opportunity for interaction, communication, and individual attention afforded small school students and teachers.

The first paper, &quot;The Administration's Welfare Reform Proposal: Impact on Rural Areas&quot; by Robert Hoppe, discusses major provisions of (1) the proposed Welfare Reform Amendment (H.R. 4904) which would attempt to standardize Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) Program and make it more consistent from state to state and (2) the Work and Training Opportunities Act (H.R. 4425) which would increase employment opportunities for people eligible for AFDC. The brief concludes that most of the proposal's provisions appear beneficial to rural people. The second paper, &quot;The Farm Differentiation in the Poverty  Threshold: Should It Be Changed?&quot; is by Thomas A. Carline, Linda M. Ghelfi, and Janet W. Coffin. It presents a short history of changes in the farm differential since 1964 along with three arguments for its complete elimination from the official poverty definition. Among the implications discussed are the impact elimination of the farm differential would have on programs and statistics, the broad-based support for eliminating the differential, and the impact of in-kind income (food stamps, housing, Medicare and Medicaid) on urban and rural poverty.

        "description":"Because of the decline of farm population and family farms, the increase in energy-intensivity, and concentration process in agriculture, a rising tide of criticism has focused on the land grant system and its role in encouraging scientific applications supporting these trends. A study was conducted to develop a strategy that would change agricultural research priorities at the University of California and yet remain within the existing network of agricultural organizations, the United States Department of Agriculture, and the land grant complex of colleges. The strategy that emerged included a number of specific goals, including (1) reducing the energy consumption in agriculture, (2) halting the decline in the number of farms, (3) supporting self-production of food, (4)  equalizing income within the agricultural producing sector, (5) reducing chemical applications in agriculture, (6) holding food quality constant or improving it, (7) holding food prices constant, and (8) limiting further concentration in agricultural production. Key elements of this strategy include prioritizing social and research goals, providing the appropriate agency with time to generate research to fulfill these goals, and attaching limited but distinctive penalties to the failure to develop research trajectories in keeping with the goals. This document also presents a procedure for assessing the research contribution through social impact assessment and examines the difficulties of developing change strategies. (Author/DS)",

The two major objectives of the project were to construct \"banks\" of test items referenced to the curriculum guide for mathematics (1978 edition) in grades 3, 7, and 10 and use these items to construct tests which could be used either as achievement measures or diagnostic tests. Chapter 1 of this document discusses the strand test concept and the administration and scoring of the strand tests. Chapter 2 describes the development of the items. Chapter 3 describes statistical procedures. The appendices  include lists of the MAPT strands and the item writers. (Author/MK)",

The problem is a consequence of an apparent discrepancy between the present school programs and the theory of Piaget concerning the time to introduce the volume algorithm. Data showed that sixth graders could apply the algorithm to computation and comprehension questions regardless of their volume conservation level. There was also an improvement of students' conservation levels regardless of their volume achievement scores or their treatments. (Author/MK)",

        "description":"A study to determine the influence of occupational competence, economic independence, and involvement in a variety of roles upon the well-being of adult women is reported. Prior to reporting results, the document discusses social changes that have made occupational competence and economic independence critical for women's successful adaptation. Changes include the ability to control fertility, the lengthening life span, and the increasing participation of women in the work force. The study involved collecting data from 142 white, married, middle-class women and their husbands, all of whom had at least one child enrolled in preschool. The focus was to determine differences in the level of role pattern satisfaction and self-esteem. About 35% of the mothers were employed and 60%  were classified as &quot;at home.&quot; Results indicate that the well-being of non-employed women is highly dependent of their husbands' approval of their pattern, or more accurately on the wives' perceptions of his approval. In contrast, employed women are considerably less sensitive to their husbands' attitudes. Commitment to work and satisfaction with their current job contribute heavily to womens' indices of well-being. Also, even though women may be intensely concerned with the demands of young children, involvement in multiple roles need not result in debilitating conflict, strain, and dissatisfaction. In conclusion, the research supports the value of preparing girls from childhood to develop and exercise occupational competence. (Author/KC)",

The objective is to recommend whether similar development models should be used in the future. The study is presented in three sections. Section I examines and compares three approaches to local program development: hierarchical, random, and mutualistic. Decision making rests with the curriculum expert in the hierarchial approach; with the individual or group constructing the program in the random approach; and to some extent with all the participants in the mutualistic approach. These are discussed in relation to various aspects of decision making, including locus of power; role of teachers, students, and community personnel; major concern;  legitimization; and expected outcomes. Section II examines the Canadian Content Project in relation to the decision to use the mutualistic approach. It outlines objectives and plans relating to rights of team members, advantages for team members, obligations of team members, and assumptions about team members. The major portion surveys the perceptions of the teacher members of the teams about the realities of working on the project. Most of the respondents believed their expectations had been fulfilled, but less than one-third indicated willingness to participate in such a project again under the same conditions. The major finding was that the mutualistic approach was not implemented because it was not understood by the participants. Section III summarizes the study and offers five points  to be considered in the future when using a mutualistic approach. (CK)",

The objective was to ascertain the strengths and weaknesses of the kits as well as to determine whether the program development model was effective in producing quality materials. Quality was defined in terms of internal consistency, inter-unit consistency, program consistency, external consistency, and significance. Questionnaires were mailed to teachers and students in 74 K-12 pilot classes; 1488 were returned. In the area of internal consistency, questions relating to focus and explicit activity sequences and objectives were raised. Inter-unit consistency, especially in skill development, was almost impossible given the process used to develop the kits. Questions raised  relating to program consistency were aimed at refining congruency with provincial handbooks. External consistency examined congruency with current social studies practice. Questions were raised relating to all 16 characteristics of sound programs. All respondents reacted positively to the significance of the Canadian content. Questions raised concerned a logical overall plan for content coverage in all the kits and avoidance of overlap and imbalance. Possible recommendations included hiring overall editors, developing a series of &quot;How to Do It&quot; booklets, finding resolutions to consistency problems, instituting quality control, and presenting content summary charts in each kit. Appendices present the program analysis form and student questionnaires. (CK)",

One component of a two part publication, the guide demonstrates how the conceptual structure of the economics discipline presented in the first publication (ED 148 648) can be used to help students develop basic economic concepts. Each lesson is self-contained. Students read and discuss short readings, analyze tables and maps, write essays, and take part in simulations. Lessons 1 through 3 deal with the Colonial Period. Lesson 1 applies the concept of scarcity of the factors of production to topics such as the hardships faced by the pilgrims and the use of indentured servants. Lesson 2 deals with the concept of opportunity costs. In lesson 3 students study voluntary trade,  interdependence, and specialization. Lesson 4, on the Jacksonian Period, requires that students explore the meaning and function of money. In lesson 5 \"Westward Expansion\" students learn how economic incentives play a central role in explaining human behavior. The concept of comparative advantage is introduced in lesson 6, \"Interregional Trade.\" Late 19th Century labor market conditions are examined in lesson 7. The concepts of competition, the market structure, and economies of scale are explained in lesson 8, \"The Growth of the Corporation\", and in lesson 9, \"Changing Structure of American Industry.\" Lesson 10 treats government regulations. Lessons 11 and 12 discuss the role of government in the economy before and during the Great Depression. In lesson 13 students examine various forms  of government intervention and their effects on the free functioning of market forces. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"The paper explores reasons for the failure of contemporary approaches to moral education and suggests an alternative based on theories of prosocial behavior. Prosocial behavior comprises actions intended to aid another person or group of people without the actors' anticipation of external rewards. Cultural and social factors appear to be most directly linked with prosocial behavior; that is, such behavior is likely to be learned as the child experiences models, expectations, and reinforcement. However, assumptions of current moral education approaches tend to ignore the cultural and social factors. These programs (values clarification, cognitive development, and rational analysis) emphasize the development of decision-making and reasoning skills and independence and autonomy.  Lack of specific moral content and of student evaluation also characterizes current practices. An alternative approach is based on Durkheim's (1975) view that the goal of moral education is to develop the elements of morality: discipline, attachment to groups, and autonomy (a self-chosen sense of the good and one's duty). Implications are that a criterion for recruitment should be based on personal characteristics which make a potential teacher a significant role model, the school atmosphere should involve group orientation, and the curriculum should stress that there are certain givens concerning moral life. Problems relevant to this approach should also be examined: indoctrination, cultural relativism, and moral conflict. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"Because of the vital elements of economic life that national accounts often leave out, great skepticism should be attached to the use of GNP as a measure of country's well-being. National accounts in both developed and developing nations consistently overlook and undervalue work done by women, whether in the subsistence sector, the informal labor market, or the household. As a result, many hardworking women are classified as \"not economically active.\" During the past three decades women have entered the formal labor force in unprecedented numbers. However, women workers in both rich and poor countries are subject to occupational segregation which fragments the labor market into stereotypically masculine and feminine jobs. The trend toward greater participation in paid labor on  the part of women has not been matched by an increased involvement of men in unpaid work. Women have campaigned for equality in the labor force and public life, but men have not made an issue of equal access to housework and home life. Numerous serveys have examined the way men and women spend their time and findings on working women's disproportionate share of the total work load are remarkably uniform, whether one examines developed or developing countries, capitalist or socialist economies, agricultural, or industrial societies. For families in which both adults work for pay, solutions to the problem of the woman's double day include delegating some household responsibilities to persons outside the family and sharing the total workload more equitably among family members.

        "description":"The ideas of John Dewey illustrate the American conflict between democratic principles and authority. Dewey denied opposition between freedom and authority and suggested that the issue was the union of the two principles. He defined authority as stability of social organization which gives direction and support to individuals. For Dewey, any new system of authority had to be voluntary and cooperative, internal to the individual, and not imposed on him. He suggested that the search for a new kind of authority should be modeled after the field of science. An examination of Dewey's educational philosophy reflects the difficulty of his theory. Dewey rejected both the internalization of moral absolutes and the teaching of automatic subordination to bureaucratic control. The role of  the school, however, was to manipulate the child to ensure a uniformity of outlook and a widely accepted authority. The school was to function as an instrument of social change and the teacher as a social engineer. He assumed the superiority of his standards to those of parents. While the sincerity of Dewey's devotion to democracy is obvious, it must be pointed out that while he calls for teacher participation in educational decision making, he does not devote equal time to the public's right to control the schools. In conclusion, despite his efforts to transcend the conflicts of the American tradition, the conflicts were evident in his work. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"A study to determine the agenda-setting role of the mass media concerning the political interests of the general public during the 1976 presidential campaign is reported. Agenda-setting refers to the transfer of concerns from the media to the general public. The concept is concerned with cognitions rather than attitudes. It has been stated that while the press may not tell us what to think, it definitely tells us what to think about. The sample consisted of 45 registered voters who responded to nine interviews conducted throughout 1976 and in January 1977. In investigating the relationship between media coverage of issues and the salience of issues to voters, the survey measured the extent to which an individual feels an issue is important to him/her (intrapersonal salience) and  the extent to which an issue is discussed by an individual to others (interpersonal salience). Results indicate that participants' use of the mass media increases quickly in the election year, peaking in early spring, then dropping off to a lower plateau for the remainder of the year. Initially, political interest influences media use, but heavy media use in the spring, particularly television news, then stimulates political interest. However, use of newspapers for political information generally is a stronger predictor of both interpersonal and intrapersonal issues. The conclusion is that the agenda-setting role for television is the stimulation of public interest, while the dominant role for the newspapers is setting the agenda of issues. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"The paper discusses literature which reports biological factors of criminal behavior and suggests how such biological characteristics might interact with the learning of moral behavior. The first three studies of predelinquent and prerecidivistic criminals measured autonomic nervous system responses to stress. Those who later became delinquent demonstrated somewhat underreactive nervous systems; that is, their pulse rates were lower than individuals undergoing the same stressful situation. The next three studies of families, twins, and adopted children linked genetic factors to antisocial behavior. Studies of antisocial individuals also indicated that presence of hyporeactive nervous systems. The conclusion is that adequate physiological fear is essential to the learning process.  For example, fear of punishment leads a child to inhibit his stealing impulse; the person with an underreactive nervous system has a slower response to fear-inducing situations. Implications for these findings involve the predictability of who may later become a serious criminal and the possibility of preventive intervention. However, models of intervention such as behavior-altering drugs and severe punishment are inappropriate. (Author/KC)",

The model focuses on a specific learner approaching a specific task. Discrepancies between the learning potential of the student, as assessed by the teacher, and the actual performance of the student are explored from the viewpoint of various learning theories and situations. The paper concludes that the present crisis of public confidence (or lack thereof) in education will continue, unless reactive blame-laying is replaced by positive action: Teachers must come to be regarded as professionals in  public service rather than as public servants.

Instructional expenditures in IGE and non-IGE schools did not differ significantly. However, IGE teachers devoted significantly more time to individual instruction. A production function approach identified the input and process variables most related to achievement in reading and mathematics and student self-concept. Several variables were consistently related to student achievement: (1) teachers' involvement in a degree program; (2) years of teaching experience; (3) teachers' sex; (4) students' maturity; (5) students' social confidence; (6) teachers' perception of the principal's leadership; (7)  teachers' job satisfaction; and (8) teachers' involvement in decision making. A set of 12 independent variables accounted for 78% of the variance in reading achievement and a similar set of 12 variables accounted for 71% of the variance in mathematics achievement; all of these variables were susceptible to control by teachers and administrators. Another similar set of 12 variables accounted for 72% of the variance in social confidence scores; these variables reflected the ambience of the school rather than specific instructional processes.

The Concerns-Based Adoption Model was based on research findings about educational dissemination and change. The model describes adoption of innovation as a growth process. Each teacher, according to this model, experiences a characteristic sequence of concerns as an innovation is implemented: (1) awareness; (2) information; (3) personal; (4) management; (5) consequence; (6) collaboration; and (7) refocusing. The Stages of Concern Questionnaire was developed to measure teachers' positions concerning an educational innovation. It was developed from the statements made by 300 elementary school and college  teachers about their own concerns, and factor analysis was used to select 35 items which loaded highly on the seven concerns of the model. Test reliability was satisfactory, based on internal consistency estimates of .64 to .83, and test-retest reliability of .65 to .86. Research studies have supported the test's validity. Some longitudinal studies have also demonstrated that teachers, over time, pass through the hypothesized stages. (GDC)",

        "description":"Some of the historical developments which have influenced educational evaluation are the importance of operationalism and behavioral objectives; curriculum reform; the Elementary and Secondary Education Act; and school and teacher accountability. Major problems related to current evaluation practices include negative attitudes toward evaluation, and the lack of theory and adequate guidelines for evaluation. Traditional conceptual schemes of evaluation include measurement as evaluation; determination of congruence; professional judgment; and applied research, though most evaluators and researchers implicitly support a separation between these two modes of inquiry. Current approaches to evaluation and evaluation models include Provus' discrepancy evaluation model, Stake's  antecedents-transactions-outcomes model, and the context, input, process, product (CIPP) model. These decision-oriented evaluation models can be contrasted with value-oriented evaluation, based on Dewey's conceptualization of valuation. Out of this theoretical base, naturalistic evaluation methods have arisen, including the responsive, judicial, transactional, connoisseurship, and illumination models. Concurrently, systems-oriented evaluation has also been developed, to interconnect the planning, development, and evaluation process. All these approaches have implications for needs assessment and policy analysis. (Over 80 bibliographical references are appended.) (GDC)",

        "description":"A survey of administrators, teachers, and parents in 15 Elementary Secondary Education Act Title I school districts indicated that evaluations are used locally to meet federal and state requirements, to inform parents and staff, and to confirm positive attitudes toward a program. Standardized achievement tests, the backbone of Title I evaluations, are viewed as inadequate for judging or improving programs. Respondents felt tests were biased and preferred other measures: skill-specific tests, observation, self-concept or attitude measures. Evaluations were not used to improve programs for several reasons: program stability; funds; politics; unavailability of results in time for decision making; differing information needs of federal, local, and state agencies. Respondents disliked  evaluation and ignored negative results if they believed in a program. Until these underlying attitudes change, evaluation results, even if technically sound, will not be used. Of the two current federal strategies for Title I evaluation, an independent national study and a local-to-state-to-federal reporting scheme, the latter is more likely to be used. The federal government should be committed to increasing communication between program staff and evaluation staff, and to promoting evaluation among local staff. (CP)",

Some of the characteristics of this nation's educational system are discussed, and a normative principle is stated that those having a greater share of educational goods merit a greater share of non-educational social goods. The model assumes two categories of people: high school graduates with no further education and those who have not graduated. It further assumes a normal distribution of non-educational social benefits and a perfect biserial correlation between high school graduation and social benefits. The conclusion is reached that beyond a 75 percent high school completion ratio,  it no longer pays to finish high school, but it is a serious social disaster not to do so. It is suggested that the present rate of 75 percent may be a natural point of stability. The possible effects of various educational policies are discussed in terms of the implications of this model.

In the first study, a computer-based algorithm was used to analyze prose subject matter and to identify high-information words. Sentences containing selected words were then transformed into multiple-choice items by four writers who generated foils or question alternatives informally and by an algorithmic method. These items were then organized into tests and administered to 24 college students before and after they had studied the instructional materials. In this replication, the tests were administered to 249 high school students, and results were combined with those obtained earlier. This provided  stable estimates of item difficulty. Results supported those obtained earlier. Thus, it appears that this item-writing technique is feasible and that algorithmic methods of generating foils produce items of reasonably good quality.

The reliability and predictive validity of the advisor predictions were both investigated. One major strength of the study was the inclusion of variables measuring progress during developmental studies. Predictions based solely on data available prior to developmental studies would invariably predict failure because it is those variables which suggested a need for developmental studies in the first place. A second major strength of this  study was the inclusion of an advisor prediction as a variable in both regression methods. This inclusion maintained comparability between methods while allowing the inclusion of both &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;soft&quot; data.

        "description":"This study presents an application of the Rasch equating methodology on a minimum competency testing program in reading and mathematics. Common item equating was performed in two stages to link the 1978-1979 form of the New Jersey Minimum Basic Skills tests to the 1977-1978 form. Both fit to the Rasch model and stability of the common item pools were investigated prior to the actual equating. Equivalent raw scores derived from the Rasch methodology were compared with a prior linear equating. Special attention was paid to those raw score points around the state's cut-off score. Results from the study indicated moderate to good fit of the tests to the Rasch model. Several &quot;unstable&quot; equating items were found and the equating was therefore carried out in two ways: 1) using all  twenty-five equating items, and 2) using just the &quot;stable&quot; equating items. Raw scores derived from both the Rasch and linear methods showed close though not perfect agreement. The equating using only the &quot;stable&quot; equating items changed six out of the seven equating tables. In only two of these six tables, did this change move the scores closer to that given by the linear method. (Author/GSK)",

Adaptive techniques substantially reduced test length without reducing quality, when applied to three problem areas: the use of unidimensional item pods, the measurement of multiple content areas, and mastery testing. The use of unidimensional ICC in achievement testing was further supported by the lack of effect on dimensionality of immediate knowledge of results. Because some results were inconclusive, more research is needed on inter-subtest branching, dimensionality of achievement over time in instruction, and adaptive mastery testing.  Finally achievement measurement lacks a coherent framework. Norm referenced and criterion referenced testing approaches have little in common; and they do not relate to the crucial problem of measuring individual achievement gains during or after instruction. To incorporate inter-subtest branching, inter-time branching, and mastery testing, an adaptive self-referenced testing model is proposed. (CP)",

It is crucial to ethical instruction, study of theory, teaching methods, and training in skills or abilities.

A possible argument against the justification of critical thinking as an educational ideal is that all educational ideals are political in two senses: every educational ideal has political ramifications; and every educational  ideal is politically biased, and so the acceptance of any ideal is a function of prior political commitment. These arguments fail because educational ideals can be independently supported on both moral and educational grounds. Practical and philosophical topics for research are suggested. (CP)",

Mnemonic levels were assessed with Piaget and Inhelder's memory of an arrangement task, both initially and again at six months. The data strongly supported the Piagetian theory linking long-term memory to cognitive development. Immediate recall memory was independent of the initial cognitive assessment, while six-month correct recall, reconstruction, and recognition memory were highly correlated with the seven-month cognitive assessment. Students who were assessed initially as nonformal, but who became formal  within the seven-month interval had the same chance of correct recall, reconstruction, and recognition as those initially assessed to be formal. A seven-month formal congitive assessment was generally characteristic of students with correct six-month recall, while the incorrect recognition and incorrect recall/correct recognition groups did not significantly differ with respect to the percent of formal subjects.

In this cultures-in-contact situation provided in an urban school in the northeastern United States, language data were collected through the use of video tapes, audio tapes, and note-taking in the classroom, sampling from a six month period from the start of the school year until shortly after the beginning of the second major grading period. Additional data were collected via teacher and student interviews and independent measures of literacy development. Analysis of teacher and student interactional language using  discourse analysis frameworks advanced by Sinclair and Coulthard and Mehan reveal language use rules, both taught and learned, for behavior and academic achievement. These data also reveal the subjects' relative success in functionally operating within those rules. Functional match or mismatch of the taught and learned categories of rules appears to be related to teacher assessment of the students' competency in the classroom and students' success in becoming literate.

Empirical research literature yields data showing that teacher behavior and attitudes have important implications for minority children. Twelve staff development/inservice education programs were studied by WIEDS through survey and interview techniques to identify effective desegregation/integration problems which employ staff development as a tool. Findings indicate that desegregation/integration problems can be dealt with through effective staff development efforts. Staff development would help in providing  positive classroom atmospheres which encourage interracial friendship and prevent negative classroom experiences, in increasing staff knowledge of student backgrounds, in teaching children to become ethnically literate, in involving parents cooperatively in the educational process, and in preventing resegregation. WIEDS has begun to conceptualize models, guidelines, and materials to promote effective staff development/inservice education programs. (MK)",

The author concludes that the school failed to incorporate all the features of IGE, which calls for alterations in staffing so that staffs are more differentiated and more collegial than in traditional schools, the specification of learning objectives, and the grouping of students according to work needed on skill development rather than more traditional grouping practices. The author found that the IGE model helped the school succeed in minimizing disorder, creating positive relationships between students and teachers, fostering non-hostile and  often friendly interracial relationships, and improving test scores. Other characteristics of the school were found to foster positive relationships including extracurricular activities, the &quot;fresh and sweet&quot; quality of the student body, the varied class background of students, and the muting of competition among students.

The investigation focused on curricular content, instructional practices, and social interactions at different track levels in secondary school English and language arts classrooms. In the paper, the theoretical basis of the study is discussed, sampling and data collection procedures are described, and the study's results are presented in detail. Some of the findings include: (1) conspicuous differences exist in the quantity of learning time provided to students at different track levels; (2) in terms of topics of  instruction, cognitive levels of skills and learning activities, and non-cognitive behaviors mentioned by teachers as part of instructional content, pronounced differentiation occurred among the tracked classes; (3) teachers of higher track students were perceived to be more enthusiastic and clearer in their presentations than were lower track teachers; (4) distinct differences could be seen in the kinds of social relationships and interactions that characterize classes at different track levels. These findings are held to be consistent with the views of theorists who articulate the cultural reproduction notion of schooling. (Author/GC)",

However, an examination of how research findings are translated into policy is necessary to assess accurately the extent to which this goal can be realized. This paper assesses the efficiency of four strategies for increasing research use in policy making: enlightenment-transfer, engineering-transfer, enlightenment-transaction, and engineering-transaction. &quot;Enlightenment&quot; and &quot;engineering&quot; are labels used to describe basic and applied research design. &quot;Transfer&quot; and &quot;transaction&quot; describe methods of disseminating research information. It can be concluded that qualitative researchers interested in having research incorporated into policy would be best advised to  use either of the two transfer strategies and concentrate on improving the kind and form of information they present. Guidelines for researchers for facilitating the incorporation of research into policy are presented.

Selected conclusions from this section are these: an accurate measure of employer satisfaction should be developed; universal and workable definitions for terms such as graduates, completers, leavers, and employers must be used; and variances for curriculum and types of programs must be made. Reasons cited and developed in the  paper for assessing employer satisfaction with vocational education graduates are to validate worth; identify needed improvements; improve education/employer relations; improve guidance services; bolster recruitment; enhance labor force capability; and satisfy legislative mandates.

The next two sections, the focus of the document, provide information on and suggest criteria for evaluating and selecting career  information material and a career information system. These criteria for evaluating material are listed: what, why, who, when, where, how it was gathered, and how it is presented. Guidelines for selecting materials suggest that materials must be accurate, representative, attractive, keyed to client interests and abilities, and cost effective. Career information system evaluation and selection is discussed in terms of its components--information, delivery, and user services--and examination of the organization sponsoring and/or marketing the system. A final section discusses steps in implementing/organizing a system, including needs of potential user agencies and organizations, inventorying existing resources, and acquiring financial assistance.

Project objectives were met through the involvement of nine school districts in the Alliance of Career and Vocational Education. The National Center for Research in Vocational Education staff provided training for career education directors and career education curriculum materials for teachers to facilitate program implementation in the nine districts. As a result of project activities, it was found that four major factors influenced the transportability and  installation of Alliance programs: (1) goal and model congruence, (2) cost, (3) ease of installation, and (4) staff and community involvement. Evaluation data indicated that the career education programs were received equally well by staff and students in the five ongoing districts and four new districts. (LRA)",

Two key elements of social and economic development were studied: (1) mid-career students, including their characteristics, goals, and education/training needs; and (2) the environments for learning and retraining created by community-level organizations. (Mid-career students were defined as those who had interrupted or terminated their formal education, had been employed or otherwise occupied for at least five years, and were now reentering some form of formal education or training.) The mid-career student data was gathered by means of comprehensive questionnaires completed by 1,042 mid-career students enrolled in multi-institutional education and training  programs in seven widely separated communities in the United States. The community-level organizations were studied ln visits to each community by the project team, who interviewed community leaders, educators, local and state education policy makers, and students. Based on the findings, a set of alternative models or \"ideal\" types of community organization was constructed, and a list of basic elements of community support services was developed for use as a checklist to evaluate the probable effectiveness of existing or proposed community organizations.

Divided into four chapters, this document describes the characteristics of mid-career adult students in terms of their previous education and work experiences, their present and proposed life and work transitions, their goals and ambitions, and their experiences in planning personal programs to help them accomplish their objectives. Chapter 1 discusses the research base and purposes of the mid-career change study. Chapter 2 describes the environments of change based on the responses of over  one thousand adult students who were surveyed in the study. Chapter 3 discusses the characteristics of the mid-career-change adult student. The final chapter summarizes the findings of the survey under the following topics: planning for career change; attitudes about career change; ages and life-work transitions; and career goals and directions of change.

Data was gathered for a baseline description of the 270 women participants--133 assigned to training and 137 to the comparison group--through an interview soon after enrollment. The average woman was thirty years old, black, a mandatory WIN participant, no longer living with her husband, and had one or two children. Most had considerable labor force experience in jobs primarily in low-skill categories.  Almost half had training to upgrade skills for low-skill category occupations. For most, the current episode on welfare was their only one. Students liked the curricular structure of the program, but cited difficulty of coursework and racial and sexual imbalance and prejudice as dislikes. Other problems were related to finances, transportation, and lack of family support. Issues of concern in program functioning were a 59% attrition rate and poor attendance and performance. (YLB)",

Three basic questions were to be answered by the project: (1) Based on a survey of solar heating and cooling systems equipment, what types of systems are being manufactured? (2) What is the quantitative demand for workers to install and maintain such equipment? and (3) What skills must be possessed by solar workers? Among the findings reported was that the typical installation time for a domestic hot water system is forty man hours, plus an additional ten man hours required for design, and two man hours per year for maintenance. An analysis of the tasks for design, installation, and maintenance for a typical solar system reveals  that the solar tasks accounted for approximately 20 percent of the total task time. The remaining 80 percent of the tasks could be performed by solar-trained conventional tradesmen. To supply the required number of solar technicians and mechanics at a steady rate, a minimum of 4,000 workers must be trained every year to fulfill the increment in demand until 1985.

        "description":"Site visits were conducted at six state departments of vocational education (Texas, Illinois, Utah, South Carolina, Michigan, and Indiana) to assess the level of articulation with related educational dissemination agencies. These states represented a variety of settings which illustrated the effects of geography, population size, levels of past and present educational dissemination activity, awareness and usefulness of an approved state plan, and physical proximity of staff members on the levels of articulation. It was observed that articulation is greatly enhanced when the amount of informal communication between staff members is high. Formal interagency agreements are not a guarantee of cooperation, although periodic communication and meetings are essential to maintain  awareness. Generally there is a lack of funds to adequately use existing resources. Streamlining of organizational personnel structuring would greatly facilitate present levels of articulation. The overall level of articulation in these states is not high, but, it was noted that there is great willingness to participate and increase the amount of articulation. (The six case histories are presented individually.) (Author/LRA)",

        "description":"To examine tactical self-presentations (images persons display publicly) in task-oriented leadership situations, 128 subjects (56 male and 72 female) were assigned leadership positions in groups that did very well or very poorly. The leaders learned that either they or the group-at-large were responsible for the performance and that the other group members either did or did not know the precise locus of responsibility. As predicted, males emphasized self-presentations of competence and prominence relative to their socioemotionality (the appearance of being warm, approachable, and interpersonally oriented) when the others did not know of the leader's responsibility for success, but relatively de-emphasized the former attributes when the others did know. Males also displayed some  compensatory self-presentations following a leader-responsible failure, though the effects were not precisely as predicted. In contrast, females' self-presentations did not follow predictions; they normally emphasized their socioemotionality over other attributes irrespective of the combination of treatment. These findings are consistent with prior research generally indicating that females are more interpersonally oriented in group settings, while males are more task oriented. (Author/LRA)",

The first section introduces the package, overviews the other sections, discusses state agency involvement and responsibility, presents three alternative organizational structures, and provides a (one-year) time frame. The emphasis of section 2 is on integrating the Indian population into the total state plan. It provides information on four areas: potential problem areas, potential matching funds, suggested activities for inclusion in state plans, and procedures for participating in state-funded programs. Developing a communication network  between and among state vocational education agencies, local vocational education programs, and Indian populations is the subject of section 3. Section 4 recommends procedures to guide a state vocational agency in planning, implementing, and utilizing a needs assessment. Topics include steering committees, survey team, community survey, publicity, and survey instruments. (Sample surveys are provided.) Abstracts of successful vocational programs are included in section 5 to assist in the development of programs that specifically address Indian population needs. In-depth studies on seven of these programs provide additional information on program curriculum, financing, staffing, planning, and implementation. (YLB)",

        "description":"In comparison with traditional experimental design, which is concerned with what happened, a case study approach is more appropriate for answering the question of why or how something happened. As an alternative complementary-vocational-education-evaluation approach, the case study attempts to describe and analyze some program in comprehensive terms with its idiosyncracies and complexities, frequently as it unfolds over time. Case studies have advantages--opportunities to formulate problems as the evaluation progresses, modify data categories constantly, and reduce distortion of variables--and limitations--need for special training in conducting them and careful definition of case, their length, and their generalizability. Twelve steps comprise the three stages in the case study  process: pre-fieldwork; fieldwork; and analysis, verfication, and synthesis. The preliminary steps involved in case study design are setting boundaries, defining the unit of analysis, selecting a site, establishing initial contacts, developing data collection systems, and defining fieldwork procedures. The field work stage involves staff training, logistics of field operations, and data collection using qualitative methods (interviewing, observing, and gathering data unobstrusively). Steps in the final stage--analysis, verification, and synthesis--include analyzing data, reporting the findings, and utilizing the findings.

Changes and trends identified by the panel are listed under six societal force areas: demographics, technological advances, the economy, the work place, energy, and value shifts. Possible positive responses to these changes, taking into account perceived gaps between the state-of-the-art and the kinds of institutional responses needed are given in a four-page matrix. One axis depicts seven major areas of institutional response (personnel development, program development, support services, linkages, planning/assessment, delivery systems, and administrative services). On the other  axis are three critical areas of need: energy, diverse populations, and technological advances. Research and development needs are then listed for the seven areas of institutional response. The eight criteria for selecting the advisory panel (workshop participants) to assure diversity of representation and the names and addresses of the ten leaders selected are given. (MEK)",

Chapter 1 provides a general introduction to QWL. A summary of the Washington, D.C. conference appears as chapter 2. Chapters 3-5 extend the treatment of these controversial issues--definition of QWL, objectives, structures, union and management roles, public policy implications, scope of a QWL effort, payoff, QWL in relation to union organizing, analysis of QWL failures, relationship between QWL and collective bargaining, and union and management initiatives. Chapter 3 presents the views of ten management people on issues and  viewpoints expressed by trade unionists. Chapter 4 analyzes major concerns--definition and objectives, union attitudes, relationship with collective bargaining, conditions associated with success/failure, and prognosis for joint efforts--with reference to the QWL literature. Some policy implications relating to joint union-management QWL improvement efforts are developed in chapter 5. The needs for national commitment, active role of federal government, labor-management dialogue, education, and research are addressed. (YLB)",

        "description":"A study sought to determine whether the perception of sex bias influences a woman's decision to teach vocational agriculture. Separate questionnaires were administered to female secondary vocational agriculture students, female university students enrolled in agricultural education, and female vocational agriculture teachers. Each of the questionnaires dealt with perceptions of sex bias and with the desirability of agricultural education as a career. Among the findings of the study was that with respect to their perception of sex bias, in response to the statement concerning community acceptance, 72.3 percent of the secondary students agreed that the community would accept a woman vocational agriculture teacher. Similarly, 61.1 percent agreed that a woman vocational agriculture  teacher would get along well with her class, while 58.7 percent either disagreed or strongly disagreed that students in vocational agriculture would not accept a woman teacher. On a question concerning desire to teach, 59.6 percent of the female university students agreed that they would consider teaching production agriculture. A total of 48.7 percent did not feel it would be difficult to find a job teaching production agriculture because of their sex. A majority of the female teachers surveyed (70%) did not agree that administrators were reluctant to hire a female vocational agriculture teacher. (LRA)",

A sample of 229 students and 348 administrative and teaching staff from the Toronto Secondary Schools participated in this survey, which collected data  through two sets of questionnaires, one for students and another for staff. The responses of the students are presented in the first half of the findings, while those of the school personnel are reported in the latter half. Highlights of these findings indicate that students and staff feel that the best form of education for returnees is dependent on the returnees' needs, and that, while students tend to feel it is not easy for dropouts to return, staff feels it is.

These trends have produced two effects, i.e., greater marketability for undergraduate psychology majors and greater use of trained paraprofessionals as community mental health care providers. An undergraduate Helping Skills Course, piloted in response to these trends as a complement to traditional courses and practica, incorporated a design based on three components: (1) presenting a conceptual framework using models of systematic skills training; (2) providing opportunities for increasing self-awareness and relationship-awareness; and (3) offering guided helping skills  practice and feedback. Student evaluation responses on a paper and pencil measure indicated significant increases in ability to respond to problem statements with accurate empathy. (Author)",

Male subjects (N=80) participated, four subjects per experimental session. Two subjects competed in a non-zero sum, mixed-motive PDG while being observed by two other subjects. Each player was observed by only one observer, either a friend or a stranger. After 20 trials, each player and his observer assigned responsibility for the player's outcome. Observers who were friends to actors assigned more personal responsibility to the actor for success, and less personal responsibility for failure, than did observers who were strangers to actors.

The data collection focused on identification of crime location, time of day or night, number and interaction of participants, weapons used, extent of injury to the victims, and rate of reporting to the police. Only three crimes of violence--rape, robbery, and assault--were investigated; child abuse was excluded. Acts of domestic violence involving relatives occurred primarily at night, while violent acts committed by acquaintances occurred during the day. Findings also indicated that: (1) these violent crimes rarely  involved more than one victim; (2) 60% of the attacks involved weapons or harmful objects; (3) most incidents resulted in physical injury but few hospitalizations; and (4) offenses involving relatives had the highest police reporting rate.

The objectives of this conference are described in terms of the need to reach consensus on how cases should be handled by prosecutors and the way in which information can be exchanged among prosecutors representing the 17 cities where LEAA-funded family violence projects exist. Issues addressed included: (1) the nature and extent of family violence, particularly spouse abuse; (2) the appropriateness of criminal prosecution; (3) criteria for determining prosecution; (3) measures to assure victim cooperation; (4) ways to overcome proof and evidentiary  problems; (5) effective dispositions; and (6) effective alternatives to prosecution. A list of conference participants and an annotated bibliography of selected readings are also provided. (Author/HLM)",

College students with weight concerns, particularly those susceptible to &quot;mood&quot; eating and binge episodes, may have a restricted range of activities which provide positive reinforcement. Overweight students in a behavioral weight-control program reported less enjoyment of pleasant activities than normal-weight classroom control subjects. Restrictive dieting tendencies were positively correlated with frequency/enjoyability ratings of socially-related pleasures, and negatively correlated with frequency/enjoyability ratings of non-social  pleasures. There is an ambiguous relationship between the amount and variety of pleasurable activities and subsequent body weight fluctuations. (Author)",

Tow targets of commitment contingencies, completion of the study and behavior change, were examined among 42 female and 3 male subjects who made a monetary deposit to enroll in the 10-week program. The treatment consisted of self-monitoring of eating and exercise behavior. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: (1) no commitment; (2) study completion commitment; and (3) study completion plus behavior change. Attrition, three measures of study participation, behavior change, and short- and long-term weight loss were evaluated. The no-commitment group had the greatest attrition rate. Only one participation variable was affected; the behavior change commitment increased the frequency of  self-monitoring, and resulted in greater change in eating behavior but did not affect change in exercise behavior. The number of weigh-ins attended and frequency of self-monitoring were positively related to weight loss. Change in exercise behavior predicted weight loss; change in eating did not. Commitment contingencies have a narrow effect in a weight loss program and little generalization to non-targeted behavior occurs. (Author/NRB)",

The self-report Likelihood of Influence Tactic Use Scale was administered to 10 males and 10 females in each of three cohort groups to investigate the influence tactics used at different age levels. Respondents rated their likelihood to use influence tactics in intimate, parent, child and best-friend relationships. Younger adults were most likely to use influence tactics in all relationships. Middle-aged adults used influence most with their children. Older adults used influence tactics most in their intimate relationships. Indirect/emotional strategies were employed more frequently by females. Adult children and elderly  parents had difficulty directly influencing each other and resorted to indirect/emotional strategies. All cohorts used direct/rational strategies most often with friends, less often with intimates and least often with parents. Overall, there was much similarity in influence styles by cohorts, genders and in relationships. Results suggest that influencing is a function of both culturally socialized behavioral predispositions and the power differential of individuals in a relationship. (Author/NRB)",

Undergraduate subjects (N=65) predicted the performance of hypothetical students on a comprehensive college final exam of medium difficulty, based on IQ scores and study time efforts ratings of varying reliability. The reliability of effort and ability (IQ) information was manipulated to test averaging and multiplying models for differences in prediction. Results indicated that increased reliability for either ability or effort information had greater effects on judged performance. Increased  reliability of one type of information lessened the effect of the other type of information. The findings are consistent with an averaging model in which reliability of information influences its weight, but are inconsistent with a multiplying model. (NRB)",

Subjects (N=85) in the first experiment were children aged 7-12. Subjects (N=48) in the second experiment were college undergraduates. Subjects in both studies were instructed to think about and discuss sad incidents experienced by themselves or others prior to the opportunity to help. The prediction was confirmed that children and adults empathetically experiencing negative affects of others would show higher levels of helping than self-focused subjects. Focusing an individual on another's misfortune may encourage altruistic behavior, an effect more marked on male subjects.  Since the potential recipients of help were not the targets of the affective arousal, empathy appears to transfer and enhance other charitable behaviors. (NRB)",

There are generally two approaches used to answer this question: assign males and females the role of leader, keeping certain extraneous factors constant, and then compare leader or group effectiveness; or examine the leader's or group's reactions to actual male and female leaders. These approaches characterize the two sets of conflicting research results, i.e., research supporting gender differences in leadership behavior uses samples from the general population of women, while studies finding no gender-related differences uses samples from the population of actual female leaders. An alternative approach for examining leadership  effectiveness in terms of gender differences is to assess how leadership role, leadership style, and situational characteristics influence leadership behavior.

Findings revealed that the CPDM course had a positive impact on student selection of a college major, knowledge of the world of work, decision-making processes, and level of career planning. In 1979, following extensive textual revisions, a second field test, using a formative-summative model, evaluated the effectiveness of the CPDM course as a whole and on selected course components. Formative evaluation results suggested a need to revise the instructor's guide in terms of  time and class management and to streamline the instructional portions of the student text.

        "description":"This training program, designed to assist treatment programs decision-makers in planning, implementing, and monitoring practices and services for alcoholic women, provides participants the opportunity to: (1) measure the current state of their agency programs; (2) select priorities for change; and (3) develop an action plan for change. The program is designed for teams of two people from the same agency, one with decision-making responsibility and one interested in women's treatment. Two trainers, one male and one female, conduct one-three-hour sessions in small group exercises and discussions, lecturettes, and brainstorming with a group of 20 participants over a 2 l/2 day period. This manual helps trainers prepare for and conduct the course. It includes a session-by-session  overview, refresher materials on training methods, guidelines for training program management, sample recruitment materials, and masters for duplicating participant handouts. A series of session outline cards accompanies the manual and includes specific directions for conducting each session, goals and objectives, and materials needed for learning activities.

        "description":"The hypothesis that negative emotional life states accompanying life stresses are associated with overeating and weight gain cannot be adequately tested solely by laboratory analogue studies. Naturalistic, short-term longitudinal designs are needed in which individuals susceptible to mood eating can be identified prior to a stressful event and followed up to determine weight changes. College students in two samples completed questionnaires on height, weight, restraint, eating habits, self-image, and life events. Mood eating tendencies, which were more frequently reported by both overweight and normal-weight females than males, were associated with self-monitored dysphoric moods and negative self-evaluations. Subjects with high scores on the Mood Eating Scale were likely to be  restrictive dieters reporting binge-eating tendencies and dissatisfaction with weight-related appearance. Results suggest that the Mood Eating Scale is a viable measure of a mediating variable, a cognitive appraisal process intervening between life and weight changes. (Author/HLM)",

Males presented with three sets of masculine occupations, and then switched to feminine occupations on the fourth trial, showed a continual decline in recall. Males presented with a feminine-masculine switch showed 80% release from PI. Males may first have classified masculine occupations presented as &quot;occupations,&quot; with feminine occupations subsumed into this category. Males presented first with feminine occupations classified them as such,  making the later-presented masculine occupations a new category. Females distinguished between masculine and feminine occupations, regardless of order of presentation, showing a small consistent release from PI. A differing social reality experienced by males and females has an influence on encoding of occupations. No sex-role effects were found.

The extent to which job attitudes are predictive of early retirement decisions beyond the predictions by income, health and demographic characteristics is an important consideration. Michigan Civil Service employees (N=379) who were eligible to retire responded to questionnaires of financial, demographic, health and job perception measures. A year later, a second questionnaire identified those who had retired and those who continued to work. Demographically, retirees tended to be female, non-white, have less education, and come from smaller communities than non-retirees. Retirees reported more illnesses, had lower salaries and fewer dependents than non-retirees.  Although retirees viewed their retirement income as adequate and their jobs as less challenging, job attitudes did not add significantly to retirement prediction. Financial variables are most important in the retirement decision, therefore financial incentives should be relatively effective in influencing such decisions. (NRB)",

A 12-question Sexual Experiences Survey written in parallel versions for men and women was administered to 3,862 university students. Three levels of sexual aggression/victimization ranging from consensual sexual intercourse to actual rape were reported by both sexes, supporting a dimensional approach. Factor analysis of the survey instrument revealed three stable factors accounting for 51% of the variance. The factors corresponded to the three levels of sexual aggression/victimization, suggesting a viable alternative approach to sample selection for future rape research. The number of females reporting victimization was several  times larger than the number of males reporting aggression. Further research should determine if males fail to report aggression, if each aggressive male victimized more than one woman, or if males and females differ in their perceptions of a given experience.

College students (N=100) completed questionnaires on their background and romantic/sexual relationships in addition to the PAQ. Results indicated that androgynous persons used bilateral strategies such as persuasion, bargaining, and positive affect in getting  their way. Undifferentiated persons used unilateral strategies such as emotional withdrawal or pursuing their own ends--regardless. Masculine individuals preferred direct strategies such as asking their partners to do what they wanted, while feminine individuals chose indirect, unilateral strategies such as pouting.

Two considerations that must be taken into account by any individual, group, or commission addressing issues of criteria for competency in literacy are: (1) literacy competence is a relationship between the specific demands of a situation and the variety of literacy and nonliteracy strategies available to any individual; and (2) a tendency exists to confuse the symbolic attributes of literacy with actual literacy demands. Side issues that must be understood include the fact that trends from the SAT tests are not relative to basic literacy, there is not comparable educational data from many other nations, and available  research does not support the fact of a decline in basic skills. Other issues that must be explored include the difference between functional illiteracy and functional competency and the possibility that illiteracy is merely one aspect of a larger problem of poverty or discrimination. If a national literacy commission is to be instituted the project must be clearly conceived. Literacy should be viewed as a relationship between demand and ability and the focus should be on how well individuals are performing their jobs and life-tasks, and the extent to which literacy ability influences performance must be determined.

These children were asked to print a series of reversible target figures (letters and numbers, such as 2-s, p-q, p-9, and b-d) that were presented alone and with their mirror-image counterparts. To control for the possibility that the mere presence of another figure might be sufficient to produce an error, the targets were also presented with nonmirror-image figures. Although more reversals occurred when the target was printed with another figure than when it was printed alone, the nature of the other figure had no bearing on the number of reversals produced. Correct reproductions occurred far more often than reversals, even when the target was printed with its mirror-image counterpart. Focusing the  child's attention on both the reversible target and its counterpart without emphasizing their orientation differences led to a reduction in reversal errors. Taken collectively, these findings opposed the widely held belief that printing reversals stemmed from interference produced by conflicting left-right orientation cues associated with the reversible figures. Apparently, differences in reversible figures do not need to be underscored to prevent interference. (Author/RL)",

After assessing the problem, the Bureau of Language Arts of the Chicago Board of Education selected inference as the focus of high school reading. To develop a taxonomy of inferences, the Chicago committee began inductively, by writing or selecting passages or stories which its members intuited as being increasingly difficult and appropriate for the various years in high school. The texts chosen were progressively more difficult in terms of the inferences required to comprehend them. In subsequent pilot testing, items that proved difficult included inferences involving judgment or emphasis; questions involving discrimination between related motives or characteristics;  inferences of part/whole relations; and questions about the climax of the story, about the relation of setting to plot, and about the function of an incident. However, it was believed that as the fiction reading objectives came to be the more consistent focus of teaching, the Chicago schools would see a marked improvement in reading comprehension. Too, inferential reasoning would at least be one of the instructional emphases in Chicago's high school English courses. (HOD)",

After 30 undergraduate students were classified as either late concrete, early formal, or late formal operational, they were presented with ten literal, ten similarity, and ten proportional metaphors. The subjects were asked to paraphrase the meaning of each sentence aloud as quickly as possible, and not to begin the paraphrase until they had a complete answer in mind. Latency from the time of sentence presentation to initiation of the paraphrase was recorded by a digital timer. A significant interaction was found between operational level  and type of sentence. Planned comparisons revealed that paraphrase latencies for proportional metaphors were significantly shorter for late formal operational subjects than either late concrete or early formal operational subjects. Formal operational subjects paraphrased proportional metaphors as quickly as similarity metaphors. It was concluded that level of operational development was significantly related to metaphor comprehension in young adults. (Author/RL)",

        "description":"A series of studies was conducted to determine the reading and study skills needs of nontraditional students in the Indiana University-South Bend open enrollment program. An investigation of reading level conducted with 61 students in introductory English classes determined that 20% were at the remedial level in reading and more than 44% were at that level in study skills; in addition, 6.5% were below the 7.9 grade equivalent in reading and 4.8% were below that level in study skills. Another study determined that the average reading level of GED tests was grade 10, and that they required little in analytical reading and thinking skills. College textbooks in various subjects were tested for readability level, and the mean level was grade 12.8. Recommendations for recruiting  nontraditional students include the following: administer a battery of tests on admission to identify those students remedial in basic skills so that they may be properly advised, offer courses in remedial reading and study skills, and establish a minimal level of competency for admission to the university, as well as a criterion level for referral to remedial reading.

Posttest scores obtained in May 1977 after the experimental treatment were compared to follow-up posttest scores obtained in May 1978 after no intervention. No significant gains or losses occurred during the nonintervention year in measures of teachers' attitudes toward teaching reading in the content areas and their knowledge of reading skills.

The program was intended to help students comprehend and recall information from different subject areas and to organize complex topics into manageable units. The three major components of the instruction were: varying the rate of reading in relation to a purpose; generating questions; and predicting information, categories of information, and possible answers to the questions. The program used both teacher-supplied, commercially produced materials and student-supplied material from the content areas. Fourteen students participated in the initial course. Evaluation was done  through both informal observations and formal testing, including a pretest and a posttest. The findings showed that the program offered was better than no reading program at all, but that it was not necessarily better than other possible programs. However, the high level of students' enthusiasm for applying the strategies to their regular class work was encouraging. (FL)",

In the first chapter, various factors thought to be important in learning to read are described along with supporting evidence, and Ehri's theory of word identity amalgamation is summarized and contrasted to alternative views. The next eight chapters discuss the specific studies (with the results and conclusions drawn from the studies) on the following topics: the mnemonic value of orthography among beginning readers, the nature of  orthographic images, the influence of orthography on readers' conceptualization of sound segments in words, the effects of image training on printed word learning in children and in beginning readers, whether beginning readers learn printed words better in sentences or in isolation, whether they learn printed words better in contexts or in isolation, and whether word training increases or decreases interference in a Stroop task. The final chapter presents a summary of the studies. (FL)",

        "description":"The cognitive processing capacity (CPC) model of teaching and studying was used to determine whether tenth grade students could improve their performance in biology. The 27 students in the experimental class were taught to study information in quantities that matched their CPC and to chunk these quantities together under a heading in a study outline or diagram. In teaching, the same process was used by the teacher of the experimental class. The control group, another biology class of 27 students, continued to be taught as they had been in the past. After completion of two units of biology, the performances of the experimental group students were superior to those in the control class. Correlations between CPC scores and biology unit test scores tended to account for 46% to 82% of  the variance in the control group's biology test scores. On a third biology unit, both classes were taught by the CPC model of teaching, with the experimental class continuing to achieve at a significantly higher level. When a comparison was made of the letter grades received by the two groups of students in their other content area classes, the experimental group had a significantly higher proportion of letter grades that increased versus letter grades that decreased. These findings appeared to add stronger support for the use of the CPC model of teaching and studying in the classroom. (RL)",

The second section provides a brief review of the literature on evaluating heuristic procedures, with emphasis on J. Lauer's concept of &quot;metatheory.&quot; Discussed Lauer's three evaluation criteria of transcendency, flexible direction, and generative power. The third section describes a classroom experiment in which the composition instructor attempted to elicit heuristic  models from students, using an inquiry approach that involved the following procedures: (1) range-finding, (2) categorizing questions, (3) defining categories and purpose, (4) comparing student categories, (5) sampling questions, (6) presenting new information, and (7) redefining categories and purpose. The last section concludes that teachers should be concerned less with trying to teach students the invention process and more with utilizing their own inventiveness in staging inquiries. (AEA)",

It argues that students may have more prior knowledge about a topic than is readily apparent and that if their prior knowledge can effectively be tapped, a bridge between reader and text may be created that will result in more successful comprehension of text and, in addition, will aid in the gaining of new information from textbook reading. The paper then presents a prereading plan designed to access prior information and facilitate text processing through a three-step procedure that focuses on the development and  assessment of conceptual language and organization related to major ideas expressed in a text. Examples are presented to show how the procedure may be used in the classroom. (FL)",

        "description":"Historical sources show that advertising practitioners actively sought to improve the respectability of their profession between 1885 and 1917. Advertising professionals during that time wanted to rid their occupation of its poor public image and to create public acceptance by eliminating nonprofessional conduct and by patterning the advertising business after more traditional professions, such as law and medicine. This attitude of professionalism became a self-serving ideal that advertising practitioners believed would make their business more profitable and respectable. The Associated Advertising Clubs of America played a crucial role in establishing advertising degree programs at major universities throughout the United States. By 1917, however, university instruction had not  produced the desired professional autonomy, and the social status of those in business had improved considerably. Consequently, the advertising business abandoned its quest for professional advertising education. Since that time, advertising instruction has developed largely as a combination of applied social science, common-sense craftsmanship, and professional aspiration. (Author/RL)",

An examination of the indexes of \"Public Opinion Quarterly,\"\"Journalism Quarterly,\" and the \"Journal of Communication\" through the mid-1960s indicates the evolution of the study of print media in the political process. Among the subjects given emphasis are media content and coverage, persuasion, news bias, newspaper influence on voters, and newspaper reporting of political public opinion polls. Other aspects of newspaper reporting that have been studied or proposed for study are the inadvertent altering of message content, gatekeeping (or news decision making), and the effectiveness of different media as information sources. A  great deal of research has dealt with the effects of print media coverage. Among the many communication techniques created over the years, generally by print journalists, that facilitate coverage of political activity, are the press conference, the journalistic interview, and the press briefing. Students of political communication must now turn more attention toward redefining political communication. They must examine the communication of political information outside the campaign context, the relationship between government and the media, and the role of politics in communication. (GT)",

Students can be taught to approach the personal essay as a special type of argument on a particular controversy to a significant audience. First emphasizing the importance of audience, defined as the specific opinion, attitude, or ignorance that a piece of prose attempts to affect or change, and then leading students to see what they have learned or how their attitudes have changed about a subject, composition teachers can help students define their own previous attitudes as the audience for their arguments. A course designed around a  sequence of assignments dealing with conflict progressively more external to the student might be managed in three phases: first, papers based on personal experience from which the student learned something significant; second, papers arguing with someone the student knows personally; and finally, papers based on readings in which the student argues with an unknown other, a professional writer or essayist. Such a course should enable students to make the connection between their own private experiences and issues significant to the society outside their private world. (AEA)",

        "author":["Hill, Paul T."],
        "description":"Evidence collected through comparison of compensatory education students' calendar year and school year gains implies that summer drop-off of basic skills is a common phenomenon. There are two possible interpretations of this finding. The first, \"forgetting,\" assumes compensatory education students know less in the fall than they did the previous spring. The \"no growth in summer\" interpretation assumes that the students do know as much in the fall as in the previous spring. The results of the National Institute of Education's Instructional Dimensions Study provide strong evidence in favor of the \"no growth in summer\" model. Students whose initial test scores were at or above the national norms make substantial gains during the summer, but compensatory education students do not.  Compensatory education programs are therefore doing some good and should be continued until effective alternatives can be found. Summer school programs might foster achievement gains during the summer months, but they do not attract many disadvantaged students and their programming is not focused on basic skills instruction. Public programs may be unable to overcome the problem of summer drop-off entirely. Further research into the summer drop-off phenomenon is needed to understand the limits of public policy and maximize the effectiveness of compensatory education programs. (Author/MK)",

Data was gathered through 10 years of monitoring television programs, analyzing characters, and conducting surveys of child and adult viewers. Trends in representation of women and minorities (nonwhites, Hispanics, young and old people), findings on role characterizations and occupations, a measure of violence as a demonstration of power, and associations between television exposure and viewer conceptions of social reality are discussed. Television drama is found to underrepresent women and minorities. Typecasting of women is seen to restrict ooportunities. Women and minorities are characterized as  more vulnerable than their majority counterparts and are more frequently depicted as victims of violence. A positive and statistically significant relationship was found between the time an individual spends watching television and the individual's stereotyping of the role of women and the aged. Younger viewers born into a television world are found to be more imbued with its depiction of people and less likely to express an independent view of reality.

        "description":"One hundred and seventy five adults were surveyed to collect data on attributes and attitudes related to poverty. The authors attempted to evaluate attributions outside a laboratory setting in order to collect data applicable to real-world settings, taking into consideration the complexities of modern society. The study was concerned with the relationship between abstract attribution processes and the meaningful real issues of social inequality. Two issues were considered: the determinants of attributions regarding inequality, and the role attributions play in mediating politically relevant attitudes. Factor analysis of responses revealed that attributions are largely determined by perceptions and other attitudes rather than by social position. Some ego-defensive attributions  were also relevant. Attributions were found to have important consequences for politically relevant attitudes and policy preferences. The authors conclude that while laboratory derived theories of attribution are applicable to real world settings, they must be supplemented by broader-based studies. (Author/MK)",

In the exchange theory perspective the student is viewed as a party in an exchange relationship with teachers and schools. The exchange relationship will continue as long as both parties see themselves as making a &quot;profit.&quot; The sample population studied was made up of secondary students from majority and minority groups in a southwestern community. Discriminant analysis was used to weigh the importance of a variety of factors, with an 84% correct prediction of dropouts achieved. The three most important determinants were found to be  student perception of occupational structure openness, perceived school racial discrimination, and the behavior and expectations of teachers. The author suggests alternatives to the present situation, including provision of enhanced motivational and community support for minority students and community demand that schools be held accountable for maintaining student motivation and attendance.

        "description":"This report analyzes teacher staff development programs and their costs in three large urban school districts, and discusses research and policy implications of the research results. The districts were selected through a survey of school districts serving the 75 largest U.S. cities, and were chosen because of their respectively high, medium, and low apparent level of staff development activity. The study revealed patterns of development activity and resource allocation that contradicted conventional wisdom on the subject. In all the districts, the actual costs of staff development were fifty times more than most district staff estimated. Further, the nature of staff development activity itself was not found to be primarily the result of conscious policy, but rather, had developed  in response to other factors, such as funding and teacher contract obligations. Another difference discovered among the districts was their use of substitute release time, stipends, sabbaticals, and salary increases for completion of educational courses as incentives for teachers to participate in staff development. One major conclusion drawn from this research is that the weak political position of staff development and the constraints operating on school districts make unlikely the imminent reform of actual staff development practice.

Ninety-two children were assigned to one of the following remedial approaches: a child focused school based, a child focused home based, a mother-child home based, a mother only home based. A no treatment control group was also included. Pre and post measures assessed the relative impact of these approaches on subjects' reading levels, maternal participation and maternal attitudes. Additionally, the predictive validity of three selection measures given to the undergraduate paraprofessionals who delivered the program was assessed. Results indicated that the home based programs were more successful in improving reading levels and maternal participation. No  significant differences were found between groups on maternal attitude measures. Comparisons between treatment conditions and the control group revealed that the control group increased significantly more on an achievement test subscale. One paraprofessional selection measure, the Group Assessment of Interpersonal Traits, was predictive of outcome. The implications of the overall design for model refinement were discussed.

Information provided includes the types of programs that have been implemented, the populations they serve, and the programs' costs. Data presented from a national survey as well as from individual State education agency reports suggest that Title I summer programs are neither widespread nor increasing in number. Information gathered from Wisconsin, Georgia, and Oregon, indicates that existing programs tend to be conducted at the elementary school level, are academically oriented, and run for approximately six weeks each. Staff and student attitudes are described as generally positive. In addition, a number of legal considerations particular to Title  I summer programs are discussed, including: (1) student eligibility and selection criteria; (2) the programs' geographical locations and reach; and (3) the absence of a normal State or local contribution to summer programs, which creates difficulties in applying the prohibitions of supplanting and other related rules. It is concluded that Title I summer programs generally provide as much or more instruction than school year programs at less cost per student. (Author/GC)",

        "description":"Because educational equity is a developing area, courts have little precedent to guide rulings. Extra-legal evidence may help in deciding what the law is. Social science evidence is also invited by the courts because educational equity law is purportedly an instrument of social change. The sophistication of social science research, as well as the qualifications of testifying experts, varies greatly. Some confusions about the role of social science in court cases may result from the fact that the bulk of expert testimony is contributed by educational practitioners drawing conclusions and making inferences rather than by social scientists testifying about their research findings. Social science has influenced the development of educational equity law by identifying and clarifying  important issues, by providing consensual factual information, and by instructing the courts on how to analyze the salient issues. Legal opinions often indicate that the courts have adopted the social science mode of reasoning and the findings that follow and have chosen one social science claim over another. Even when social science research merely corroborates a judge's priori preference, such evidence can still influence a decision. In some cases, social science may provide the court with the necessary intellectual justification for a decision that cannot be justified only on legal grounds. (Author/MK)",

In order to implement this policy, all segments of the community must be involved, including educational agencies and their governing boards, principals, teachers, counselors and support staff, curriculum administrators, librarians, post secondary institutions, parents, and students.

        "description":"This paper reports a study to determine national policy needs with respect to lifelong learning by focusing on state-level policy development, including the implications of federal policy; the arrangements for planning, coordination, and financing at the state level; the patterns created and the issues raised by these arrangements; and the alternatives for federal policy as it bears upon state activities. Section III (sections I and II are summary and introduction) reviews the federal programs in relation to their impact on states' programs. In reviewing state practices, section IV briefly notes patterns of learning opportunities supported by state appropriations. Section V describes effects on organizational patterns of existing arrangements at the state and federal levels for  the support of adult learning opportunities. Coordination, an important consequence, is discussed in section VI, and section VII provides a brief review of possible planning functions. Section VIII attempts to delineate the state issues that arise from the activities, policies, and arrangements discussed in previous sections. Section IV describes alternatives for future federal action in the promoting of lifelong learning. Concluding remarks emphasize the need for investigation, reflection, and participation to bring about effective decision making in developing federal lifelong learning policies. (Author/YLB)",

Focus is on lessons learned that will be useful for developing such programs. Chapters 1 and 2 discuss the background of the PLESA program and highlight the similarities and differences among the projects which improved their clients' English-speaking ability by providing English as a Second Language (ESL) training and in some cases offering occupational skills training and general education courses. Chapters 3-7 describe project planning and organization; client recruitment, selection, counseling, and training (English language and vocational); and job  development and placement. Each chapter follows a standard format including a summary introduction pointing out key lessons learned from the PLESA experience and sections dealing with program components. Each section has three parts: a description of approaches used, discussion of issues raised, and list of recommendations. Chapter 8 presents an assessment of the program and a discussion of implications for future programs and policies. Findings reported show that participant job placement was only 39% and job retention was not high; however, it was demonstrated that there is a need; special services are required; and prime sponsors can mount effective programs. The appendixes contain annotated bibliographies of instructional ESL materials and resources. (A report containing ten project  case studies is available separately. See Note.) (YLB)",

        "description":"The history of educational programming for the handicapped has unfortunately been one of quiet discrimination. This pattern has come from the evolution of an isolation-based society. Society is moving increasingly toward the human and equity-based treatment of disabled people. Reflecting some court decisions, the Education of the Handicapped Act (PL 94-142) requires school districts to redistribute their resources to provide appropriate public education to handicapped children. Although the federal government may help by putting in sufficient new dollar resources, it is primarily the problem of local and state governments. To participate in the federal program, PL 94-142 requires states to provide equal and individual education programs for handicapped students. This legislation  will impact on other programming, such as vocational education for handicapped junior and senior high school students. The impact of the resistance to encouraging the participation of handicapped children in vocational education is that handicapped young people comprised only 1.74 percent of the total vocational education population as of 1975. Research in vocational education should focus on the characteristics of people who may be successfully integrated into evaluating program outcomes, job design, and modifying existing programs. Program models for handicapped vocational education students should be validated and then disseminated.

A literature search found confusing definitions of lifelong learning, global implications of the concept, and little information about what the public needs and wants to support this view. The lifelong learning provisions of the Higher Education Amendments of 1976 concentrated on the adult population, yet the states vary tremendously in their commitment to adult learners. Special attention should be given to the 52 million adults who have not completed high school; educational alternatives for this group should be explored, especially those that might be offered by postsecondary institutions.  The lifelong learning cycle should start with the 16 million three- to sixteen-year-olds, then the 20 million adults who have less than an eighth grade education, then the others who are at poverty level, then the remainder who have less than a high school education, and finally those who are registered in schools and higher education institutions. All adult education programs should be coordinated, from adult basic through higher education, under one umbrella--Adult Basic and Continuing Education at the federal level. (MEK)",

Priscilla Elfrey, Transition Point I presenter (initial entry), discusses the importance of power, including competence, confidence, and connections, in helping women obtain, progress, and change their jobs and careers. Carol Eliason, Transition Point II presenter (re-entry), stresses the need for women re-entering the work world to validate life skills. Joan Humphries (Transition Point III) suggests counseling/career services, training programs,  educational and employment practices, and applied research activities to help women assess their career progression during this period of career advancement. To help women achieve upward mobility, Corrine Rieder, Transition Point IV presenter (job mobility), recommends two perspectives: an academic approach and a more personal experiential approach. Phillip Randall, Transition Point V presenter (pre- or post-employment), discusses the factors and events leading to post-retirement jobs and careers.

Development of new testing was continued by Temple University, The Pennsylvania State University, and University of Pittsburgh. Workshops for test developers were conducted to ensure standardization of the end product. Review of completed products and use of validation studies permitted improvement in individual tests. Statistical studies, using candidate testing results from the three universities, provided normative data that can be applied with greater reliability in establishing scoring parameters. Quality testing instruments were made available through centralized printing and distribution by National Occupational Competency  Testing Institute (NOCTI). The entire Pennsylvania test bank was transferred to NOCTI who would provide management, including printing and dissemination, storing, norm accumulation, revision, and update. Continuation of training of individual examiners through a centralized workshop activity ensured that standardization processes and practices were known to all examiners. Effort was placed on publicizing the program throughout the state. A national seminar of NOCTI member states (with twenty-two states represented) was hosted to facilitate sharing test review and development with other states.

        "description":"The purpose of the first year's work of a two-year project was to identify education and work program characteristics that are indicators of the normative (work-centered) and personalistic (person-centered) dimensions of eighteen experiential education programs and to determine common characteristics and whether programs can be classified based on resulting data. Procedures included interviews with program participants, coordinators, and on-site workplace personnel. Twelve major indicators of program type, indicating normative and personalistic dimensions, were isolated: (1) program goals, (2) nature of career growth; (3) self-concept development; (4) role of program staff; (5) interpretation and internalization; (6) focus of learning activities in work settings; (7) diversity of  work setting experiences; (8) duration of program experiences; (9) relationship of learners to ongoing work and workers; (10) method of supervision employed by resource person; (11) pay; and (12) academic credit. By calculating the proportional relationships of these dimensions, five program types were identified for the typology: normative; personalistic; and transactional: adaptive, reciprocal, and transitional.

        "description":"A study investigated the retention of mathematical and reading concepts of students enrolled in a learning-in-work environment (Experience-Based Career Education) and a traditional classroom learning environment on a measure of academic achievement using a twelve-month longitudinal design. The performance of twenty-seven students in each environment was evaluted using the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills, administered at the beginning and end of the junior year and at the beginning of the senior year. The learning interval was designated as the time between pre- and post-testing, and the retention interval as the time between post- and follow-up testing. The results indicated differences in both reading vs. math skills and in traditional vs. learning-in-work environments, with  the greatest amount of fluctuation being in the math scores of the two groups. While the groups were equivalent at the beginning of the year, the students in the traditional environment increased their math performance by the end of the year, while the learning-in-work students' math scores decreased during the same time period. The groups subsequently reversed this direction of change over the summer, with the traditional students' math scores showing a decrease, while the learning-in-work students showed an increase in math scores. An interference/assimilation model is proposed to interpret the findings. (Author/MEK)",

        "description":"Factors that influence the effectiveness of state and local units of the federal Work Incentive (WIN) program were examined to suggest ways to improve the program, which is designed to move recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) into productive jobs. Factors studied were organizational, managerial, and service delivery characteristics and also environmental factors, such as demographic and labor market conditions. Data collected over a two-year period from field research in forty-three local sites and ten states were analyzed to compare high and low performing programs. The main performance measures identified were number of job entries per staff, average job entry wage, retention rate, and average monthly welfare grant reduction. Socioeconomic environment  was found to significantly influence performance levels while political-bureaucratic environment was not shown to be associated with variations in performance. High performing state programs were managed differently than low performers, and high performing local units differ systematically from low performlng units in the way they were managed and delivered services to clients. Organizational structure of state programs appeared less important than other factors, but local characteristics were extensively shaped by those at the state level on such issues as program priorities, management behavior, and attitudes toward CETA. Recommendations are presented under the following topics: differentiating high from low performing programs, managerial recommendations, changes in service delivery  methods or emphases, and elements of a structured performance improvement program.

        "description":"Both the process and the antecedents of transfer (transfer of skill or knowledge from prior experiences to new ones) are considered by the authors, who suggest ways that teaching for transfer can be implemented. Three questions relating to transfer are considered: Is the capacity or ability to transfer attended to and developed in education and training programs? Can an individual's ability to transfer be developed and/or strengthened through planned learning experiences? and How do you teach for transfer? In an informal survey of forty teachers, the authors discovered that with the exception of adult education, teachers do not teach for transfer, but rather teach knowledge and skills which they assume the student will be able to transfer. The authors argue that while the  aforementioned is important, an essential purpose of education should be to teach for the maximum positive transfer of knowledge and skill information. They indicate that the ability to transfer such learning can be taught, but many educators seem to take the learning process for granted, assuming that the ability to apply previous learnings follows from in-class mastery. Providing practice beyond classroom mastery to application in varying contexts under differing conditions is stressed. (Sixteen practical suggestions for teaching for transfer, presented under awareness, sequencing, practice, and reinforcement are included.) (MEK)",

The federal government's strategy involves directing money to underserved populations; encouraging planning at all levels to produce more employable graduates; promoting research and demonstration of effective educational models; and establishing programs to employ and stimulate employment of youths and adults. The federal government discharges its responsibilities by supervising the state planning system, implementing the National Occupational Information Coordinating Committee, establishing state Research Coordinating Units, sponsoring research and demonstration activities through a contract with the National Center for Research in  Vocational Education, and administering the Youth Employment and Demonstration Projects Act. States must plan, develop, and disseminate occupational and career information, encourage innovative practices, and provide a general system of fiscal and program accountability. Local school districts must develop planning and working linkages with the community, provide feedback, and operate programs and delivery services. Three areas for improvement are cooperation among education providers, flexibility in programming, and involvement in occupational development. The scholar should evaluate, conduct research, assess the federal strategy, and redefine vocational education within the broad structure of education, training, and work. (YLB)",

By providing ideals to which existing conditions and objectives can be compared for evaluation purposes, the standards should help corrections personnel establish goals and develop guidelines for programs of occupational training. The standards are grouped into these five areas of program operations: curriculum and instruction (5), students (9), staff (5), organization and administration (11), and physical plant, equipment, and supplies (4). Standards for curriculum and instruction deal with program descriptions, objectives, and methods and procedures.  Orientation, placement, evaluation, and follow-up are included under standards related to students. Standards involving staff have to do with selection and preparation, salary, professional growth, business and industry involvement, and evaluation. Organization and administration standards deal with the staffs of advisory boards, committees, and administraton; financial policies; community relations; planning, research, and development; evaluation; and discrimination. Standards dealing with physical plant, equipment, and supplies relate to planning and safety and health conditions. Discussion follows each standard.

Developers state that women successfully completing this goal oriented probationary program do not go to trial and are given an opportunity to have their charges dismissed. Without the offender stigma, employment options  appear to increase, the rearrest rate is often reduced, and these women appear to have a better chance of becoming self-confident, self-supporting members of society.

        "description":"As part of a symposium on challenges and problems of adult education researchers in different settings, recent research activities at one private independent research organization were examined. Three projects of the American Instituties for Research (AIR) were reviewed, all relating to adult development and aging. The first examined career guidance for adults with an emphasis on women and minorities. It resulted in a catalog describing successful programs throughout the country and in a planning manual for such programs. The second, involving a series of studies to define and assess Quality of Life, indicated that learning and intellectual development is an important dimension of Quality of Life and that adult education can play an important role in the lives of older adults.  The third, on adult basic education needs, participation and persistence, was conducted as part of the Statistical Analysis Group in Education (SAGE) created by the National Center for Education Statistics. It was concluded that private research organizations provide the researcher with a great deal of flexibility for setting objectives and that research designs used in applied situations may be less rigorous than those used in basic research, with a trade off occurring between internal and external validity. Major limitations are lack of training for work in a private institution and the lack of security in research support. A major advantage is that multidisciplinary efforts and colleague interaction and collaboration are the norm. (JT)",

Materials, divided into two sections on state vocational and national programs, are presented in the same order that they appear in the act to provide easy access. These results are reported: an all-time high total enrollment, increased male and female enrollment in nontraditional vocational programs, increased enrollment of disadvantaged and minority students, nearly 2,250,000 program completers at all levels, and appropriations and expenditures for vocational education totaling over 5.6 billion dollars.  These other specific topics are emphasized: expansion of state advisory councils on vocational education for broader representation of business, labor, educational, and minority interests; states' assessment by Management Evaluation Review for Compliance Quality; implementation of displaced homemaker programs; and development and operation of a Vocational Education Data Reporting and Accounting System.

        "description":"An optimal vocational evaluation program is described which was provided as part of a treatment of vocational and school behaviors of 119 reluctant learners from twenty-two rural school districts. (The 60-hour vocational evaluation process involved out-of-school psychometric and work sample testing over a two-week period.) An alternative in-school variation of that program is suggested and the effects (generally positive) of the original program on learners are summarized. Three perspectives are discussed with respect to the use of vocational evaluation in rehabilitation and educational applications: as an information gathering process, as a client-reactive process, and a rehabilitative process. The central components of a variety of educational experiments are examined as  catalysts for increasing the relevancy of education and for effecting changes in behaviors of special needs students. Vocational evaluation is identified as a key catalyst for affecting the vocational development and school behaviors of the reluctant learners in the three-step Equal Career Opportunities Program (ECO): (1) in-school identification; (2) out-of-school vocational evaluation; and (3) in-school followthrough. In the alternative model which is suggested, vocational evaluation and career guidance are formally joined into a one- or two-semester course, the terminal objective being that students will establish realistic vocational plans and be provided with necessary school resources to attain these goals. The evaluation of the effects of vocational evaluation on the ECO students'  vocational development and school behaviors are summarized and presented as suggested minimum levels for the in-school model.

        "description":"A study based on supplementary questions in the October 1978 Current Population Survey revealed an improved job situation among U.S. youths both in and out of school, but it showed dropouts and those from low-income families at a distinct disadvantage. Overall, the number of employed youths (age 16-24) increased by 1.1 million from October 1977 to October 1978 although that segment of the population increased by less than 300,000. Most of the increase in the student labor force was accounted for by high school students. The large differences between the labor force participation rates of black and white youth (students and nonstudents) persisted or increased. The unemployment rate for dropouts was more than double that of high school graduates and three times that of college  graduates. Youths from lower income families were less likely to be in the labor force, and if in it, much more likely to be unemployed. Three-fourths of the report consists of tabular data on the employment status of youth (high school or college students, graduates, and dropouts) by sex, age, race, family income, occupation/industry, and duration of employment; on additional combinations of the above variables; on reasons unemployed youth were looking for work; and on youth of Hispanic origin. Methodology for the survey is described briefly. (JT)",

        "description":"Using an opinion questionnaire with students, parents, and school personnel and personal interviews with secondary students, a Kentucky research study examined the extent of sex bias in vocational programs, the factors contributing to the enrollment of nontraditional students, and the barriers or problems affecting the enrollment of nontraditional students in the state's vocational education programs. Additional objectives were (1) to determine the effects of socioeconomic status, attitudes toward education, and the culture of the geographic area upon enrollment in nontraditional programs, (2) to make basic recommendations for the elimination of existing stereotyping and bias, and (3) to compile a sex fair comprehensive bibliography of vocational education materials. Selected  conclusions include these: all respondents felt vocational teachers exhibited sex fair behavior; students and their parents are unsure as to how nontraditional students were treated by counselors; all groups except the principals were unsure as to whether principals saw the need to eliminate sex bias in the community; and students do not feel that they are adequately prepared for the possible problems and barriers a nontraditional job seeker may experience. Among the eight recommendations made are those supporting increased parental involvement, student orientation to legal rights relative to sex fairness in education, the development of a sex-fair standardized method of student selection for over-capacity vocational courses, and an interdisciplinary approach to encourage the enrollment  of nontraditional students. (The fourteen appendixes include survey instruments, summarized responses, and various forms and procedures used. The bibliography is available as a separate document--see Note.) (Author/MEK)",

New additions are brief sections on basic definitions and additional considerations of the significance of work. The first paper, on career education for minority and low income persons, states that career education for this segment of the population has been a matter of over-promise and under-delivery. Promises and problems are discussed as conceptual, process, and programmatic assumptions of career education. The second paper, on career education for gifted and talented persons, discusses special problems involved in program development, such as career decision making, the  development of talent, and work experience. In the third paper, on career education and the handicapped person, statistical predictions concerning under-employment and unemployment of handicapped high school graduates during the next four years are cited to emphasize the need for making career education opportunities available. These basic career education principles are stressed as particularly relevant for the handicapped: the right to choose from a wide range of personally meaningful work opportunities and emphasis on accomplishments and discovery of an individual's talents rather than limitations.

Chapter 3 reports on a series of questions designed to gauge the link between schooling and work. Findings on who got what kind of education, grades received, records of completion, and ways in which this postsecondary schooling was financed are presented in chapter 4. Chapter 5 is a study of the issues surrounding interruption of schooling after high school, withdrawal after commencing postsecondary programs,  and rates of completion. Chapter 6 reports findings with respect to occupational prestige and salary. Chapter 7 presents findings on private vocational schools, adult education, apprenticeships, and short courses, and assesses their importance to the respondents. In chapter 8, a number of individuals give their personal accounts of schooling and work on the basis of their priorities. The final chapter gives a set of statements regarding equality of educational opportunity in Ontario and presents a set of recommendations. The questionnaire is appended. (LRA)",

Analysis was based on key writings on consumer education and an examination of fifteen high school texts published between 1938 and 1978. Only a few topics--budgeting, savings and investment, life insurance, and housing--received extensive coverage in all texts examined. A second group of topics were included in most texts and received extensive coverage when included (food, clothing, autos and transportation, banking services, social insurance, consumer law, and taxes). A third group of topics included in almost all of the texts received coverage varying in adequacy and length (non-profit information services, government regulatory activity, and consumer role in  the American economy). Despite recognition of their importance, a fourth group of topics (health, education, recreation, provision of public services, consumer rights and responsibilities, consumer problems, and action to improve consumer protection) received even more variable treatment. Variations in inclusion and treatment of topics often appeared related to different disciplinary perspectives (home economics, social studies, business education). The content of consumer education has only partially responded to social and economic changes and new concerns such as inflation, working wives, product safety, and control of corporate power.

The issue of what image of the next 10 years is most appropriate for educators today can be examined metaphorically with differing visions of what education can become. By using a series of predictions and by consolidating forecasts from futures research, educators can image a set of likely developments in education's context over the next decade, including forecasts of economic, technological, demographic, cultural, and political change. Implications of these developments for educational equity and practice center on issues of educational finance, educational technology, disparity in educational settings, and retrenchment of traditional approaches to schooling. The responses educators can make  to these forecasts of the future and the visions they evoke suggest that the 1980s may be a time of marked educational innovation, not for ideological reasons, but because of financial necessity.

Concurrent with demands which have placed increased reliance on measurement and assessment have been criticisms of present testing practices. The effects of sociocultural and motivation variables on achievement patterns of 7,000 Illinois school children were investigated. Achievement, conceptualized as the students' sense of competence (evaluation anxiety and achievement attributions) and motivation goals, was assessed through the use of standardized testing instruments. Results indicated that: (1) sociocultural background directly affects motivation and performance; (2) motivational effects serve to reinforce or enhance the effects of sociocultural background on performance; and (3) both objective  performance and the interpretation of that performance affect motivation.

Social development, growing out of a social work tradition is referred to as the process of planning institutional change to bring about a better fit between human needs and social policies and programs. Several basic concepts are described as principles of futuristics, including imaging the future, creating the future, a long-term time perspective, an interest in values, a systems orientation,  and using futures methodologies to anticipate future demands. The way in which social development has adopted several of these futuristic concepts in developing a new approach to improving human services by choosing specific values is addressed by the following: (1) fulfillment of basic human needs; (2) human dignity; (3) equality of means; (4) participation; and (5) global awareness. A systems approach emphasizing macro-level changes in social service programs incorporated by SSD is also described. (Author)",

The basic research, involving data collections beginning with the class of 1975, took place in approximately 125 public and private high schools selected to provide an accurate cross section of seniors throughout the United States. Questionnaire results indicated that: (1) about 65% report illicit drug use at some time in their lives; (2) marihuana is the most widely used illicit drug; (3) use of alcohol and cigarettes is more  widespread than use of illicit drugs; (4) college-bound students have lower rates of illicit drug use; and (5) regional differences in 1978 were insignificant. Trends in drug use comparing the classes of 1975 through 1978 suggest there has been an appreciable rise in marihuana use and female cigarette smoking, and despite the decline in perceived harmfulness of most drugs (licit or illicit) there has been very little change over the past three years in levels of disapproval for most of them.

In a program at Michigan State University, youths referred to the project from the juvenile court are randomly assigned to undergraduates who are trained and supervised by project personnel or to a control group which receives treatment as usual. The standard 18-week intervention involves a combination of child advocacy and behavioral contracting. Results have been positive, but not conclusive. Project youth tend to have fewer and less serious police and court contacts and better school performance when compared to control youth. A major focus of the research has been to identify the conditions under which such a  diversion program can be successful. What is done with the adolescent after diversion appears to affect his/her potential re-involvement with the system. Variations in this, as well as other variables, e.g., where in the system the youth is diverted, who administers the diversion program, and the type of youth diverted, are likely to account for a wide variety of results found by diversion programs.

Four commonly used approaches for identifying needs are: (1) social indicators; (2) analysis of resources and patterns of use; (3) community surveys; and (4) group approaches. Rarely does a single approach provide all the information necessary to identify needs. An analytical framework should integrate need information with program constraints, and develop feasible alternative mental health solutions. Decision makers can then act on the recommended alternative solutions. Most decisions are made by selecting actions that are politically feasible and reflect marginal changes in the existing base of resources available to the center. (Author/MLT)",

This system must contain at least minimal data on client movement, services, staff activity, and costs. The monitoring process includes planning, monitoring, and assessment. Three areas discussed in this paper are the monitoring process, information systems and monitoring and using information systems. Issues addressed include organizational readiness, information system adequacy, integration of system elements, feedback, and the data processing mode (manual versus automated). Specific suggestions and practical examples are included. The  final section links information system reports with management in order to assist managers by providing data about program goals, fluctuations in demands for services, and staff productivity.

Three general measures of quality are: (1) input standards for staff and the setting providing care; (2) process standards for the quality of treatment; and (3) outcome standards for the results of care. Federal guidelines recommend that mental health centers model their quality assurance programs after the Professional Standards Review Organization's (PSRO) assessment method. However, PSRO activities evaluate physical health care, and they focus primarily on input measures of quailty. Contrarily, quality assurance programs in mental health centers focus on the treatment process. Clinical peer review is the  major monitoring tool, and only clinical personnel may conduct peer reviews and make quality assurance decisions. Although every mental health center's standards should reflect normative mental health standards, each center's standards should be flexible, meet local needs and be self-imposed. (Author/MLT)",

It aids clinicians and managers in planning programs and managing clinical services. A mental health center should establish goal-oriented program planning, information systems, and quality assurance programs before it attempts client outcome evaluation. Outcome studies are still in the developmental stages and should be conducted when there are clearly defined needs, available resources, and clinical and managerial agreement regarding the uses of the resultant data. Seven outcome evaluation methods are described and referenced: (1) level of functioning scales; (2)  multidimensional ratings; (3) SCL-90 Symptom Checklist; (4) goal attainment scaling; (5) client satisfaction follow-up questionnaire; (6) community satisfaction studies; and (7) consultation and education outcomes. Client outcome studies can be continuous and provide on-going feedback, or they can be terminal and provide information about a particular service or group of clients. These studies assist in forming policy, developing programs, and justifying programs. (Author/MLT)",

Their review process necessitates the development of adequate mental health standards and criteria and better communication between community mental health centers (CMHCs) and HSAs. The Arthur D. Little (ADL) study which sought to determine the feasibility of developing guidelines, criteria, and standards for PL 93-641, identifies few of the mental health standards and review criteria developed by HSAs. Because CMHCs face data demands from multiple sources, HSAs should coordinate their data needs with other major mental health planning  and review processes. The federal site visit process, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals survey, and state licensing and review boards also request data from CMHCs. HSAs could use the National Standards for their standards and criteria, an approach which would reduce overlapping and conflicting CMHC assessment and monitoring procedures. (Author/MLT)",

A sample of 27 third grade teachers and 31 sixth grade teachers were assigned to one of five success status categories based on the pattern of mean reading achievement levels recorded for their actual 1974, 1976, and 1978 classes. The teachers were administered the Survey of Teacher Emphases and Practices in Reading Instruction in 1978. Differences were noted between third and sixth grade instruction in  the use of skill books and teacher-made games and individual instruction. Interim findings for 1974 and 1976 indicated a linear pattern of continued emphases; effective teachers of reading reported signficantly different instruction and diagnosis emphases and noted significantly different pupil engaged time in reading instruction than did less effective teachers. However, the 1978 data for this pattern was reversed. Teachers identified as effective for the six-year period reported less emphasis for these components than did the less effective teachers.

The text analysis groups note that it is essential to develop tools not only for evaluating the difficulty level, but also for distinguishing challenging texts from confusing texts and for identifying sources of difficulty in given texts. The report discusses the groups' decision to analyze and collect a body of analyzed texts, with which to compare developing theories of text properties and their development of a system to annotate, store, and retrieve  analysis of texts. Their method of text analysis is divided into lexical analysis, syntactic analysis, text-level inference analysis, and an illustration and layout analysis.

        "description":"Content area teachers should be aware of the five levels of vocabulary with which their students must cope. The five levels include standard words at the least complex level, transitional terms that have different meanings in the content area than in standard usage, technical terms specific to the subject area, changeable terms (similar to transitional terms) whose meanings change even within the content area, and phrases appearing in adjective-noun structures yet conveying meaning only as a unit. These five types of vocabulary can be taught at three instructional levels: the specific level of rote memory, the functional level that involves paraphrasing, and the conceptual level that introduces categories and analogies. Research has shown that teachers using only exercises at the  specific level will inhibit vocabulary development beyond simple rote memory; so teachers need to vary instruction with specific, functional, and conceptual learning tasks in order to stimulate meaningful student vocabulary development. Teachers can also apply the levels of vocabulary and the criteria for vocabulary instruction as taxonomies for studying the readability of materials and for preparing, evaluating, and discussing instructional materials and objectives.

An analysis of two other research studies on this topic shows that results of this study support the results of a study by G. L. Cox and J. E. Swalm and contradict the results of a study by B. D. Smith. It is noted, however, that since Smith used the Nelson-Denny Reading Test to test gains from specific diagnosis, her findings are not necessarily valid  and not necessarily contradictory to those of the other two studies. The evidence in the literature indicating that the Nelson-Denny Reading Test is not an appropriate test for evaluating the reading ability of college students in developmental programs and that survey tests are often used inappropriately as measurements of achievement in college reading programs is discussed in the light of the findings from these research reports.

        "description":"A three-way mixed factorial design was used in a study of the ways good and poor readers used context in cloze tasks. Reading ability (good versus poor readers) and booklet format (sentence versus sentence fragment presentation) served as between-subject factors, while context (whole versus partial passage) served as a within-subject factor. Subjects were 78 fourth grade students whose reading achievement had been measured by the Stanford Achievement Test. All three main effects were found to be significant: good readers scored higher than poor readers; students with sentence booklets scored higher than those with sentence fragment booklets; and performance was better on whole passages than on partial passages. The results replicated findings by M. H. Neville and A. K. Pugh,  showing that good readers were better than poor readers at utilizing the context provided by complete passages. Good readers gained much more from the intrasentence context afforded by the sentence booklets than did the poor readers. Surprisingly, the results suggested that poor readers made better use of intersentence context than good readers. When semantically acceptable responses were scored, however, intersentence context produced significant, nearly equivalent gains for both good and poor readers. (RL)",

Posttest measures revealed that those who studied the sentences learned more about the syntactic/semantic identities of function words, whereas those who studied the lists remembered the orthographic identities of the words better and could pronounce the words faster and more accurately in isolation. The findings show that there are multiple aspects of printed words to be learned by beginning readers, and that the aspect that gets learned depends upon how the words are practiced. These results lend support to the theory of printed word learning in which  various identities of words become amalgamated in lexical memory as a consequence of reading experiences with the words.

In the first study, a prototype of the Inflected Endings Subtest was administered to 143 third and fourth grade children. The results indicated that most students had mastered all of the inflected endings assessed, with the exception of the possessive use of the apostrophe. In the second study, a prototype of the Affixes Test was administered to 275 fourth and fifth grade  children. The results indicated that while some of the affixes assessed in the test (un-, -ful, -less, for example) were fairly well known by the children, others (pre-, -ant/-ent, for example) were still not understood by a majority of the children. In general, performance on prefixes was significantly greater than performance on suffixes. Overall, girls significantly outperformed boys and fifth grade students achieved higher scores than did fourth grade students. (Author/FL)",

The children also made more correct selections when the referent of the metaphorical comparison was specifically denoted than when the identity of the referent had to be inferred.

        "description":"Although the nature of topicalization is complex and cannot be easily separated from considerations of syntactic structure and sentence focus, analysis of language usage has indicated that topicalization is more a stylistic than a syntactic process. Topicalization refers to moving a noun phrase (NP) into the initial position of a sentence. Examples of language use demonstrate that speakers and writers often use passive constructions as part of their rhetorical strategies because the passive allows movement of NPs into virtually any position within the sentence. The apparent ease with which NPs can be topicalized seems to have less to do with the distinctions between old and new information than with packaging the information so that it is processed and interpreted by the audience  in ways that favor the motivations of the speaker/writer. Even the syntactic configurations characteristic of \"objective\" prose enable simple transformations of NPs that systematically suppress agency, which is another way of manipulating audience response. What this evidence indicates is that syntactic rules exist because they favor certain descriptions of the world over others; thus, any attempt to construct a grammar based on \"case\" relations as somehow inherent in the construction of sentences is not only doomed to failure but abdicates the responsibility of discovering how sentences come to be produced and interpreted.

Some of the common problems were the lack of structured writing times, procrastination, and distractions. The writers who overcame their problems often needed help only to organize their writing tasks into discrete steps or to budget their time properly. Such case studies are theoretically and pedagogically useful to writing teachers, because they can show discrepancies between writers' perceptions of their effectiveness and their actual performances throughout their writing processes. When  teachers record naturalistic observations of writers at work, they invite self-evaluation by anxious writers to modify work habits and streamline the writing process. In this way, students' writing apprehensions decrease, and some of them learn to enjoy writing. (RL)",

        "description":"Because inexperienced or basic writers depend on the semantics of everyday spoken dialogue when writing, research on written composition and the developmental links between spoken and written language should be more accessible to the practitioners who teach writing to those students. A review of the literature supports the theory of a semantic connection between speaking and writing, and a tenth-grade writing sample demonstrates a dependence on the reader's familiarity with a particular sociocultural context for the writing's full semantic value. Teachers who work with unskilled writers should avoid correcting only surface forms and should give students the opportunity to talk through the context-bound aspects of their writing with concerned readers. The interaction of talk and  writing is essential to achieving competence for student writers who depend on the semantics of spoken language. (AEA)",

Poetry theater presentations require approximately five class periods to complete, allowing 45 minutes per class. The first class period should be devoted to choral reading. In this period, the class should be familiarized with the techniques of choral reading and then broken into groups of five or six students. Each group then creates a presentation of the same poem used with the entire class. The second class session should be devoted to the discussion of themes for a presentation, finding poems related to the theme chosen; selecting lines, phrases, or words from those poems to use in the  presentation; deciding on the final order of the poem to be presented; assigning specific lines to people in the group; determining appropriate movements and voice levels; and practicing. The third and fourth class sessions should involve refinement of the presentation, and the last session is the presentation itself. In addition to providing positive experiences with poetry, poetry theater gives students valuable group work experiences and helps them to become more creative. (FL)",

Entries in the first part of the book deal with teaching Shakespeare in secondary schools and in college, teaching Shakespeare as performance, and teaching Shakespeare with other authors. Entries in the second part deal with criticism of Shakespearean films. Discussions of the filming of Shakespeare and of teaching Shakespeare on film are followed by discussions of 26 feature films and then by entries dealing with Shakespearean performances on television. The third part of the book constitutes a guide to available media resources for the classroom. Entries are arranged in three categories: Shakespeare's life and times, Shakespeare's  theater, and Shakespeare's plays. Each category lists filmstrips, films, audio-cassette tapes, and transparencies. The general format of these entries gives the title, number of parts, grade level, number of frames or running time, whether color or black and white, producer, year of production, distributor, titles of parts, a brief description of content, and reviews.

While they should continue the reading and analysis of imaginative literature that they began in high school, they should also develop their latent powers in the other dimensions, especially listening and speaking, and should learn the basic techniques and subtleties of professional writing and reading as well. Exercises that combine as many of the four skills as possible have proven to be both well-liked by students and very efficient in increasing overall mastery of language skills. Two typical assignments--interviewing and abstracting--illustrate how the student is required to produce  coherent, useful communication using several skills in conjunction. Success of the pedagogy is shown by growth in syntactic maturity, organization, emphasis, documentation, and student confidence. (Author/FL)",

        "description":"Two underlying assumptions of the Cultural Indicators approach to television research were examined, using data on the television viewing habits of 76 second grade, 150 fifth grade, 509 eighth grade, and 350 eleventh grade students in Perth, Australia. The assumptions were that commercial television presented an organically composed total world of interrelated stories produced to the same set of market specifications, and that television audiences viewed largely nonselectively and by the clock rather than by the program. The evidence on selection and habit in television viewing countered a &quot;purely ritual&quot; overstatement of the Cultural Indicators assumption. Two of the three content types most related to social reality (crime adventure and cartoons) were quite predictable from  viewing habits. But habitual television watching itself did not account for all content-specific relationships, because viewing comedy and news programs related to other viewing habits without being related to beliefs about social reality. This evidence pointed to content differences (selection) as a key factor in television viewing even though habit could be considered an important antecedent to much of the viewing that produced the cultivation of a biased conception of the real world. Greater than average viewing times for cartoons and game shows were associated with perceiving the world as relatively mean and violent, while the reverse was true for drama and news viewing. (RL)",

It was found that such research could be grouped in four categories--lighting and color, staging, editing, and sound--and that these areas covered only a small portion of the compositional variables involved in the structure of television images. It was suggested that one reason for the slow development of empirical research on television composition was the inability of early media theorists to distinguish television from film in terms of scope and nature. Other possible explanations for the dearth of research on television composition are the complexity inherent in the control  and measurement of television's compositional factors and the lack of understanding of biometric research procedures, particularly in the areas of perception, neurology, and physiology.

Twenty-eight students at the City University of New York were assigned to one of the eight social situations derived from J. Fishman's construct of social situation, whicb provided the social context in which linguistic variation was examined. Language use within the context of conversation was examined with respect to J.

The findings suggested the  following: that language is used across a series of hierarchically arranged concentric contexts--those emphasizing a community's use of language and those emphasizing the individual's use of language; that the variables of each context can produce differing effects on language use depending on what level of the hierarchy language use is belng studied and how these variables interact with one another; and that variables that are associated with one context more than with another can in no way be excluded from influencing language in those contexts where they are not a dominating influence.

A survey of 150 law schools was designed to determine the communication skills and training necessary for competent performance in both law school and professional practice. Of the 84 responding schools, 81 schools provided usable data. The findings of the survey confirmed the contention that some aspects of communication training are viewed as highly relevant to the formal education of an attorney. The five communication topics considered most important were basic argumentation, listening, principles of persuasion, interviewing, and structuring messages and speeches. These topics are generally taught  in a variety of communication courses; but they are rarely applied to the legal setting in those classes, suggesting that the usual communication course may be inadequate preparation for prelaw students.

Data from a doctoral dissertation on black professional women's perceptions of their communication with black males suggested a strong influence of cultural conditioning on the participants' perceptions, goals, values, and communication strategies. Although most of these women had a positive image of the black male, they also indicated that the black male's ego was the primary cause of any communication problems. Although it was apparent that the black professional women faced unique communication problems in dyadic  relationships with black males, no concrete evidence emerged from the study to suggest that such communication barriers would lead to the deterioration of black male-female relations. Effective communication between the black male and the black professional woman will require developing new communication strategies and tactics by both parties. Extensive demographic data is considered a valuable means of revealing what communication problems and what strategies for dealing with communication problems result from various cultural backgrounds.

After two rounds of interviews with 112  persons, consensus was reached on 50 top leaders. The other method used was also a modified reputational process. The paper draws no conclusions, since additional work in progress is testing the efficacy of the processes. Observations are made, however, about the number of noneducators who are influential in educational decision-making, and the number of individuals originally tagged as second and third raters who move into the power structure.

Another purpose was to determine the cost of meeting a proposed standard for textbook availability, namely, that every student should be provided with copies of the texts he or she uses in all basic academic subjects. Data were gathered from two sources: a survey of teachers and administrators in a sample of 25 schools and an analysis of expenditures for textbooks and other instructional materials. Results showed that needs varied sharply by both grade level and subject matter, with the greatest needs found at the middle or junior high school level. The study also provides descriptive information on textbook usage for classroom and  out-of-classroom experiences as well as data on the need for supplementary materials. Extensive tables are included and the appendix offers an alternative cost analysis and a summary of findings. (Author/LD)",

Presented here are detailed statistics on the prevalence of drug use among American high school seniors in 1978 and on trends in those figures since 1975. Research involved annual data collection in approximately 125 public and private high schools across the U.S. Explored are students' attitudes about drug use, exposure to drug use, and perceptions about the availability of drugs. New subjects covered this year include the intensity and duration of the highs usually experienced with the various drugs and the cross-cohort comparisons of the rate of initiation into drug use. Also new this year are two figures in each drug chapter that deal with trends in drug use at earlier grade levels.  Finally, two new chapters have been added that deal with certain relevant aspects of the social milieu in which American teenagers find themselves. (Author)",

The findings and recommendations represent a distillation of the experience, ideas, and concerns of 25 cultural service organizations, 18 government agencies, and 27 cultural institutions, all of which are listed in the appendix. It was found that there are six energy-related issues that are relevant to all types of cultural institutions and groups in all parts of the country: (1) rising energy costs, (2) threats posed by energy shortages, (3) energy legislation and regulations,  (4) energy-related information and technical assistance, (5) alternate energy sources, and (6) energy-efficient architecture and design.

The principals and teachers from experimental schools participated in OD workshops, in a project-coordinating council for planning and policy, and in school goal-setting activities. The power of the principals and teachers became more equalized in experimental schools than in control schools. Teacher participation in decision-making was positively related to power equalization; teacher satisfaction with the administration was partially related to power equalization. Principals in schools where power equalization occurred tended to lose power during the intervention. By the end of the intervention, newcomers were comparable to  experienced teachers in power. The results support the view that OD can help reduce power differences in schools. (Author)",

Of this $4.00, $3.00 is spent on outcome or process evaluation, 60 cents on program planning/needs assessment, and 40 cents on dissemination/utilization. Findings are from an evaluation budget procedures survey of evaluation directors of 55 local education agencies (LEA) and 14 state education agencies (SEA). A majority recommended a 4-8 percent, sliding scale, program cost allocation for evaluation. LEA respondents judged evaluation more important to subsequent program operation than to program funding. Misunderstanding, high costs, political considerations, and poor quality evaluations lower the priority that educational leaders hold for evaluation. It is  recommended that evaluators spend more time communicating and encouraging use of evaluation findings. (Author)",

Declassified students are defined as those who cannot be considered as retarded when adaptive behavior criteria as well as intelligence criteria are used. Assessment is made by a diagnostic team consisting of a school psychologist and educational diagnostician. Tests are given in the areas of intellectual skills, personal adjustment, educational/learning skills, and perceptual motor skills. Adaptive behavior assessment is made using such instruments as the Vineland Social Maturity Scale, the Adaptive Behavior Inventory for Children, and the Texas Environmental Adaptation Measure (a parent interview). Adaptive behavior assessment  of 596 students in a 3 year period resulted in declassification of 45% of the students. Half of the declassified students appeared eligible for special education programs; for the remaining half few programs are available and new assessment procedures need to be developed which not only identify declassified children but which discern possible reasons for poor academic performance.

Among issues examined are the following: use of tests for purposes other than those for which they were intended; technical adequacy of currently used tests (standardization, reliability, validity); the use of deficit scores to identify the learning disabled; bias in assessment; bias following assessment; and assessment of abilities vs. assessment of skills. The questions of who is to test and who is to make decisions regarding placement are addressed. Six factors, including increased disillusionment on the part of classroom teachers with the kinds and quality of assessment and increased emphasis on the rights of children are seen to be bringing about  change. The importance of differentiating assessment, viewing tests as samples of behavior, and using technically adequate tests is underscored. (CL)",

Four label and behavior conditions were simulated and analyzed.

Results indicated that IQ was highly influential on obtained severe discrepancy levels (SDLs) and related percentage discrepancies; that CA acted more as a moderator than as a predictor of the SDL and percent discrepancy levels; and that high levels of error can be expected if the SDL is calculated without regard to its discrepant level and used as a placement or evaluation criterion against which to measure achievement differences.

An introductory section examines three research studies on interventions in the area of problem solving with the retarded learner and concludes, among other things, that mainstreaming has underscored the need for this population to have competent problem solving skills. The second section explores strategies and tactics, such as role strategies. Discovery type inductive strategies, especially the guided discovery strategy, in which the learner is provided some structure for the experience, are reviewed. The fourth section describes the logical inductive strategy, with emphasis on the three stages--mass, differentiation, and integration; and the five steps  that comprise the strategy--labeling, detailing, inferring, predicting/verifying, and generalizing. The final section discusses methods of implementing the stragegy and presents two simulated lessons and a chart illustrating the inductive problem solving sequence. (Author/PHR)",

        "description":"Despite some exceptions in recent years, most elementary foreign language texts continue to be organized in a typical \"twenty-five lesson\" format bound by an old-fashioned idea of continuity. It is argued that this format is a major source of student frustration and a barrier to optimum second language acquisition. As one possible alternative, an organization into a larger number of minimal increment units is proposed. These small increments would allow for greater refinements in sequencing, early maximizing of student communication potential, and easier assimilation of basic structural features with less interference from exceptions and peripheral complications. The implied perspective and curricular framework is foreign language instruction at the college level, but much of  what is said may also apply to instruction in the schools. (Authors)",

        "description":"A study was conducted of the Baie Sainte-Marie Acadian dialect, a particular form of the French language derived from the French spoken in France during the 16th and 17th centuries. The purpose of this study was to analyze and explain a certain number of morphosyntactic deviations from standard French, from both a synchronic and a diachronic perspective. The two questions of particular interest were: (1) the relative importance of the influence of the English and French systems, and (2) whether the deviations discovered were clearly and systematically structuring themselves. Four male and four female informants, representing two age groups (30 to 60 years of age, and over 60) recorded conversations with other Acadians. From the transcript, a corpus of 16,000 words was derived.  The analysis concentrated on verbal and prepositional syntagma. Analysis of the data showed that: (1) there was a close correlation between the number of years of schooling and the number of deviations from standard French, and (2) most of the deviations were archaisms going back to the first half of the 17th century. The conclusion was drawn that the Acadian dialect is more archaic than anglicized as far as the source of the deviations is concerned. While the question of the self-structuring of the deviations proved to be more difficult to answer, the data furnished several examples of systematic simplification of the verbal morphology. (AMH)",

The first essay outlines a methodology for phonetic correction designed for students who exhibit the ability and the desire to converse spontaneously and who have had some years of instruction in French. An outline is given for a dynamic and somewhat eclectic program that is considered appropriate for these students.  The second essay discusses the norm proposed for the pronunciation of the \"French R\" and the difficulties involved for speakers of English. It outlines a method that uses insights and techniques from traditional procedures as well as from on-going research.

        "description":"Book four, part two, of an intermediate-advanced level German refresher course for college students is presented. The volume consists of 25 lessons of text material and 50 prerecorded tapes. A typical lesson with its two accompanying tapes is made up of interrogation, military terminology drill, and a comprehension test. The materials of the first tape of each lesson are divided into four sections: interrogation for listening, interrogation for memorization, additional interrogation for listening, and military terminology drill. The interrogation for listening is a short exchange between an interrogator and a subject in a typical military situation. The interrogation for memorization is a repetition with an opportunity for students to repeat it on tape to facilitate memorization  of the material. The military terminology drill consists of a series of military terms, heard first in English and then in German. After students have completely memorized the dialogue they listen to improve pronunciation and to hear the intonation of native German speakers. After this there is an informal checkup by which students test their ability to perform each of the two roles on tape, in turn, from memory. (SW)",

        "description":"One English speaking child's phonological, semantic, and syntactical development from 15 to 21 months old is detailed in order to investigate the development of the mid vowel categories in English as reflected in spontaneous speech production. Prior research on this topic is summarized to reveal certain trends in the development of mid vowels. This study compared the child's four basic categories of vowels with the full range of an adult's in order to determine correspondences. Realization rules based on these correspondences were postulated. These rules accept adult surface forms as input and give the child's sound categories as output. These are shown to be functionally related. The pattern of mid vowel development from Stage I to Stage II suggests that these vowels can be  described by the term regression. It is concluded that phonological acquisition is characterized by an interaction of the inventive nature of the child and the inherent constraints on the phonological category system. (PMJ)",

        "description":"The expansion of higher education in the United States has resulted in a variety of outreach programs to bring postsecondary education off the campus and into the community. New systems and programs of nontraditional study have emerged. Issues of current concern in open learning include: quality and effectiveness, outreach and access, research and evaluation, economics (costs, benefits, productivity, and obtaining support), implications of emerging technology, public policy, and cooperation and collaboration. The trend toward lifelong learning brings with it new possibilities for educational technology and the mass media, as well as a challenge to postsecondary educators. It is noted that in the United States citizens get much of their information from the mass media, and that  harnessing this potential for learning is the great challenge for education in the near future. The experiences of six individuals with open learning programs are highlighted throughout. A list of references is included. Appended are basic data on seven participating projects (the Appalachian Education Satellite Program and Community Service Network, Coastline Community College, Dallas County Community College District, Empire State College, Miami-Dade Community College, Open College, the University of California at San Diego, and the University of Mid-America), a list of factors that help or impede learning projects, and an executive summary of the joint conference on research needs in adult learning in March 1979.

        "description":"The validity of prediction equations based on American College Testing (ACT) Program test scores and high school grades is investigated. Presented are separate results for prediction equations based on ACT scores only, on high school grades only, and on both kinds of prediction jointly. Also included is a discussion of the relationship between equations and the length of time they have been in use. The study is based on data collected from a random sample of 260 colleges participating in the ACT Research Services from 1972-73 to 1976-77. The accuracy of prediction equations based on the two variables was found to be quite stable over time. A similar stability was noted in the accuracy of grade predictions for males and females separately. Grade predictions based on ACT scores  only showed slightly greater stability over time than those based on grades only. It is concluded that despite the changes some colleges experience in student abilities, curricula, and grading practices over time, freshman grade averages can be accurately predicted using equations as old as four years. ACT policy is to update equations at least every three years. Data tables and statistical analyses are briefly discussed, and a brief list of references is included. (Author/MSE)",

The study defines medical market areas in the province and asks questions about the effect of the Quebec insurance plan on the distribution of physicians, the supply of physicians, how physicians organize their practices and the composition of physician output (possible changes in hours worked or availability of appointments), the use of physician services, and cost. Economic models and statistical techniques are used to examine complicated issues such as the significance of a fixed fee schedule for physician reimbursement which prevailed in Quebec during the beginning years of national health  insurance.

Research in the area of teacher evaluation is cited, and it is proposed that reviews of the literature on student evaluations indicate by and large that student ratings are reliable and valid, even though there is a large body of dissenting opinion. Students have obtained significant influence in evaluation of teaching effectiveness, and administrators are thought to be viewing student evaluation of teacher effectiveness as more reliable and valid than colleague evaluation or informal observation. There still remains the question of how feedback on teacher performance can be used constructively for teacher growth and improvement.  Evidence seems to support the notion that teacher morale has declined decidedly on many campuses. It is suggested that if inept methods of evaluation and accountability pressures cause poor morale of faculty members, there is a need for reanalysis of the issues. Clarification of whether evaluation of instructors is to improve teaching effectiveness or to determine who will be promoted or tenured is needed. Student ratings need to be carefully weighed in view of the complexity of the nature of the process. Until further research is accomplished to develop sophisticated and tested evaluation forms, current student evaluation should be kept in perspective. (SW)",

A detailed examination was conducted of 257 randomly selected cases pending review in the Appellate Division of the Internal Revenue Service and 281 court cases already decided. The tax rules and Treasury regulations were found to be confusing and difficult to apply. Determination of the tax status of educational grants and expenses depends upon the naming of precise factual and legal distinctions in fact situations that are essentially  comparable. The result is that taxpayers similarly situated are treated in a dissimilar manner. The General Accounting Office suggests a solution designed to: (1) simplify the tax rules applicable to educational grants and deductions, and (2) accord approximately equal tax treatment for persons in similar situations.

What in effect the new legislation does is to carry forward the 1202 functions, to reinforce further the recognition of the federal interest in comprehensive statewide planning, but to leave the matter of structure and means of accomplishing educational objectives to states, their legislatively authorized higher education boards or agencies, and to institutions. One of the changes related to the 1202 Commissions or the 1202 functions of state higher education agencies is an increase in  the scope of statewide planning. A second change is the number of states in which responsibility for administration of Title I has been assigned to the principal state agency responsible for coordination or governance of higher education in spite of the fact that the federal legislation does not mandate such consolidation.

On the assumption that the hypothesis was correct, the project also sought to define functional specifications for such an integrated system of audiovisual resources. The findings stipulate differences between nonprint and print media and their relative reduction to control; present  the state of efforts to achieve standards; note the need for mutual cooperation and coordination of audiovisual resources; describe current barriers to a national network; and indicate the existence of essential network elements. Recommendations include the establishment of international liaison, promotion of established cataloging standards, further development of networking study proposals, the expansion of computerized control of audiovisual resources, the utilization of shared cataloging and vendor supplied descriptions, and the dissemination of information concerning current networking activities, their coverage, services, and use.

Extensive descriptions of the experiences and reactions of teachers and students in the classroom as the demonstration developed form the major part of this report. Because of teacher self-selection into the PLATO treatments, this was not a randomized experiment, but rather a naturalistic study in which comparisons could be made; however a multiplicity of plausible explanations could be offered for differences in outcomes between PLATO and non-PLATO groups, and among classes taught by different teachers. Six case studies, based  on observation, interviews, and teacher logs, document the problems of implementation, but also capture teachers' assessments of this developing technology. Demonstration year achievement and attitude outcomes for reading and mathematics are also included, as well as major findings. (RAO)",

        "description":"A review of the first 23 volumes of &quot;AV Communication Review&quot; identified 68 theoretical and experimental articles on the effects of media on student learning attitudes. Examination of these articles revealed that (1) researchers do not routinely evaluate the impact of mediated instruction on learner affect toward either the medium or the content information; (2) in most studies where attitudes were measured it was generally a post-hoc evaluation of peripheral importance to the main objectives of the study; (3) locally constructed measures of attitude were most often used, and few studies provided validity or reliability information for attitude measures; and (4) attitude change as a result of the use of media has not been a major area of research effort. Within the framework of  the above limitations, it was concluded that less abstract forms of media seem to provide the greatest likelihood of positive learner attitude formation; there is insufficient evidence to determine if there is an age-medium-attitude interaction; and achievement seems to be related to attitude. An annotated listing of the articles is provided, and several tables and figures are attached, as well as a list of additional references. (CMV)",

Telephone interviews were completed with 600 individuals, comprising a representative sample of the school's district. Major findings indicate that while 94% of the respondents had heard of SAC and 40% reported that they or someone in their household had attended SAC, 31% did not know that tuition was free and 38% did not recall having received a class schedule in the mail. SAC was rated as doing a very good job in serving the community's needs by 53% of the respondents, but 26% did  not feel familiar enough with the college to rate it. Respondents rated vocational education, transfer education, and personal interest education as the most important community college functions, and rated providing basic skills education and financial aid as \"not very important.\" Over half (58%) said that they or a household member would be interested in taking classes at SAC; arts, crafts, business, and English courses were requested most frequently. Classes which meet once a week for three hours on week days in the mornings or evenings were felt to be most convenient. The 26-item interview guide is included in the survey report. (Author/JP)",

        "description":"Despite some initial hesitancy in the first half of the twentieth century to award associate degrees, since the end of World War II, the associate degree has become as widely accepted by two-year colleges as the baccalaureate degree is by four-year colleges. This is evidenced by the steady increase in the number of associate degrees awarded annually, the eagerness displayed by educators in the various disciplines to have degrees with their specialties attached, and the trend toward making a particular degree the criterion for transferability and occupational competency. The acceptance of the associate degree is also reflected in the various regulations governing the number, purposes, and standards for the degree. Furthermore, when allowances are made for the large number of  part-time students attending two-year colleges and the high risk of the open door policy, the number of associate degree graduates is indeed significant. Thus, despite arguments for community-oriented, non-traditional education, the associate degree program remains a significant community college offering. This literature review provides a historical outline of the use of the associate degree since 1900, a discussion of the requirements for the most common associate degrees awarded, and statistical data on the number of degrees awarded between 1970 and 1976.

Survey data, augmented by information from student records and the results of a statewide longitudinal study, indicated that women students were more likely to be under 30 years of age, non-white, and have  a lower annual income than community women. While 95% of the community members had heard of SAC, and 77% felt that the college was doing a good job, 71.1% had never taken a class at SAC. SAC students were familiar with most of the college's student services, and 83% also rated SAC as &quot;good.&quot; All services, except financial aid, were evaluated favorably by most of those who had used them. With regard to scheduling preferences, community residents favored morning or evening classes in three-hour time blocks.

        "description":"The three papers included in this symposium discuss the relevance of Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development to the early childhood practitioner. First, an overview of Piaget's theory is presented. This focusses on the particular aspects of the theory most relevant to practitioners in early childhood education. Second, curriculum implementation is examined. Piaget's ideas are applied to the traditional child-centered curriculum through a discussion of six steps which guide what the teacher does with children during the day: (1) anticipation, (2) analysis, (3) arrangement, (4) attention, (5) articulation, and (6) assessment of activities. Third, Piaget's contributions to understanding children's socioemotional development are examined. Ways to determine appropriate goals for  socioemotional development and the means for reaching these goals are discussed. (Author/RH)",

The current paper is a synopsis of parts of this project. The paper summarizes the following: (1) the applied research methods used to generate the data-base for the new planning and design guidelines; (2) key findings in the areas of policy, planning, and architecture for both child care facilities and outdoor play areas; and (3) example design applications of the new patterns and criteria for the design of prototypical new facilities, renovations of existing facilities, and adaptive  reuse of older buildings. The two design guides described in this paper represent a humanistic approach to architecture based on an examination of children's needs and the role of the physical environment in child development and experience. They are based on recent research in child development, environment and behavior, and architecture. The work also incorporates ideas on child care facilities and play settings from around the world. Most of the information in these documents, while generated for specific application in family housing areas on U.S. military installations, is considered generalizable to child care facilities and outdoor play environments for children.

The PEC was designed to serve the needs of practitioners, professionals and researchers in the field of parent education and to provide them with up-to-date information on parent education materials, programs and resources. PEC objectives focused on (1) providing training and technical assistance; (2) materials revision, placement, monitoring and evaluation of use; (3) identification and cataloging of new materials, disseminating parenting materials information and selling parent education products; (5) conducting workshops, planning for increasing networking among parent education providers, and writing conference reports; (6) conducting a  follow-up impact study of training materials on parents' child rearing beliefs and behaviors, formulating policy recommendations and topics for further research; and (7) conducting a publishers' alert and providing materials for publishers. The ethnographic follow-up study produced a number of findings related to an understanding of the following: the impact and implementation of parent education workshops, the role of parenting models and ethnic differences in facilitating changes in parents, and parents who were abused as children. Case examples, coding sheets, a description of the implementation of parent training packages at each site, and range of effects data are appended. (Author/RH)",

Kindergarten children and first-, fifth- and sixth-grade students were shown pictures that could be divided into four sets. Within each set the pictures were similar in color, depicted action, and category label. Adult-instructed children were shown the pictures one at a time. The adult named the pictures and the child repeated the name. Pictures were placed in rowed arrays containing common set attributes and the adults explained how items in the set were similar. Self-instructed children were told to \"pretend to be a toy store manager\" and \"put things together that are alike....\" Children then  studied the groups they had formed. After the pictures were removed each child was given three retrieval cue tests asking for recall of items by color, action and category label. Results indicate that young children who were instructed by an adult did as well as adult-instructed older children, but young children left to devise their own strategy did less well than older children who devised a strategy. Adult-instructed first graders remembered more than self-instructed first graders did. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"This study examines the relationship between several teacher attitudes and students' perceptions of the teaching milieu. To assess these relationships, measures of teachers' attitudes, teachers' perceptions of their own teaching and children's evaluations of the instruction were used. Five instruments were used to measure the attitudes of 42 first, second and third grades teachers: The F-Scale (anti-democratic tendencies), the Attitudes Towards the Freedom of Children Scale, the Teaching Self-Concept Scale, the Affect Towards Teaching Scale, and the Perception of Causation Scale (locus of control). The students sample included 378 first graders, 405 second graders, and 365 third graders. Each student was administered the Student Evaluation of Teaching II (Set II). Full results  were obtained from 23 of the 42 teachers. Analysis of these results show the following: (1) teachers' perceptions of causation, their affect towards teaching, their attitude towards the freedom of children and their anti-democratic tendencies (F-Scale scores) were all in a direction consistent with expected scores. That is, the more responsibility teachers assume for the learning of their students, the more they like teaching, the more freedom they feel children should have and the more democratic their values tend to be. (2) All of the above measures were found to be inversely related to the self-concept measure. That is, the more confident teachers (high teaching self-concept) felt less responsibility, liked teaching less, felt more restrictive in regard to children's freedom and tended  to be more authoritarian. (3) The grade level at which a teacher teaches (within this narrow range) had little effect upon student's ratings of the teacher. In regard to years of teaching experience, again there is little difference between the groups. (4) Male students consistently rated their teachers more positively than did the female students.

Present diversity among educators of young children is viewed against the historical background of variety in the implementation of kindergartens and nursery schools in the United States. The effects of federal legislation in increasing the varied purposes of early childhood programs are discussed. It is determined that kinds of services, clients served, program purposes and underlying educational ideas do not provide a unifying theme for the field of early childhood education. In conclusion, three claims are made: 1) that individual practitioners become familiar with a small area of the field and recognize that their insight contributes to  the field as a whole; 2) that future developments will indicate which elements of the present diversity are most beneficial; and 3) that the field is unified because early childhood educators as a group hold and use a common belief system with shared values, definitions, concepts and slogans.

Subjects were asked to recall the words, to identify the presentation modality of each word on a recognition test, and to indicate on a 3-point rating scale how confident they were that each of their modality identifications (MI) was correct. Results show that there were no overall developmental changes in the identification of modality while children as well as adults demonstrated the ability to judge the accuracy of their modality identifications, adults not only recalled more words than children but also were the only group to  organize their recall by representation modality. Findings suggest that information about the input mode of an event is a part of long-term mnemonic code for both adults and young children and that such information may be coded \"automatically\" in all age groups.

The study utilized data from the Social Security Administration's continuous work history sample for 1965-70 and 1970-75. A dramatic reversal of migration occurred in the periods examined: between 1965-70 the Appalachian Region had a net loss from migration of 400,000 people; between 1970-75 the region had a net growth of 810,000 people with 300,000 migrating into the area. Outmigration dropped from 1.6 million in 1965-70 to 1.4 million  in 1970-75. Apparently economic gains within the region during the second time period made outmigration less desirable. For both periods males had the highest inmigration and outmigration ratios. Outmigration seemed to produce favorable results, for most of the migrants made significant income and status gains relative to those who remained in Appalachia, with earnings in the destination regions rising rather quickly to the average of the new area. Evidence indicated that Appalachian migrants have received the health, education, and other services that enable them to compete successfully in their new settings. (DS)",

Minimum standards for the boarding school are outlined,  including those for furniture, equipment, and desirable qualities for sleeping quarters, living rooms, rumpus areas, and kitchens. The section on student activities seeks to develop an understanding of the functions of a student activities program and to indicate ways of concentrating and coordinating efforts. It discusses the operational philosophy of such programs and suggests total school cooperation in such activities as clubs, student government, intra-mural activities, trips, arts and crafts, and social activities.

The project has found that, although nearly a decade has elapsed since the mandatory creation of Title I Parent Advisory Councils (PAC's), in most of the rural south such councils are still struggling for legitimacy and role definition. Some schools have created &quot;paper PAC's&quot; which seldom, if ever, function. Other districts have limited the scope of meetings to such activities as open houses,  style shows, or classes to train parents to help their children with school work. Many schools appeared unwilling to provide the information and training necessary for parents to serve effectively on the councils. In spite of the generally negative experiences encountered, the SEPEP staff did find school officials and parents whose attitudes contributed to successful implementation of PAC's. Factors contributing to such success were: (1) a clear message from the school of &quot;we want your support,&quot; (2) regular monthly meetings devoted to legitimate concerns, (3) efforts to educate parents about the program, and (4) attitudes of state and federal officials charged with enforcing Title I laws. Eleven recommendations for improving PAC implementation conclude this paper. (DS)",

        "author":["Hull, Ray"],
        "description":"On-site interviews with administrators and teachers in 35 small, rural secondary schools in Oregon indicated that quality education was being provided to their students, despite the limitations of low budgets and small staff and student bodies. The study found that to provide the curriculum diversity that would meet the special needs of their students, small schools were manipulating a variety of components. These components included required and elective curricula, scheduling, use of independent and individualized learning and special programs for exceptional students, career and vocational programs, activity programs, community resources and flexibility in graduation requirements. The study suggests that the greatest strength of the small school is the provision of an  environment that supports and enhances individual relationships between and among all those concerned with the small school educational process. This report examines some of the specific ways in which the small schools were dealing with the problem of meeting individual student needs within the context of a limited program. Because they represent the problem areas most commonly addressed by small secondary schools, seven topics are given particular attention. These topics include: (1) curriculum, (2) scheduling, (3) independent/individualized learning, (4) exceptional students, (5) career/vocational training, (6) school activities, and (7) the school-community relationship.

        "description":"A person with a synthesized multicultural identity is one that holds positive attitudes toward Chicano and Anglo cultures, functions competently in both cultures, feels accepted by members of both cultures, and possesses a transcendent philosophy of life and world view. Although societal institutions have historically stressed assimilation to the mainstream American middle class, a different philosophy has begun to emerge. Cultural pluralism, or &quot;cultural democracy&quot;, permits the individual to retain identification with his own culture as he identifies with other cultures in American society. Individuals comfortable with a number of cultures are particularly needed as leaders today. Research with bicultural Mexican Americans in California and Texas has shown such people to possess  flexibility in learning styles, human relational styles and incentive-motivational styles. A study on the leadership behaviors exhibited by monocultural and multicultural college students in mixed ethnic groups under conditions of conflict indicated leaders with high multicultural experience to be particularly effective. Such individuals were less autocratic and more democratic than their low multicultural experience counterparts. They also were more accurate in reporting what had actually transpired in their groups and accepted more readily the responsibility for their group's action. This document also describes the development of the Flexibility, Unity and Expansion Model of Acculturation and an instrument for assessing multiculturalism in Mexican Americans. (DS)",

The establishment of Indian centers offering such services as health clinics, drug and alcohol programs, GED courses, birth control clinics, baby clinics, language classes, day care centers, recreation programs, cultural activities, housing and job assistance is one method Indian people have utilized to help themselves. Educational services including tutoring programs, counseling, and textbook review committees have been provided by some community centers  to supplement school district programs in an effort to more adequately prepare students for participation in the dominant society while allowing them to maintain their Indian identity. Community centers can also help urban Indians maintain their culture by providing facilities for the display of Indian arts and crafts. Each center is unique, but they all offer Indians, many of whom are new to the urban setting, a place where they can relax, stabilize, and feel the security of meeting other Indian people who have similar problems and needs. These centers may be funded through HEW (Indian monies), philanthropists, community education monies, or any number of sources. (NEC)",

Their labor force participation rose 4.5% between 1973 and 1978, when they comprised 41% of the total nonmetropolitan labor force. Although women accounted for 89% of nonmetropolitan employment growth in the 1960's and 58% in the 1970's, their mean earnings declined. A greater percentage than before of nonmetropolitan women entered professional, technical, managerial, clerical, craft, and service sector occupations while fewer entered operative occupations, a former source of great employment gain for the nonmetropolitan female population. Educational level correlated positively with occupational choice and both factors together had implications for job stability. The three main  factors which influenced the decisions of rural women to enter the work force are: economic considerations (resulting from inflation); changing family structure and social attitudes (the largest net increase in nonmetropolitan female labor force participation rates occurred for ages 25-34, prime childbearing years); and more job opportunities (resulting from the decentralization of manufacturing to rural areas).

        "description":"Studies show that 9 out of 10 migrant students do not complete their high school education. To identify the factors contributing to this high dropout rate, 350 migrant youths were surveyed to assess what they viewed as \"good\" programs and why they had dropped out of school. Most respondents noted some sort of sports activity as what they liked best about high school and academic classes as what they liked least. Programs of greatest interest were those offering job/career training. Reasons for dropping out were usually related to the need to work and family concerns. These and other study results are discussed at length in the first section of this document. Interviews with migrant students and excerpts from their letters and articles shed further light on the young people's  experiences with secondary education. The second portion of the document describes nine exemplary programs for secondary level migrant students which offer such special services as financial and supportive college assistance, \"hands on\" work experience, vocational training, learn and earn incentives, and credit exchange between schools. Conclusions from the survey and review of the already existing programs list such needs as transfer of academic credit, stipended work experience, counseling and career education, and financial assistance for college, as well as trade school.

Of the 34-35 million rural women, a large percentage are plagued by poverty and lack of opportunity for education, employment, health care, and various social services. Rural people, who constitute one third of this country's people, also make up half of the nation's impoverished. While a greater number of rural women are now employed outside the family, they tend to be employed in low-paying clerical, service, and seasonal positions. For women who are ethnic minorities, aged, single head of households, or displaced housewives, the isolation of rural life adds an additional burden. This paper recognizes the urgent  educational needs of rural women; summarizes research and statistical findings on rural women in the areas of education, income, employment, and values orientation; points out some cultural conflicts and dilemmas that may occur as a result of short-sighted, fragmented, and hastily implemented educational programs; presents a global perspective of the education of rural women which calls for social and policy changes and is multidimensional, grassroots based, and oriented to the culture and people of rural America; and delineates the needs for research, for regional rural centers, and for federal support in rural women's education.

This report describes the methods and procedures used in that study and presents a variety of findings. First, the project demonstrates that it is feasible to carry out this type of large scale research, including the reliable measurement of student attitudes about energy conservation. Second, the results show that both workshops and individual consultations were successful in influencing teachers to include energy conservation instruction in their classes. Finally, the findings concerning impact on student attitudes  and self-reported behaviors are mixed but encouraging. These results are presented: preliminary conclusions are drawn; and the necessity for further research is discussed. (Author/RE)",

The investigators sought to identify and classify the difficulties students had, and they tried to guess the mechanism which produced those difficulties. They compared the work of successful and unsuccessful solvers, looking for ideas that might help make more solvers be successful, and they tried to identify what must be learned by the student of equation solving. The discussion of findings includes: identification of three types of errors, and sections devoted to kinds of knowledge in algebra, meaning in algebra,  errors and the psychology of skill, and characteristics of good solvers.

Each set of data was separated according to sex. Data indicate that many discrepancies exist between the mathematics program that students complete and what they actually should complete to insure successful entrance into college programs. Furthermore, they demonstrate that females take fewer mathematics courses, and their poorer preparation severely limits their occupational choices.

        "description":"This teacher's guide contains a unit of study for teaching about energy in grades four, five, and six. The guide is self-contained and includes the fact sheets students need to work out the activity problems. The unit is organized around the theme of the domed athletic stadium. The students begin by surveying the energy it takes to travel from their homes to the stadium and to operate all the machines that heat, cool, and light the huge arena. These energy users are then related to the sources from which the energy is refined or processed. After students discover the great variety of direct uses of energy and the growth in the demand for more fossil fuel based power, they turn to a study of different indirect uses of oil for which the plastics industry serves as an example.  Artificial turf provides the organizer for this section as students study the processing steps involved in making it. The impact of the gap between U.S. consumption and production of oil and natural gas is explored in a puzzle-like activity which provides students with data and requires that they make personal decisions about conserving our increasingly limited supplies of oil and natural gas. In a concluding unit, students use a set of fact sheets on three alternative energy sources for the future and are asked to make a decision about using high-cost fuel to heat a stadium. Teacher background information on energy is also included in the guide. (Author/RM)",

The guide is self-contained and includes the handouts students need to work out the activity problems. The unit is developed around the concepts of shortage, scarcity, tradeoffs, investment, and decision making. Students develop these concepts by examining data from both the social sciences and the natural sciences. By participating in several decision-making activities students develop participatory skills as well as an understanding of the problems involved in energy decisions. The activities in which students are involved are many and varied and include using the newspaper headlines to identify effects of a fuel shortage, using graphs and cartoons to define scarcity, and  studying the appeals in advertising slogans to identify some of the ways attitudes are formed toward or away from conservation. The packet is divided into four units each of which contains two or three lessons. It is designed to last approximately two weeks. The unit can be extended if the teacher chooses some of the optional decision-making or research activities. Teacher background information on energy is also provided in the guide. (Author/RM)",

        "author":["Kriesberg, Louis"],
        "description":"This paper examines noncoercion in international struggles, reviews instances in which positive inducements were combined with or used instead of coercion, and analyzes conditions affecting the utilization and effectiveness of noncoercive means in conducting international relations. Coercion refers to actual and threatened violent and nonviolent negative sanctions including use of military force, threat of bombings, and economic boycotts. Noncoercion is interpreted to include persuasion (one party's efforts to convince an adversary to accede to its requests) and reward (positive sanctions and/or offers to the adversary of something it values and accepts in anticipation of a reciprocating concession). Examples of noncoercion in international struggles include negotiations between  Israel and Egypt following President Sadat's visit to Jerusalem in 1977, the Nuclear Test Ban Agreement in 1963, and withdrawal of the Soviets from Austria in 1958. These instances were all part of larger conflicts beset with escalations, de-escalations, violence, negotiated agreements, and continuing tensions. The conclusion is that noncoercive means will be more effective in solving international struggles if all adversaries act on the assumption that even the most bitter enemies have some common interests, coercive alternatives are too costly, noncoercive inducements must be attractive and realistic, and the motives, interests and perceptions of all negotiators are of paramount importance.

        "description":"This paper describes and evaluates a political skills course for college students. Course objectives include teaching students to do the following: organize and run a meeting; bargain effectively; communicate within and between groups; manage a crisis; organize a political coalition; be aware of personal stress and some of the ways to reduce it; understand the substance of a number of current political issues; and learn about the dynamics of political conflict and cooperation. An attitude survey given to students at the beginning of the course revealed that the students were optimistic and positive about themselves and strongly felt that they would benefit and learn from the course. The major teaching method used in the course was simulations and gaming. Students were involved in  many role-playing situations including values clarification and collective-bargaining exercises. In parts of the course students were confronted with a crisis situation, such as a Soviet laser attack of an American missile test flight, and had to make decisions under conditions of stress. On both the standardized and open-ended evaluations, students gave the course a very positive evaluation. On the standardized evaluation, a three item scale designed to measure student perceived learning was ranked consistently at the top or above University-wide norms (25th to 75th percentile range). In the voluntary, open-ended written evaluation, 78% of those who wrote evaluations explicitly made positive comments about the course. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"The paper presents an overview of developments within the discipline of psychology from the early 19th century until the 1980s. Emphasis is placed on differences between Soviet and American schools of psychology teaching and research and on the possible role of Western European psychologists in bridging the gap between these divergent approaches. Major differences between America and Soviet approaches to psychology include that American psychologists stress behaviorism (study of behavior instead of mental states) and cognitive psychology (an information processing approach), whereas Soviet psychologists base their work on a Marxist philosophical framework (as in the work of Vygotsky during the 1920s) and on an action-oriented approach (actions are the main objects of study and  are viewed in light of their relationship to the pursuit of an individual's goals). Until recently, the American processing approach and the East European action-oriented approach have developed almost entirely independently of each other. It is suggested that because Western European psychologists are familiar with both approaches, they can facilitate a more open exchange of ideas between Soviet and American psychologists and can help American psychologists benefit from the positive aspects of Soviet psychology including use and application of systematic teaching experiments and development of more sophisticated techniques of qualitative diagnosis.

This publication is the report of that Commission which consisted of 34 members including survivors, lay and religious leaders of all faiths, historians, scholars, and congressmen. The Holocaust was a crime unique in the annals of human history, different not only in the quantity of violence--the sheer numbers killed--but in its manner and purpose as a mass criminal enterprise organized by the state against defenseless civilian populations. Remembering the Holocaust can instill caution, fortify restraint, and protect against future evil  or indifference. The Commission made recommendations for memorials. First, a National Holocaust Memorial Museum which will present the Holocaust through pictorial accounts, films, and other visual exhibits shall be built in Washington D.C. Secondly, an Educational Foundation dedicated to the pursuit of educational work through grants, extension services, joint projects, research, and exploration of issues raised by the Holocaust shall be founded. Thirdly, the Commission recommends that a Committee on Conscience composed of distinguished moral leaders in America be appointed. This Committee would receive reports of genocide anywhere in the world. Additional recommendations included observance of &quot;Days of Remembrance,&quot; ratification of the Genocide Convention, prosecution of Nazi war  criminals in America, and the maintenance of Jewish cemeteries abroad.

Pocahontas, poet Anne Bradstreet, and religious dissenter Anne Hutchison are discussed. The plight of female indentured servants and black slaves is portrayed through writings and advertisements from that period. Chapter II covers women, family, and home in colonial times. The lives of black, white, and Native American women are contrasted. Chapter III focuses on colonial occupations of women. Diary excerpts depict lives of female  shopkeepers, plantation managers, printers, doctors and midwives, innkeepers, and school mistresses. Chapter IV, &quot;Women in the American Revolution,&quot; discusses the Daughters of Liberty groups and the role of women in the war effort. Chapter V is concerned with the rights of women during this era. Letters and diaries portray women who questioned their subordinate role in society, marriage, and education. The chapter concludes, however, that by the 19th century, the passive, ornamental lady set forth in ladies' books and female academies was becoming the ideal of femininity.

        "description":"The document, one in a series of four on women in American history, discusses the role of women in the Progressive Era (1890-1920). Designed to supplement high school U.S. history textbooks, the book is comprised of five chapters. Chapter I describes reformers and radicals including Jane Addams and Lillian Wald who began the settlement house movement; Florence Kelley, who fought for labor legislation; and Emma Goldman and Kate Richards O'Hare who became political prisoners for speaking against World War I. Chapter III focuses on women in factory work and the labor movement. Excerpts from diaries reflect the working conditions in factories which led to women's involvement in the AFL and the formation of the National Women's Trade Union League. Mother Jones, the Industrial Workers  of the World, and the \"Bread and Roses\" strike (1912) of 25,000 textile workers in Massachusetts are also described. Chapters III and IV trace how women got the vote through the decades of struggle and argument, the slowing down of the suffrage movement, its revival by a younger generation, the militants and Alice Paul, and the work of Carrie Chapman Catt in ratifying the 19th Amendment. Chapter V is concerned with women in arts and letters during the Industrial Age: Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Ida Tarbell, Sarah Orne Jewett, Mary Wilkins, Mary Wilkins Freeman, Kate Chopin, Edith Wharton, and Willa Cather. Women painters, photographers, composers, and dancers are also noted. (KC)",

        "description":"The author presents a rationale for adding psychology to the high school social studies curriculum. Also, changes within the environment of secondary schools which affect educators' willingness to offer psychology courses are identified. Approximately 750,000 high school students are currently enrolled in some sort of psychology course. In spite of this impressive enrollment figure, however, many educators argue against including psychology in the high school curriculum. Reasons for not including psychology in the curriculum are that teachers are not sufficiently trained in psychology to teach it well; students are too immature to understand psychological concepts before college; and psychology focuses on personal adjustment rather than intellectual concepts. The rationale for  including psychology in high school is based on four major premises--that it is already taught successfully in many schools, offers high school students a chance to work with a scientific discipline before college, prepares students for a service-oriented society, and can help students adjust to society. Factors influencing the increase in psychology courses in high school include a high degree of student interest, recognition that psychology can teach students about relating to a fast-paced world in which facts soon become dated, and belief on the part of teachers and parents that psychology will help adolescents resolve questions concerning personal worth and meaning.

        "description":"The booklet explores the actual and potential relationship between citizenship education and consumer education. The purpose is to examine key assumptions supporting citizenship and consumer education and to identify basics that cut across these two approaches to social education. It is presented in four chapters. Chapter I defines both citizenship and consumer education and points out that the approaches have a common goal: that of developing peoples' social competence. It also lists assumptions regarding schooling, particularly that education is an effective way of achieving the goal, and assumptions regarding citizen and consumer roles, including that the two roles are separate. Chapter II discusses the relationship of citizen and consumer roles, which fuse when individuals  make decisions that have consequences for all citizens, when economic decisions are made collectively in the political process, or when individuals consume government services. It also points out commonalities in the two roles, including that both are subject to the same historical forces, face common problems, occur in similar settings, and that people exhibit comparable behavior in both roles. Chapter III offers guidelines for linking citizenship and consumer education by listing seven citizenship competencies and suggesting several ways these can be used in consumer education. The conclusion is that the two roles are not separate, and that the linkages between citizenship and consumer education can provide one useful starting point for integrating social education. (CK)",

Chapter I explains the need for citizen education; how the concept of democratic citizenship evolved; and the history, evolution, and core elements and tensions of citizen education in the United States. Chapter II discusses patterns of political learning among American children, adolescents, and adults focusing on both cognitive development and social learning. Chapter III emphasizes the influence of the family and the peer group on children and adolescents and  describes a variety of school-based programs in citizen education. Chapter IV discusses selected citizen education activities of the media, voluntary/community groups, business and labor unions, and all levels of the government. The concluding chapter reaffirms the need for citizen education, lists 15 developments occuring within the past five years, and recommends that there be national leadership in this area sustained by a genuine commitment to major improvement. It also recommends nine goals for leadership activities, including reestablishing citizen education as a basic goal of schooling, designing professional training experiences, coordinating school and community resources, and broadening the constituency served by citizen education.

Fifty-two undergraduate education students were divided into four groups to receive four different treatments. All the students took the digit symbol test, followed immediately by a test of their memory for the nine symbols. Then they were given a verbal paired associate learning test. After that, one group studied codes to help them remember the digit symbol pairs; the second group practiced a letter symbol test; the third group had repeated practice on the digit symbol test; and the fourth group worked on a social studies reading task. After eight minutes, all the students took the digit symbol test again and then a second test  of memory for the nine symbols. All four of the groups obtained somewhat higher mean scores on the second administration of the digit symbol test, but there were no significant differences among the four groups in the amount of gain. Possible reasons for this outcome are discussed, and suggestions are made for further research. (Author/CTM)",

Checklists were developed for the observers to use in scoring the performance tests. A preliminary field trial of the test was administered to a small sample of dental auxiliaries, and revisions were made to the test and the scoring checklists. The revised tests were then administered to 115 dental assistants or dental hygienists. The development of  the scoring formulas for the performance tests was a three-stage process. Inter-observer reliabilities were computed for each subtest, and score distributions were compared for auxiliaries rated adequate with those rated inadequate by the observers. Various methods were used to select recommended pass/fail cutoff scores. Conclusions of the study and recommendations for further development are presented. (Author/CTM)",

The 1960's are characterized as a decade of innovation, while the 1970's are described in terms of interest in accountability and cost effectiveness. Several reasons for current concerns about basic skills are suggested: parents' expectations; industry's interest in the school's role in job training; a general emphasis on measurable quantities; and public reluctance to pay higher taxes. Classroom teachers are said to face a growing array of obstacles which seriously thwart their professional mission; many new policies contribute to the erosion of the individual teacher's autonomy. A variety of quoted sources indicates that there is little agreement on which  skills are considered basic; definitions range from the three R's--reading, writing, and arithmetic--to ethics, coping skills, and self concept. Several news items illustrate the fact that literacy data may be misleading. (GDC)",

Economic principles suggest that the cost of obtaining something is the value placed on whatever must be sacrificed to obtain it. This opportunity cost varies among individuals, changes with time, and depends upon the individual's prior learning. The value of learning can be computed by approximating the banker's compound interest formula; the opportunity cost and the number of times the learning is used are considered in this formula. Once the costs are computed, the cost-benefit  model should consider the service provided, as well as all those who benefit from it and those who pay for it. Although this procedure has not been empirically validated, it provides a simple and objective method of examining multiple outcomes over time.

All the students had difficulty formulating problem lists as indicated by average overall scores of 42% and 57% correct for the generate and the select groups, respectively. Significant quantitative and qualitative differences were noted between the two groups in that the select group usually picked properly integrated problems while the generate group constructed partially  correct answers composed of unintegrated cues.

Guidelines concerning guessing are also presented. While guessing is encouraged on program evaluation or screening tests, it is not advocated for diagnostic tests; thus, different scoring formulas may be appropriate for different applications of testing. Instruction designed to increase student motivation and test wiseness is described, and is said to be potentially fruitful when several situations are considered: the student's will to win, feelings of individual powerlessness, withdrawal due to previous failure, purposeless testing, and teachers' negative attitudes. Suggestions to combat  these problems include feedback to students and parents. Advice is provided concerning several issues in a test wiseness program: when students should guess; strategies for norm-referenced, criterion-referenced, screening, and diagnostic tests; and scoring formulas. It is concluded that students must be taught to pace their testing time, that item construction cues can be taught, and that practice is useful. (GDC)",

The results of three stepwise multiple regression analyses revealed that the Comprehension, Picture Completion, Similarities, Block Design, and Object Assembly subtests accounted for 36.92 percent of the variance associated with performance on the WRAT subtest. These findings are discussed relative to the identification of disabled readers  with individual intelligence tests and their implications for future research in the differential diagnosis of reading disabilities.

Background variables include socioeconomic and other family characteristics. Achievement test scores, grade point average, and age-grade retardation were also included in the study. The criterion for the study was projected educational attainment at four and a half years after high school graduation. Path analysis was used to study the relationships among the 18 variables. The best predictors of educational attainment were educational aspiration, ability as indicated by test scores, occupational aspiration, and high school grade  point average in that order. In this sample of 3300 students, 76 percent obtained some post-high school education. Of this group, 16 percent delayed their entry into post high school education, 15 percent interrupted their post high school education, and 16 percent attended other than two or four year colleges. It was concluded that delaying or interrupting post-secondary education did not handicap eventual educational attainment, and neither did delayed high school graduation. (CTM)",

Four types of data were used: oral reading rate correct, oral reading rate incorrect, word meaning, and comprehension. The first three measures were derived from the Power Builder Kits (Science Research Associates); the last was taken from the Stanford Diagnostic  Reading Test. Group 3 had the highest oral reading correct rate, after the four week program. There were no significant group differences in word meaning or comprehension. Superior achievement occurred when teachers measured oral reading daily relative to daily goals and altered both goals and consequences, based upon student performance. The effectiveness of traditional pretests and posttests for formative evaluation was questioned. (Author/CP)",

The author first provides a framework for his suggestions by reviewing research to delineate the characteristics of instructionally effective schools. Recommendations for policy and program improvement in Connecticut's schools are based on the following assumptions: (1) individual schools are powerful social systems with norms, beliefs, and values which serve to sustain the social system; and (2) the task of improving urban education is the task of redirecting the social system of individual schools. The author makes recommendations about  specific policy issues in the following areas: (1) mission of the schools, (2) efficacy and expectation, (3) instructional leadership, (4) opportunities to learn, and (5) home school support systems. The author points out that because the technology of education is both &quot;soft&quot; and imported from a distance, it is difficult to ensure that intended outcomes actually occur in individual schools. The author concludes, however, that following his recommendations will help bring about improvement of educational achievement levels in urban schools. (MK)",

Previously collected evaluation data from four compensatory education programs (grades 1-8) are reanalyzed in order to test the effects of these components. Program effectiveness is judged according to the standards of both grade-equivalent and percentile point achievement indices, as measured by standardized tests. The primary finding of these analyses is that conclusions about program effectiveness are greatly influenced by the the period of time over which the evaluation is based. Specifically, it is shown that the inclusion of the  summer months in the evaluation can reduce estimates of achievement and reverse positive judgments of program effectiveness. Additionally, it is demonstrated that the 10 percentile point achievement standard is more stringent than grade-equivalent score standards, and is thus less likely to be met in a 12-month evaluation. Based on this study's findings, it is recommended that evaluation of compensatory programs be based on a 12-month (fall to fall) period and that students not be promoted on the basis of spring test scores.

In the workshop on employment, issues discussed included the participation of Asians in the health system and in the public (Federal, State and local) sector. In the workshop on voter participation, discussion centered around problems of voter registration, voter education, and redistricting as they affect Asian Americans in New York City. Also considered were ways that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 can be used to increase the participation of Asian Americans with limited English speaking ability. Principle issues covered in the workshop on youth were the  lack of statistics on Asian American young people, language and educational problems, youth programs and employment, and gangs and violence, particularly in New York City's Chinatown. In the workshop on the elderly Asian American population of New York City, the availability of census statistics, language and cultural problems, social isolation, health, limited income, and housing were among the areas discussed. For each workshop, relevant statistical information is presented. Recommendations of the conference participants for eliminating discrimination and inequalities are also given. (GC)",

        "description":"The author argues that despite the conventional wisdom that schools cannot overcome the effects of socioeconomic status and race on academic achievement, there is a growing body of literature indicating that school climate and students' sense of control of their environment are strongly correlated with achievement. Five school-specific strategies have been suggested for changing the school climate by concentrating on the students' sense of futility: (1) use of academic team games; (2) effective reinforcement techniques; (3) improved test taking skills; (4) confronting low academic performance by convincing the student to take personal responsibility for achievement outcomes; and (5) confronting racism by focusing on individual responsibility for success. The author uses  attribution theory as a framework to identify the underlying commonalities of these five strategies and integrate them into a theoretical framework. He suggests that motivation is a highly alterable, situation-specific learning variable, and that an understanding of the problem of achievement and motivation requires analysis at both the level of social system and at the individual level.

A section which outlines the problem--the lack of basic competency in computational skills in youth and adults--discusses the work of the National Assessment of Educational Progress to evaluate student performance and declining scores on Iowa Tests of Basic skills and California Achievement Tests. Support for remedying skill deficiencies is described as coming from implementing career education in the mathematics classroom and the public's support of increased emphasis on careers in high school as shown by the Phi Delta Kappa based on Gallup Polls of Public Attitudes Toward Education. A section that makes special note of the problem of defining&quot;basic skills&quot; suggests that skills can be specified only as being basic when that to which they are basic is specifically stated. The need for vocational educators to search for and specify the mathematical applications that underlie vocational emphasis is briefly considered. The section following provides examplars of the varied approaches of mathematics and vocational educators to the issues of mathematics in vocational curricula, individualization, metrication, and instruction for special needs groups.

        "description":"An understanding of the magnitude of illiteracy or adult undereducation in the southeast U.S. and identification of the social, political, and economic conditions related to it are essential to developing effective policies for reducing or eliminating adult illiteracy in the region. Literacy is defined as the intellectual, social, vocational, and civic skills and abilities expected of a high school graduate who has had a &quot;reasonably good&quot; education. Nationally, about half the adult population has less than a high school-level education (50 million), one-quarter of these less than fifth grade (&quot;functionally illiterate&quot;), and three million cannot read or write in any language. The Florida population is about average, the rest of the Southeast 10% to 14% below national levels. Since  the Southeast is also moving faster in terms of rate of development and change, it is a time when critical choices can mold the region's development and serve as a model to other areas. The correlates of illiteracy must be seen; poverty, exploitation, alienation, and related conditions are highly associated with being illiterate in a highly literate society. Thus major changes are required in political, economic, and educational policies and priorities especially in regard to development of under-realized sources of tax revenue, gross under-utilization of educational resources for formal and non-formal lifelong learning, and continued development of foreign-based labor intensive industries. While present adult basic education (ABE) programs have not failed, they represent a holding action  at best. Main needs are for sufficient commitment of resources, integrated economic-educational planning, and use of already existing knowledge and technology. (JT)",

At the end of the project, each site had a  core group of people who had been trained in native American career education, and had made some decisions about the kinds of programs that would meet their needs. The degree to which implementation occurred, and the kinds of activities involved, varied widely from site to site, due primarily to organizational factors. One of the major results of the project was an increased understanding of the conditions which contribute to or inhibit the establishment of native American career education programs.

Focusing on reference group theory (symbolic interactionism), the conceptual framework of the study is founded upon the assumption that through participation in experiential education programs, students can expand their reference groups by beginning to include co-workers who are adults, thus easing the transition between school and work. Scales developed and used in this study include those examining student perspectives on adults (Empathy, Helpfulness, Communication, Consultation) and selected work setting characteristics (Feedback, Hierarchical and Lateral  Interaction, Challenge). Data analysis revealed that the Empathy and Communication scales have high reliability and the potential of discriminating between respondents. Hypotheses were tested by means of a static group comparison design which included 401 students classified by the extent of their work experience. Results indicate that student-adult communication and feedback appear to be important variables which reflect positive interaction. Students with work experience scored significantly higher on communication than those without work experience. However, the grade level of the students and their involvement in extracurricular activities were stronger predictors of the responses on the communication scale. (Author/MEK)",

Twenty women from each of three community/junior colleges were surveyed using the Survey of Women's Attitudes about Careers (which was also used for posttesting) to determine what the barriers were. A treatment program, based on survey findings, was designed and delivered. The treatment program, which addressed decision making, goal setting, self-knowledge, and awareness of career opportunities, was intended to assist women in overcoming barriers for entry into nontraditional employment and to encourage them to become self-directed in their career development. Posttests and follow-up interviews  were used to assess the program's impact by considering (1) changes made by participants as a result of specific goals, (2) application to and problems encountered in apprenticeship and training programs, and (3) degree of support from family and friends. It was concluded that the program did have some impact in assisting women to enter nontraditional occupations by helping them set career goals and change stereotypical attitudes. Participants also reported feeling less deterrence from potential barriers and having more control over their career development. (YLB)",

        "description":"The purpose of the study reported in this speech was to ascertain whether perceived barriers to entering nontraditional occupations as measured by a barriers-to-entry survey could be employed to accurately discriminate among women's consideration of a nontraditional occupation. Using a stratified random sample of 500 women (51% response) living in a moderately large Southeastern city who were employed in traditional occupations of nursing, teaching, and secretarial work, the two-part survey sought to discriminate among women who had given little, serious, or no consideration to entering a nontraditional occupation. Results of the survey indicate that membership in these deterrent groups can be identified on the basis of perceived barriers. Specifically, the findings lend support  to two assumptions: (1) the greater the consideration a woman gives to nontraditional occupations, the more she will be deterred and the more helpless she learns to feel; (2) women discover that the role of female is considered more important than a career role, even when entering a nontraditional field.

        "description":"The feasibility of classifying occupational tasks as a basis for understanding better the occupational transferability of job skills was examined. To show general skill relationships among occupations, 5 classification schemes were applied to 50 selected task statements for each of 12 occupations. Ratings by five reasonably knowledgeable people were obtained for the tasks of each occupation. A comparison of the task ratings was conducted to determine the skill components or aspects of tasks that would appear to be similar and could contribute to transfer capability among occupations. Additional exploration was attempted by obtaining overall job ratings, using each classification scheme, for a subsample of four of the occupations. This permitted an examination of the comparability  of task-composition versus whole-job bases for identifying the skill components of an occupation. It was concluded that tasks can be individually classified, that at least some classification schemes produce reasonable rater agreement for a wide assortment of types of tasks, and that such classifications can identify different task characteristics. However, there is cause for hesitancy in suggesting further study in more depth and sophistication, due to the conceptually complex and tedious chore for persons asked to rate occupational tasks. Suggestions are made for future studies. Questionnaires (on human attributes, psychological processes, content domains, action processes, and objects of action) are appended along with summary data.

Ten occupational training areas selected as a focus of the project were air conditioning, auto body, auto mechanics, diesel mechanics, drafting, food service, horticulture, machine shop, small engine, and welding. A needs assessment involved vocational teachers and industry in a cooperative effort to determine what industry was doing about metrics and gained information to develop scale instruments to measure (1) what metric tools and equipment were used and (2) what metric measurements were made in vocational programs and industry. Two additional scales were  designed to aid in planning for shop conversion to metrics and to determine individual metric professional development needs. Teacher workshops were conducted to provide awareness experiences and aid in planning for changeover. A metric education course for vocational teachers based on 16 available individualized modules was designed and offered in one region.

        "description":"A total of 1,994 students (approximately 70% of those who participated in the American College Testing Program's Nationwide Study of Career Development) who were working more than half-time three years later responded to an extensive mailed questionnaire followup study seeking to describe the predictability of actual job choice from expressed vocational choice and confidence in choice. Both choices and occupations were categorized into Holland-type job clusters. Analysis involved the use of weighted hit rates and coefficient Kappa. Expressed vocational choices correctly predicted actual occupation two years out of high school for 38% of the total sample (males 40%, females 35%). When certainty level was added to expressed choice, hit rates were 43% for very sure choosers, 38% for  fairly sure choosers, and 28% for not sure choosers. Each choice level proved significantly different from the others. Selected implications reported for counseling and research activities are as follows. For research: (1) Holland's typology may not be as powerful for explaining the early careers of semi- and unskilled workers as for managerial, skilled, and professional workers (further followup is suggested); (2) the expressed vocational choice variable demonstrated its viability and reliability via self-report; and (3) Vrooms force model may explain the dymanics of expressed vocational choice (since it was associated with predictability of choice). For counselors, a student's choice seems to indicate both a general direction and an implied prediction that exceeds change--at least  within the six job clusters used in the study. Counselors can also infer from this study some employer requirements for entry into broad general groupings. (MEK)",

Issues are examined with regard to aging and work in four areas of American society: waste of human resources, retirement, mental health and education. Health care and financial independence emerge as major concerns. Focus is on the context of social welfare versus self-help approaches and the need for more precise ways to describe the population. A functional definition is proposed in which an aging index is derived from measures of physical status, psychological well-being, economic stability,  socialization, life satisfaction, and chance factors. A taxonomy of work and aging is then outlined which presents a systematic way to identify and state researchable questions concerning various groupings of older persons and the work conditions which may provide available work options for them. The taxonomy assumes that people experience the aging process differently, that the aging process is developmental, and that people operate at functionally different levels of ability and efficiency, and that people regardless of age, at different points in time and for different reasons, have needs for paid and/or unpaid work activities and associations. A final section presents implications for federal policy on aging, retirement, mental health, and education calling for major research efforts  to bring clarity to the issues raised. (JT)",

While states may vary structure, organization, extensiveness, and resulting impact, the basic purpose of vocational education continues to be preparation for work. It also has the broad goals of the larger education system to be responsive to constantly changing social requirements. Past national influences have included federal legislation separating it from education in general by selective financing and emphasis on special populations. Critical factors in its future organization and structure are population trends and nature of the labor force. Considering available financial resources and economic pressures, possible enrollment is predicted to be lower at the secondary  level, higher at the postsecondary. Possible cost predictions range from $4.35 billion (1976 level) to $5.25 billion, with federal funds representing (still) 10.9%. Past federal financial support has primarily been distributed by population. Federal shares of financial vocational education must be increased to equalize cost, which then would allow states to increase support for new or expanded programs for other groups. The federal government must also consider the states' ability to support vocational education and the need for additional funds to provide for special needs groups. (YLB)",

Reform of past practices emphasizing special needs and college-attendance-related job functions was recommended to respond to the varied services demanded from and limited funds available to counselors today. Although they are sound, existing models for delivery of career counseling were considered dependent on accurate student  needs and self-understanding information. An alternate method incorporating community involvement was suggested. A survey of the 112 largest public school systems produced information indicating that career guidance and counseling services in urban schools (1) are not properly funded; (2) lack adequate supplies, resources, and personnel; (3) need to develop models to improve services; (4) need to establish operational professional roles and function statements; (5) are facing pressure to add more duties despite staff shortages; (6) require more intensive inservice training and skill development experiences; and (7) must improve their communication skills with school staff and the community.

It contains (1) information on a step-by-step approach to developing and implementing a comprehensive planning process (chapters 1-3) and (2) a case study of planning activity at Walla Walla Community College (chapter 4). Chapter 1 identifies and explains requirements of an effective planning process, including a planning model and prerequisites to effective planning. Implementation of the planning process is discussed in chapter 2. A conceptual model developed within the framework of the Planning, Management, and Evaluation System is presented, and these three phases of the process explained in detail:  planning (preplanning, strategic planning, operational planning), management (plan utilization), and evaluation (including monitoring). Chapter 3 focuses on vocational education planning and explains suggested steps in a program planning model. The purpose of chapter 4 is to delineate and describe planning and budgeting processes used by Walla Walla Community College. A preliminary evaluation is attempted. Among exhibits illustrating how other institutions approach various aspects of the planning is a description of Valencia Community College's needs assessment approach. (A second monograph in the series, available as CE 025 231, provides essential information for \"planning to plan.\") (YLB)",

Chapter 1 discusses planning as an essential administration function for the 1980s; such planning must be sensitive to societal trends and value shifts. Chapter 2 overviews literature found to be of value for conceptualizing and developing a comprehensive institutional planning system. The review encompasses literature on planning theory and literature having specific application and reference to planning in the two-year college. Chapter 3 synthesizes premises found in the literature--essential characteristics of the planning process, essential prerequisite  considerations, and essential requirements of the process. Chapter 4 presents a conceptual framework to facilitate understanding of the role, function, and operation of a planning system. Discussion focuses on a popular administrative model (Planning, Management, and Evaluation Model) and a planning process developed within the framework of that system. Chapter 5 presents an open system view of planning, which takes into consideration the relationship with the nature of the environment.

        "description":"Following a summary of what is presently known about transfer skills, the options available for assessment of transfer skills are identified and problems inherent in that task examined. Transfer skills (the ability or capacity of the learner or worker to transfer skills or knowledge from prior experiences to new ones) are discussed using the work of a number of contemporary theorists and noting points of general agreement. Types of educational measurements that can be applied to the assessment of transfer of skills are classified as either traditional or nontraditional methods. Traditional methods examined are paper and pencil, multiple choice, and objective tests. Nontraditional methods analyzed are interviews and oral examinations; simulations; essays; performance tests; and  self-assessment devices. Examples of each, their use as well as advantages and disadvantages, are given. It is noted that no specific tests or procedures could be recommended as end-alls; rather, they are presented as tools to help determine if transfer has occurred. A bibliography of selected documents describing nontraditional assessment methods is included as an appendix. (MEK)",

Chapters that follow examine the literature on cognitive style and learning style separately. Implications  for research on all three of the concepts (transfer skills, cognitive styles, and learning styles) are offered within the context of a discussion teaching style. Current applications in educational and training environments are discussed and various inventories for assessing cognitive/learning styles are identified and compared to assist the reader in selecting a learning style approach.

Following an introductory chapter, chapter 2 reviews the major approaches to career development in sociology and psychology while chapter 3 outlines how the two approaches can be combined. Chapter 4 describes the development and validity of the occupational status and the occupational field classifications. The fifth chapter describes the National Longitudinal Survey data used in the study. The next three chapters  describe patterns of career outcomes: the employment status and kinds of work held at different ages, the occupational aspirations men have at different ages, and the extent to which earlier aspirations and jobs determine later jobs held. Chapter 10 focuses on family and personal background variables that are associated with entering different fields and levels of work, while chapter 11 focuses on the influence of educational and economic environments. The final two chapters review the theoretical and practical implications of the study. (LRA)",

Chapter 3 presents the basic concepts of selected mathematical  and statistical topics, which are discussed in further detail in chapters 4 and 5. Chapter 4 develops the mathematics of differential equations, presents a justification for using ordinary least squares in the statistical analysis, and describes a computer program that can be used to estimate coefficients of the differential equation system. The fifth chapter draws on the technical materials presented in chapters 3 and 4 to describe interpretations of differential equation systems applied to career expectation variables.

The study was designed around a cross-sectional path model of career expectations drawn from the sociological literature on status attainment and is based on differential equations in which all expectation variables are viewed as affecting each other in a time-continuous system of feedback loops. A random sample of approximately 700 Ohio high school sophomores completed self-administered questionnaires providing data on career expectations and socioeconomic characteristics of family members. One or both parents of each youth also completed questionnaires identifying the parents' career expectations for their children and socioeconomic data. All  occupational data were coded into three-digit 1970 census codes and then transformed into codes reflecting socioeconomic content of occupations. Selected means, standard deviations, correlations, and path models were compared to previous cross-sectional research in the local area. These comparisons revealed good matches between current and past samples in broad patterns, but samples differed in specific detail. Comparison of correlations based on the subjective-probability method to those derived from traditional methods revealed that the former were consistently higher than the latter. Finally, the results involving the identification issue in cross-sectional data in which feedback loops appear were analyzed. (BM)",

After briefly outlining the British education system, the author discusses recent and proposed changes designed to help young people (particularly the unemployed, terminal degree student, or those who are working and receiving daytime training) affect a smoother transition from school to work. Two contemporary programs are outlined which are providing on-the-job experiences for youth: the Youth Opportunities Program and Unified Vocational Preparation, both of which have provided much useful information to the British government relative to the school-to-work transition. The resultant proposal is also described: that young people who leave school to enter  work should be offered traineeships in their early months of work as part of a joint enterprise of school and training service providers, much like an apprenticeship. In concluding, a proposal currently under consideration, shortening the apprenticeship period by substituting qualifying examination for a portion of the four year apprenticeship, is discussed.

        "description":"The PTA continues to be engaged in projects and programs which relate to parents' and children's perception and understanding of the world of work, education, and career development. Current activities include a project focusing on television's effects on children and youth, the national PTA's Urban Education project determining issues in public education, and activities in the area of testing. The PTA supports career education and the parent's role, which involves two different functions: (1) guider of or resource for his or her own child and (2) advocate for increased opportunities in the area of career education for all children, with emphasis on the impact that parents can have at the community, state, and local levels. From parents children learn attitudes and motivations  about work, careers, and goals. To positively influence their children, parents need to learn about employability skills, educational opportunties, needs assessment, and career education concepts. More research and development is needed to disseminate such information, materials, skill development, and the training of parents. Through the PTA parents can assume their roles as advocates for career and vocational education at all levels. (Questions and answers are appended.) (YLB)",

        "description":"In focusing on local school board response to citizen desires for change in public school operations and on significant issues changing education from the perspective of school boards, three principles must be kept in mind: (1) public schools are controlled by three arms of government at three levels; (2) the federal government has limited powers; and (3) federal trends (concerning the federal government) are not coincidental with national trends (existing independently of the federal government). Issues of federal and national scope include severe student population decline, fewer students but richer programs, and expansion of federal control. States have reacted by emphasizing their power at the expense of local boards of education who are bypassed at the local level in favor  of citizen advisory committees. School board concerns involve a trend against big government spending, administrative unionism, curriculum reform, vocational career education programs, and their role as coordinators of community educational resources in a more comprehensive approach to education. Parent and citizen involvement necessary to help school boards deal with these problems raises other problems: advisory committees versus school boards as final authority, support of the expanding group of senior citizens, and the relationship among the superintendent and advisory committee and school board.

        "description":"The British, like the Americans, are facing youth education and employment problems. Recent consideration of the content and standard of education, especially the obligations schools have in equipping pupils for adult life, has led to the suggestion that schools have a duty to meet industry's needs. Government should consider a national program giving a new vocational thrust to secondary education, because, for school to help students acquire social and other skills to help them obtain jobs in the 1980s, education must offer a stronger vocational program that reflects changing employment patterns. Youth unemployment needs special attention because it may condition work attitudes. What young people want should also be considered. Students not aspiring to higher education should  have the opportunity to explore work places and engage in practical activities. Education should be changed to include practical activities in the curriculum, more closely associate schools and further education colleges, instill a wider knowledge of industry in teacher training, give students supervised work experience, and provide for student career awareness, career exploration, and career selection.

        "description":"Vocational education programs cannot and should not serve all the population groups targeted by the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA). Rather, they should and must collaborate and cooperate with the manpower community. In order to do that five major policy issues need to be dealt with: getting agreements to collaborate, prime sponsor and local education agency linkages, vocational education delivery system, education credit, and extended school days, facilities, and teachers. Although there is a basis for collaboration, there must be someone to play the role of facilitator/catalyst. In the absence of preexisting trust between CETA and vocational education, the development of a sense of shared interdependence is needed. Toward these ends, vocational education must  examine the redefine the scope of responsibilities of the discipline, documenting the effectiveness and costs of current programs while discarding those which are no longer useful. It also must gear itself to serve the needs of a rapidly aging population. Each student should have his or her own IEP (individal employment program) developed, with the granting of academic credit for work experience as appropriate. The traditional school day must be extended, as must the settings in which vocational education can be offered. Inservice education for school personnel also is essential. Vocational education must respond to the demographic time bomb set to go off in 1995 by instituting systematic changes capable of accomodating these population shifts. Time is running out for the vocational  education and manpower communities to work together voluntarily.

        "description":"In the early 1970s educational evaluation's fusion of respect for rationality, power to implement rational procedure, and an altruistic objective (improved instruction) appealed to educational researchers. Dealing essentially with closed systems, it measured program success by student performance on measurement instruments. Critics exclaimed that program developers and evaluators took away personal decision rights from students and that outcome measures were incomplete and inaccurate. Changes occured due to reanalysis showing the futility of earlier research, operating focus on procedures (not outcomes), open student participation, and loss of stability required for longitudinal study. In present-day open system evaluation settings, emphasis is on multiple objectives, and  selection of what is to be evaluated is left open. No longer committed to methodology and provision of clear information, evaluators use case studies and looser, more interactive designs. Their reactions to political demands are to use needs assessments, develop systematic procedures, and write more reports. Problems between politics and evaluation include these: (1) the technical disagreement that any evaluation is subject to erodes its credibility with its contracting agency, (2) evaluation results can be used to discredit politicians whose claims outstrip their programs, and (3) success of political efforts gives politicians a sense of personal power.

        "author":["Tolbert, Jack F."],
        "description":"Proprietary schools represent a growing segment of the total educational effort of this country and one which often has been misunderstood by the public education community. While greater cooperation is desirable between proprietary trade schools and non-proprietary schools providing similar job training, the prejudice of traditional educators toward vocational education for profit and the proprietor's desire to protect his investment are barriers to such cooperative efforts. Proprietary schools are currently in a growth period, primarily due to increasing enrollments and a growing reluctance on the part of states to increase funding for public postsecondary education. Although the tremendous growth of private trade schools in the early sixties brought with it certain abuses, the  development of strong trade associations, including the National Association of Trade and Technical Schools (NATTS), helped proprietary schools in the seventies build a solid reputation for ethically-run, quality programs which have a high rate of success in terms of job placement. The Medix School's success depends largely on an effective mix of student recruitment, the education process, job placement, and institution management. Few studies have been conducted of private career schools or their students; this appears to be an unmet need in vocational research and development. Perhaps there is a model or method that can combine the effective features of proprietary schools and the public sector which offer students a better learning opportunity.

Only in 1969, however, did comprehensive legislation declare company vocational training within the sphere of state responsibility, give unions participation rights in determining training content, and create a Federal Institute for Vocational Education Research. Improved quality of training but fewer training places led to the Act on the Promotion of Training Places (1976), which provided certain prerequisites for the future of vocational education: it became a political subject and &quot;demand for training&quot; is now measured by the number of school leavers, not by industry's needs. The future development of vocational  education will be determined by (1) society's image of a working person, (2) cooperation between employers and unions, (3) well-trained vocational school teachers and training personnel, and (4) individual benefit given to handicapped, foreign children, and females. Despite different education systems in the Federal Republic and the United States, work of vocational educators and youth problems are similar. Views should be exchanged regarding school to work transition, greater adjustment between the education and employment systems, learning on the job, and financing vocational education. (YLB)",

Part 2 (chapters 2-7) identifies specific student practices for building a comprehensive program. Each chapter is organized into (1) narrative, with definition, rationale for use, summary appraisal of practices, and full description of an illustrative practice; (2) ten abstracts of practices, showing range, types available, costs; (3) additional practices; and (4) references. Chapter 2 focuses on curriculum-based  practices--a broad approach to delivering career guidance practices. Chapters 3-5 present individual practices geared primarily to one developmental area. Titles are Self-Understanding and Occupational Knowledge Practices; Career Exploration and Decision-Making Practices; and Placement, Follow-Up, Follow-Through, and Employability Skills Practices. Chapter 6 addresses the needs of women and special sub-populations. Chapter 7 concerns computer-based career guidance practices. Part 3 (chapter 8) discusses the implementation of programs and practices under these topics: change agent roles for counselors, a seven-step strategy for effecting change, and a review of roadblocks to change.

It is a synthesis of major conclusions and insights, with some additional perspectives, from eight final reports on an exploratory study (see Note). A brief overview is presented of project objectives and activities which focused on identification of skills, attitudes, knowledge, and personal characteristics that schools could seek to develop, and how they might teach them to prepare students for careers characterized by change. The several conclusions include the following: (1) The substantial job changing in the American labor force is neither inherently good nor bad. (2) Individuals need help in preparing for careers characterized by change. (3)  Although little is known about job changing, skills alone do not determine mobility or adaptability. (4) All skills are potentially transferable to some extent and on some occasions. There is reasonable consensus on broad categories important for success in a variety of occupations. (5) Students need opportunity to practice application of skills under a wide variety of conditions and circumstances. (6) Performance in one talent area is unrelated to that in others, so schools should develop abilities in a number of different ones (e.g., creative, decision-making, planning, and communication talents). (7) A number of educational programs and instructional techniques have been identified that seem to provide for the implicit recognition or development of transferable skills. Suggestions and  recommendations are made for teachers, counselors, administrators, employers, and researchers. Examples of transferable skills and characteristics and the final report of the project's panel of consultants are appended. (JT)",

        "description":"This paper discusses the central problems and issues of the transition from school to worklife in the United States. Developed from a framework which outlines the structure of the education system and the place of vocational-technical education within it, the paper addresses measures the United States has taken to facilitate the transition from school to work. Content and methods related to curriculum and teaching in vocational education are briefly described and conclusions are drawn on the present state of affairs relative to the school-to-work transition. Selected conclusions are these: (1) access to facilities in urban and rural areas must be improved; (2) more emphasis should be placed on staff development; (3) guidance services and counseling efforts should be better  integrated into the school system and the curriculum; and (4) better and more reliable information on job possibilities, work experience, and employment options are necessary. It is noted that resolutions to the school-to-work transition are most likely to be found where cooperative work experience programs can serve at least fifty percent of all students enrolled in school-based vocational programs; where career exploration in the workplace is available to all students; and where education is more successfully integrated with business and the community by programs being delivered on the work site rather than exclusively in the classroom.

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to review and synthesize what is known about occupational adaptability and to propose a heuristic model of the process(es) of adaptation in work. Following an introductory chapter, three chapters contain a review of literature that draws from many disciplines and presents an overview of human adaptation in general, as well as in the context of work. The review addresses three questions: What is meant by adaptability? What are the major factors involved in adaptation? What behaviors and styles are used in adapting? Chapter 5 presents the model for occupational adaptation, which is intended as a heuristic framework with which to examine elements and forces in peoples' work lives and how individuals go about dealing with adaptive demands involved with  working. The model also addresses adaptive options of bringing about changes in jobs and work environments, preventing or avoiding the effects of unwanted changes, and making moves from one job or career to another. Chapter 6 discusses implications of the model and offers suggestions for increasing and refining adaptation in work and life. Chapter 7 reviews implications for individuals, work organizations, and society in general improving the occupational adaptability of individuals. Examples of transferable skills lists are appended.

It can be divided into two major parts: (1) presentation of information and a model for structuring the information-gathering process and (2) demonstration of analysis of the information collected to develop &quot;referral&quot; or evaluation criteria. A section on gathering information suggests possible questions for seven major information categories found most useful in vocational planning--demographic-identifying information, work history, education and training, personal and social adjustment, disability, vocational interests and goals, and job-seeking experience. Other  topics include client understanding and involvement in the evaluation process, reasons for and structuring of the initial or diagnostic interview, and development and use of a structured information form. The twenty-one-page Materials Development Center Structured Information Form is provided and its use described. The section on analysis follows a brief discussion with example answers to questions on the information form and evaluation questions (information needs), which were developed from the information. (CE 025 400 provides information on developing individual evaluation plans from these questions.) Tentative steps for using the information in this publication conclude the publication. (YLB)",

Two chapters focus on making and using flow diagrams and process charts. Other topics discussed (chapters 8-11) include use of an operation chart or operations process chart, principles of motion economy, workshop efficiency, and laying out a work place or production line. The section on production standards contains basic information and more advanced materials.  Chapters 12 and 13 define work measurement and outline a quick method to set a production standard. Chapters 14, 15, and 17 provide materials for more precise determination of production standards--time study, work rating, and allowances in setting performance standards.

In addition to these five sub-process units (units 2-6) an introductory unit (unit 1) on the adjustment services concept and the relationship with vocational evaluation is also provided. Each sub-process unit includes a brief overview or introduction followed by an annotated  listing of suggested resource materials. If there is overlap in material content, the resource is assigned to the unit to which it is most directly applicable.

Focus is on testing persons with sight, hearing, and academic problems with the indication that principles developed for this fairly high percentage of the severely disabled population are applicable to other handicapped persons. Part I suggests methods of communicating instructions and items to the client in a way that he will understand what is required of him. Conditions of blindness, deafness, and mental retardation are defined and general test modification suggestions made for each. Part II contains examples of how specific tests can be modified to meet the special needs of the disabled and  examples of commonly used tests that can be used without modifications with one or more of the three disability groups. A test review outline is presented followed by twenty-one individual test reviews under the following headings: achievement batteries and reading tests, character and personality, intelligence, vocations--clerical, vocations--dexterity, vocations--mechanical, and vocations--interests. Part 3 briefly describes a few tests designed for the severely disabled. (JT)",

The programs for preventive/educational counseling for adult development are considered in terms of general life skills and specific careers, i.e., social and civic career, marriage, family, occupation, and leisure. Within each of these careers, the programs are examined in terms of the tasks and issues of the adult developmental periods of different  theorists. (Author)",

The development of a cooperative program with the drama department to train and utilize drama students as coached clients is described as the first technique. The second technique is presented as a review by trainees of experienced counselors' taped interviews to help them develop more accurate and comprehensive perceptions of an actual counseling encounter. The third alternative technique is delineated in terms of training counselors in the use of mental imagery for self-directed practice and review of counseling interviews in an imaginary context. Current programs teaching counseling interactions for enrollees are  reviewed in light of how trainee role-playing has traditionally been the primary method used to provide these experiences. The alternative techniques presented are designed to provide additional quantity and quality to the experiential aspects of training programs with minimal additional costs and personnel requirements.

Age groups, each consisting of 41 women and 10 men who were elderly (over 60), in middle adulthood (26-45), or adolescence (14-16) were asked to list events they expected to happen in their future lives and in the community, nation or the world; to assign time; and to state if the events would be pleasant or unpleasant. It was hypothesized that a curvilinear relationship would occur between age and length of &quot;looking ahead,&quot; with the adult group the highest. While the results tended in that direction, only the elderly were significantly lower than the other two groups. As hypothesized, societal time spans were not significantly  different among the age groups. It was also hypothesized that depressive mood would be associated with a shorter time span; this finding was confirmed for the elderly for both personal and societal futures. (Author)",

Explanations for the evolution of this species-specific trait are possible through &quot;non-deterministic&quot; theories of aging positing &quot;wear and tear&quot; or the failure of nature to eliminate imperfection, or &quot;deterministic&quot; theories which explain longevity as the by-product of selection for some other features such as general constitutional &quot;fitness&quot; or optimal life-history strategy. All of these hypotheses, however, fail to propose a positive selective force which could have acted to favor longevity in evolving hominid populations. Consideration of the evolutionary advantages of long life suggests a model of how selection for longevity could have effected a  positive feedback loop between inclusive fitness and social support networks, representing the central biological and sociocultural components of a biocultural theory. Results of preliminary testing of this theory, using data from New England family genealogies, suggest validity for this approach. (Author)",

To determine the correspondence between a measure of counselor effectiveness and five cognitive complexity measures, 38 subjects, master's degree students in counseling, completed each of five cognitive measures and were rated by their practicum supervisor on their effectiveness in actual counseling interviews. No significant correlations were found between the measures, nor did any combination of instruments permit prediction of counselor effectiveness with any statistical significance. Other interpretations are possible, including that the sample may have been sufficiently homogeneous with respect to  cognitive complexity that subject differences in this domain could not produce statistical significance. Future investigations should focus on the utility of the construct of cognitive complexity as it relates to counselor selection, counseling, and counseling effectiveness. (Author/CKJ)",

First, sex differences in values were examined. Then, for groups classified as having values &quot;typical&quot; or &quot;atypical&quot; of each sex, analyses were made of differences and similarities in such behaviors as preferences for major fields of interest and kinds of occupations chosen. While identified sex differences tended to confirm the stereotype of the striving, active, positive male and nurturant, passive female, the two&quot;typical&quot; sub-groups accounted for many of these differences. Furthermore, differences between the &quot;typical&quot; and &quot;atypical&quot; sub-groups within each sex often parallelled those between the sexes. Results suggest that similarities between the sexes in the CDM process outnumber differences and justify &quot;sex-blind&quot; guidance. (Author)",

        "description":"The effects of various questioning strategies on reading comprehension were tested. The subjects, 24 second grade students reading at or slightly above their grade level, were divided into three instructional groups. The strategy group focused on integrating textual material with prior knowledge. The question group got a steady diet of inferential questions. The control group received a traditional mix of literal/inferential probes (about a four to one ratio). In general, posttest ANOVA and pre/posttest ANCOVA supported all five of the study's hypotheses: (1) helping children make connections between what they already knew and what was in a text increased the likelihood that they would draw inferences spontaneously; (2) giving children practice in answering inference questions  also tended to enhance their ability and inclination to do so spontaneously; (3) students trained in an inferencing set, whether by suggestion or sheer practice, processed explicit messages from the text better than students who focused on those messages; (4) treatment effects appeared to be subject to a prior-knowledge filter; and (5) growth in inferencing ability did not necessarily overcome the inherent advantage typically attributed to literal questions. Although the design of the study was not ideal and the data supported some hypotheses to a greater degree than others, it was concluded that instruction and practice in making inferences had direct consequences on children's reading comprehension.

A prototype of the test was developed in winter 1977, and a revised version was administered in spring 1978. Analysis of this test data revealed several problems, and new criteria for the test were established. After a survey of the phonics components of nine popularly used diagnostic and achievement tests was conducted, a new test was designed to meet the new criteria. The new test assesses 45 different spelling-to-sound correspondences in 141 items and is comprised of two subtests on consonants and vowels. The subtests have been administered separately to small groups of students. Interesting patterns were noticed in the errors of  students on the vowels subtest. Plans are being made to further revise the phonics test by increasing the number of letter-sound correspondences, and the test will be administered to younger students. (Author/MKM)",

A conceptual framework has been hypothesized in order to reevaluate existing research and to permit a formal distinction among the several functions that prose-learning pictures likely serve. The functions hypothesized are decoration, remuneration, motivation, reiteration, representation, organization, interpretation, and transformation. Two of these functions, the representation function and the transformation function, have proved useful in differentiating  between the magnitude and consistency of picture effects that can be anticipated from one prose-learning study to the next. The framework can prove helpful in identifying the kinds of variables that need to be controlled for when looking for pictures in prose effects, as well as the kind of research that still needs to be conducted to isolate the contributions of specific picture components.

        "description":"One factor that contributes to the difficulty that a reader may encounter when reading a text is the syntactic complexity of the constructions used in the text. Examples of altered text constructions include the transformations of subjects of subordinate clauses, making them either the subjects or the objects of main clauses. When the conditions for such &quot;raising to object&quot; or &quot;raising to subject&quot; are examined, it is found that there are really just a small number of factors involved. For example, the noun phrase that is raised must be perceived as a good discourse topic in the discourse context where the sentence occurs. Differences of meaning among the variant forms can be accounted for as inferences from different surface structures. Extra inferred meanings are conveyed by the  structures that are more complex to process according to absolute measurements of syntactic complexity. Syntactic complexity, however, is not an absolute value, because it may vary with discourse context and the function of the construction in discourse. An understanding of the relation between syntactic complexity and discourse function allows a writer to use more complex constructions without increasing text difficulty for the reader. (Author/RL)",

The data from reading time research both supports and refutes the claim that reading is less prevalent among older than among younger people, although the implicit general conclusion of this research appears to be that reading is a popular leisure activity for the elderly. Reading preference research suggests that the reading preferences of older readers are totally individualistic. Finally, while researchers have made claims for the psychological benefits of reading for the elderly, such claims do not appear to be supported by empirical research.  Further research should focus on defining more clearly the relationship between reading and psychological benefits. Perhaps researchers could gain more critical insights into the benefits of reading for the elderly by investigating the concept of value of reading, based on the interaction between time spent reading and the importance and enjoyment of reading for the individual. The concept of value of reading has implications for the development of reading programs based on individual differences and for investigations of the social and psychological processes that influence the elderly reader.

One group assumes a negative relationship, hypothesizing that time previously devoted to reading has been replaced by increased television viewing. Research in this area has produced uneven results, though there is hope that more sophisticated measurements and methodologies will ultimately reveal the true interaction between television and reading. The second point of view assumes a positive relationship between the two media and suggests that television can stimulate reading. Proponents of this viewpoint are supported by the general successes of \"Sesame Street,\" scripting, and teaching critical  television viewing skills in language arts classrooms. According to the research that has been examined, utilizing children's interests in media to teach basic skills in the home and the school now appears to be the predominant trend in education at this time. But this trend has raised concerns about giving the television medium more legitimacy than it deserves and about contributing to declines in the emphasis on print and the quality of reading materials.

Clay's \"Concepts About Print Survey,\" and the students' talk about reading and writing in interviews. Preliminary findings indicated that the children had learned many of the rules of classroom discourse, including those used in literacy teaching and learning, and were becoming literate.  However, some cultural differences in language interaction and literacy learning were found. The findings suggest that educators need to develop an understanding of language interaction and learning patterns of oral cultures in the United States and that a variety of assessment techniques in reading are needed to measure learning in that area.

In the second chapter, some of the historical roots of the concept of literacy are traced both to show how the concept of literacy evolved and to show how literacy has always been closely tied to the spirit of the times. The social, political, and educational uses and abuses of literacy assessment are examined and an attempt is made to place current efforts in a social, political, and educational context, including current assessments of functional literacy. The need to assess actual literacy demands and individuals' abilities to handle those demands is stressed in chapter three. In chapter four, possible instruments to do this type of  assessment are proposed for job-related literacy demands and the results of a field-testing of these instruments is presented. (MKM)",

An increase in the number of students successfully meeting the required grade point average of approximately 3.00 on a 5.00 scale during their first semester has changed from 39% in 1976 to 62.9% in 1979. Initially, the program required special academic advising sessions plus individualized work in the learning assistance center. This plan was revised as it was noted that most of the students exhibited few academic skill deficiencies but did have a prolonged history of inappropriate academic behaviors, such as class cutting, procrastination,  poor problem solving abilities, and avoidance behaviors. The existing program now provides three options: (1) a three hour elective credit course in psychology that stresses acquisition of learning strategies, (2) individualized study in the learning assistance center lab, and (3) academic improvement groups focusing on academic problem areas. Results indicate that students choosing the credit program have been far more successful in meeting the required grade point average than those choosing the non-credit program. (MKM)",

Its purpose was to develop a measure that reflects the strength of organization of existing knowledge as it relates to key concepts and vocabulary in content area textbooks. The study elicited prior knowledge from 36 high school seniors, using free association based on stimulus content words from reading passages, categorized this knowledge into broad levels, and statistically examined the nature of the relationships between these assigned levels of prior knowledge and the  organization of recall. The findings indicated that level of prior knowledge was strongly related to the recall of a passage as measured by B. J. F. Meyer's analysis of prose. In addition, it was found that the relationship among recall measures and between level of prior knowledge and the recall measures was dependent on the passages used, indicating that there was some passage dependency in terms of both prior knowledge and recall.

The first part of the paper deplores the current trend to skip important developmental experiences in kindergarten in order to take children directly to the abstract experiences involved in skill-based reading and workbook lessons; notes that kindergarten should not be thought of as preparation for first grade and that not all kindergarten children should be reading; and suggests ways of setting up an individualized reading program that makes use of self-selected books to encourage and challenge children who are already  reading. The major portion of the paper describes a variety of reading-related activities for kindergarten children who can read, including: (1) a child-made game based on a topic in which children are interested; (2) teacher-made games involving matching words and answering riddles and other questions; and (3) activities involving children in making books, writing stories, studying foreign languages, writing captions for comic strips, following directions, making greeting cards, creating secret codes, writing and illustrating stories based on children's picture books, and working with experience charts.

A study was conducted to examine the amount of actual reading of connected text, orally or silently, assigned during classroom reading instruction. Twenty-four first and second grade teachers from four school districts were observed as they worked with classroom reading groups. The numbers of words read by children in good and poor reader groups were compared to identify whether the amount of actual reading varies even when the allocated reading instructional time remains relatively similar between groups. Results indicated that the good readers read, on the average, more than twice as many words per session as poor readers. Other results showed that  poor readers were seldom asked to read silently and their errors were often treated out of context, with the teacher emphasizing visual or phonic characteristics of the target word. In contrast, the good readers' errors were more often analyzed in the context in which they occurred, with the teachers commenting on the syntactic or semantic appropriateness of the wrong response. Implications of the study are that in order for poor readers to read larger quantities of material the amount of silent reading instruction and independent reading assignments should be increased.

Undergraduate grade point averages, letters of recommendation, Graduate Record Examination scores, and statements of goals were the four admissions criteria most often used by the master's programs studied. More than half the programs required oral/written comprehensive examinations of their graduating students, though many faculty did not enforce the requirement. Only 25% of the programs required a thesis from graduating students, while 12% did not allow them; the thesis was an option in the other programs, reflecting a choice between &quot;professional&quot; and &quot;teaching-research&quot; tracks. Few programs required formal  language proficiency testing. Nearly half the programs required cognate courses in fields outside journalism. Some of the problems that were reported related to physical facilities, graduate faculty, students without journalism backgrounds, high dropout rates, teaching foreign students, getting research support for students, establishing fair admissions procedures/standards, establishing a professional track within a thesis program, and giving graduate credit for undergraduate courses.

A path model of these variables was developed, reflecting implicit causal assumptions between visibility (press coverage) and such factors as the size of the senator's home state, seniority in the Senate, the senator's office staff size, committee leadership/prestige, and level of activity (within and outside the Senate). Analyses of all the correlations between these variables showed that senatorial activity was the strongest predictor of AP coverage, especially for Democrats. Only the data for the 89th Congress deviated from this pattern; in that analysis, the size of a senator's staff was the best  predictor of coverage. State size was equal to or stronger than activity in predicting the visibility of Republican senators in the 83rd and 93rd Congresses. In general, the variables were better at predicting Republican Senatorial activity and press coverage. The findings suggested that senators in positions of power within the Senate were not necessarily getting the most frequent press coverage. The most active senators usually got the most press coverage, and they tended to come from the most populous states and have the largest office staffs. (RL)",

An oral sentence completion technique was used with the child subjects, and the same items in written form were used with the adults. The results for the older children in the sample confirmed the results of previous studies in revealing a pattern of overuse of the definite article. However, the more complete usage data suggest that the overuse is a selective one that occurs predominately in one category and after a period of essentially correct usage. These findings argue against an explanation based on egocentrism and suggest that the incorrect usage of the more advanced children results from an overextension  of a principle of shared knowledge found in adult article use. Overall, the data in this study allow description of an acquisition sequence for the English article system that extends earlier developmental findings and resolves some of their inconsistencies.

Training begins with assigning tutors writing activities to make them more aware of themselves as writers and learners and more appreciative of the processes of composition. Readings from Peter Elbow's \"Writing without Teachers\" and Carl Rogers'\"Freedom to Learn\" and role playing as textbook reviewers serve to further the tutors' understanding of composition. With this respect and understanding, the tutor is able to make responses appropriate to individual needs of student writers, and examples of these responses are found in the research papers  that tutors are required to write about their experiences tutoring students. Most notable in the tutors' research reports is reference to a changing dialogic relationship between tutor and writer. The tutor seems to be able to guide the student from a one-sided student-teacher dialogue to a more equal I-thou relationship that encourages the students' respect for themselves as writers and learners and enhances their ability to engage in academic discourse.

        "description":"Students in college basic writing courses need to consider their own written language and to compare it with other students' work before they can develop a sense of the symbolic relationship between language and experience. Because of a lack of previous writing experience, basic writers have no sense that the &quot;facts&quot; about which they write are statements and therefore created, and no sense that this creation is a matter of choice dependent on the writer's intentions. A sequence of writing assignments has been developed that calls for basic writing students to describe, analyze, and compare their decision making processes in a number of out-of-class experiences as well as in the experience of writing papers. The assignments and the examination of other students' papers help  students to see that writers can choose many different ways to describe the same kinds of things, that writing is not alien to other life experiences, that their writing behavior can be classified in new ways, and that the use of language to define the meaning of an experience lies outside the event itself. The final assignment asks students to write a long paper about themselves as decision makers, incorporating into it generalizations drawn from their previous papers. This direct encounter with their own ideas objectified on the page reveals more about the writing process than anything teachers can tell them. (GT)",

        "description":"In a summer institute, secondary school writing teachers improved their teaching and writing skills through teaching writing by the direct method and through participating in weekly writing tutorials. Too often, writing is taught through such indirect methods as work with grammars, rhetorics, and heuristics, which seem more attractive to teachers than working directly with student writers in the actual business of writing. However, the training of writing teachers should encourage the teaching of writing by the direct method--and the most direct method is the writing tutorial. In the summer institute, teachers acted as editors during writing laboratory classes for high school students, and they participated in post-practicum sessions stressing the diagnosis of particular examples  of student writing. They also spent eight hours each week in expository writing on self-chosen topics and were tutored by institute staff members in open-ended tutorials emphasizing direct response to the writing at hand, examination of all rough drafts of a piece of writing, and sharing of writing by tutors. Teachers' essays were published in two volumes during the institute. A formal evaluation of the institute, which included a full-year follow-up, suggested that the institute had been remarkably effective in changing the teaching and editing behaviors of the teachers, as well as their attitudes toward themselves as writers.

The coach who approaches responsibilities from a humanistic perspective can offer the student far more than just a knowledge of the skills involved.

The distraction literature was reviewed and synthesized into five propositions, which served as a starting point for predicting how distraction should generally affect persuasion. A model of conversational distancing violations was then adapted to predict how nonverbal variables specifically might function as distractors. A total of 350 college students were then involved in an experiment that manipulated violations of distancing expectations and attractiveness of confederates. The results supported distance violations and physical appearance as sources of distraction and  provided some support for the prediction that attractive individuals engaging in violations of expectations will serve as positive sources of distraction, leading to greater susceptibility to persuasion. Predictions regarding propensity to counterargue and derogate a source were not supported and raised questions about the measurement or conceptualization of the construct. (Author/FL)",

The first chapter analyzes certain discourses of the American Revolution to show the rhetorical strategy developed by the patriots with the goals of destroying the British ethos and, at the same time, creating a new American ethos. The second chapter analyzes inaugural addresses of presidents from George Washington through Jimmy Carter to show how the rhetoric of these addresses attempted generally to bring to bear the prestige of the past in attacking contemporary problems, specifically employing and exploiting the  influential ideas generated by the discourse of the Revolution. The final two chapters separately examine two controversies--the imperialism debate at the turn of the twentieth century and the civil rights struggle of this century--to elucidate the impact of the continuing rhetoric of the Revolution on specific American actions. In its conclusions, the monograph notes that the rheotric of the Revolution established a durable, adaptable ideology that has presided over the evolutionary processes of the United States. (GT)",

The questionnaire elicited information on television viewing habits and knowledge of real life law enforcement. Six items were used to test knowledge, each having a &quot;TV&quot; answer and a &quot;real life&quot; answer. The subjects were divided into categories of light, moderate, and heavy television viewers of law enforcement television programs. The hypothesis  that as viewing level increased, the ability of a subject to discern fact from fiction would decrease was partially supported by the findings. The results also suggested that the influence of television as an instructor of statistics about law enforcement might not be significant, but that the influence of television's repetitious portrayal of certain police methods and behaviors might have an impact on adolescents' perceptions of social reality.

The total intellectual, cultural, and sociopolitical environment serves as the explanatory context. Among the values of the perspective are that it views the rhetoric of earlier ages in their own right without imposing alien concerns from another era; it cautions against efforts to recall classical doctrines in attempts to solve contemporary problems; and it directs attention to phenomena which might otherwise have escaped notice, such as the  changing meanings of technical terms. Reservations concerning the use of systems theory as an historiographic perspective include the following: it would not be viewed as an exclusive frame for research; there is an unfortunate tendency to confuse theory and practice under the guise of pluralism; and some aspects of systems theory require considerably more precise definition.

Some proponents of educational voucher plans suggest that putting more control in the hands of individuals through a laissez faire educational system will be in the public interest. John Coons and Stephen Sugarman claim that the family is the ideal educational decision-maker, that the best interest of the child must be given priority in educational decision-making, that this &quot;best interest&quot; lies in the development of the individual's autonomy, and that the quality of education will improve if educational suppliers must meet the demands of their clients. Coons and Sugarman also argue that educational diversity would foster a  consensus supporting the present political system, would prove more democratic, and would reduce racism while increasing integration. These claims have no basis in established fact, but instead form a political argument that appeals to the currently popular but conflicting desires held by a number of widely divergent groups across the country.

Second, the leadership abilities developed in the first phase are applied to a practical improvement project in the  principal's own school. Finally, the principal's experience is assessed and preparations are made to begin again with the first phase. (Author/PGD)",

        "description":"Published descriptions of inservice education for elementary and secondary administrators focus on what is being done, by whom it is being done, and the intent or goals of the programs. Program effectiveness, or the lack thereof, is seldom reported. Studies of inservice programs reveal agreement on program weaknesses but little consensus on the details of alternative processes or on desirable goals. Few inservice programs feature improvement of administrator effectiveness through examination of individual performance and adoption of programs incorporating ongoing development. Typical inservice experiences involve attendance at unrelated, topic-oriented conferences and workshops. Current inservice programs tend to be either informal projects of individual administrators or  specialized short-term programs sponsored by, and meeting the needs of, universities, large urban school districts, state or federal categorical programs, professional associations, or private organizations. The topics covered generally focus on management skills or contemporary issues without addressing the larger question of how the principal can be instrumental in school improvement. (Author/PGD)",

The responses indicated that the collegiate style of governance exists at these schools only in limited form. The presidents displayed very ambivalent views of their faculty members. Typically, they praised their faculties' teaching abilities to the skies but otherwise found the faculties fractious, argumentative, and difficult to deal with. In evaluating their campuses' strengths and weaknesses, the presidents manifestly used subjective norms. They obviously measured their own schools not against national norms but against a small group  of other colleges of the same approximate quality, in the same geographical area, or under the sponsorship of the same sect, as their own.

Data were collected on program history, philosophy, structure, operational characteristics, student characteristics, and program impact. Methods used included open-ended interviews with program staff, administrators, parents, and teachers; direct observation; and a review of student record data for the 1977-78 school year. Findings indicated that no one successful or generic model for an inschool suspension program exists and that districts with such programs will continue to suspend students out of school. Also, no clear or consistent pattern of association exists between membership in a program  and race, sex, grade level, or conduct marks. Recommended for further study are the processes for increasing the meaningful involvement of parents in school discipline and suspension, and the processes for assisting teachers to deal more creatively with discipline-related problems.

A sample of 19 compelled students and 21 self-affiliated students was surveyed. Results showed that self-affiliated students show greater commitment towards their school as a formal organization, including its behavioral and academic expectations and its extracurricular activities. The report provides an analysis of case studies, based on student interviews, of the school accommodation strategies and resulting behavior of students in both groups.

        "description":"This report reviews more than 30 studies that have attempted to measure the importance of size economies in the provision of education, with emphasis on the theoretical, methodological, and empirical basis of each. Size economies refer to a system of obtaining optimum use from funds available. The purposes of the report are (1) to determine the degree to which size economies in education exist; (2) to consider the potential applications of size-economies research; (3) to evaluate the theoretical basis of size-economies literature; (4) to examine the appropriateness of the data sets that have been used; and (5) to analyze the methodology applied in size-economies research. According to the paper, the consistency of the reported results suggests that increased size of elementary  and secondary schools will permit some limited economies. Economies will also result when more students are administered by the same school district. The paper concludes that care should be taken in applying the results because the degree of savings also depends on other factors, such as the quality of education provided and transportation costs.

First, the paper examines the results of a 1979 national survey of Catholic school superintendents and teacher organization heads. The purpose of the survey was to determine attitudes toward and the present status of teacher organizations. The results showed a steady growth in the number of teacher organizations and consensus for establishment of a third party to settle disputes. An analysis of the 1979 Supreme Court decision concluded that church-operated schools do not fall under the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board. The paper concludes that agreement must be reached by both  administrators and teachers on the overall mission of the church, its educational mission, and the place of the school within that mission. Further, models must be developed to take the place of a third party in labor disputes. (Author/LD)",

Among the most-used and most effective measures, according to the 3025 respondents, were providing adequate teacher supervision in hallways and lunch rooms, and keeping schools clean and attractive. One of the most effective measures, in the opinion of the principals, was installing an alarm system, although over one-third of the principals reported they already had one. The findings are  discussed in terms of which measures are most effective, the cost of school vandalism, and how to use the findings. The need for developing more behavioral programs and better cost-reporting systems, and ways of utilizing the results of the study are outlined. (Author/MLF)",

The strongest correlation of the BTBC was with the test of receptive language (TACL). Correlations with the Piagetian tasks were moderate but significant, and were interpreted to mean that the BTBC can be used as a general estimate of cognitive ability. Canonical analysis of all variables revealed the presence of one common factor, language comprehension. Predictive validity was established using the Metropolitan  Readiness Test which was given 8 months later. End of the year placement decisions revealed that low scores on the BTBC correctly identified four of five students who were recommended for placement in special education classrooms. (Author/CL)",

The struggle over the laicization of education, the role of the church in the organization of schools, and the question of language instruction are discussed in their historical context. Part I presents a survey of historical, political, and religious developments from the origin of the Alsatian language in the Middle Ages, through the centuries  of association with both France and Germany, until the eve of World War II in 1939. The second part of the study describes the changes in attitudes that have been occurring since 1940. Particular attention is given to an analysis of the educational statute peculiar to the three departments of the region that insures religious instruction in the schools.

The basic assumption is that effective writing demands a feel for one's audience and a sense of purpose, integrating function (what is being said), situation (to whom it is being said), and grammar (how it is being said). The functions selected are those that students use in writing academic papers. Each lesson begins with exercises introducing expressions for a particular function such as focusing, substantiating, recommending, or predicting. Within each function, students take the roles of different speakers/writers with different purposes in order to practice writing for specific situations. Grammar is related to the expression of a particular situation, fostering both grammatical and  communicative competency in writing. Following the practice, peer correction exercises with guidelines reinforce grammatical points and effective writing techniques. (PMJ)",

College attendance and employment patterns since the 1960's and projected trends for the 1980's are considered. Projections of a shift in employment patterns and a deteriorated market for college graduates are thought to indicate the need for new educational policies. Reasons for current dissatisfaction with the level of support for higher education, from the point of view of institutions, faculties, and students, and prospects for each group if the current level of support continues are discussed. It is suggested that the changing demographic conditions that affect enrollments are likely to force some institutions to close their doors, and to produce a major downturn in the  fortunes of faculty members. The following approaches to student financing are considered: the laissez faire economists' approach, the Swedish model, and the eclectic model. Policy with respect to work-and-study opportunities, the lack of suitable jobs for Ph.D's, and the potential of research universities to conduct research is considered. Responses by Joseph N.

Evaluation focused on the Ford Foundation Graduate Program, original proposals submitted by the 10 universities, annual reports and data submitted by each university, and interviews with presidents, deans, and faculty from the 10 universities participating in the program. Chapter I, (The Program), discusses the development of the program, the experimental design employed, and procedures followed at the Ford Foundation. In Chapter II, (The Outcomes: Data Analysis), the statistical results of the program are examined drawing on the annual reports submitted to the Ford Foundation and  on the separate analyses performed using Doctorate Records File data. Chapter III, (The Outcomes: Site Visits), presents findings from site visits conducted at each of the 10 supported universities. The final chapter offers major conclusions drawn from the study as well as an evaluation of where and why the program went wrong. Among the several conclusions are: the weakened academic labor market undermined the program rationale in the eyes of most faculty and students; staff changes during the program added instability; and the differences of the 10 universities participating in the program made it difficult to form broad generalizations. Appendices provide comparisons of proposed budgets and actual expenditures under the program by university, and lists of individuals interviewed on site  visits at the 10 universities. (LC)",

        "description":"Writing labs should have substantive rather than merely cosmetic effects on student writing. Through a 30-minute writing conference, students can improve the assignment at hand and obtain insight into their own development as writers. The writing instructor has three tasks during a conference: (1) to establish focus, (2) to make a diagnosis, and (3) to teach the lesson itself. Establishing focus involves specifying a student's expectation for the conference and immediate need for the assignment by using a form designed to elicit such information. Making a diagnosis differs in conferences that involve drafts and those that do not. When there is no draft and the student is having trouble getting started, diagnosis and teaching begin together through a heuristic dialogue. When there  is a draft, diagnosis must determine what the student knows and does not know about the writing process. Teaching involves recommending strategies, such as organizational, syntactical, and proofreading strategies, for the student to use in later writing. The teacher leads the student to a fuller development of ideas at hand or to correction of problem areas, making sure that the student is aware of successfully handling part of the writing process.

The first part of the paper offers a detailed explication of Kohlberg's stages of moral development, while the second part provides suggestions for the application of Kohlberg's theory by English teachers. Specific suggestions offered include presenting moral dilemmas to the class to initiate discussion, writing assignments, oral reports, and analyses of literature; having students develop and present original dilemmas as the basis of class discussions and writing assignments; and directing students toward examples of moral dilemmas posed  in literature selections in order to have them evaluate the charcters' responses to those dilemmas and discuss their own responses to them.

The VDT is a computerized device that displays copy on a screen and provides for highly flexible alteration of copy. Six hours of field observation of copy editors on duty was conducted and extensive notes were kept on a minute-by-minute basis. Content analysis of editing changes of four selected wire stories was performed. The results of the study were as follows: the editing system did not substantially interfere with gatekeeping performed at the newspaper; very little actual gatekeeping was done using the VDT, as most evaluation of stories was done using paper copy; and the  combination of several wire stories into one story, copy editing, and headline writing were the major tasks performed on the VDT.

        "description":"Questions concerning the relative protection afforded by the speech and press clauses of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, the law of libel, and protection for the editorial process are the focus of this paper. The first section summarizes arguments for First Amendment press protection, focusing on the question of whether there is a historical basis for making a distinction between the speech and press clauses of the First Amendment, as well as on approaches to the inherent difficulties in defining &quot;press.&quot; The second section discusses implications of the 1974 Supreme Court decision in &quot;Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.,&quot; in which the Supreme Court for the first time applied the constitutional libel defense established in &quot;New York Times Co. v. Sullivan&quot; to media  defendants. It outlines problems with the media-defendant approach taken in the case and notes the reluctance of several state courts to extend the constitutional privilege to nonmedia defendants. In its third section, the paper outlines implications of the 1979 &quot;Herbert v. Lando&quot; case, in which the Supreme Court cast serious doubts on the scope of protection afforded the editorial function of the press. It explains the question posed in the case, discusses the Supreme Court's response, and suggests that a constitutional privilege for the press was not ruled out by the Supreme Court ruling. The paper concludes by observing that the issues involved in the ongoing speech-press debate have received little illumination from recent Supreme Court libel decisions. (GT)",

It notes how Viewdata differs from broadcast Teletext systems and reviews the technical aspects of the two media to clarify terminology used in the systems. The paper suggests, for example, that although Viewdata is marketed as an &quot;interactive&quot; medium, the degree of interaction so far available on the system is still limited. The development of Prestel, a Viewdata system used by the British Post Office, is discussed in detail, and its technical characteristics are described. Some of the problems encountered in introducing the system in Great Britain are considered and the relevance of those  problems to efforts to market the system in the United States are discussed. The paper questions whether the need for the medium has yet been demonstrated beyond the speculations of futurists and calls for market research endeavors. It suggests that a delay in the adoption of any one particular system as standard in the United States would be advantageous in that it would allow competing, and possibly more attractive, systems to be developed further.

Its editor, Robert Walsh, was considered to be one of the leading men of letters of his era. Located in Philadelphia, the 26-year-old Walsh developed a publication to report regularly on the activities of governments in Europe, particularly in Great Britain. His quarterly was modeled after the popular British periodicals, such as the &quot;Annual Register of England,&quot; and the articles concerned matters such as the political struggle between France and Great Britain and also gave attention to President James Monroe and the United States Congress. The publication also contained much nonpolitical  material. Walsh used book reviews, which took the form of lengthy essays; speeches; and essays on history, society, geography, and science. Walsh wrote most of the material himself, but did use contributors when they made manuscripts available. Walsh was forced to cease publication of his magazine after only eight issues because of unfavorable political conditions (his pro-English position was unpopular in 1812), lack of contributors, and few subscribers.

Based upon the conceptual models found in a wide range of literature on consulting, the four roles used in the study were: (1) expert prescriber, in which the practitioner operates as the authority on both public relations problems and their solutions; (2) communication technician, in which the practitioner provides the organization or client with the specialized skills needed to carry out public relations programs; (3) communication facilitator, in which the practitioner acts as a sensitive \"go-between\" or information broker; and (4) problem-solving process facilitator, in which the practitioner, as a member of the management team,  collaborates with others throughout the organization to define and solve problems. A sample of 458 members of the Public Relations Society of America (72% men and 28% women) completed a 28-item survey form about the roles they played. The findings showed that men and women differed significantly on the four roles measured.

        "description":"Journalism on the agricultural frontier of the Old Northwest territory of the United States was shaped by a variety of cultural forces and environmental factors and took on diverse forms. Bridging the gap between the two cultural forms of written correspondence and printed news was a third form: the handwritten newspaper. Between 1844 and 1854 there were at least three handwritten newspapers published in the frontier town of Washington, Iowa. They were the &quot;Domestic Quarterly Review,&quot; the &quot;Washington Shark,&quot; and the &quot;Quarterly Visitor.&quot; Though this genre was not peculiar to the agricultural frontier, the appearance of these particular papers can be understood in terms of their demographic and biographic contexts. During its first 15 years, Washington was without a printing press.  The town had developed as an agricultural center rather than as a trade or business center, and because of its relative isolation, its population had remained modest in size. Possibly because of their relative isolation, the editors and their readers turned to the handwritten papers as one means of recreating the cultural world they had known. The editors, who were lawyers, politicians, and educators, may have tried to create a communications environment that could embody their own cultural and professional values and provide a mode of discourse to which they had grown accustomed.

Of the 320 employees polled, 95 supplied usable data. There was only limited support for the hypotheses tested, with weak evidence supporting the idea that employees who were highly integrated into the organization tended to have higher overall readership of the newsletter than employees less highly integrated into the organizational system. Similarly, there was only  partial support for the hypothesis that a higher level of functional integration into the organization correlated with higher readership. The least amount of support existed for the hypothesis that higher integration in the sociability network correlated with higher readership of newsletter content dealing with the sociability network. The data did offer some support for the theoretical model used; there were numerous, fairly strong relationships between purposes, readership, and level of career aspiration. It was proposed that the psychological aspects of integration within the organization were useful in predicting employee purposes for reading company newsletters. (RL)",

If the need to maintain balanced speech programs (emphasizing both skills and nonskills courses) is recognized and acted upon, the results of these studies can help in many ways. The results can be used to support the need to build and maintain strong programs of speech  communication and strong oral communication components in the general education requirements. Advisers who are aware of the results can do a better job of directing students into elective courses in speech communication, courses that can serve the students' professional needs.

It was suggested that these findings resulted from intervening variables, such as an adverse working environment, dissatisfaction, and perceived high opportunity. These results highlighted some of the logical problems with identifying intervening variables, the need for an alternative method of statistical analysis, and the possibility of a &quot;satisfaction threshold&quot; below which traditional  correlates lose their predictive ability. In short, the study implied that information about the present organizational climate and satisfaction with working conditions were valuable in the selection of correlates to turnover, the interpretation of statistical information, and the identification of possible intervening variables.

        "description":"Under Ohio's existing educational finance plan, the power of school districts to purchase the educational resources commensurate with each district's educational needs is far from equal. Consideration of four specific potential reforms, separately and in combination, indicates that greater equity can be obtained. If Ohio is to avoid substantial increases in the tax burden on voters, property tax diversion is the most plausible means of gaining equalization leverage in school finance. Property tax diversion would sharply reduce those inequities due to wealth disparities among districts, but it would tend to hurt central city districts. Introducing a poverty factor would bring substantial relief to high poverty districts. Introducing a cost factor would bring relief to districts  that face high resource costs. A package of the four reforms would be extremely effective in enhancing equity in Ohio school finance, while also permitting a continued role for school district financial discretion. These reforms have been tested by use of a computer simulation. An appendix presents part of the user's manual for this simulation program, to provide the reader an opportunity to study the program's power and limitations. (Author/PGD)",

The paper concludes that the model can be improved in three areas. Salary data can be refined and brought up to date. More factors contributing to staff adequacy levels can be identified. Finally, the model can be observed over time to see if it consistently predicts school district behavior. (Author/LD)",

From the 53 schools closed in New York City since 1975, six schools were selected for study. Of the six schools, three are vacant, two are used by private organizations, and one by the board of education. Data on indicators of neighborhood change in each of the six communities were collected from city and local sources. In those cases where alternate uses were developed for empty school buildings, the neighborhood retained its character and its style; where buildings were vacant, crime and decay appeared to spread, and the fabric of the neighborhood was torn. The following problems in finding alternate uses for closed schools are identified:  lack of coordination among agencies at the city and community level; ineffective strategies for protecting school buildings prior to reuse; and absence of strategic and long-term planning for marketing surplus schools. These problems are discussed and recommendations made for their solutions. (Author/MLF)",

        "description":"The federal government became involved in the development of public school curriculum in order to pursue broadly accepted national goals. During the first two decades of federal curriculum activity, however, the country became increasingly fragmented socially and politically, making the federal role more complex and controversial. Federal attempts at curriculum revision have affected materials and teaching activities, but have often ignored the wishes, habits, and needs of users. Still, an unprecedented degree of intrusiveness of federal regulation into the teaching process has become acceptable. Federal education policy tends to be a melange of the often conflicting policies of different special interest groups and governmental bureaus. In most cases these interests hope to  develop curriculum changes at, diffuse them from, and evaluate them by a central agency--the federal government--without encouraging development of new policies in the field. Federal involvement in curriculum can be understood and interpreted from three analytical perspectives: the technological perspective was most important when there was a high consensus on national goals; the political and cultural perspectives have become important as the society has divided. Consideration suggests favoring strategies for change based on teacher initiatives and designed to meet varied, complex, and sometimes contradictory demands. (Author/PGD)",

Questionnaires were given to juniors and seniors as well as counselors in 29 public high schools in the San Francisco (California) Bay region in 1978. The survey posed questions about students' knowledge and use of four options that were available in all 29 schools: work experience programs, early graduation, concurrent enrollment in a college or university, and taking the California High School Proficiency Examination (CHSPE). Variables that contributed to understanding student use of a particular option, discussed in this paper, include student attitudes and experience while in school, counselors' attitudes, attributes of individual  students, and students' stated reasons for using or not using options. A detailed account is given of the CHSPE alternative. The paper concludes that the main limitation of CHSPE and the other options is that they do not increase the total number of jobs available in the economy, a desired result of participation in these programs. A lengthy appendix offers a reproduction of the survey instrument and an analysis of the methodology used. (Author/LD)",

Also included in this chapter are studies that provide conceptual work on the issues of &quot;adequacy&quot; and &quot;equity,&quot; which are central to federal, state, and local activities in school  finance. Chapter 2 describes the majority of the analytical work, organized around the four major policy areas. The culmination of the study plan is in Chapter 3, which focuses on optional strategies and designs for the federal role in education finance. An extensive appendix provides more indepth information on the study plan, including its development and implementation. (Author)",

This essay is in reply to a related essay, in which another author identified the consequences of what he perceived as a minimalist judicial role and called for greater exercise of responsibility by the courts. Replying to those assertions, this essay describes the race and schooling issue as at once judicial and political and identifies a role for courts in strengthening a genuinely political process, one which reckons with the wishes of black as well as white constituents.

This article summarizes findings concerning the effects and costs of various tactics that public agencies should employ to influence student enrollment decisions. First, the paper describes three phases in the student choice process and outlines relevant empirical results. Next, it assesses nine typical tactics for influencing enrollments, and it rates the tactics' efficiency. Implications for policy and research round out the article with the conclusion that using new tactics--such as specialized academic help, financial aid, and information dissemination--will be a wiser choice than relying more heavily on old ones.

        "description":"Many members of the educational community today believe that political pressures have a major effect on education policy and institutions. This paper discusses four barriers that impede teachers and administrators who must cope with these new political pressures. The four barriers include the problem of meanings and definitions, the lack of perspective due to frustration over meanings, doubts about systematic investigation of political processes and behavior in education, and a sense of professional powerlessness among educators. The discussion draws from research in political science and sociology and from work by scholars in the area of the politics of education. The latter includes results from a team project concerned with exploring the education policy process at the state  level in Australia and the United States. The paper concludes that the four barriers can be overcome: (1) by making meanings clearer; (2) by understanding how political and educational processes are interrelated; (3) by accepting the possibility of systematic exploration of political phenomena; and (4) by recognizing the critical role of professional expertise.

In Experiment 1, 20 deaf college students received an interpreted, videotaped presentation of one lecture and a printed presentation of a second lecture, with the two lecture topics counterbalanced. Immediately after each lecture, students wrote down the important information they could remember. The recall protocols were scored for the rated importance level of the ideas they contained. Students recalled more idea units rated as important when the lecture was printed than when it was interpreted. Furthermore, they recalled more units at all levels when the lecture was printed than when it was interpreted. In Experiment 2,  16 postsecondary level deaf students received one interpreted lecture and then a second interpreted lecture on a different topic. Students again recalled more units rated as important. In addition, recall of the second lecture was greater than that of the first. (Author/SBH)",

Multiple regression and correlational techniques were used. The regression equation formed of the nine most significant variables accounted for 64% of the total variance in effective mainstreaming. Significant variables included clarity of school mainstreaming goals, staff knowledge, communication between principal and special educators, principal's advocacy and leadership style, and school size. It is concluded that successful implementation of mainstreaming depends on a more systemwide approach involving the whole school.  (Author/CL)",

The program involved graduation to on site training in dishwashing, bussing, and utility-maintenance. Specific vocational skills as well as personal and social skills (such as grooming, bus riding, and time management) were emphasized. Training time, cost, and employment statistics are reported, indicating that 35 of 39 persons trained and placed in jobs during the project are currently employed. Among conclusions noted are that mentally  retarded adults respond to a direct approach toward terminal employment objectives and that prevocational training for post high school adults may be costly, unnecessary, and nonproductive; that most performance problems can be reduced or eliminated through training; that behavioral standards for mentally retarded adults should be the same as for nonretarded adults; and that there are disincentives in the welfare system for vocational education programs for mentally retarded adults.

Parent participation is necessary both because it has been mandated by law and because parents have an influence on their children and provide a valuable resource in career education. Alternative delivery systems, such as newsletters and teacher home visitations should be considered. Parents may be reluctant to become involved due to negative previous experiences with schools and school personnel or because they have found it difficult to articulate their concerns. Teachers need to display interest, acceptance, and empathy as well as honesty, objectivity, and dependability. Effective interaction needs to be established through such techniques as careful planning  of conferences, and teachers must be prepared to recruit parent involvement and establish an ongoing communication system with parents.

Data was collected by personal interview of teachers and parents of children enrolled in the programs. Transition practices, including mainstreaming efforts, were found to be inadequately planned and implemented. Program entrance and exit standards were not clearly defined and sending and receiving teachers had limited contact in program and placement decisions. Actual and preferred parental involvement data for nine parental roles were collected. Discrepancies were found that suggested confusion by both teachers and parents regarding appropriate and productive parental involvement.

        "description":"In a study extending and refining Carol Chomsky's research, 48 Arabic speaking children aged six, eight, and ten were tested for their comprehension of imperatives using the complement-requiring verbs Ask, Tell, and Promise. Clear support for children's overgeneralization of the minimal distance principle was found only with Promise constructions. When a classification error by Chomsky (including a more complex sentence among her simplest Ask/Tell Case) was corrected by making a new case of this construction, it was found to be much harder than all but Chomsky's most difficult type. Overall, there was a strong tendency to interpret both Asks and Tells as direct speech, and therefore to ask the why clause. In the case of Ask constructions this leads to asking with the wrong  subject. There were definite, age related Ask stages based on correct subject assignment. It is proposed that comprehensibility is not, as Chomsky claimed, simply one to complement clause complexity defined as the number of deletions from suface. (Author/SW)",

Four aspects of the question are treated: (1) linguistic minorities in the U. S., especially those of Hispanic and German origin; (2) the history of Franco-Americans; (3) the present state of French in Louisana; and (4) the typically French character of Louisiana. Historically, Franco Americans fall into three groups, namely, the descendents of the Acadians who settled in Louisiana, 19th century immigrants who settled all over the U. S., and the Quebecois who migrated to New England. The discussion of the French in Louisiana covers the three periods in Louisiana history, the three geo-cultural regions of the state, and a demographic study. With  regard to the French language, the study treats the varieties of French spoken today, French usage, geographic distribution and language, and the character of Acadiana, or French Louisiana. The Final section of the study deals with the universally-recognized French character of the region, a character that goes beyond language usage. Particular attention is given to French national characteristics, typically French geographic traits and markedly French religious, linguistic, cultural and political influences. Numerous maps and tables are appended. (AMH)",

The subjects of the first part were sixth graders in two different programs, one a core program and the other an immersion program. The subjects of the learning study were secondary school students and adults. The purpose of the study was: (1) to develop appropriate research methodologies, (2) to understand language teaching and learning processes by observing them under different conditions, and (3) to indicate the possible interrelations between teaching and learning in formal classrooms. Each part of the investigation describes the relevant research model and reports on the application of the model to some issues, specifically, the effects of the learning setting, the age of the learner and  the attained level of proficiency. The instrument in the teaching section analyzes teaching activities and the discourse functions that characterize the verbal interaction between teacher and students. The learning study model attempts to account for the way in which information about the language is assimilated by the learner, represented by the learner as knowledge, and then used to form language responses. The teaching instrument identifies some essential differences in language teaching in the two types of classes; the learning model indicated that explicit and implicit information about language have unique roles in the solution of specific language tasks.

After a historical discussion of various manifestations of liberal education through the ages, recent strains of liberal education alternatives are reviewed. Seven major trends in liberal education during the 1970s are identified: the movement back to a required, integrated group of courses or experiences under a \"core\" curriculum; renewed interest in relating the outcomes of liberal education to curricular programs; redefinition of liberal education in terms of process and not simply content; a move away from the traditional exclusive emphasis on reason  and intellect; a new focus on values or moral education; development of new relationships between the liberal arts and the professions; and redesigned curriculum structures such as degrees, credits, administrative structures and calendar arrangements. Given these particular educational trends, the recent models of Bergquist, Chance and Conrad are examined using criteria of content, process, and outcomes to isolate further trends in liberal education theory. Finally, distributive, integrative and competence-based models of liberal education are arrived at which subsume previous models and which offer new insights into future trends in the liberal tradition. A lengthy bibliography is appended. (DC)",

A brief survey form was mailed to the heads of humanities departments at 31 Western universities that offer doctoral degrees in English, history and philosophy. The form asked respondents to estimate number of doctorates to be conferred until 1982, whether doctoral awards would increase or decrease in 1983-84, and how nonacademic employment would affect doctoral candidates. Results showed that English departments report aggregate estimates of increased numbers of doctorates in the next three  years, while history departments show an increase from June 1980 to June 1981, then a sharp decline to June 1982. The estimated number of doctorates in philosophy is greater than the average of degrees conferred over the past five years. It was estimated that most programs would stabilize their doctoral population and try to control initial large numbers of doctoral awards to prospective candidates. History departments were the most active in preparing graduates for nonacademic careers; philosophy departments least active.

It is suggested that academic education, as opposed to education outside the classroom, attempts to teach a student information and skills, yet a good portion of that information is forgotten. On the other hand, what a person is interested in and has learned independently may be retained better. In using self-paced instruction in the classroom, students are encouraged to make use of the resources offered by the teacher and to set their own tasks at their own pace. In a self-paced class, students are encouraged to decide which and how many tests they wish to pass, they are given a number of chances to gain mastery over the material covered by a single test, they are encouraged to select readings which relate to their interests,  and they know in advance what evaluation corresponds to the goals they set for themselves.

Part I (Analyzing the Request for Data) discusses the importance of understanding the reasonableness and complexity of the request. Part II (Collecting the Data) offers six management steps involved in data collection: (1) informing relevant units or departments; (2) checking existing data bases to avoid duplication; (3) preparing report formats; (4) actual collection activity; (5) tabulating and editing of data; and (6) forwarding and filing of data. Part III (Monitoring the External Agency's Analysis of the Data) discusses the need for monitoring and control by  representatives of the colleges and universities which agency staff claim to have analyzed. Part IV (Review of the Agency's Use of Data in Decision-Making) focuses on the importance of knowing what data is examined by the agency; only data used in decisionmaking should be emphasized in the report. The final part (Evaluating Data Reporting Procedures) suggests that once every three years colleges and university administrators should compile a careful record of the number of data requests and responses in order to develop the best system for reporting. It is suggested that knowing the agency's purpose and use for the request enables the institution to respond with a tailor-made response; therefore, paperwork and staff energy are kept to a minimum.

Relationships between the cognitive level of the professor's question and the overall cognitive levels of both the professors and students are analyzed. The sample included 40 professors in four institutions. Four audio tapes were made per professor in the course of a semester. The tapes were analyzed according to the Amidon Multiple Category System, the Florida Taxonomy  of Cognitive Behavior, and the Aschner-Gallagher System. Statistical analyses of the results revealed that many of the classes were void of intellectual interchange between faculty and students, and lacked vigor. It is proposed that the technique of questioning is potentially more useful, and that faculty development programs could include training in this technique. (Author/MSE)",

The algorithms were decomposed into term weighting schemes and similarity measures, representatively selected from those known to exist in information retrieval environments, before being tested on documents submitted by specific clearinghouses to the CIJE database. Searches were conducted using information need statements from individuals with interests congruent to the database, and documents retrieved by professional searchers were judged for relevance by those submitting the need statements. This input was analyzed according to the ability of the algorithms to move relevant documents toward the beginning of the output  list using the coefficient of ranking effectiveness (CRE). While it is possible to significantly improve the order of the output using either a controlled vocabulary or free text, the ranking is at best about 20 percent effective at this time. It is suggested that the factors currently used in ranking algorithms are not likely to make ranking closer to 100 percent effective. A bibliography of 58 references is included. (Author/RAA)",

Methods for enhancing the understanding of the physical relations in equipment, the hierarchical analysis and practice of sub-skills, and the general logic of searching behavior are aspects considered. The &quot;aiding&quot; approach provides technicians with an information base in special booklets, diagrams, computer programs, and directed sequences. The &quot;maintainability&quot; approach concentrates on designing equipments for troubleshooting ease. When these approaches are applied to troubleshooting problems, the great majority can be solved. For troubleshooting equipments already in service, proceduralized aiding is probably the best  for immediate solutions, especially for many one term military technicians. Aids must be designed from a behavioral standpoint and be specially prepared, tested, and debugged. The most effective aids, however, will not find all troubles, and people with relatively deep skill levels will always be required. To provide such people, research is needed in the visualization and memory of complex physical events, the learning of long branching sequences, individual differences in search behavior, and enhancement of human reasoning by small computerized devices.

Bibliometric methods were used to provide measurement of the nature and currency of books, magazines, encyclopedias, newspapers, government documents, and pamphlets referenced by students. A sample of 15 high schools representing five school districts and two independent schools provided data on 1,845 students from 73 classes. Four major sources of data were (1) bibliographies (or reference lists) of student papers; (2) a questionnaire survey of students describing facilities used; (3) a survey of teachers on assignments, instructions  given students, and type of library skills provided; and (4) interviews with school librarians on user services and collection policies. Book reports were examined as a separate investigation, and a separate analysis was performed to describe lists of recommended titles included in 19 bibliographic publications used as selection tools by high school librarians. Among these tools were the Senior High School Catalog, the Junior High School Catalog, the National Association of Independent Schools list, and lists of award books. (Author/RAA)",

The report first discusses the origins and consequences of four trends affecting vocational education: the growing demand for part-time, adult continuing education; increased demands for accountability; the exhaustibility of resources; and changes in the workplace creating worker dissatisfaction, labor underutilization, and increased investment in research and development. A planning process designed to keep technical education viable in light of these forces is then presented, incorporating: (1) the establishment of protocol and planning structures; (2) methods of reaching consensus on the proper role of the college in society; (3)  methods of specifying planning goals; (4) program development techniques to achieve these goals; and (5) a personnel development component which takes into account the various stages of individual development and helps faculty adjust to non-traditional students and teaching methods. Next, the leadership roles which colleges and professional associations can play are examined in terms of setting national educational policy, educating legislators, and achieving public credibility.

        "description":"Grade reports supplied by California State University at Los Angeles (CSULA) for the 1978-79 academic year were used to assess the academic performance of the 503 Los Angeles City College (LACC) students who transferred to CSULA in Fall 1978, Winter 1979, Spring 1979, and Summer 1979. These data indicate that 23% of the transfer students failed to complete any work at CSULA during their first quarter; 57% of them withdrew without penalty. Of the 388 students who completed some work, 37% earned a \"B\" average or better, and 21% fell below the \"C\" level. Highest grade point averages (GPA's) were earned in Pan Afro studies, Music, Physical Education, and Spanish; lowest grades (below 2.25) were earned in Physics, Criminal Justice, Business, and Geography. While the average  pre-transfer GPA for students (2.67) was the highest in 12 years, the average GPA earned by these students after transfer to CSULA (2.43) was the lowest for the 12-year period; the most significant decline was registered by students enrolled in the School of Letters and Science. A decline was also seen in the number of transfers who completed work--the 1978-79 figure is less than half of that from 1969-70 and is a 30% decrease from 1977-78. Graphs and tables illustrating the academic performance of LACC transfer students at CSULA since 1968 are provided. (JP)",

        "description":"In October 1979, a study was conducted to collect information about faculty and administrative salaries in Illinois community colleges for use by State agencies in justifying budget requests and by colleges in determining salaries for the coming years. The survey focused on the number of full- and part-time faculty, faculty salaries based on actual contracts, faculty salaries from salary schedules, part-time faculty salary rates, overload salary rates, total fiscal year (W-2 type) faculty salaries, average faculty load information, faculty organizations, employment benefits, and salaries of key administrators. The survey revealed that the state average of the mean academic year contractual salaries actually paid to full-time faculty was $18,849 during 1979-80; the average  12-month salary was $20,289. According to salary schedules, instructors with a Master's Degree earned from $12,227 to $24,402, depending upon their years of experience. Part-time faculty salary rates ranged from $185 to $315 per course semester hour, averaging $240 during the fall 1979 term. The average overload rate for full-time faculty was $332 per course semester hour. The number of part-time teaching faculty increased by 0.4% to 10,266, while the number of full-time faculty decreased 0.6% to 4,935.

To cope with these threatening issues, a strategic planning process must be developed which places significant emphasis on the resources to be integrated and coordinated. Such a process must include a pre-planning phase, a needs assessment mechanism, a mission statement, achievable institutional goals, comprehensiveness in scope, a key planning officer, executive management commitment, involvement of staff on all levels, short- and long-range goals, a cyclical structure, use of information as the basis for planning, data  collection and coordination of information linkages, flexibility, a priority-setting mechanism, a tie between planning and budgeting, institutional research, synchronization with state planning processes, and a routinely updated master plan. A second major management component over which institutions must gain better control in the future, is information resource management. Extending beyond the traditional scope of computing services, information processing in the future should also include text management and computer/communications networks, in order to bridge the information gap between data processing and the management decision-making process.

The survey instrument, which was administered in class, solicited information on: age; marital status; race; citizenship; parents' life situation, educational attainment, and occupation; residence; college attended; class and full-/part-time status; college finances; employment; majors; pre-college activity; reasons for college choice; occupational choice and salient factors in career  choice; plans for Lhe future with regard to work pattern, salary, employer, ease in finding a job, job-hunting techniques, residence, marriage, and family. The men who were surveyed were asked if they expected their wives to work, especially after having children. In addition, students were asked about their experiences with counselors and faculty advisors, and about problems they had experienced at college. The study report examines the lack of research related to women at two-year colleges and analyzes study findings with special emphasis on women students who chose non-traditional careers. (JP)",

The development of the agreements involved: (1) an examination of program competencies by high school and college faculty; (2) the determination of the level at which the high school student has met the minimum criteria for completion of beginning college courses; and (3) the establishment of procedures for credentialing the student's competence by means of advanced placement,  awarding of college credit, or challenge examination. The evaluation of the articulation process, which involved surveying student participants and monitoring their progress as they completed degree requirements, revealed that the process increased college enrollments and student satisfaction; 85% of the secretarial students, for example, who entered the program via the agreement, came to the college and chose the program because of the articulation process. A project is currently underway to effect system-wide articulation at the program level. The articulation agreement and forms used in the program are appended. (JP)",

Part I first presents the findings of a review of the literature on biology curricula, focusing on core curricula; course content; introductory courses; prerequisites; and courses for biology and non-biology majors, and allied health and remedial students. Next, the catalog and schedule analysis is presented, covering biology course offerings, target student groups, prerequisites and course sequences, institutional characteristics, and introductory courses. Part II examines instructional  practices revealed in the literature and in the instructor survey. The literature review assessed the use of modules, laboratories, and textbooks, while the instructor survey considered student characteristics, instructional modes, use of class time and instructional materials, grading practices, desired student competencies, course goals, and out-of-class activities. Part III looks at the biology faculty in terms of degree attainment, employment status, teaching experience, selection of course materials, use of support services, and working conditions.

Next, it is noted that representatives from Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee reported that little or no impact had been felt from tax limitation legislation on community college education. In contrast, reports are then presented from 17 states, which detail changes in educational mission and college programming, governance and management, staffing, and financing that are directly attributable to such legislation. The  17 states are: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and Washington.

In addition, data were collected and analyzed on students' sex, entry age, marital status, high school background, entry status, educational  objectives, program of study during last semester in attendance, full- or part-time status, average semester hours attempted, cumulative grade point average, and cumulative credit completion ratio. Summary findings demonstrate similar patterns of persistence among the three entry groups. Moderate persisters comprised approximately 40% of each group, followed by non-persisters (25%), graduates (14%), extreme persisters (10%), and stop-outs (9%). Data tables illustrate statewide data.

Harmon Pierce and Rosemary Miller describe the program at a large urban institution, while Michael Parsons outlines the operation of a staff development program  for smaller colleges. Richard Greenwood describes activities designed to integrate part-time faculty into college life. Edward Decker focuses on colleges with a predominantly part-time staff. In the third section, Joseph DeSantis advances a design for a state support system; Louis Albert and Rollin Watson address current legal issues; and Richard Beman recounts the rewards and frustrations of being a part-time instructor. Finally, Michael Parsons recommends specific actions to achieve parity for part-time faculty and Donna Sillman cites relevant documents from the ERIC junior colleges collection. (AYC)",

Each of the three parts of the report reviews pertinent literature, reports study methodology and findings, and discusses trends and implications. Part I outlines trends in economics curricula and analyzes study findings as they relate to course offerings in six disciplinary areas: introductory courses, principles of economics courses, business related, technology related, American Economics, and special topics. Also considered are prerequisites, the distribution of courses by college governance and size, and the level  of economics literacy experienced at two-year colleges. Part II notes the rapid growth of the number of students taking their introductory economics course at two-year colleges, discusses the lack of published literature dealing with economics instruction at these institutions, and presents survey findings illustrating enrollment and completion rates, the various instructional modes and materials used, and the grading practices that are most often employed. Part III discusses economics faculty, their status, and the assistance available to them. Summary conclusions and recommendations, a bibliography, and the questionnaire are included. (JP)",

The remainder of the manual is presented as a checklist of potential ideas to be explored in establishing a student retention program. A section of questions identifying essential student information precedes checklists of typical student needs and criteria for the evaluation of retention research. The next section of the manual considers retention and college programs in terms of: administrative understanding of and commitment to the retention program; course scheduling; the faculty; student  services (e.g., financial aid, job placement, counseling, advising, career planning, admissions, and registration); community relations; library resources; the business office; the support staff; and the security office. Institutional policies are discussed next, and questions are presented to help colleges evaluate their admissions, placement, transfer, grading, withdrawal, and appeals policies. The influence of student goals on persistence and typical dropout behavior are described to help identify potential dropouts before they withdraw.

Data were collected and analyzed on headcount enrollment and students' age; sex; program; status as continuing, new, or transfer students; citizenship; permanent and local residence; and semester hours carried. Major findings revealed that 3,047 regular students were enrolled in credit courses, representing a 9% increase from the previous summer's enrollment of 2,807. Further analysis of the data indicated that: (1) the number of males decreased from the previous year by nine students, while the number of females increased by 242; (2) 30% of the students were liberal arts majors, 28% were in vocational programs, and  41% were unclassified; (3) the majority of the students enrolled were continuing students; (4) the mean student age was 26.5 years; and (5) the students carried an average load of 4.1 credit hours and generated 12,485 semester hours.

First, Jerry Johnson discusses the various ways in which developmental education staff in Oregon attack the problem of the high risk student. His analysis includes a description of such students, an examination of the inadequacy of traditional educational methods in meeting their needs, and an enumeration of the administrative and instructional steps that can be taken to improve the chances of student success. Next, Jewell Manspeaker addresses  the issue of the entering characteristics and abilities of community college students and points out factors to be considered in designing an economically efficient, entry-level assessment system. Bill Segura then examines current faculty advising practices in Oregon and discusses the characteristics of successful developmental advising programs. Finally, Richard White explores the problem of providing adequate career development services within the limitations of personnel, budget, and time. Each essay includes a selected bibliography.

Staff development activities in selected districts focused on ways to increase the continuity of children's learning experiences. Children in those districts were compared with children in districts with less continuity. Statistical controls were used for age, level of mother's education, family income, and cognitive performance at the beginning of PreK. On the Cognitive Abilities Test and on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, the children in high-continuity districts surpassed  children in districts with less continuity in both general reasoning and knowledge of verbal concepts. These findings provide evidence of the effectiveness of activities to strengthen continuity in children's educational experiences when those activities follow a developmental PreK program.

A total of 95 persons working in 32 child care centers in San Francisco were interviewed by telephone. One-fifth of the centers in the city were represented and both public and private centers were included. Each category of center was proportinately represented and centers were randomly selected within each category. Scaled interview items provided data on training, experience and education of staff, job responsibilities, wages, hours of paid and unpaid work, benefits, center structure, adult to child ratio, break and substitute policy, frequency of meetings and topics discussed, and how decisions were made in centers. Open-ended questions sought to ascertain sources of tension and  satisfaction, frequency and reasons for turnover, and changes staff would like to see in their centers. Information about center budgets and sources of funding was solicited separately from center administrators. Major findings are reported in summary form. Essentially, the data confirm the commonly held assumption that child care staff are underpaid and overworked, and suggest that the high rate of turnover and &quot;burn-out&quot; of child care personnel is linked to working conditions and job satisfaction based on job title, funding source and length of program day. Suggestions for changes within and beyond the child care center are made. (Author/RH)",

A sample of 80 children in nursery-kindergarten, first, second and third grades (ages ranging from 4-9 years) were divided into two groups. An abstract painting by Kandinsky was shown individually to each child. Children were told, &quot;Look at this picture and tell me what you wonder about it.&quot; Group A children's responses were followed by questions from the interviewer. Children in Group B were not given questioning replies, but were responded to with positive statements. All subjects were the interviewer's past or present students. Findings indicate that, in comparison to positive replies, a teacher's questioning reply to a child's  question does not produce increases in children's questioning behavior. Apparently, age is a factor, not only in children's ability to ask questions, but also in their ability to understand what a question is. A relationship between the responses of the interviewer and the level of the child's questions was found. When the interviewer replied to the child's question with a question, the child responded with a higher level question. Subjects who had younger siblings and whose mothers had been home during the subjects' first two years asked more questions than did other children. Black children tended to make more responses than did others. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"The empirical phase of this two-phased project was focused on identifying children's sex-stereotypes about adult occupations and testing the use of role-reversed stories as a method of modifying those attitudes within school settings. Subjects were first through fifth grade children from each of a suburban, a small town and a rural school. Children were pretested with an instrument designed to measure children's attitudes about who \"can\" do various jobs. First, third and fifth grade children were randomly selected for an experimental treatment consisting of a series of stories about characters in each of four occupations. Children in a control group continued their regular school activities. Post tests asking both \"can\" and \"should\" questions were administered two weeks after  treatment and, in one school, after approximately one year. Findings indicate that models can affect children's attitudes toward gender stereotypes, but long term or repeated exposure to the nontraditional models is likely to be necessary to produce significant or permanent change. Project dissemination phase activities intervened in the stereotyping process by acquainting school personnel with the findings of this study (contained in articles prepared for journal publication) and by training them (through workshops and presentations) to help children develop flexible ideas about women and men in various jobs. Including the stories about occupations, materials related to both phases of the project are appended. (Author/RH)",

Comprehension monitoring, the ability to evaluate one's level of understanding of incoming messages, was assessed using two separate tasks. In the first (referential task), the child took the role of the listener in a referential communication situation and was asked to monitor his comprehension of the speaker's messages. In the second (game-learning task), the child learned a new game by listening to rules presented by an adult, and was asked to indicate when he had heard enough rules to play the game. The subjects were 12 younger LD boys (7-8 years of age), 12 older LD boys (9-10 years), 12 younger and 10 older normal boys matched on age and IQ with the LD  subjects. Results showed that compared to normals, LD children made more comprehension monitoring errors for both adequate and inadequate messages on the referential task, and were more likely to say they knew how to play before they had heard enough rules on the game-learning task. Possible explanations of the results in terms of inattention or impulsivity of the LD children were considered and rejected. No age effects were observed. Thus, the major finding was that, relative to a matched sample of normals, LD children were deficient in comprehension monitoring skills. (Author)",

The importance of understanding the influence of subject characteristics in self-control studies, while often ignored in actual research, has been repeatedly advocated verbally. This paper presents a study designed to explore and confirm the relevance of subject characteristics such as language level, attribution of personal causality, and relationship with the therapist to CSI training outcome. In a treatment analogue study, 15 children received CSI training and 15 were in an attention control group. The children, aged 72 to 139 months, were from a non-clinical population attending a summer day camp. Each child participated in a subject measure  assessment, pre- and post-training assessments, and two 20 minute training sessions. Training materials for both groups included tasks which varied in their similarity to the assessment measure. The CSI group improved more than the control group on Porteus Mazes; both groups improved over time on other measures. Cognitive maturity, personal attributions of causality, private speech, and therapist ratings were related for the CSI group to improvement on the Porteus Mazes but not the other measures. These same subject variables, especially the attribution measure, were related for the control group to all outcome measures. Prediction and detection of treatment versus practice effects are discussed. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"This paper investigates the effects of age and sex on the spontaneous helping behavior of preschool children. Forty-six middle-class children, 22 boys and 24 girls, attending school in a small city in northeastern Kansas took part in the study. Children were divided by median split into younger and older groups. Taped interactions of children with a needy confederate were rated on four measures representing various components of the broad dimension of helpfulness: (1) latency (in seconds) to the child's first clearly helpful response, (2) extent of spontaneous sharing, (3) degree of verbal and physical involvement with the confederate, and (4) extent of overall helpfulness. The average of two trained independent judges' ratings was used as the measure for each child on each of  the four dimensions. Results indicate that older female preschoolers responded more quickly to the needs of a distressed confederate and received higher ratings on sharing, involvement, and overall helpfulness scales than did males or younger females. These findings suggest a developmental progression from lesser to greater helpfulness for preschool girls, but not for preschool boys, in a situation where the needy other's affective cues are salient.

Learning set (LS) acquisition refers to an improvement in performance across a series of problems which have a common basis of solution. The design of this study involved two groups, one in which the positive stimulus on Trial 2 involved the introduction of a novel dimension (Novelty-Positive), and one in which the negative stimulus involved novelty (Novelty-Negative). The novel dimension introduced was color, and was preceded by both rewarded and nonrewarded first trials. Twenty-four 3-year-old children were randomly assigned to one of the two experimental treatments. The results supported the novelty hypothesis in that performance was significantly better in group  Novelty-Positive than in group Novelty-Negative. No significant reward differential was found in this experiment as has been found in other studies (e.g., Moss &amp; Harlow, 1947). The result of the present experiment replicates a similar finding reported by Callaghan and Cameron (1978). (Author/SS)",

Instead of the pastoral subsistence farm of the past, rural America is becoming primarily non-agricultural with employment in service industries increasing to nearly 70%. High technology manufacturing is locating in rural areas because it does not need to be near natural resources or energy and because rural locations offer desirable life style options to highly skilled employees. Rural educational opportunities are improving especially at the post-secondary and adult levels. While these changes offer rural areas the potential to break out of  the cycle of rural poverty, they create new problems of interdependence which affect local government. Rural advanced industrialism may be found in all states, but is concentrated in the 16 most developed states; together these states have 22.8% of the U.S. nonmetropolitan population. (Author)",

The agriculture sector of the U.S. economy, for example, can be classified as production, education/research, and agribusiness. Discriminant analysis of questionnaires showed residence preference to be a (situs) dimension countermanding societal and monetary status when a career as producer was chosen by ag-career undergraduates in 15 Southern land-grant colleges (1067 white males of a 15% 1977 sample). In contrast, the education/research oriented men opted for more education and had more prior ag education  experiences than the agribusiness oriented. The status range from mid-rank farm manager to laborer in production agriculture compared in the same region (Cosby &amp; Frank 1978) with the higher ranges of educators and agribusinessmen (professor, ag agent, top-rank veterinarian, landscape architect). Situs opportunity parameters based on family residence background entered into career choices, validating Benoit-Smullyman's concept (1944) of situs as a viable dimension in stratification studies.

It is designed for an instructor with limited experience in climbing; however, the need for teacher enthusiasm and patience is emphasized. Also accented are the positive aspects of psychological and physical skill development. For instance, rock climbing can provide a moderate amount of stress which can lead to personal insight and promote self-confidence. Safety aspects are dealt with in depth, emphasizing &quot;why&quot; something has to be done. Equipment needs and care are discussed in terms of both school budgets and safety. The 13-session course  includes 1 class on the &quot;Three-Point Rule&quot; which requires students to crawl or walk while moving only 1 limb at a time. Each class session has a seven-point format. This guide also includes a long segment on constructing artificial climbing walls to provide experience in any locale. (AN)",

All household heads (married males) in Bhagpura (123) and Khaira Bet (116) were interviewed; other data were derived separately. Program acceptance (modernism) in both villages correlated very highly with the respondants' psycho-social modernism, mass-media participation, and extra-community contacts. Khaira Bet (more remote in terms of road links and transportation facilities) reflected more conservatism in all areas, particularly formal and family education, civic/political participation, level of living, village leadership status, landowner status, and occupational status. An unanticipated finding was that  caste was not a significant predictor of program approval. Age reflected a predictable conservatism and had a negative correlation of -.72 in both villages. Since exposure to mass media and extra-community activities was significant in acceptance of socio-economic development programs, development and extension agencies should find support for rural development programs among villagers who have already been exposed to external ideas and behavioral patterns; agencies should also design extra-community social contacts, formal education, and mass-media and civic/political participation of villagers in order to aid development efforts.

These bills would waive the statute of limitations in the Indian Claims Commission Act and permit the Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Indians to file suit in the U.S. Court of Claims for alleged failure of the Government to uphold treaty obligations agreed to in a treaty entered into by the tribe and the U.S. Government in 1853. Representatives of the Cow Creek Band claim their failure to comply with the deadline is due to the fact that they were not afforded notice or assistance by the  Government of their potential claims as mandated in the Indian Claims Commission Act. Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Indian Affairs, Forest Gerard, gave a brief history of the Indian Claims Commission Act and its effect on the Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Indians in settling their homeland. Members of the Cow Creek Band testified to the ordeal their people have been through to make claim to land which they have lived on for generations; the discouragement they encountered when the Bureau of Indian Affairs did not recognize them as a tribe or reservation; the struggle they have experienced in obtaining education, housing, jobs, and medical services because they were ineligible for assistance available only to federally recognized tribes; and their greivances against the Government  regarding the fulfillment of treaty responsibilities. An extension to submitting a tribal land claim was repeatedly requested. (EB)",

Superintendents and chairmen similarly viewed evaluation as: continuous monitoring of ongoing programs (54-65%); assessment of student progress (32-37%); and accountability (23-32%). Just under half of the school board chairmen reported regular curriculum evaluation and 92% reported some. Much of the existing evaluation activity was constituted by standardized testing programs, available in 84% of the districts, and was conducted by district staff  personnel such as principals or guidance counselors. Resulting information was used mainly to determine the future of ongoing programs (65%) and the need for new programs (35%). While 44% of board chairmen were satisfied with the amount of evaluation material they received, 51% wanted more although the majority of districts had no policy regarding program evaluations. Although nearly half the chairmen reported spending less than 10% of board time on curriculum, not unlike larger districts, there was nonetheless an overall positive reception of and intended use of evaluation material.

        "description":"Organized into 4 chapters, the report provides tabular data portraying the educational condition for about 12 million Hispanic Americans in the United States, and shows how Hispanics compare with the majority population on various measures of educational participation and achievement. Providing an overview of Hispanic Americans in the U.S., Chapter 1 discusses the problems of defining Hispanics and Hispanic subgroups, and presents general information on such characteristics as size of the Hispanic population, age and geographical distribution, and school enrollment status. Concerned with elementary and secondary education, Chapter 2 covers such topics as enrollment rates, characteristics of high school students, and school noncompletion. This chapter concludes with a brief  description of education in Puerto Rico. Covering postsecondary education, Chapter 3 includes tabular data on such topics as enrollment, degrees awarded, and characteristics of students. Portraying the status in American society of Hispanic teenagers and adults as related to their previous level of education, Chapter 4 covers such topics as employment by broad occupational category, unemployment rates, post-high school experiences, and income levels. Throughout the report, data on Hispanics are compared with data on non-Hispanics to provide an interpretative context. (Author/NQ)",

The fact finding hearing was prompted by mail to the committee indicating that the status of many children previously qualifying for the programs would be altered. Witness Gerlad D. Gipp, Office of Indian Education, outlined the history of the new form which was redesigned in direct response to Congressional mandates and explained the differences in the old and new versions of Form 506, to be completed by parents or legal guardians of Indian children. He noted that the form will be used to  determine program eligibility and to supply information regarding the definition of Indian. He also clarified eligibility requirements in detail and noted existing eligibility abuses. (SB)",

        "description":"Discussed are some issues and queries about research in language and language acquisition. In particular, the area of inquiry is the logic subjacent to communication. In question here are the foundations of communication. What, if anything, underlies language? The unorthodox position developed in this paper has ambitious assumptions and slim empirical foundation. Nevertheless, it has strong links with some classical intellectual theories. The general argument to be made runs roughly as follows: The human animal is, to a great extent, characterized by the mathetic capacity. This innate capacity, which is related to the primal abilities of classifying and rule-generating and following, is essentially mathematical in nature and underlies all cognitive activity including language.  Relative to their own sets of assumptions, human beings tend to be logical or consistent beings. A rich and not well-developed area for understanding the nature of language and its acquisition, and intellectual growth in general, is the study of children in situations where their implicit sets of rules or assumptions become clear. The clarity, precision, and power of certain elementary mathematical structures make them ideal vehicles for the study of the mathetic capacity and its manifestations. (Author/MK)",

The student is then requested to take a postulate alien to his/her experience. Most high school students will not easily accept this, and a lot of student interest is generated.

The programs included two classes developed at Johns Hopkins University (an all-girls' accelerated mathematics class and a girls' career awareness class), and four school system-based programs based on the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth. The populations are considered to be well-above average with respect to mathematical ability. Analysis included investigation of the impact of programs on plans to take such courses as pre-calculus, calculus, chemistry, physics, and computer science, in high school. Impact of the programs upon variables related to acceleration in mathematics was also assessed along with the rate of population attrition  within the programs. The achievement of students in the school system-based accelerated classes was evaluated for possible sex differences. Questionnaire responses and the Fennema-Sherman Mathematics Attitude Scale were used to measure attitudes and interests. Comparisons were made between responses on some attitude measures and related factors such as acceleration, career goals, and life style plans. The major finding is that special programs for the mathematically gifted do have an impact on the course-taking behaviors and plans and aspirations of girls. (Author/MK)",

Three factors are considered: (1) problem structure, (2) student characteristics, and (3) the nature of instruction. An analysis of verbal problems is presented. This analysis includes a discussion of various types of problem entities: discrete sets, continuous attributes, and actions or transformations. Problem structure is also analyzed along three dimensions: action vs. static relationships, set inclusion, and order (larger vs. smaller). Examples of  various problem types are given. Results from the first year of an ongoing (1978-1981) longitudinal study of primary age students are included. These results are mainly gathered from individual problem-solving interviews with about 150 subjects. Various strategies employed and their change over time are examined. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the research, both present and contemplated, for instruction. (Author/MK)",

These mathematicians organized three main conferences in three areas of mathematics education, and have carried on activities related to the findings of the conferences. The main activity in the area of school education was the Cambridge Conference on School Mathematics held in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1963. Subsequent activity arising from the original conference led to workshops and a series of feasibility studies. The main activity in the area of teacher education was a conference in 1966. Subsequent activity arising from this conference included some in-service teacher  training work in Lexington and Newton, Massachusetts and in Princeton, New Jersey. Pre-service preparation work took place at the University of California, Berkeley; Indiana University; Teachers College, Columbia University; Boston State College and other state colleges in Massachusetts. A third conference was held in 1967 to consider the integration of primary school mathematics and science. The main activity arising from this conference was classroom trials of ideas. The outcome of these trials was a new program entitled Unified Science and Mathematics for Elementary Schools (USMES). This report details activities in the three areas of concern, and includes eleven appendices of relevant materials. (Author/MK)",

In the third section, some recommendations are made for narrowing the gap which seems to exist between the potential and the reality. Among these fifteen recommendations are: (1) the public should be educated about the nature of mathematics; (2) steps must be taken to improve the attitude of mathematics teachers; (3) there should be a curriculum emphasis on the dynamic process of mathematizing rather than on the static product of this process which is mathematical fact; (4) we must stress the historical roots and contemporary applications of mathematics; and (5) the mathematical community must give educational considerations a higher priority than is now the case.

There are many educational aspects of the MUN program in which students play the role of a representative of a particular country to a specific U.N. body. In their preparation for a model U.N. conference, students must do a great deal of background reading to gain a thorough knowledge of the U.N. in general and of the particular organ on which they will serve. The delegate's effectiveness also depends heavily on an intimate understanding of the country represented, its political and economic systems, its level of development, its foreign policy, and its relations  with other countries. Students also gain an insight into international negotiation, consensus building, and bloc politics. Finally, delegates must be familiar with and develop some facility in using parliamentary rules. Although most delegations receive some funding from their college or university, funding also comes from student government funds, from a Dean, a department, or special budget. Most delegations engage in some kind of fund-raising activities during the year. (Author/RM)",

        "author":["Branson, Margaret Stimmann"],
        "description":"This publication responds to a paper by Judith Stecher which strongly urges that a law related/humanities curriculum be included at the elementary school level. Currently most elementary teachers are concentrating their efforts on just two skills--reading and computing. A recent study of elementary schools in the northern counties of California, for example, reveals that 70% of all class time now is devoted to reading and arithmetic. Very little, if any time, is alloted to social studies and the humanities. Research shows, however, that attempts to teach skills in isolation are doomed to failure. Skills are interrelated. To be taught successfully, they must be related to the process of problem solving, conflict resolution, and valuing. Reading, writing, and computing are not  subjects which have content or concepts of their own. In order to teach these skills, teachers should use the ideas and concepts from the social sciences, law, music, art, and philosophy. These subjects are now being neglected in the elementary school. The inclusion of a law related/humanities curriculum in the primary school is critical because it serves children at their \"prime time\" of learning. Given the desirability of infusing law related, humanities centered content into grades K-6, there are several means of persuasion or courses of action open to concerned citizens: l) inform the public; 2) conduct more staff development and in-service training; and 3) make suitable materials available to teachers.

        "author":["DeVries, Raymond G."],
        "description":"A comparison of the social structuring of birth and death in modern American society is proposed as a new area of study: cosmic status passage. The author compares the two events as cosmic, universal transformations. The similarities of the experiences are explored in six categories. First, the role of the birthing or dying individual is structured according to the degree to which the event is desired, controlled by the individual, scheduled, voluntary, a defining feature of the individual, visible to others, and a singular or group experience. The second category concerns the role of the modern family which is characterized by smaller size and more antonomy than families of earlier times. The result is that birth and death have a greater social-psychological significance and  that moments directly following each event are regarded as a time of isolation for the immediate family. Similarities in the third category, control of information, include the appropriateness of birth and death experiences for \"polite\" conversation, legal arrangements such as birth and death certificates, and the dissemination of news about either event. Fourth, the role of medicine in both experiences affects the individual's capacity to define and control the situation and redefines the limits of acceptable risk and the nature of a normal birth or death. Fifth, collective concern about the status of these cosmic experiences leads to social movement in the form of hospices and alternative birth centers. Finally, the biological occasions of birth and death are often followed by  culturally constructed rituals. The author concludes that the cosmic qualities of the two events cannot be ignored. (KC)",

The project reviewed literature on both school and nonschool programs and identified important features and outcomes. The five volumes include: I, an overview of sex education in the United States; II, methods for evaluating programs; III, student, teacher, and principal questionnaires (presently being rewritten); IV, a bibliography of approximately 2,000 references to articles, books, and reports on sex education; and V, an annotated bibliography of exemplary curriculum materials. The major portion of this summary describes Volumes I and II. Topics include reasons for studying sex education, characteristics of school programs,  program innovations or variations, prevalence and effect of school sex education programs, features and outcomes of programs, public support for sex education in the schools, nonschool sex education programs, state guidelines, and methods for evaluating programs. Conclusions of the study are that although many schools and organizations have developed sex education programs, there is little communication among them; sex education programs are very heterogenous; comprehensive programs must include far more than discussions of reproduction; and most Americans support sex education in the schools.

Chapter I provides a brief overview of sex education in the public schools and summarizes goals, forms, and prevalence of sex education. Chapter II reviews literature on the effects of school sex education programs based on behavior goals of sex education courses. Chapter III describes important features and outcomes of sex education programs and includes ratings by experts of the importance of these identified features and outcomes. Conclusions are that the dual goals of preventing pregnancy and improving the quality of relationships are mutually supportive; an emphasis should be placed on changing values, self-esteem, skills, and comfort  in sex-related activities; and the classroom environment should be supportive and trusting. Chapter IV identifies 20 exemplary school sex education classes or programs and describes in detail the program at University City High School, St. Louis, Missouri. Chapter V provides an overview of nonschool sex education programs for teenagers. Programs analyzed include Planned Parenthood Affiliates, national youth organizations, local youth agencies, religious organizations, programs for pregnant teens, and hospital programs. Chapter VI contains analyses of state guidelines for sex education instruction in the public schools. Data for the study were obtained by completing a &quot;Summary of Laws and Guidelines for Instruction in Sex Education&quot; for each state. (Author/KC)",

Part One focuses on students' knowledge and misinformation about Africa, as well as the environment of the continent, a prediction of problems caused by the environment, and an attempt to formulate hypotheses for student inquiry into African culture. Sixteen learning activities include two pretests, class discussion, and mapwork, as well as exercises in knowledge identification, classification, data gathering, speculation, and  generalization. All activities emphasize problem prediction and hypotheses formulation about the development of African cultures. Concluding sections list student and teacher resources and offer student handouts. Part II offers activities focusing on African art, music, and oral literature as integrated expressions of the culture. These are intended to supplement the activities of Part I and should be coordinated with them. Stories and proverbs from several tribes are told and discussed, including dilemma tales, singing tales, and tales of gods and heroes. Activities include identifying values, playing games, creative writing, problem solving, reading novels, film viewing, having a story telling contest, and dramatizing.

An overview of the unit lists seven important concept areas and five skills to be taught in the unit. Ten lessons focus on topics such as the African environment, clothing, shelter, family life, religious beliefs, values, music, and other diverse cultural characteristics. All are taught through listening to and discussing various types  of African folktales. Each lesson states objectives, teaching procedures, important discussion points for the teacher, needed materials, and reading resources. Lectures are included when relevant. Activities include reading, comparing, writing folktales, classifying, and dramatizing. Appendices offer some folktales, an annotated bibliography of sources for the tales used in the unit, a bibliography of children's literature, and a list of 21 optional projects. (CK)",

        "description":"The document discusses the highly developed, diversified, and decentralized system of education in Switzerland. Because of the political, geographic, and linguistic diversity of education in Switzerland, this brief report is limited to major characteristics and patterns of education common to most Swiss cantons. Topics of the report include school structure; administration; intercantonal coordination; grading system; elementary, secondary, upper secondary, vocational, special, and teacher education; universities and other higher education institutions; adult education; and educational research. The author stresses that coordination among cantons is a serious problem. The language of instruction is German in 19 cantons, French in five, and Italian in one. In most secondary schools  a second national language is compulsory. Primary education provides the first level of compulsory education and lasts from four to six years. Lower secondary education, consisting of general education, extends through grade 9. Upper secondary education includes academic, general, vocational/technical, and teacher training. Teacher education is largely the responsibility of the cantons. Universities are self-governing bodies; all holders of federally recognized Swiss maturity certificates (issued at the upper secondary level) are eligible for unrestricted admission to any university. Educational trends include standardization of terminology, programs, and examinations among cantons; closer cooperation among researchers, teachers, and administrators; more independent study for students;  and improvement of inservice and preservice teacher education.

A PN system involves assigning a different number to each individual within a given society and using that number for commercial, governmental, and military identification. The purpose of the report is to provide information about PN systems to people involved in the public policy debate over whether such a system should be adopted in the United States. The document is presented in eight chapters. Chapter I explains how to develop a PN system and relates that Israel and the Scandinavian nations were selected as case studies because they are forerunners in developing and applying PN systems in national statistical programs. Chapters II  through V focus on the PN systems of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Israel, respectively. Topics include organizing and operating the systems, problems peculiar to each country, administrative and statistical uses of the PN system, future use plans, and plans for additional studies and research. Chapter VI reviews advantages and limitations of PN systems. Advantages include that PN systems are technically easy to use and store and that they increase data available for statistics, planning, and research. Disadvantages include that the digits become reversed fairly frequently, number files are not always transferred when a person moves, and integration with other systems is difficult. Chapter VII focuses on issues of confidentiality and privacy. The final chapter presents an overview of PN  systems in 16 nations, including the Netherlands, Peru, Australia, and Japan. (DB)",

The program is intended to demonstrate that highly skilled techers can function as school leaders without abandoning their classrooms. Allowing teachers to play a key part in administrative decision making will assist in teacher acceptance of such decisions, as well as easing the load on overburdened administrators. Two seminars are devoted to training in general leadership skills, staff development, assessment, and curriculum development skills, and environmental improvement and applied research skills. An outline of twenty-five specific leadership skills covered in the program is presented. (JD)",

Higher conceptual level (HCL) teachers emphasize diagnosis and student characteristics in their plans, while lower conceptual level (LCL) teachers give special consideration to materials and classroom techniques. A study of the lesson planning procedures of 68 elementary school teachers provided categorical data on the tasks typically involved in the planning process. The results indicate that there is no significant difference between HCL and LCL plans, although the differences become more significant when the teachers are further subdivided into age, grade levels taught, and length of time used for  planning. Implications for teacher training programs are presented. (CJ)",

The distance between these two poles is an index of the program's effectiveness in teacher training. The needs assessment model, which can be used for self, summative, or formative evaluations, is then implemented through the: 1) listing of competencies, 2) surveying of inservice teachers for competency attainment, 3) ranking of competencies according to the level of importance and the level of attainment, 4) comparing of high priority competencies to  the content of the training program, and 5) revising of the program or the competency.

        "description":"In Rasch terminology, two or more tests are linked when they are joined into a pool related to a single scale. When the same item calibrates at a low level on one test and a high level on a second test, it indicates that the item is low on the first test because the other items on that test are higher, and is high on the second test because the other items on that test are lower. The difference between the average of the calibrations of a subset of items on one test and the average for the same items on a second test is called the linking value. The accuracy of a linking value can be established by confirmation through the use of a third test, an algebraic process known as triangulation. The pattern of links between pairs of field tests is called a linking network. The purpose  for the network is to insure that sufficient information will be available to calculate accurate linking values for each test to the final scale. Four types of linking networks can be used: the four square network, the three-by-three network, the double eight linking network , and the octagon linking network. (Author/BW)",

The research reported in Monograph III supported the contention that Rasch item levels are based on an equal interval scale. The research in Monograph IV concluded that students receive comparable achievement levels from different tests, provided that neither test is at a grossly inappropriate level. Research in Monograph V determined that a sample size of at least 200-300 students should be used to field test new  items. Monograph VI dealt with the item calibration problems that might result if the range of the test were restricted, and concluded that the item calibration would not be significantly affected.

These competency statements then served as the basis for the Professional Personnel Evaluation System (PPES), which also consists of rating scales to be completed by administrators, parents and students; detailed observation procedures; a handbook; and a computerized record of ratings for school-by-school comparisons. After the first year of operation (1978-79), participants felt that the new system was superior to the old method of teacher testing. There was great concern, however, over the variability in teacher ratings by administrators across schools. In 1979-80 other events intervened. Staff time costs  were too high to justify the new system, raising the speculation that teacher testing may be the only way to establish a minimum competency level. (CP)",

The predictive validity of a battery of preschool tests, chosen to represent the core areas of preschool assessment, across race and sex, was evaluated. Validity of the battery was examined over a 12-month period, involving 322 preschoolers (white and black, female and male). A regression equation was determined using all preschool measures to predict achievement scores. Predictions were made for each individual test, and residual terms were calculated. No significant differences occurred in mean residuals between any pair of groups, indicating an absence of bias in prediction across race and sex with the large battery. Sex bias in  prediction was seen when subsets of the larger battery were examined. It is suggested that test developers become aware of the issue of bias and demonstrate differential construct and predictive validity as a part of the development of a test. (Author/GSK)",

The first variable, management strategy, tested the hypothesis that advising students of their learning need in relationship to acquisition of a task at a given criterion would be more effective than either adaptive control or learner control strategies. Data analysis showed that for college students, the advisement condition resulted in better performance than the learner control and needed less instructional time and fewer instructional instances than the adaptive control. The second variable contrasted two forms of content structure used in learning coordinate concepts: simultaneous and successive. Students given concepts simultaneously performed better on the posttest and needed less  instruction than those who received concepts successively. (Author/CTM)",

The studies suggest that the effective teacher (primarily of low SES children in the primary grades) is one who (1) uses time efficiently, keeping students engaged with task-related activities; (2) organizes students into medium to large groups for instruction, (3) correctly monitors work while being available to provide answers to student-initiated questions; (4) assumes  the role of a strong leader; (5) asks low-order questions, ensures that students have the opportunity to learn sufficient amounts of content, keeps interaction at a low level of complexity, structures lessons so that students are aware of objectives; and (6) sustains a classroom environment that is warm, friendly, democratic, and relatively free of disruptive behavior.

Nine reliable oblique, but distinct, factors were found: busy work; administration (school); testing and evaluation; breadth of instructional goals; counseling; administration (classroom); teaching; enrichment; and extra-curricular activities.

That is, the project sought to demonstrate the existence of effective schools in which teachers succeed in imparting the basic skills of reading and mathematics to both poor and non-poor children. One goal was to locate variables that describe the educational resources offered by a pupil's family, and that in the case of some schools, appear to limit their educational effectiveness in teaching the basic skills. Using the Michigan Educational Assessment Program tests, administered to 4th and 7th grade pupils,  each background variable was separately used as a pupil classifier. The pupils were then divided into five levels on the basis of mother's and father's education. It was found that effective urban schools do exist, and achieve high levels of performance in reading and mathematics for all children they enroll, including those from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds.

Each 5x2x3x2 analysis of variance assessed the effects of five countries, both sexes, and three academic majors repeated across both success and failure situations. Although there was some support of earlier studies of sex differences and western-eastern country distractions, the findings are more complex than previously determined using a single dimension and only one context. Results suggest more similarities than differences among subjects from the five nations studied. They believed  their failures mainly due to lack of effort. Females attributed their achievement significantly less to contextual factors than did males. Education majors attributed more to context than did social science majors. Social affiliation was attributed more to ability than to other causes, and more so by females than by males. (Author/CTM)",

The model related a respondent's race and  ability, two exogenous variables, to postsecondary grades and both grades and ability to the dropout variable. The results support the proposed causal model and indicate that the effects of ability and grades are independent of race. (Author/CTM)",

A model of multiple-choice processing is discussed and used to develop a proposed model of recall processing. Each model is tested by the means of investigating the use of retrieval cues in processing each type of question. The reading comprehension of twenty male and female undergraduates was measured with a multiple-choice test, and that of another twenty subjects was measured with a recall test. The questions in each test were designed to test the importance of cue location and availability in achievement test question processing. The results indicated that for multiple-choice tests, the optimal strategy may be one of processing the whole item, stem and  alternatives, especially if specific semantic cues appeared in the alternatives. These results support the chosen model of multiple-choice processing. The analysis of the recall responses indicated that the processing can occur successfully with general context cues only; however, performance is better with the use of general context and specific class cues. Such an interpretation was used to modify the suggested model of recall processing. (Author)",

If evaluation, the process of gathering information for instructional improvement, could be accomplished without the quantitative, formal processes of measurement and testing, there would be no need for them. Unfortunately, informal processes are more inefficient, inacurrate, incomplete, and biased, than testing and measurement, especially with groups. Educators should thus be assertive, knowledgable consumers of standardized tests; if these tests are inappropriate, well-designed classroom tests can be useful.

Foremost, criterion-referenced test developers need a comprehensive set of steps for construction. In this paper, 14 logical steps for building criterion-referenced tests that refer to several different applications and allow for objective and non-objective formats are offered: 1) preliminary considerations; 2) identification of possible content; 3) preparation of domain specifications; 4) review of domain specifications; 5) additional test planning; 6) preparation of test content; 7) preparation of scoring method; 8) test materials review; 9) compilation of final form of test; 10) determination of standards; 11) preparation of report  forms; 12) preparation of technical manual; 13) publication of test; and 14) collection of technical data. Four significant contributions of the steps are: 1) use of a priori methods for validation; 2) allowance for use of objective/non-objective test formats; 3) flexibility of steps for use in distinct situations (classroom; district/state; state and national); and 4) comprehensiveness of steps. In addition to the steps, a discussion of rationale for inclusion of each step and guidelines for implementation are provided. (GSK)",

The content of the reasoning consisted of inductions concerning the names of mammals, assumed to occupy a Euclidean space of three dimensions (size, ferocity, and humanness) in organized memory. Problems used in the experiments were analogies, series, and classifications. They were presented in unrestricted-time form by paper and pencil for-choice items and tachistoscopically as two choice items. Time required in the tachistoscopic form was assumed to be an additive combination of five stages: selection of components of the problem, of strategy, of internal representations for the information, of a speed-accuracy  trade off, and the monitoring of solutions. Results partially confirmed the vector model of memory space for names of mammals. Response latencies confirmed the prediction that analogies required one more processing step than did series, which in turn required one more step than did classifications. The significance of these findings for the explanation of general intelligence is discussed. (Author/CTM)",

A 68 percent return rate provided 1,468 useable questionnaires for the data analysis. An item-order effect was demonstrated by comparing Pearson product-moment correlations, covariance matrices, residuals resulting from a fixed factor structure, and factor loading patterns for the various questionnaire forms. The item-order effect appeared to  be more pronounced for adjacent item pairs than for item pairs separated by one or two items. Only a marginal effect was demonstrated for item grouping with captions. It is probable that low-inference type items factor structures obtained from survey data are dependent upon item order, but only minimally affected by item grouping. (Author)",

It includes both the replacement of an existing concept (conceptual exchange), and the incorporation of a new concept (conceptual capture). Conceptual exchange occurs only when an existing concept is dissatisfying and a new concept is intelligible, initially plausible, and fruitful. Conceptual capture occurs if new and existing concepts separately satisfy the four conditions discussed above, and are mutually consistent. The model was applied to three interviews which were held with a graduate tutor in freshman physics; the tutor was asked to solve problems concerning Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity. The first interview was used to determine his metaphysical commitment--to a Newtonian, mechanistic view of the  world; relativistic effects were explained mechanistically. The second interview showed the stability of his statements four months later and presented the metaphysics underlying relativity in comparison and contrast with his own. The third interview, ten days later, repeated parts of the first and showed that a profound change from mechanistic to a relativistic view had occurred. This case study underscores the importance of knowing a student's initial conceptions, especially those which are implicit and inarticulated, before planning a teaching strategy. (Author/CP)",

The first was a group of students enrolled in an introductory chemistry course, and the second was a group enrolled in a general studies art appreciation course. All students filled out the Decision Making Inventory and Frey Instructor Rating instruments. The analysis of variance for the two classes yielded very different  results. Both professors were of the same decision-making style, yet their evaluations were unalike. Overall, the art professor was evaluated much higher than the chemistry professor. Numerous explanations for the differing results are offered.

This framework illustrates that no single type of test can be identified as the absolute prototype criterion-referenced test. It is shown that over the past 115 years criterion-referenced testing has grown to be a many-faceted concept, its multitude of specific instances differing qualitatively from each other. A definition is provided for a criterion-referenced test as one that is deliberately constructed to yield measurements that are directly interpretable in terms of specified performance standards. Three broad categories are identified (well-defined domains, ill-defined domains, or those that are basically undefined), and the relationships are clarified. The  classification scheme for distinguishing the varieties of these tests is presented in tabular form according to the basis for test development. Other tables give examples of criterion-referenced tests, and summarize additional breakdown of categories of tests which reference scores to unordered domains. Essentially, this framework is seen as a first step toward clarity of communication among professionals and toward improved test development. (Author/GSK)",

In three sections, this paper explores the competency testing movement: 1) main features and basic issues in the competency testing movements; 2) observations on the politics of competency testing; and 3) consideration of the concern over the quality of education as it is focused on testing. Main issues likely to arise as efforts are made to implement competency testing schemes are also discussed. Four issues are cited as especially important for how ideas for minimum competency testing work out in practice: testing and teaching, remediation, potential for discrimination, and test security and freedom of  information. It is stated that the problems of testing programs seem more prominent than their prospective benefits; the problems are derived from the relationship between what tests measure and what is taught in schools. The suggested antidote to unintended outcomes of competency testing is to focus more attention on what should be taught in schools and how to teach it effectively, rather than on that which can be measured.

In order to facilitate the teachers' implementation of such changes, the Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM) was developed, using the teacher and the innovation as the frame of reference. Three of CBAM's diagnostic dimensions are the person's Stages of Concern About an Innovation; Levels of Use of the Innovation; and Innovation Configurations. The model may be applied to many different innovations in a variety of contexts. Competency testing is seen as an innovation because it introduces new testing procedures and necessitates a complex process of change. The implementation of competency testing  should include emphasis on advance planning, attention to individual concerns and levels of use, and acknowledgement of the innovation configurations which are being implemented.

The information was used for an ETS survey directed toward international education aspects of social studies. The project was initiated in 1972 by the United States Institute of International Studies to provide a better understanding of student interests, knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions regarding other nations and peoples. In addition, school and community questionnaires and teacher questionnaires were administered to provide supplementary data to help interpret the student responses. The results are displayed in 60 tables and  reflect examples of the extent of student illiteracy in world affairs. On the positive side, results also show the student interest that schools have to build on early in the educational process, and provide confirmation for the belief that if schools care to, they can make significant differences in students knowledge and perceptions.

A mapping sentence, logically representing the universe of content of a basic cardiology course, specified the facets of the course and the semantic structural units linking them. The facets were: cognitive processes, disease priority, specific disease, and clinical judgment stage. Developing items from specification strings was simpler and quicker than developing items from objectives without specific guidelines. Due to logistical problems, only two of the four parallel forms originally planned were actually used. Although this increased the number of times each item was used, it did not violate the theoretical methodology, nor the notion that the tests were parallel. The tests  will be field tested with fourth-year medical students at five medical schools, to establish their parallel forms reliability. (CP)",

The first section focuses on current demographic trends in central cities and suburbs, discussing data from the mid 1970s on population movement between cities and suburbs, regional differences in these trends, the racial and socioeconomic characteristics of people who move, and turnover rates in metropolitan housing. The second section deals principally with the reasons that people move within the same metropolitan area, presenting data on age of movers, changes in housing tenure (i.e., from rental to home ownership), and behavior involved in seeking a new home. The third section of the  paper considers ways that Federal policy can facilitate the redistribution of populations in order to attract higher income households to the cities and reduce the disproportionate concentration of the poor in these areas.

The summaries in this book are designed to assist in doing this. They represent a cross section of civil rights court cases dealing with personnel administration. One hundred forty-two cases are abstracted. The cases were presented to the Supreme Court of the United States or to one of the eleven Federal  circuit courts.

The needs assessment consisted of findings from a comparison of male-female data found in existing archival materials, a critical incident study of individuals who are supportive of equity practices and who are likely to participate in the implementation of a national demonstration in Tucson, and a survey that asked elementary and secondary students about attitudes on job suitability, division of labor at home and school, and class preferences. Evidence of imbalance in enrollments was found; women were underrepresented in academic and vocational courses that serve as prerequisites for higher paying jobs. A persistance of stereotypic role perceptions,  especially among elementary students, but also among junior and senior high school students, was evident. Findings also indicated that high school women perceive inequities in athletic opportunities and other aspects of the school program. Reluctance on the part of female students to enroll in nontraditional courses was found, even when they expressed a desire to do so. Implications for program requirements are discussed in this report. Critical incident and student survey instruments, as well as instructions for the administration of the surveys, are appended.

To produce estimates for the black homeseeker market, the analyst first \"ages\" the black population as of the last census, estimates how many have moved in or out of the market area, and applies household \"headship rates\" to determine the number of households which will result. Next the analyst estimates the potential black homeseeker population, the extent and rapidity with which these homeseekers are likely to depart from traditional or ghetto patterns of residence, and the probable effects of current housing supply constraints.  Procedures for Spanish speaking households employ the same principles but variations are required due to inadequate data. These procedures should serve to provide usable, although rough, estimates of market potential. Sources of required data are included in the report. (Author/MK)",

The chief findings were: (1) women have faced and continue to face discrimination in marketing, lending, and shelter-related services; (2) discrimination against women has historically been overt but is becoming increasingly subtle; (3) women are not aware of the nature or extent of sex discrimination; (4) myths and stereotypes are the underpinnings of prejudicial attitudes toward women; (5) statistics pertinent to women's access to shelter or housing-related services are not available; (6) women outside male-headed households represent a sharply growing demographic trend; (7) discrimination on  account of sex is frequently compounded with discrimination on account of some other characteristic; (8) lending institutions have discounted women's incomes when making decisions on applications for mortgage credit; (9) sex discrimination based in the law further reinforces sex discrimination in housing; and (10) women are virtually excluded from policy making jobs in the nation's shelter system. Recommendations which encourage solutions to these problems include public education efforts, government compliance efforts, data collection, affirmative government housing programs, local women's coalitions, and expansion of opportunities for women to participate in housing policy-making decisions.

The methodology is based on the assumption that reading can be viewed as a social activity or process that becomes defined through the interaction of participants. Data are collected through the use of ethnographic techniques such as participant observation, videotaping, and ethnographic interviews. Data are collected in three general settings: the school (including both in-classroom and outside-classroom activities), the community, and the home. There are four components to the analysis of the data: a lexical/semantic analysis, microanalysis, macroanalysis, and triangulation. The product of the analysis is the generation of  hypotheses about reading activities and the social contexts in which they occur. (Author/GC)",

        "description":"In this speech the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice discusses the impact of racial and sex discrimination on the nation. The author reflects on the high costs of discrimination, financially and socially, in terms of riot damage, underutilization of the work force, crime, and poor education. In discussing the Federal government's recent affirmative action efforts, he notes that, despite equal opportunity legislation, institutional discriminatory barriers still exist and exacerbate problems of inequality. The author delineates the present administration's goals for affirmative action: (1) a cessation of discriminatory practices, (2) recruitment programs designed to increase pools of eligible minorities and women, (3) replacement  of non-valid job related tests with valid devices, (4) increased minority and female hiring and promotion, and (5) back pay for victims of past discrimination. The author concludes with a call for creativity in the implementation of affirmative action and education of the American public about the costs of discrimination. (MK)",

The testing instruments used were the California Achievement Tests. Section A of this report presents information on pupil performance for the school system as a whole. Section B contains data on pupil performance in each of 31 districts. Section C presents, by district, information on the performance of pupils in each school. In each section the following data are presented: the mean score for pupils in each grade, the median score for pupils in each grade, and the percentages of students with scores at different performance levels. The percentage of students excused from the test because of limited English proficiency  is also reported. Analysis of the data shows that the performance of pupils in the 1979 Citywide Test can best be characterized as very similar to, but slightly lower than, the performance of pupils nationwide on the same tests. Compared with the results of citywide testing in 1978, the 1979 grade equivalent scores were slightly higher. (Author/MK)",

        "author":["Saber, Mohi El-Dine"],
        "description":"Contemporary cultural and educational changes in the Arab States are reviewed with respect to the effort to liberate Arab countries from illiteracy. The stated objective is to establish common intellectual ground between Arab adult educators (policy-makers, planners, or executive officers) through understanding the social, political, economic, and educational situation. Three separate sections deal with cultural change and education, an Arab strategy for literacy and adult education, and education and the role of women in integrated development. A major theme is a strategy of integrated literacy throughout the Arab homeland: a strategy which combines an attack on &quot;cultural illiteracy&quot; (reflected in social and economic underdevelopment of developing countries) and illiteracy of  the individual (ignorance in reading, writing, and numerical skills), which is seen as an inevitable consequence of cultural illiteracy. The author emphasizes the necessity of bringing formal and adult educational systems into an integrated plan at all levels--general, vocational, and university. He further proposes a &quot;nationality of knowledge&quot; through a common Arab fund in which states with the greatest financial resources should be the main contributors so that primary education for both sexes could be made universal in the Arab region. Specific suggestions are addressed to correcting the &quot;cultural lag in understanding women's role.&quot; The analyses and proposals are illustrated with reference to the author's experience as professor, researcher, and Minister of Education in Sudan,  1969-1972.

The study was quasi-experimental involving two levels of treatment: (1) the adult IDECC teaching approach and (2) the postsecondary traditional teaching approach. Sixteen classes were randomly selected from a population of thirty volunteer sites. The IDECC approach utilized selected adult IDECC competency-based materials as their unit of instruction. The traditional instructors developed lesson plans as their instructional material within a workshop setting. Findings based on analysis of covariance by regression utilizing forty-eight sources of variance  indicated that five sources of variance made a significant contribution: school, student educational level by student education level, student occupational experience by student occupational experience, teaching approach by student past participation in distributive education programs, and student age by student occupational experience.

In the first year, three elements will be put into operation. First, a staff development collaborative consisting of representatives of key agencies and groups to initiate, direct, and monitor the implementation of the plan will be established. Second, staff development facilitators will be identified to stimulate the development of local and area staff development planning and programming and to link resources to the adult educators who need them. Third, small grants and other incentives will stimulate local district and area staff development. In the second and following years of the plan, staff development  leadership training of program administrators and teacher leaders will occur. They will be trained to initiate and generate staff development processes in their districts and areas. The plan identifies a variety of funding resources and urges adult educators to use all of these sources to offer staff development opportunities and activities. (An evaluation design is included that provides for analyzing and modifying the plan, the program, and the process each year, as well as a final evaluation of the impact of the staff development plan on practitioners and students alike.)

The introduction discusses reading in vocational education as both a curricular or educational issue and as an occupational or employment-skill issue. It presents four areas of questions which should be asked of vocational educators regarding readability, the relationship between curricular and occupational literature, reading instruction, and student reading needs. The second section, Reading in Vocational Education, reviews literature and research on reading in two parts: (1) reading as a curricular activity, with focus on three topics--vocational program prerequisites, analysis  of textbooks and related literature, and reading program development, and (2) occupational reading. The third section concerns research on reorganizing reading priorities in vocational education. Section 4, Call for Research, lists ten topics for future studies: relationship of occupational literature to tasks, employers' perceptions of needed reading skills, readability index for occupational reading; general literacy versus occupational literacy, transferability, upward mobility, teacher education, interim strategies, special needs, and coordination between academic and vocational programs. A philosophy of reading for vocational education is found in the final section. (YLB)",

To document the need for the program the status of  present Pennsylvania secondary and postsecondary health occupations education offerings is summarized, and program goals are examined in relationship to the Pennsylvania State University Academic Policy Plan and the Master Plan for Higher Education in the state. Finally, the plan itself is presented: objectives, admission requirements, outline of baccalaureate degree requirements (46 credits) and requirements for the major (81 credits), and discussion of program administration.

        "description":"A study evaluated career attainment and job satisfaction of young adults from nonmetropolitan Washington and identified factors influencing them. Results were based on data collected in a 1973 mail survey of members of high school classes graduating in 1965 and 1966. Career attainment was measured by occupation, earnings, place of work, and education beyond high school. The survey showed male annual earnings peaking at $7,000-$9,999, while most females earned $5,000-$9,999. The most common place of work for men was large towns; one-third of the employed women worked in large cities. About two-thirds had some college training. In general, their career attainment was similar to that for the United States population aged 25-34 in 1970. Analysis of job satisfaction considered these  job characteristics: self-actualization, ego status, belongingness, safety and order, and basic creature comforts. A 1975 followup survey of the migration proportion of the 1973 sample studied expectations and perceived benefits and costs of moving. The majority migrated to get more education. A more enjoyable lifestyle was identified as the greatest single benefit, leaving relatives and friends as the greatest single cost. The income, educational, and occupational characteristics of parents were also generally directly associated with the educations and occupations of the respondents. (YLB)",

        "description":"This paper reviews some of the past literature on male-female wage differentials in order to determine the early hypotheses which are the historical roots of the current theoretical and empirical work analyzing male-female wage differentials. Part 1 reviews the discrimination hypotheses, which emphasize differences in the labor market conditions (such as crowding, job segmentation, and lack of organization) that result in different rates of pay for the same work. Part 2 reviews the human capital hypotheses, which assume that the sexes have different productive attributes that yield wage differentials. This discussion focuses on socialization, labor force commitment, investment in human capital, differential female supply prices, and physical strength differences. Part 3 provides  a summary and conclusion suggesting that policy directed toward reducing male-female wage differentials should be broad in scope and address itself to the numerous causes of the differentials indicated in parts 1 and 2.

        "description":"During the next twenty years, a significantly expanding adult population and decreasing youth population will cause education for adults to be an increasing concern to the educational system. Out of necessity, an increasing proportion of the resources in education will be directed towards educating adults. Challenges which present themselves are how adults learn, what they want to learn, and where they want to learn. Research needed to launch a comprehensive system of adult education is unfortunately lacking. A basis for future implications for research and development for adult education is to be found in Mezirow's approach to research, which answers six significant questions: (1) How many adults learn through learning projects? (2) Who is responsible for planning the learning?  (3) What motivates adults to learn in this way? (4) Where does this learning take place? (5) Why do adults choose to learn on their own rather than take a course? and (6) Is this research not confirming the learning behavior of educated adults? Implications for research include the need for further data on self-directed learning and the adult learner. (Questions and answers are appended.) (YLB)",

The Diehl-Mikulecky Job Literacy Survey was administered to 107 subjects who represented a full range of occupational types and levels and who comprised a sample similar to the adult working population on the demographic variables of sex, race, income earned, and occupational category. The survey included items to assess the literacy demands encountered in occupations, the strategies employed by subjects in meeting these demands, and select attitudinal variables hypothesized to influence functional literacy in a job context. Additionally, the survey provided an indication of general reading ability through the use of a cloze test on a general topic, and an indication of job-reading ability  through the use of a cloze test constructed for subjects from their actual work materials. Several traditional measures of occupational success (income, job prestige, and job responsibility) were incorporated as variables in the study. The data collected were reduced to fourteen major variables (four variables tapping literacy demands, five tapping subjects' strategies and competencies, and five tapping attitudes) and several demographic variables. The interrelationships of the variables and their contributive effects in explaining variances in job-literacy competency, literacy demands, and occupations success were examined. (BM)",

To determine if the effectiveness of strategy training is influenced by the sequence of instruction, the participants in the learning-strategies class were randomly assigned to two groups. One group received primary strategy training during the first half of the semester and support training during the second half. The other group received the opposite instructional sequence. A control group was recruited from general psychology classes. Some of  the strategies included were various mnemonic devices, imagery elaboration, paraphrasing, visual networking, goal-setting distraction desensitization, and formal peer interaction. Among the findings was that strategies-trained students achieved 17 percent to 40 percent more on technical-subject-matter achievement tests than did untrained students. Low-reading-aptitude students achieved more under imagery strategies than low-reading-aptitude controls under the paraphrasing of the untrained strategies condition. Visual-networking-strategies students scored 26 percent higher on delayed-retention achievement tests than controls in the untrained group. (LRA)",

Selected administrative and instructional personnel in the Nashua School District were interviewed to determine their awareness of the needs of the limited English proficient population and to procure their support for project activities. Phase 2 involved implementation of the model program developed at the end of  phase 1. Its five basic components were (1) testing for placement and instructional planning; (2) career counseling for junior and senior high school students; (3) instructional programming for junior and senior high school students; (4) staff development in testing English as a Second Language, cross-cultural career counseling, and modification of English as a Second Language programs to include vocational vocabulary and concepts; and (5) curriculum library development.

Topics under which findings are presented include accredited prior classroom and experiential learning, noncredit prior classroom learning, colleges' recognition of nonclassroom prior  learning, and transferability of nonclassroom prior experience learning into paid employment. Conclusions presented are as follows: the main approaches used by educational institutions to assess prior experience learning are (1) course or program evaluation, (2) credit by examination, and (3) portfolio development. Portfolio development is considered the optimum because of its flexibility, but because of its individualization it involves more time and higher costs. Credit by examination works best when there is good correspondence between content of exam and scope of experience. Course/program evaluation is possible only for prior learning involving formal instruction. The main approach used to relate women's prior learning to employment involves matching individual competencies with job  competencies. (JT)",

        "description":"To assess the professional continuing education needs of persons employed full-time in administering, directing, leading, organizing, or planning leisure services, a questionnaire was mailed to 1,640 leisure service professionals throughout Wisconsin (50% return). Groups surveyed (and for which data was analyzed separately) included people involved in park/outdoor recreation, community/school, therapeutic, older adult, camping, and outdoor/environmental education services. On the average respondents had worked in present position five years, in leisure services eight years. Of all surveyed, 78% had at least an undergraduate degree, 18% a Master's, 27% had recreation as a college major, 10% were pursuing an advanced degree and 20% would like to. On the average they supervised four  full-time and twenty-seven part-time employees and forty-four volunteers; were 35 years old; 44% women; gross salary ($15,000). Some of the high specific needs and interests were innovative programming, public relations, program evaluation, programming for special groups, leadership techniques, supervising staff, training staff, current issues in programming, evaluating personnel and interpersonal communication. Highest needs were in relationships and programming. Regarding continuing education, 35% belonged to professional associations; most frequent activities: conferences, inservice training, and reading professional books, but activity desired for future was college credit coursework. Greatest deterrents cited for participating in continuing education were schedule conflicts, cost,  and not enough time. The importance of continuing education was ranked high by 87%, 47% believing it should be mandatory for continued employment. (Questionnaire appended.) (JT)",

The article considers these factors which determine the length of time a person works continuously for the same employer: age and sex, marital status of women, race, and occupation and industry. It is shown that workers under age 25 change occupations most frequently; single women generally remain in the same job longer; white men had worked longer on their current jobs than black men, but black women had worked longer than white women; and farmers had the longest job tenure of any occupational group, and workers in the construction and trade industries had the shortest. The explanatory note briefly describes the basic labor force concepts,  sample design, estimating methods, and reliability of the data used in the report and based on a question in the January 1978 Current Population Survey. Supplementary tables include tenure on current job by (1) sex, (2) age and sex, (3) full-time or part-time status and age (marital status of female workers), (4) class of worker (industry of men), (5) class of worker (industry of women), (6) occupation of men, (7) occupation of women, and (8) age and sex (years of school completed).

        "description":"Two groups of 15 Administrative Specialists, 7lL Military Occupational Speciality (MOS), participated in four job-task refresher training sessions designed to enhance the typewriting of military correspondence. One group performed under a study training method which allowed use of a Correspondence Manual while arranging materials into the correct format, the second under a recall training method which required reliance on memory. Under both methods, participants received knowledge of results concerning both typewriting speed and accuracy. Straight-copy typewriting performance also was measured at each training session. Both training methods produced approximately a 36% increase in format arrangement speed without an associated increase in error. These benefits occurred regardless  of a soldier's time in MOS or on-the-job typewriting experience. Straight-copy typewriting performance remained at an average level of twenty-three words per minute across sessions and did not reflect job-tasks typewriting proficiency. Timely and consistent use of knowledge of results was suggested to be the reason for the typewriting improvements obtained under both training methods. Similar use of knowledge of results in an on-the-job environment also should improve job-task typewriting performance, and thereby reduce the need for a formal refresher training program.

Data were collected through person-to-person interviews with 1,566 respondents. The results of the study indicate that prevailing work time conditions are at variance with the preferences of today's workers. A majority of the American workers state a willingness to forego most of future pay raises for more time away from work if some choice is allowed concerning the specific forms of potential free time. A solid majority of workers would give up at least 2 percent of current earnings for their choice among five different forms of free time, and about one-fourth claimed a desire to forego 10 percent or more of their income for time. An  additional finding was that the ways in which potential gains in free time are scheduled is a major determinant of whether individuals will trade potential or current earnings for time.

The problem-solving approach was found most relevant for addressing the skills and demands placed on leaders. Both it and research on communications aided in delineation of leader skill categories. From historical engagement simulation (ES) data (battle narratives, audio tapes, and net control sheets collected at ES exercises), the literature search, and research staff ES combat experiences, a listing of leader skill categories and individual  leader skills was developed. The twelve skill categories, subsumed under five broader headings, were (1) management skills--planning, execution and control, initiating structure, and interacting with subordinates and supervisors; (2) communications skills--transfer of information and pursuit and receipt of information; (3) problem-solving skills--identification and interpretation of cues, weighing alternatives, and choosing a course of action; (4) tactical skills--application; and (5) technical skills--equipment and basic.

Data for the study was obtained by mail questionnaire during the summer of 1978-79 from an Australia-wide sample of 4,919 individuals who were between seventeen years of age and seventeen and eleven months on October 1, 1978. Approximately half of the sample were in their final years of high school and the remainder were early school leavers, persons who had left high school before year 12. Study results indicated differences between states and between systems (government, Catholic, and independent) in achievement. Students from migrant families whose native language was not English were also  disadvantaged when the measure was student achievement. Early school leavers were most likely to be found in government schools, in particular states, or among those who had not achieved mastery of literacy and numeracy. Relative to seeking employment, each extra year of schooling resulted in finding a job one month earlier. In addition, schooling and proficiency in basic numerical skills seem to count on the job, and are rewarded with continuous employment and higher prestige jobs. As a remedy to the problems experienced by early school leavers, recommendations were made relative to these individuals receiving further education in alternative settings. (MEK)",

        "description":"This review of the research on the evaluation of career education provides a review and synthesis of five major publications prepared for and/or published for the United States Office of Education and considers a number of problems and promises facing evaluators of career education in the eighties. Reviewed are reports prepared by Tuckman and Carducci in 1974, Development Associates in 1975, Enderlin in 1976, Bhaerman in 1977, and Bonnet in 1978. It is noted that no other small program within the Office of Education has devoted so much attention to evaluating its effectiveness on such a sustained basis. The overall conclusion stated is that the available evidence is more positive than negative, i.e., at present there is more reason to believe that career education is effective  than that it isn't. Four issues discussed as concerns for evaluation in the eighties are &quot;the career education treatment&quot; (identifying what has been done in the name of &quot;career education&quot;); the need for immediate evaluation criteria for learner outcomes; finding and using proper control groups; and conducting longitudinal studies of the teaching-learning process.

Another section, on apprenticeable occupations, describes occupations in construction, manufacturing, service, and expanding opportunities for apprenticeship. A section on how to become an apprentice outlines the apprenticeship application process. Following this, the system itself is analyzed in terms of the role of federal and state apprenticeship agencies and committees, and the final section  summarizes federal laws and regulations affecting apprenticeship.

Five general classes of options are evaluated: (1) reimbursement reforms, (2) loan programs, (3) scholarship programs, (4) institutional support, and (5) nonfederal governmental programs. This report also provides background information on the structure, organization and financing of the medical education system; the National Health Service Corps; the history of federal legislation affecting medical education; and econometric studies of the relationship between physicians' earnings and specialty and location decisions. The evaluations are  based on thorough reviews of existing research and the application of theoretical and empirical analyses to new data. Implications for an overall policy strategy for medical education financing are offered. The authors conclude that changes in the system of reimbursement for health services would have the greatest potential for altering physician distribution and affecting the medical education system. However, because the reimbursement system is complex and changes in it would probably not occur in the immediate future, recommendations are made on a number of options for the direct financing of medical and graduate medical education.

It evaluated Department of Labor (DOL) and prime sponsor policies and procedures for ensuring nondiscrimination both in program services provided by recipients of federal financial assistance and in recipients' employment practices. The review was performed at DOL's headquarters (Washington, D.C.), three of DOL's regional offices, and eleven of tne 460 CETA prime sponsors. GAO found that (1) the prime sponsors generally do not adequately serve significant segments, (2) DOL needs better reporting or servicing of significant  segments, (3) DOL and prime sponsors need to improve monitoring and evaluation of equal opportunity activities, (4) prime sponsors need to improve design of programs to better service all segments, and (5) underrepresentation in prime sponsors' management may affect program participation. Recommendations addressed to the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) were made. The review showed that DOL has taken positive steps to ensure nondiscrimination in its CETA program, but there are still problems. ETA is in noncompliance with some sections of the Justice Department's Title VI regulations (civil rights enforcement plan). (YLB)",

        "description":"An alliance between apprenticeship and vocational education could accomplish more than either system could achieve on its own. An understanding of the system is important prior to working effectively with apprenticeship programs. They are sponsored by single employers or groups of employers acting singly or jointly with a union. Union interest centers around control of craft competence and productivity, increased job security, and union security. Employer interest is based on lower costs of training for groups of small-scale employers. Apprenticeship in practice is concentrated in the building trades, which have over 60% of registered apprentices. Government, specifically the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training and state apprenticeship agencies, has a supportive and regulatory  function. Apprenticeship seems to resemble cooperative education but differs in that the apprentice has a regular job, the cooperative student has a training position. Apprenticeship is industry-based; cooperative education is school-based. Vocational education and apprenticeship can work together in two ways: (1) vocational education can channel well-prepared and well-informed candidates into apprenticeships and (2) public vocational education can serve as a resource for providing the related instruction portion of training in apprenticeship.

        "description":"The Southern Regional Education Board administered a three-year Faculty Development in Nursing Education Project. Its three objectives were (1) to provide opportunities for faculty to improve their abilities to identify learning problems; study alternative learning strategies; present instruction appropriate to the learning types of students; and recognize, respect, and adapt to cultural differences; (2) to disseminate information about effective strategies; and (3) to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the various activities initiated. Activities implemented at twenty sites (college-sponsored programs) reflected three major emphases--learner, teacher, and instructional process. Specific focuses included learning and teaching styles of learners and teachers and how these  styles could be used to promote improved teaching and learning experiences, identification of learning obstacles and use of appropriate measures to overcome them, impact of cultural variations on teaching and learning, and increase of teacher awareness of cultural values and decrease of misconceptions and stereotypical expectations. (Examples of activities at various sites are cited as appropriate to the discussions.) Nurse faculty and task force leaders completed evaluation forms as project evaluation. Results attested to project effectiveness as a model for directing attention to attitudinal and procedural barriers that inhibit the educational experiences of students from diverse cultural and educational backgrounds.

Extensive use is made of results of the 1976 Survey of Income and Education, an expanded version of the ongoing population survey conducted by the United States Bureau of Census. These topics are covered: demography of Alaskan women, race, age, families, labor force participation, current employment of women in the government and private sectors, occupations, wage and salary information, higher education and apprenticeship training, women and unemployment, characteristics of the unemployed, characteristics of job seekers, inroads to the work force, Work Incentive Program, Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, and Senior Employment Program. Extensive figures and tables are provided. The  following facts are reported: 62% of Alaskan women sixteen years ofage and over are in the civilian labor force, since 1950 the proportion of women heads-of-family has doubled to 11%, women comprise over one-third of private sector employment, women constitute a majority of postsecondary students, women are moving into traditional male-dominated disciplines in postsecondary studies, and the number of women enrolled in apprenticeship programs is almost three times the national average (3%).

Subjects rated the stimulus person on several personality dimensions related to introversion-extraversion and made attributions about the cause of the conversation behavior. A four-way factorial design--personality descriptor used in self-description (introvert or extravert) X type of behavior in conversation X order of presentation of videotapes X stimulus person--found that behavioral evidence had more of an impact on personality ratings than did self-description. Subjects attributed  the stimulus person's behavior to personality when the self-descriptor agreed with the behavior, but attributed more causality to situational factors in inconsistent conditions. No order of presentation effects were found. (Author/NRB)",

Both sexes agreed on ratings assigned to clients, viewing female clients as more disturbed and as longer-term clients than males. Therapists of both sexes preferred to see YAVIS clients. Therapists felt more comfortable with same-sex clients, showing preference for specific client characteristics in clients of the same  sex, but wanted clients of the opposite sex who fit the preferred client stereotype.

It was hypothesized that subjects who score high on a feminism scale and who fail to solve a sex-role problem, thus demonstrating sexist thinking, will be motivated to adopt feminist behavior more than subjects who are either lower in feminism or who do not fail such a problem. Since the attitude is central, attitude bolstering rather than change in the direction of the behavior should be the preferred mode of inconsistency reduction for such subjects. Bolstering, in the form of positive affirmative action decisions, was generally demonstrated by subjects who failed the  sex-role problem, an effect more pronounced for those highest in feminism. No such effects on affirmative action decisions were observed for subjects who did not fail the sex-role problem. Results support the view that threats to one's self-image caused by one's own counter-attitudinal actions lead to attempts to reestablish those threatened values. Conditions are identified under which bolstering, rather than attitude change in the direction of the behavior, should be expected. (Author/NRB)",

It was hypothesized that an examination of data from both cross-sectional and longitudinal samples would clarify age and sex differences in the development of adolescent self-concept. Male and female elementary, middle, and high school students completed questionnaires, a self-concept scale, interest assessments, and instruments about the sources of information used by adolescents. Results indicated that cognitive functioning was a primary determinant of self-concept. Environmental encounters such as peer/family relationships, school, role-taking, and reactions of others affected  self-concept. The longitudinal data demonstrated consistency in self-concept measures over time. Cross-sectional comparison data, showing grade-level differences, did not replicate each other. Interest in interpersonal relationships, education, human ecology, and drugs was higher for older students than younger students. Social class and academic achievement had little effect on self-concept development. (Author/HLM)",

Elements of the warm-cold schema, specifically giver-output, giver-resistance, receiver-input, and receiver-resistance, were investigated to test the hypotheses that low resistances on the part of the giver, the receiver, and their relationship would be associated with higher warmness judgments, and that high giver-output, high receiver-input, and relationship potential would correspond to higher warmness judgments. College students (N=48) rated the  warmness of the giver, the receiver, and their relationship after twice reading each variation of a brief story. Results supported both hypotheses. Resistance varied inversely with warmness; output and input varied directly with warmness. (Author/HLM)",

According to the behavioral view, depression results from inadequate, ineffective or insufficient positive reinforcement. In contrast, the cognitive position sees depression as a result of negative thinking about oneself, one's experience, and the future. Both behavioral therapy and cognitive therapy can successfully be used as effective therapeutic tools with depressed elderly persons. However, it is unlikely that either of these treatments is adequate or sufficient to treat all depressions of old age. Great variability is a consistent finding in research on the aging, which makes it necessary to remain flexible in determining the problem and selecting an intervention appropriate for  the client. Additionally, it is necessary that the therapist feel that older persons can learn new behaviors and cognitions, and that they can respond to the same therapeutic principles as younger persons.

ACUTE's staff is multi-disciplinary and includes social workers, a clinical psychologist and a child psychiatrist. The model underlying ACUTE's approach is presented as an integration of six theories: (1) crisis intervention; (2) brief, task-oriented treatment; (3) psychoanalysis; (4) network/systems; (5) family systems; and (6) Stierlin's dialectical theory.

A perceiver's pre-interaction expectancy can mediate both his and the target person's behavior, resulting in behavioral confirmation or compensation. Male subjects (N=96) participated in dyadic interactions in which one subject (perceiver) received pre-interaction information (friendly, unfriendly or no information) about the other (target). Results confirmed predictions that behavioral confirmation, characterized by high levels of interaction and mutual liking, would occur in the friendly expectancy condition; and behavioral compensation would occur in the unfriendly expectancy condition. Although behavioral compensation superficially resembled confirmation, compensating  perceivers mistrusted the targets' behavior, liked targets less, and continued to regard them as unfriendly. Major implications are: (1) real-life interactions are shaped by pre-interaction expectancies; (2) findings on behavioral confirmation are tied to behavioral compensation found by Bond (1972); and (3) although behavioral confirmation may result from prior information, behavioral compensation may explain why one's perceptions of a target persist regardless of whether the target's behavior confirms or disconfirms them.

Rest (1974) typifies these stages in the Defining Issues Test (DIT) which was administered to 13 black, southern females beginning their Master's training in counseling. Two subjects could not be typed. Six could be assigned to a specific stage by exceptional usage of that stage: two preconventional (Stage 2), two conventional (Stage 4), and two postconventional (Stages 5B and 6). The other five subjects were classified as: one with Stage 2, Stage 4 subdominant; two with Stage 4,  Stage 2 subdominant; and two with Stage 4, &quot;A&quot; subdominant (antiestablishment orientation). There is a preponderance of Stage 4 moral thinking in this group. Counselor education programs must include discussions of moral dilemmas in an attempt to raise counselors' levels of moral judgment, and the effects of training programs on trainees' moral development must be investigated.

Six levels of classification outline these objectives. Level 1 involves the characterization and classification of persons. Level 2 studies attributes. Level 3 is concerned with inferred processes. Level 4 studies the processes in construing behavior and in making attributions. Level 5 looks for behaviors common to most people. Level 6 examines behaviors in sequence. Generalizability (external validity) is low for the first three levels and increases for the remaining ones. Research at the earlier levels shows little likelihood of developing into a basic science; the possible degree of agreement between observers is limited.  Whether this classification seems adequate or not, each person researching in personality must make explicit his phenomena, methods and goals. (Author)",

One multi-operational investigation found that information sets about familiar people, as opposed to unfamiliar people, resulted in the increased availability of persons as units of cognitive organization in a speeded categorization task and in the ordinal clustering of information according to persons in free recall. However, the two components of person familiarity of the descriptive information were deliberately confounded in the experiment. The effects of the separate contributions of familiarity of names and the familiarity or consistency of descriptors were  investigated using the same information sets and tasks from previous research, but with the addition of two extra conditions, i.e., familiar person names associated with unfamiliar information sets and unfamiliar names associated with familiar information sets. The data showed that both components of familiarity: (1) affected the cognitive organization of person information; (2) contributed independently when retrieving stored information (free recall task); and (3) interacted when accessing person schema (sorting task).

Participants completed questionnaires immediately after using GIS and six to eight weeks later. The preliminary field testing phase occurred during Spring 1979 with a second field testing phase during Fall and Winter 1979-80. Four different measurements were made during the project. Results indicated that users understood the purpose of GIS, had no trouble using it, and found the system interesting and motivational. GIS was most effective in providing occupational and career information, and  had a greater impact on educational decision-making by public school users than by agency users. Some users found GIS helpful in developing job-seeking and job-keeping skills. GIS stimulated changes in school guidance programs and the role of the counselors. The effectiveness of GIS utilization appeared to depend on how it was integrated into each comprehensive career education program. (Author/NRB)",

Clinically depressed obese subjects (N=22) were randomly assigned to either a self-control or therapist-control behavior therapy program that met for six weekly treatment sessions and three monthly maintenance sessions. There was a significant treatment group and assessment period interaction on the Depression Scale of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, with the therapist-control group significantly more improved at posttest and follow-up. In a  second experiment, 33 clinically depressed subjects were matched to one of three groups: self-control, therapist-control, or attention-placebo. There was a significant treatment group and assessment period interaction on the Lewinsohn Pleasant Events Schedule Reinforcement Potential, with therapist-control subjects significantly higher than self-control or attention-placebo subjects. Friends and relatives considered therapist-control subjects to have changed significantly more than self-control or attention-placebo subjects.

Therapist attitude is important in working with the elderly. A case study of therapy with an elderly man illustrates the processes involved in helping the client increase his activity level, reduce dependency and use of medication, and improve communication with his wife. Recommendations for use of a behavioral approach in the treatment of depression  in the elderly include: (1) the importance of a clear focus and consistent approach; (2) the necessity of frequent repetition of the connection between adaptive behaviors and depressed feelings to maintain motivation; and (3) the need to set modest goals and anticipate long-term treatment.

A telephone hotline, manned by four experienced interviewers, was set up to receive calls from ex-smokers who had relapsed or who felt at high risk for relapse. A structured interview focused on the physical and social situation in which the relapse occurred and the events preceding the relapse, including the caller's thoughts, affect and behavior. Of 32 calls in which relapse had occurred, 83% were from women. Most relapse episodes occurred in the home and during the evening, while the relapsing smoker was engaged in work or social activities. Half felt anxious, suggesting work-related anxiety was a  contributing factor. Stress, anger and depression were also often cited as factors. Withdrawal symptoms were less often reported. Contact with smoking-related cues was cited by callers reporting positive affect. The consumption of food, alcohol or drugs was the greatest single correlate of relapse. Since most callers reported no specific attempts at coping, ex-smokers may need to be appraised of the risk and provided with specialized coping skills. (NRS)",

        "description":"Agoraphobia is the most pervasive and serious phobic response seen by clinicians, accounting for approximately 50 to 60% of all phobic problems. The symptoms of agoraphobia, a condition in which an individual fears entering public areas, include fears of leaving home, fainting, entering open and closed spaces, shopping, entering social situations, and traveling far from home. There is much fear generalization to additional stimuli throughout the course of the disorder. Numerous other symptoms are commonly present including panic, &quot;fear of fear,&quot; tension, dizziness, frequent depression, depersonalization, obsessions, and stress-related physical complaints. Clinical records indicate that approximately 84% of agoraphobics seen by clinicians are female. This marked sex difference is  not seen in other &quot;neurotic&quot; disorders such as anxiety neurosis and social anxieties. Similarities between characteristics of the feminine sex-role stereotype and the typical characteristics of agoraphobia are striking and suggest that the feminine sex-role stereotype may serve as an important etiological variable in the development of these serious symptoms. Sex-role expectations for women often lead to phobic symptoms. The influences of classical and operant conditioning, modeling, and the transmission of information are mechanisms through which female, agoraphobic-like behaviors are learned. (Author)",

Recently, however, more unstereotyped characters have been introduced into television programming. It was hypothesized that college-age subjects, when presented with prime-time characters pre-rated as examples of stereotyped and unstereotyped portrayals, would perceive these differential stereotypes on ratings of sex-typed traits. Prime-time television characters (N=50) were rated for their levels of stereotyped behavior, attractiveness, and liking qualities by college student subjects. Results supported the hypothesis. All characters were generally rated higher, i.e., more masculine, on the male-valued traits than on the female-valued traits by both sexes of student raters. Support for  the possibility of sex differences in the subjects' ratings was provided by a significant interaction between the sex of the rater and the male- and female-valued traits, which showed that female subjects rated characters as more \"feminine\" on female-valued traits than did male subjects. Unstereotyped characters were found to be generally more attractive and liked more than stereotyped characters. Additionally, female raters seemed especially sensitive to the differences between stereotyped characters. (Author)",

The attitudes of middle aged and older adults regarding death anxiety, life satisfaction, and locus of control were examined to determine whether adults would change their beliefs after participation in a 12-hour educational intervention module on death and dying. Results indicated that as life satisfaction increased, death anxiety decreased. Respondents in poor health expressed significantly more death anxiety than respondents in good or excellent health. Subjects with higher levels of internal control registered higher life satisfaction. Data collected after workshop participation showed that  subjects experienced a significant decrease in death anxiety.

Powerless subjects of injustice, specifically battered women, who are eager to maintain high self-regard may actually identify with the aggressor and develop ways of anesthetizing or avoiding the pain. The physical presence of options or alternatives empowers victims to take charge and activate change in their lives. These alternatives can take the form of personal-, group-, or system-level options, such as psychological exploration of the inner self to make sense of life circumstances, membership in support groups, or legal actions against  the aggressor. When victims are offered options, they are told that they are in a position to do something about their victimization. Options do not, by definition, activate a sense of injustice, but they must be present to instigate the process. (Author/HLM)",

The paper first outlines three areas in the teaching of reading--the symbol, comprehension, and pleasure areas--and notes that teacher questions should aim at development in all three areas. It then presents data suggesting that the preponderance of comprehension questions teachers ask are literal and factual, notes that only a small number of other types of questions are asked, and points to the need for expansion of the types of questions used. Finally, the paper discusses three interrelated areas that can be used in improving comprehension questions: visual mapping, which guides students through concrete series  of steps to perform specific comprehension processes; questioning strategies, which provide teachers with a framework within which to determine the questions they will ask; and tactics for asking questions. To illustrate the discussions, the paper presents three sample visual maps, two questioning strategies (one for analysis of a document and one for discussion of fiction), and 13 tactical guidelines.

Existing readability methods and research findings were reviewed against three major criterion questions and the findings are discussed. The conclusions reported are: (1) readability formulas cannot match material to readers at targeted reading grade levels, (2) rewriting to lower the formula reading grade level score does not increase comprehension, and (3) requiring that text be written to satisfy a targeted reading grade level score focuses attention on meeting the score requirement rather than on organizing the material to meet the readers' information needs. An approach is  outlined for developing a broader based method and criteria to bypass the deficiencies of present readability formulas. It is suggested that an Army readability standards checklist should be developed that would include such items as visuals and organization of content as well as sentence length and word difficulty. The appendix includes a special report, prepared in 1974, summarizing interviews with Army writers of training manuals. (MKM)",

Activities and techniques are described for developing psychomotor skills and sensory learning experiences that are common to both reading and the arts. A model art-reading plan for the use of color is presented and specific information is provided on the processes of speech and drama, similarities in music and language, and the implications of combining music, language arts, and reading. Bibliographies are included for each of the content areas. In addition, the music section provides a discography of recorded story music with and without spoken words (record numbers are identified), and a listing of  filmstrips with recordings.

Specific techniques and activities are suggested for developing the correlation between reading and the communicative skills of listening, speaking, and writing. An outline for a one-semester course in oral communication is also included. Word recognition, comprehension, and study skills are discussed as they apply to listening and speaking. There is a brief section on the appreciation of literature, and a teaching model, adaptable for grades one through twelve, is offered to illustrate how reading instruction can be combined  with other elements of language arts.

        "description":"A total of 29 teachers and 227 students served as subjects in a two-phase study to identify the factors that influence teacher judgments of students' reading interests across grades kindergarten through grade six. The first phase of the study identified 29 cues affecting both student reading preferences and teacher judgments of those preferences. In the second phase, student reading preferences were identified by having students select which books they would like to read from a list of book descriptions. Teachers then were asked to predict the preferences of each student. Each book description was coded for the presence or absence of the 29 cues identified in the earlier phase, and a lens-model analysis of the factors contributing to the teachers' judgmental accuracy was  conducted. The results (1) illustrated that a lens-model analysis may be profitably used to identify the factors that contribute to teacher judgmental accuracy for specific problems; (2) suggested that although student reading interests were predictable, they were also changeable and that teachers did not typically have sufficient knowledge of individual student interests to accurately predict wbich books a student would prefer; and (3) suggested that teachers were highly individualized in their judgment patterns for the task, indicating a lack of a professional format for approaching the task.

The discussion highlights survey results by demographic variables, reports specific analyses of survey items, and analyzes the amount of job reading, total reading, and free reading reported. Results reported indicate that (1) demographic variables such as race, income, and employment status have little predictive value for reading habits; (2) the gender of the reader slightly predicts reading habits and attitudes; (3) working women are maintaining their positive reading attitudes and habits; (4) males' main type of reading is job-related; (5) the major  motivation for male reading is to get something done; (6) the amount of job related reading seems to be on the increase; and (7) there has been a cbange over the years among adults in the way they obtain information about reading materials, with advertising and browsing rivaling friends' recommendations. Appendixes include the Mann-Burgoyne Sociological Model for the Analysis of Leisure Book Reading; norming guidelines for the Mikulecky Behavioral Reading Attitude Measure and Stages of Krathwohl's Taxonomy; 1970 United States, Indiana, and Anderson, Indiana, census information; the telephone survey instrument; and a data analysis chart.

In the second experiment, 102 college students were administered the test anxiety scale and the Nelson-Denny Reading Test, a \"speeded\" test that requires completion in a short time. None of the students in experiment two finished the test, and there were no significant differences in reading comprehension across high, medium, and low anxiety groups. To examine the \"speededness\"/anxiety relationship more carefully, the Nelson-Denny test was  administered to a group of 19 college students who were allowed to complete the test without a time limit.

Both the analytical, sequential, left brain hemisphere and the holistic, visual/spatial right brain hemisphere can be stimulated in oral and written expression through the use of three visual arrangement plans: in the lower grades, visual stories can acquaint young children with some of the major themes of literature and can illustrate character, plot, setting, and word; in the middle grades, pictures and visual patterns can be used to aid sentence combining practice; and in the upper grades, visual compositions can be arranged to help students achieve understanding of organizational patterns in writing. The  visuals can be photographs or can be taken from filmstrips, picture book sources, or comics minus the dialogue. Visual compositions can be arranged to influence students to write narrative or steps in a process, description, comparison/contrast, enumeration, exposition, argumentation, or a combination of styles. Teachers should lead students through the following steps to implement any of these visual arrangements: (1) establish readiness, (2) form the main idea, (3) form the body of the composition, (4) write the composition, (5) review and share the compositions through several postwriting activities. As students learn to order visually, they learn to organize verbally, gaining greater facility in the organizational patterns of written discourse. (AEA)",

        "description":"To determine the amount and kind of news about foreign countries available to most small-to-medium-sized mass media in the United States, foreign dateline stories of the Associated Press Interbureau (IB Blend) and the United Press International state wire were content analyzed for two weeks of consecutive days and two &quot;constructed week&quot; samples from the first six months of 1979. The research was part of a UNESCO-sponsored study involving research teams throughout the world. The findings revealed that both wires carried significantly more and longer stories about less-developed countries than about more-developed countries. In addition, the bulk of the sampled stories concentrated on political and military activity and crime. Economic matters, international aid efforts, social  services, culture, scientific and medical achievements, and ecological issues such as energy and pollution were all but neglected in the coverage of both less-developed and more-developed countries in favor of more &quot;official&quot; news from governmental and military authorities. The findings suggest that basic questions of news value among Western editors and reporters may be more fundamental than those raised by the current controversy about the amount and kind of coverage of foreign nations.

        "description":"The usefulness of teaching advanced composition in a writing tutorial program has been demonstrated at the University of Massachusetts/Amherst with students who have passed college freshman English and who feel they still need some work in their writing. Justification for using the tutorial method is based on the premise that a teacher cannot say anything useful about writing to a large group of writers. Generalities such as \"simplify,\"\"use strong verbs,\" and \"be concise\" often do harm to students for whom such instructions do not apply. Although no formal measurement has been taken of the program's success, the following informal observations have been made: over a period of six years, 14 of the 36 sections of advanced composition have moved to the tutorial method; faculty and  students' comments have been positive; and tutorial sections are always over-full. The problems associated with a writing tutorial are that (1) the tutorial is expensive, (2) it makes bad teaching, as well as good, more effective, (3) it puts heavy demands on student writers, and (4) it does not incorporate reading, class discussion, peer evaluation, or any of the other techniques often suggested to motivate student writers.

        "description":"Media dependency was examined as a complex construct involving the interactions of exposure to television news, exposure to newspapers, and expression of reliance on one medium or the other. A weighted sample of 2,402 respondents was used, representing the United States national population in 1976. A questionnaire assessed each subject's political activity, perceived efficacy of voting/political participation, television exposure, newspaper exposure, media reliance, age, educational level, and family income. Contrary to previous research results, the findings suggested that exposure to television news was not universally detrimental to political affect and behavior. For the majority of the sample who named television as the medium they relied on, television exposure was  positively related to perceived political efficacy and to political activity. Television exposure was negatively related to efficacy and activity unless television was the relied upon medium. Newspaper exposure was positively related to the dependent variables except when television was the relied upon medium. (Author/RL)",

        "description":"A comprehensive analysis of articles and editorials was performed on &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine editions published two years before and after the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The writings of the publisher were also studied, as were personal interviews with the editors of &quot;Ebony.&quot; Editorial content was analyzed with respect to the major racial trends in the United States during the 1960s. The results indicated that &quot;Ebony&quot; published 8% more articles related to civil rights after Adoption of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 than before the act. It was concluded that the increase may have resulted from the magazine's growing awareness of civil rights issues in many different social spheres. The study also found that &quot;Ebony&quot; served as a civil rights advocate, contributing to the social and political  awareness of black Americans during the 1960s. (Author/RL)",

        "description":"This paper describes the media imperialism approach to the study of international communications, which focuses on the processes by which modern communications media have operated to create, maintain, and expand systems of domination and dependency on a world-wide scale. To provide some theoretical basis for the media imperialism approach, the paper presents a brief overview of the dependency model, which analyzes Third World developmental problems in terms of an analysis of the relationships between developed and developing nations. Based on this discussion, new directions for research for media imperialism are outlined. In particular, the paper calls for research on factors and forces operating on a national level to complement research on international factors, for formulation  of the cultural issues involved in media imperialism, and for expanded research of non-mass media forms of communication. In conclusion, the paper argues that in the formulation of a theoretical approach to the study of media imperialism, the concept of theory prevalent in most areas of the social sciences is inadequate and that a broader concept of theory should be used.

The sports pages of the New York &quot;Times,&quot; the &quot;Herald Tribune,&quot; and the &quot;Daily News&quot; for 44 days in 1947 were studied. The following items were tabulated for each story: (1) the number of times Robinson was identified as black and whether the identifying word was used as a noun or an adjective, (2) the number of incidents reported that had racial connotations, and (3) the number of racial stereotypical words used in reference to Robinson (such as &quot;boy&quot;). Figures were also noted of the number of game stories in which Robinson's name did not appear, even though he had  played in the games, and what his batting average was in those games. Photographs were also examined to see how many times he appeared in pictures showing Brooklyn Dodger players. The findings revealed that while there were numerous instances of subtle bias in all three newspapers, the sports writers generally provided fair coverage of Jackie Robinson in his first major league season.

(2) the publication adviser and journalism teacher--teaching methods and problems,  adviser and teacher roles, sources of assistance, and adviser qualifications. (3) adviser and teacher training--the quality and content of training programs, and contact between teacher-trainers and advisers of teachers. (4) legal and ethical issues--the environment in which student publications are published, censorship guidelines and policies, sources of information and assistance, and the extent of legal and ethical problems.

Each of 160 college students in a sophomore-level American history course was given a packet containing the same four photographs, but the subject matter varied as to complexity. Forty of the students saw the four photographs reproduced in a 133-line halftone screen; 40 saw them in a mezzotint halftone screen; 40 saw them in a steel engraving halftone screen; and 40 saw them in a tone-line conversion. Subjects were asked to rate each of the photographs with respect to 14 different characteristics, to rank-order the photographs  according to preference, to describe the photographs in their own words, and to indicate their degree of liking for each photograph. Analysis of the results indicated that perceptions of photographs of subjects of varying complexity and the degree of liking expressed for them were significantly different regardless of variation in their reproduction processes. However, it was noted that the method of reproduction had some influence on how exciting or active certain photographs were perceived to be.

Except for the methods of writing instruction, both control and experimental group conditions were held constant, including class hours, number of words assigned, and choice of topics. Daly and Miller's writing apprehension test was administered at the beginning and end of the experiment along with a two-hour posttest writing sample. A summary of the features of the experimental treatment includes: (1) introductory large group interaction activities; (2) paired-student problem solving; (3) small group problem solving; (4) instruction in peer  evaluation; (5) introductory large group &quot;what to look for&quot; practice; (6) small group sustained peer evaluation; (7) specific essay objectives; and (8) a six-step instructional sequence preceding each essay. Conclusions drawn from the data were that students' writing apprehension was reduced using either method but at a faster rate with the experimental method and that the experimental treatment produced writing that was as proficient in overall quality as that produced by the conventional treatment and significantly longer.

        "description":"This paper describes a year-long, college senior composition course based on nature writing and open to students from all content areas. Nature writing is defined as writing about nature with the specific requirement that the writer must remain true to the objective facts of nature while at the same time presenting the human response to, and the human relationship with, nature. The lecture and laboratory portions of the course are described and the course textbooks and required readings are listed. The first semester is described as a crash course in Western civilization, and the second semester as a synthesis of the techniques, elements of style, and modes of development that students have drawn from the writing models studied. The four modes of discourse emphasized in the  course are explained (description, appreciation, interpretation, and persuasion), as are the exercises assigned to practice those writing modes. The following methods and objectives are said to be emphasized in the course: (1) connecting reading to writing assignments, (2) developing a critical writing distance that combines both informational and aesthetic stances, (3) writing assignments patterned to relate to the discourse modes, (4) extensive field trips to sites that motivate descriptive writing, and (5) peer critiques and guided revision sessions.

Copies of all stories and transcripts of news programs during the first week of the accident were examined from the perspective of a time line of events at the nuclear reactor. The study focused on 20 critical events during that week. College students were trained to code the printed and transcribed news stories, and interviews with all major officials and public relations personnel involved in management of the accident were available to cross check information. Findings indicated that (1) news of events was delayed or unreported, (2) disputes  among officials were unreported, (3) news coverage reflected confusion among sources, (4) background or contextual information failed to be included, (5) presence of a gas bubble in the reactor vessel was not overplayed, and (6) coverage relied on secondary sources.

        "description":"High school journalists are beginning to look beyond the restrictions of reporting the news of the campus to the larger responsibility of reporting the news of the community. Such a functional approach to news gathering can help school journalists to see the relationship between their school and the community and to discover that learning how to cover one is training for covering the other in a later career. If students see how schools function in the total society and incorporate that into their concepts of news, there may be less of the split and historic contradiction between student and professional journalism. As the borders between campus and community dissolve, journalism advisers might use their powers of control and guidance to test new approaches to news gathering. The  campus as a set of beats, a locale of experts, and news course of general public interest can be utilized to show students that school and community are not separate and that the campus is a prototype of the world.

        "description":"A study was conducted to examine the background factors related to two racial attitudes of blacks--black identity and alienation from white society in the United States--and to investigate the relationship between these two conceptually different notions of black racial attitudes. An area probability design was employed and 324 black adults living in the San Francisco, California, area were interviewed. Demographic and socioeconomic factors elicited were (1) age, (2) occupation, (3) income, (4) education, (5) perceived social class, and (6) sex. The subjects each completed a six-item agree-disagree scale measuring alienation from white society and a seven-item agree-disagree scale measuring black identity. The results indicated that younger blacks were more alienated from white  society than were older blacks. Moreover, the younger, the more highly educated, and those of perceived lower social class all tended to have higher black identity. Although the correlation between black identity and alienation from white society was high, an analysis of the relationship of the background variables to the two indicated that they were conceptually distinct.

        "description":"A total of 286 subjects was presented with a series of motivations and asked to evaluate the relative importance of each in their exposure/avoidance decisions about watching sports programs on television. The 188 sports viewers assessed the importance of each motivation for their viewing of baseball, hockey, football, and tennis. The 98 nonviewers, who watched televised sports less than once a month, received a shorter list of motivations that assessed their reasons for avoiding televised sports. Motivation items ranked as important for one sport tended to be rated similarly for the other sports. The most important motivations leading to exposure to televised sports appeared to be identification with the participants and needs for vicarious success. Less important motivations  were information needs, social exchange, and those aspects of emotional release inherent in spectatorship. There appeared to be four underlying dimensions of motivations for viewing televised sports: to thrill in victory, to \"let loose,\" to learn about the players and the game, and to pass time. Motivations for avoiding televised sports centered around more satisfying alternatives to televised sports and lack of time for indulging in such viewing. (Author/RL)",

        "description":"Segments of primetime and Saturday morning television programing were viewed by 225 people who then reported what criteria they used to assess violence on commercial and public television. The subjects also provided data on their visual media experience, their viewing habits, their viewing attitudes, and demographic characteristics. The subjects ranged in age from 15 to 59 years, with about two-thirds of them in the 15 to 18 and 19 to 22 age ranges. The results suggested four major criteria for evaluation of television violence: humor, credibility, empathy, and verbal abuse. Age, sex, family orientation toward television, attitude against televised violence, visual experience, and parental status related to how the various criteria were used. The sample as a whole and parents in  particular rated cartoons low in violence. A pattern developed in which viewers professed more concern about program quality than about televised violence. This preoccupation with quality indicated that training people to be more sophisticated viewers of television might reduce their emotional reactions to televised violence. (Author/RL)",

Specifically, the study sought to determine how people use questions to reduce the uncertainty of meeting new people in impression-formation interviews. The subjects were 14 male and 14 female communication students who had previously completed the Role Category Questionnaire. These subjects were tape recorded as they conducted an impression-formation interview with one of the experimenters confederates. Following each interview, the subject wrote an impression of the confederate. Sex of subject and sex of confederate were counterbalanced. The results indicated that higher cognitive  complexity subjects, especially males, asked more questions during their impression interviews. The females in the study had higher complexity levels than the males, but they did not necessarily seek more information than the high complexity males. The subjects did not necessarily ask the confederates questions that reflected their cognitive dimensions, but seemed to seek the information in ways that followed socially approved norms.

        "description":"A study was undertaken to design and implement an experimental instrument for testing the influence of the Motion Picture Association of America's (MPAA) film rating system on movie attendance. Sixty-five high school students were given synopses of four different fictional films, each of which had been assigned an MPAA rating of G (approved for general audiences), PG (parental guidance suggested), R (restricted to viewers over 17, unless accompanied by an adult), and X (restricted to viewers over 17). The experimental manipulation consisted of varying the MPAA rating. Therefore, some subjects received a film that had been rated G while others received the same film with ratings of PG, R, or X. All subjects received one film synopsis for each category in the rating system. They  then completed questionnaires concerning the likelihood of their attending each of the films. They were also asked to supply demographic information and information about their movie-going habits and to list the movies they had seen in the past six months. The results showed the experimental instrument to be valid. Results of the experimental manipulation were nonsignificant, indicating that for this group of subjects, the MPAA ratings did not affect likelihood of movie attendance. In addition, the findings showed that the subjects most often attended films rated either PG or R. (FL)",

The four studies reviewed here suggest a number of guidelines for choosing staff development programs. The best programs appear to be those that do not utilize lectures but instead emphasize demonstrations and opportunities for teachers to practice new skills and receive feedback. Programs should be individualized to address the requirements of each participant and relate to on-the-job needs. Research indicates that programs are better if they are ongoing, school-based projects rather than short workshops or courses. Observations of other teachers who have mastered the innovation are helpful. Paying teachers to participate in staff development is not  particularly useful. Principals ought to be knowledgeable about and supportive of the program but should not have full responsibility for planning programs. Teachers want, and should be given, ongoing participation in project decisions. Regular, relevant project meetings are important. Research results were ambiguous about whether local resource personnel or outside consultants make better trainers. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"At the beginning of the successful meeting process, the meeting leader decides on a leadership style after considering his or her own nature, the needs and desires of group members, and the characteristics of the organization and situation. In planning the meeting, the leader's first guides are the goals and purposes he or she wishes to accomplish. Next, the meeting planner draws up the meeting's agenda. The meeting takes form as the participants are invited, the seating arrangements made, the meeting room arranged, and background information and agendas distributed to participants. When the meeting opens the interpersonal and discussion skills of the chairperson come to the fore. The leader skillfully guides the group through the chaos of problem-solving and decision-making. At  the same time, the leader is alert for the surfacing of negative emotions and maintains the human relations in the group. When decisions are reached, the leader makes sure that responsibilities are clearly designated and deadlines set. After the meeting, the leader distributes the minutes, follows up on the decisions made, and evaluates the meeting's effectiveness. This document describes each of these processes and identifies the sources from which suggestions have been drawn. (Author/PGD)",

        "description":"Examination of the literature reveals that all reviews of research comparing grade retention policies with social promotion policies favor social promotion. Grade retention fails to ensure greater achievement, either by retained students or their classmates, and frequently leads to long-term damage in the areas of personal and social adjustment. The ideal promotion policy appears to involve an individualized, continuous progress curriculum. Short of the ideal, the best policy calls for social promotion as the rule and permits occasional retention when it is in the child's best interest. Some research suggests that retention can benefit immature students, especially in the very early grades. When schools are in doubt, they should promote rather than retain. Several studies have  found that the ready availability of retention can encourage discrimination on racial, sexual, and socioeconomic grounds. Misuse of retention can be discouraged through involvement of parents, teachers, and specialists in the decision-making process. This document cites several studies of retention and promotion, describes a few policies currently in use, and provides a substantial bibliography. (Author/PGD)",

        "description":"Introducing this paper is a discussion of the trend during the 1960s and 1970s toward greater state and federal involvement both in financing and in developing programs for special pupil populations. The authors then summarize, as of the 1980 fiscal year, the state and federal roles in programs for the handicapped and in bilingual and compensatory education. The number of students served and the level of funding are noted. The information is presented for the purpose of developing policies to streamline the various programs administratively and making concrete suggestions as to the need for program and fiscal changes at both the state and federal levels. The authors argue that a full range of programs for special pupil populations is a matter of good human services policy and  should be seen as an element of good education policy at both the state and federal levels. They argue further that a great deal of attention needs to be given to streamlining special programs at each level and across levels of government. The future issue is how all these programs merge at the classroom level and what is the best set of strategies for providing special services along with regular classroom educational services.

        "description":"The coupling behavior of school systems was examined in this study of how school districts attempt to control and supervise alternative programs. Four alternative high schools for actual and potential dropouts, run by community-based organizations but dependent on local education agencies (LEAs) for student referral and program accreditation, were used for the case study. Two assumptions underlie the study: that school systems are loosely coupled organizations with little supervision over their main product--instruction; and that schools derive their legitimacy from their social milieu. Data were collected through interviews, observations of interaction between the alternative schools and LEAs, and analysis of documents setting down formal commitments and requirements. The study  found that LEA administrators exhibited much control over areas that affected the school's legitimacy, particularly over key areas such as the definition of what constitutes &quot;teacher,&quot;&quot;student,&quot; and &quot;subject matter.&quot; Supervision of course content and instructional methodologies was scant. The study concluded that administrators exhibit tight behaviors in areas that affect the school's societal functions and have little bearing on the school's legitimacy. (Author/JM)",

The theoretical framework was derived from organizational theory and represents a social-ecological approach to the study of organizational effectiveness using student dropout rate as an index of effectiveness. Data were obtained from 487 school districts during 1972-73. Path analysis was the method of statistical analysis used. School district size, conceived of as an environmental variable, was found to be a major determinant of organizational effectiveness. The evidence for this conclusion was that the dropout rate was higher in schools with higher  average daily attendance. (Author/LD)",

A zero energy-use school might use solar reflectors, composting toilets, and natural ventilation. The book is divided into 10 sections, representing 10 separate student projects. Each student explores energy alternatives for heating, lighting, cooling, ventilation, sewage disposal, and water for the proposed school, and completes his or her chapter with detailed drawings. Although the book  cannot be used by an architect or a school district as actual construction documents, its projects do open the door to the possibility of constructing an energy-efficient school.

Nichols,&quot; Title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and other related federal legislation are all directed toward promotion of equal educational opportunity for children whose primary language is not English. These efforts are not well-coordinated by the federal agencies charged with overseeing bilingual educational opportunity programs, which are rarely either well-defined or well-monitored. A coordinated effort must be structured and jurisdiction assigned to appropriate agencies before the final details of an articulated program of cooperation can be worked out. First, funding sources should be connected under a single official, so that the various efforts are no longer seen as mere additions to other programs. Second,  funding eligibility criteria relating to the &quot;Lau&quot; decision should be developed for districts seeking Title VII funds. Third, some requirements for receiving funds should be placed on the states. Fourth, federally funded bilingual resource centers should be more closely regulated and coordinated. Finally, clear, definitive guidelines for compliance with the &quot;Lau&quot; decision, taking into account types of assistance available, should be established and resources for monitoring and enforcement provided.

Although the competency-based learning (CBL) component had worked satisfactorily for a majority of the students, about 27% of the students had received failing, incomplete, or inflated grades as a result of the testing system. In adjusting the program, it was felt that by focusing on the testing system, the greatest amount of improvement could be achieved with the least amount of damage to the concept of a variable paced variable credit program. Problems included the tendency of CBL to siphon off &quot;under-achievers&quot; to the classroom track, the questioned  applicability of CBL to foreign language study, and the &quot;frustration factor&quot; in repeated examination. Also, it was determined that 80% passing levels gave both students and instructors a false sense of security. A new testing system was devised that defined true mastery as 90%. Students are limited to two repetitions of testing. Retroactive testing is an experimental aspect of the new system. Finally, quizzes are now being graded and have become part of the overall unit grade. (JB)",

        "description":"The phenomenon of \"invented spelling\" in young children, observed in many preschool age children who produce written messages using words that are generated through an original system of orthography, was researched with Spanish-speaking children. The following conclusions were made from previous research with English-speaking children concerning the central features of the invented spelling phenomenon: (1) it is systematic, (2) it is based initially upon phonetic principles, and (3) the major principles of invented spelling are virtually identical among children at the same developmental stage. Any non-standard spellings that the children produced were studied to see if they had been generated by principles similar to those that had been observed in the invented spelling of  English-speaking children. The first, second, and third graders from the Dominican Republic in this study used generalizations or concepts about spelling as a system to generate their spellings. Even when they guessed, they rarely guessed wildly. The children produced a very small subset for any given word of all the possible variations of letters that might have been produced to spell the word. This study indirectly demonstrated the shortcomings of an orthography based largely on phoneme-grapheme correspondence. (NCR)",

        "description":"A study was made of a group of ninth grade students to investigate the effects of a bilingual curriculum on monolingual Spanish (MS) students with regard to their self concept and attitude toward school. The research used one treatment group (MS) and two comparison groups: monolingual English Students (ME) and Bilingual Students (BI). The ME and BI groups were from a mainstream curriculum. These three groups of students were administered the following instruments: Self Esteem Inventory (Coopersmith, 1967), Self Appraisal Inventory (Frith and Nakimura, 1972), and the School Sentiment Inventory (Frith and Nakirmura, 1972) both at the beginning and at the end of the semester. The change between pre- and post-test administration was assessed by using an analysis of covariance for  each dependent measure. The pretest became the covariate and the respective post-test because the dependent variable. The results of the analysis of covariance produced a significant difference in the dependent measure Self Esteem Inventory; the Self Appraisal Inventory yielded a significant difference between the groups in self concept; and the School Sentiment Inventory was statistically significant. The need for further research in secondary bilingual education and the importance of longitudinal studies are discussed. (Author/AMH)",

The results indicate that low acceptance rates discourage many potential applicants and that a fairly large and constant percentage of rejected applicants can be expected to reapply. Four previous applicant studies are examined. The results also indicate that the rapid growth rates of applicants in recent years can largely be attributed to three factors: growth in women applicants, increases in resident salaries; and induced increases in repeat applicants. Medical school tuition, loan availability, and the attractiveness of science careers do not appear to have been important determinants of applicants over the  sample period. (Author/SW)",

Most students reported no serious information need and, in fact, indicated that formal information sources (e.g., general directories, guides to graduate study in the specific disciplines, graduate school catalogs) played a very minor role in their choice of a graduate program. The process by which prospective graduate students choose departments is reviewed, and it is concluded that geography, undergraduate faculty members, peers, and other serendipitous factors are important influences  in the eventual choice of a specific graduate program. In conclusion, it is suggested that because of the graduate students' lack of sophistication at the time of application, their information needs are minimal because they do not know enough about the graduate school process to know the kinds of questions they should be asking; thus, there is a need for a larger guidance process to identify information needs.

Major emphasis is placed upon formative evaluation, which takes place over a period of time and is performed by professors rather than external evaluators or judges. Four possible targets for formative evaluations are: course content and organization; teacher roles; program evaluation; and assessment of special projects or innovations. Any formative evaluation program should be flexible, well directed, and confidentially conducted. The author describes a seven-step evaluation system used at McGill University between 1976 and 1978, and documents an actual case study of one professor's evaluation done in this system. Another formative evaluation system recommended for  classroom performance techniques is the Teaching Improvement Process, developed by the University of Massachusetts. Every evaluation system should be subjected to periodic systematic evaluations. The key to a flexible formative evaluation system lies with the honesty of professors themselves, and a commitment to providing excellent education within a wide range of individual styles, subject areas and class types.

        "description":"The percentage of universities using student ratings to evaluate teacher performance is steadily increasing, but this method can be abused if it is the sole criterion of evaluation. Recent surveys of faculty attitudes towards teaching evaluation indicate that most faculty members are in favor of systematic evaluation, prefer student ratings to other methods of evaluation, and believe that student ratings should be used as one of several sources of information in salary, promotion, and tenure decisions. A comprehensive, fair teaching evaluation form to be used for summative purposes should be: easily understood by students; related to student learning; satisfactory in terms of psychometric criteria; under the instructor's personal control; and applicable to many different types or  styles of teaching. Student ratings, to be reliable, should be examined for internal consistency, inter-rater reliability, and test-retest reliability. Research on the validity of student ratings is reviewed, and sources of bias are identified. Alternatives to student ratings in the evaluation of teaching might be direct measures of student achievement and colleague evaluations. Considering these alternatives, and certain limitations of student evaluations, student ratings of teaching are sufficiently reliable and valid to be used only as one of several sources of information in administrative decisions relating to faculty salary, tenure, and promotion.

Data were gathered by research assistants attending classes and from professors themselves.

Chapter One offers an overview of the six major sources of federal student aid. Chapter Two contains an explanation of \"Multiple Data Entry,\" the process that enables a student to apply for a Basic Grant by filling out either a U.S. Office of Education Basic Grant application or one of four other forms. The items used in calculating a student's eligibility index are explained in detail. This chapter is designed to answer most questions counselors may have about completing aid  applications. Chapter Three explains the Student Eligibility Report (SER) and also explains the process by which an applicant corrects any wrong information on the SER. The final chapter deals with special cases, and explains procedures applicants should follow in a variety of circumstances. Also provided are important deadlines, addresses, and services offered by the Federal Student Information Center. Appendices include special instructions for applicants reporting from a Puerto Rican Tax Return and the 1980-81 Basic Grant Application.

For each academic unit, required operating funds and the total number of nonacademic staff (expressed in full-time equivalents) needed for task categories were calculated. Staff activities and expenditures were broken down for both teaching  and research functions.

        "description":"The impact of receiving undergraduate student loans on attending graduate school was studied using the data base of the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972. Information from a base-year survey conducted in spring 1972 and three followup surveys conducted in fall 1973, 1974, and 1976 was used. Approximately 20,000 students representing more than 1,000 high schools participated in the project. The hypothesis that recent college graduates with loans are less likely to attend graduate or professional school than are graduates without loans was not supported. Data indicated that graduates with loans were slightly more likely to be attending graduate or professional school than those without loans. Reasons why graduates did pursue advanced study and the  influence of undergraduate loans was further examined. The influence of grade point average and socioeconomic status was also analyzed using multiple regression analysis. (SW)",

The study was designed to assist staff and members of the Oregon Educational Coordinating Commission with a policy decision. A multi-form, multi-method and multiple audience assessment strategy was used in an effort to account for both the technical and the political dimensions of analysis. The assessment featured in-mail surveys, interviews, extensive use of secondary sources of data, identification of environmental factors that might affect future educational information and counseling service development in Oregon, a specification of study limitations, and a final working conference where preliminary assessment findings were reviewed and debated. The needs assessment  considered the adequacy of educational information and counseling services in the state in order to help in the decision of whether to apply for federal funds under the Educational Information Centers Program. It was concluded that information services were not adequate. (Author/SW)",

Analyzing Induced Course Load Matrix (ICLM) data in this manner is claimed to reduce information overload and perceptual roadblocks to the use of ICLM data.

Data concerning graduate assistantships and faculty staffing levels were used to predict, with a high level of accuracy, the number of graduate enrollments and degrees. Predictions were based on the multiple regression technique. Possible impacts upon institutional, regional, and national policy are discussed, as are the other major theories of graduate manpower planning: the market, demographic, and credentialist approaches. From a theoretical perspective the study tends to support the notion that the training opportunities approach can be used as a proxy for the demographic, market, and credentialist  approaches in analyzing scientific manpower supply and demand. The basic assumption of the approach was that the availability of financial aid to students in scientific fields, as well as the faculty staffing levels in those same fields, ought to serve as a useful predictor of enrollments and degrees produced.

Of the procedures for improving predictive validity of SAT and high school rank, the quadratic equation appeared to be most effective. Four recommendations were made to the public, southern university from which the data were obtained: (1) the 1978 quadratic equation should be used as the official admissions criterion for predicting grade point  average; (2) the predicted grade point average for admission, using this method, should be raised from 1.7 to 1.8; (3) the admissions policy should be modified to accept those students who have the minimum grade point average, have a minimum SAT total of 750 and converted high school rank of 50; and (4) more effective procedures for monitoring course and university withdrawal be used.

Results show that strength of the major department is the most frequent reason for selecting the institution for educationally mature freshmen, both black and white. Those defined as educationally immature selected the university on the basis of academic reputation. It is concluded that the university might do well to build on the apparently accepted idea among educationally mature young blacks that even if a large, traditionally white institution lacks the nurturing environment expected at the  traditionally black institution, it can provide elements of future success. However, it is also noted that even the educationally mature black student arrives at the university with a strong desire for special help in such areas as study and reading skills, and the institution must emphasize these areas.

A secondary study objective was to examine the relationship between these two measures of institutional quality and variables commonly used in previous research on similarities/differences among schools. Institutional profiles among Research Universities I and II (Carnegie Commission, 1976) were found to be markedly different when the following six measures of institutional quality  were analyzed by the spatial configuration technique: number of doctoral programs, total number of doctorates, student/faculty ratio, total research expenditures per faculty member, verbal and math scores of the Scholastic Aptitude Test, and the composite university Roose and Andersen score.

Data gathered by the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems, which constituted the Better Information for Student Choice data base on written formats, were used.

Based on the responses of department heads, a model was developed to relate the effort required to teach a class to the level, size, instructional mode, and discipline of the class. As a validation measure, the model was applied to faculty responses to a typical faculty activity form. The relationship of effort to the variables was investigated by developing linear models. All of the variables were found to make a difference in the amount of effort required to teach a class. In the perceptions of the department heads, as enrollment increases, effort increases but at a decreasing rate.  Additionally, as the anticipated effort to teach a class or a group of classes increases, the time spent increases but at a decreasing rate. The relative time spent on a class by an individual with more than one class is proportional to the relative effort to teach the class. It is argued that evaluation of faculty resources should be based on effort required rather than on time devoted to given tasks. (SW)",

The research goal was to consider whether the OU's teaching system originally designed for adults is suited to the needs and circumstances of students in the 18-20 age group. Additionally effort was directed to developing predictive indices of success and failure at the OU and to assess the level and nature of demand for OU places from the younger age group. Postal questionnaires, personal interviews, and administrative and academic records were used to monitor their progress, to measure their reactions to courses, and to discover their reasons for withdrawal. Groups of entering younger and  older students completed a sociological questionnaire and a battery of psychometric tests. Findings include the following: the pilot scheme for attracting younger students attracted very few 18-year-olds and even fewer school leavers; the younger students fared less well than older students in their first year of OU studies; and younger OU students tended to score lower on the intelligence test than did older OU students and younger students elsewhere in higher education. Among the factors that appeared to underlie the relatively poor performance of the younger students are the following: instability, finance, time pressures, and attitudes.

In order to project university enrollments, Texas public high school graduates were projected. In-migration rates were separated from survival rates, progression/continuation rates were established for each age group in each grade, and a range of enrollment projections for entering freshmen was developed. A method was also developed to estimate transfer enrollments. Once the attrition and retention rates for each group of entering students were determined, the rates were applied against the projected enrollments of first-time freshmen and transfers in order to estimate total undergraduate  enrollment for five years. Although comparable methods for projecting graduate enrollment have not been developed, a number of variables have been considered in making this projection. Techniques for forecasting future instructional workload and funding are also examined. (SW)",

The Entering-Student Questionnaire, one of five developed by SOIS, was chosen to evaluate the efforts in student recruitment, initial student impressions of MSU, opinion of current services and the usefulness of the SOIS questionnaire. A sample of approximately 10 percent of the entering undergraduate population for the 1979 autumn quarter was surveyed. Highlights noted: many students attending MSU chose the school as their first choice; campus services and staff received favorable  review; and the SOIS data analysis provided useful information allowing for more extensive review by various offices mentioned in the report. The SOIS questionnaire proves to be a useful tool when used on a properly constructed sampler group. Appendix A provides a cover letter from initial mailing, entering-student questionnaire, additional questions sheet and comment section, and a letter for follow-up mailing. Appendix B offers written comments on such areas as student life difficulties, most helpful office and social/emotional difficulties. Tables offer statistical data in various areas: enrollment; factors influencing college choice; student goals; and degree plans. (LC)",

The kind of research experiences undergraduates are provided and the importance of research experience to graduate school admission has been studied. Ninety-two percent of 60 randomly selected schools of five different types require an introductory experimental course (in addition to statistics), while 63 percent require some sort of advanced research course or project. A survey of the American Psychological Association revealed that the number of students enrolled where undergraduate research is highly valued as an admission criterion constitute about 50 percent of masters-only-program students, and 71 percent of doctoral-program students, with child/developmental and industrial programs  valuing undergraduate research the most. An apprenticeship system is described wherein junior/senior majors work with professors in the procedure planning, the data collection and analysis, and conclusion drawing stages of research, which culminates when students present papers at professional conferences.

For offices that prepare straight reports and inferential statistics a statistical language that provides report features is recommended; straight report language is suggested for offices not doing inferential statistics. Offices doing their own programming, in part, should keep in mind that: (1) programs producing reports should be clearly documented in English; (2) there should be no more than two languages used in an office, and no more than one person should know each language;  (3) new staff members should learn the languages used, rather than introduce a new language the new staffer knows; and (4) existing official data files should be used whenever possible rather than creating separate new ones.

Questions of bias in testing are outlined, and the discovery and use of new criteria and new tests discussed. Research on scientific creativity--problem-solving ability--suggests that traditional multiple-choice items on the Graduate Record Examination, for example, should be supplemented with items such as free-response questions. Research into medical diagnostic competence is being used to develop new measures for medical  school admissions, and the Educational Testing Service is currently developing a test for business schools that would recognize a student's ability to deal with people. A national survey is cited to show that even today standardized tests are not the single most important criterion for college admission, and a summary of the selection factors used in public, private, competitive, and noncompetitive colleges is presented.

In assessing changes in the role Black colleges are playing in educating talented Blacks, a study looked at the pool of talented Black students to see what proportion attends Black institutions, and how the proportions have shifted between the two school types. Data were used from the Cooperative Institutional Research Program, a national longitudinal study. This study used responses by first-time, full-time Black freshmen to the 1970 and 1978 questionnaires, except in the far west, where no traditionally Black institutions exist. Data items used included those on high school grades, high school class  rank, expectations of graduating with honors, parental income, and plans to get an advanced degree. The hypothesis was borne out. It is recommended that further research be done to determine what characteristics Black colleges have to attract talented Black students, and also that these institutions strengthen their honors programs and expand cultural enrichment and internship programs by attracting federal, state, and private business monies.

Specifically, it looked for the qualities of instruction that medical and pharmacy students consider most important in their learning. A list of 39 instructional characteristics was developed and divided randomly into two lists, which were then distributed randomly to incoming students of the 1983 class at the University of Arizona College of Medicine and the senior class of the College of Pharmacy, for ranking. Responses were received from 145 students. Analysis of the survey responses shows no significant difference in attitudes in the two schools, although medical student responses were in general more  homogeneous and a few salient instructional qualities were ranked very differently by the two groups. Like groups previously surveyed, these students consider clarity and organization of content and presentation to be of great importance; unlike other groups they consider instructor knowledge of lesser importance. It is suggested that this may be due to the survey instrument or to the substantial non-teacher information resources available to these professional students. Further research on this and related issues is recommended. (MSE)",

Among the highlights are these: at public institutions, 69 percent of full-time faculty were tenured, and 23 percent had tenure-track positions; at private institutions these percentages were 63 and 32. The physical sciences had the highest tenure rate (76 percent) and social sciences the smallest (63 percent). Institutions expected to employ non-tenure-track faculty for an average of three years. Of the 12,400 individuals formally considered  for tenure in 1978-79, 58 percent were granted tenure and 22 percent remained eligible for future consideration. The tenure approval rate was highest at private universities and lowest at private four-year colleges. The rate was also highest in engineering and lowest in social sciences. Overall, public institutions reported slightly shorter tenure probationary periods than private institutions, although both expected to use slightly longer periods in the near future. About three of ten institutions accepted postdoctoral appointments as part of pretenure probation. Data charts and graphs are included. The survey instrument, a methods explanation, and a discussion of survey reliability are appended. (MSE)",

On the other hand these institutions vary widely in administrative practices. The type of leave policy varied; there was no consensus as to a retirement age, years required for promotion, teaching load,  requirement to publish, or evaluation of faculty.

Described are the existing problems in the operation and effectiveness of California's &quot;Education Code,&quot; which regulates these institutions. Chapters include: an introduction; background for the study; descriptions of private postsecondary institutions in California; the administration and enforcement of Division 21; degree-granting institutions--the &quot;A-3 Problem;&quot; consumer protection issues; the issue of accreditation; and contracting with private schools. Seven major conclusions are drawn, among them (1) California laws regulating private institutions are among the oldest in the nation; (2) continued inaction by  state governments to enact consumer-oriented legislation to regulate private institutions could lead to the pre-emption of current state laws by more stringent federal laws; and (3) California has the largest number of private institutions in the nation. One of several recommendations suggests that the legislature undertake a complete revision of both Division 21 and the process by which it is implemented and administered. Some 22 appendices offer information such as the survey used in the study, survey participants, survey results, a list of accrediting agencies, A-3 schools by type, Division 21 of the Education Code, and sections of the Education Code to be affected by court decision.

Measures of these characteristics for a sample of 166 graduates of BE/E were analyzed to determine the nature and magnitude of their relationships. Canonical analyses established that measures of cognitive styles were significantly related to measures of aptitudes and abilities, but their common variance was not large enough to be of practical value. Measures of aptitudes were significantly related to measures of abilities and the two sets to have a considerable amount of shared variance. When the various measures were factor  analyzed, three significant factors--technical aptitude, verbal ability, and problem solving mode--accounted for much of the variability among the measures of cognitive characteristics. Thus it was concluded that cognitive styles are relatively independent of abilities and aptitudes and should be considered in selection of BE/E students, in predicting their performance, likelihood of attrition, and adapting alternative teaching treatments to student attributes.

The research group evaluated three different groups and three separate samples--prosocial, antisocial, and a control group--dividing the 255 subjects into four sports categories: hockey, lacrosse, girls' baseball, and boys' baseball. A combined methodology of seeing and observing teams, semi-directed focused interviews, and written opinionnaires were used to study viewing characteristics and monitor actual changes in sports goals and behavior. Overall findings suggest that antisocial models do not necessarily lead to increased levels of aggression, although prosocial  models significantly decrease physical and verbal aggression. Recommendations of the study support future research and encourage media policies that promote participatory goals as opposed to winning-at-all-costs goals, and increase or stress the prosocial content of amateur or professional athletics. Mass media was found to be a definite vehicle for providing appropriate prosocial models that could influence a vast number of participants involved in youth sports and athletics. (RAA)",

Twenty-four students were given the special instruction on a multimedia system that included a minicomputer, viewing consoles, response entry keyboards, and a voice synthesizer. When compared to the control group, the students in the computer-assisted course did as well as those in the classroom, but no better. The 24 subjects were then integrated back into the classroom group where they performed as  well in the remainder of the course as their fellows in the control group.

It is intended to provide up-to-date estimates of such activity, formulate long term solutions to fiscal problems, and expand access potential for library users. Initial examination of sample data shows the feasibility of expansion of the survey to include library and financial data characteristics of heavy lending municipalities and the socioeconomic, library support, and library activity characteristics of heavy borrowing municipalities. Core area definition and analysis reveal the local nature of nonresident borrowing and the limits of  statistical analysis, which indicate that local librarians must now determine causal factors, and that the Board of Commissioners should support further feasibility studies. It is suggested that accessibility factors and collateral use factors as defined in the study should now be used to further studies at local area levels. Five detailed statements of observations and recommendations stress that further reimbursements should not be made on projections of local data, but should concentrate on heavy lenders and encourage development of their services to extralocal clientele.

The experiment tested the concept of a virtual-system mode of access to a network of heterogeneous interactive retrieval systems and databases. An experimental translating computer interface named CONIT, that enables the virtual-system mode, was developed as a research test vehicle. The interface was designed to make the basic functions of three different bibliographic retrieval systems easy to use, even by inexperienced end users, by providing a simplified common command language coupled with extensive online instruction. Analysis of controlled experiments with end users indicates the probable success  of operational interfaces using the virtual-system principle and other techniques demonstrated in the experimental interface. The research has also suggested that certain techniques implementable on an interface could enhance retrieval effectiveness for a wide class of users by aiding them in the development of search strategies.

TIPS encourages the instructor to formulate objectives for meaningful units of a course--objectives which should imply what changes in student behavior indicate mastery. Then multiple choice questions are written to assess student course mastery. The TIPS program uses each student's performance to generate a uniquely catered prescription detailing where performance is above, at, or below standard and what actions the student is advised to take. Early work developing the program is reviewed as well as student ratings of TIPS, comparison of TIPS and non-TIPS classes, selected samples of TIPS objectives, and quiz  questions. Evidence is presented indicating that TIPS seems neither to help nor hinder the &quot;below-C&quot; students, but those less well off students are more satisfied with their education in a TIPS course. They drop the course with more precise reasons related to course content, and show a greater likelihood of re-enrolling in the course in a subsequent semester than students who withdraw from a non-TIPS section.

The model was first developed in a study examining organizational barriers to the flow of STI in organizations. The study collects data on the information-related attitudes and behavior of more than 500 scientists working in a variety of organizations. Secondary analysis of these data culminates with the development and testing of the systems model. Discriminant analysis methodology is applied to the findings and nine variables are found to best account for variance among six job types. Profiles of job types are developed according to relative  rankings of the predictive variables. A classification scheme is then developed which groups them along print, verbal, and STI dimensions. Graphing of the scores of the job types on the predictors results in a guide for assessing the degree of similarity among job types. (Author/RAA)",

By extending the notion of frames to include rule frames which can then be interpreted and applied, expertise of various kinds can be directly encoded into the frame representation. Frame based rules are useful in encoding constraints, performing actions, noticing complex situations, and deducing solutions. By varying the interpretation of a  rule frame, the same competence knowledge can be used in performing each of these tasks. Rules are able to use frame based representation in finding other rules, avoiding most pattern-directed invocation. (Author/RAA)",

The emergence and domain of information science is briefly reviewed, and the need for library education to take into account new theoretical frameworks and new professional services offered by information science is indicated. The contents of three areas of work in information are discussed: (1) professional, both applied and practical; (2) technological; and (3) scientific (basic). Programs and problems in information science education are briefly reviewed, particularly as treated in library schools.

Research involving components of mid-career crisis indicates that obsolescence or fear of obsolescence is a primary factor. It seemed reasonable that a system involving education, information, and communication focused on delivering problem solving &quot;know how&quot; to the professional engineer relevant to the problem he is currently working on could be of real benefit in updating professionals and increasing their productivity. The resulting interactive system PROCEED is described, including its personalized access system, an associated database, and a set of self-study educational materials.  A special feature of PROCEED is the Adaptive Reference System, an interactive series of questions and choices presented to the user by the computer to help him define and refine his problem, so that the system can search its database to find the most relevant and appropriate consultants, aides, or other sources of information to solve it.

The faculty needs analysis was facilitated through an Instructional Development and Effectiveness Assessment System designed to diagnose problems in ten areas relating to instructional methodology and techniques. The data obtained from this analysis, as well as from guest speakers and a library of professional materials, were used in the creation of individual development plans for each faculty members. Administrator effectiveness was similarly diagnosed through a series of evaluation activities for departmental chairmen. The  institutional needs analysis was effected by a Planning, Management, and Evaluation system, using ad hoc committees to clarify goals in the areas of program flexibility, student retention, student advising, instructional development, and staff workload and remuneration. Specific dollar amounts for these goals were assigned, and timetables for their implementation and evaluation were established. Though more work needs to be done on developing satisfactory performance standards for the array of services provided by a college, NCTC's diagnostic system is a first step in keeping up with changing educational needs.

The report first presents seven axioms, developed through an analysis of related literature, which are vital to the advisement process and then provides a bibliography of the materials surveyed. Then, four of these axioms are discussed: (1) recruitment efforts must not be given higher priority than retention; (2) the outcome of academic advising depends more on the interpersonal communication skills of the faculty advisor than on his/her subject expertise; (3) the advising process must actively promote the integration of the student into the college environment; and (4) advising must be developmental in nature, taking into consideration  each student's skills and objectives. Indicators of effective and deficient advising systems are then presented in the areas of the selection and retention of faculty advisors; the organization, methods, and continuous nature of effective advising; and the use of student information. The report concludes by underscoring the importance of assessing basic skills, organizing the advising process around educational objectives rather than academic disciplines, using a multi-disciplinary team of advisors to assess the needs of new students, intensive orientation programs, and a continuous advisor training program.

The building has proven to be an excellent educational facility in many ways; nevertheless, because of its small size and inefficient use of space, in 1979 the Board of Governors voted to build a permanent east side educational facility. The specifications contained in this report were developed to assist in the planning of a facility of not more than 35,000 square feet of inside space, which would not cost more than $3,500,000, would allow for future expansion or contraction, and would be able to house introductory and selected advanced courses, as well as some occupational offerings. The report begins  with a statement of institutional philosophy and then assesses the desirable features and drawbacks of the current facility. It then presents general guidelines regarding the efficient use of internal space, flexibility, the future use of solar power, and pedestrian flow. It goes on to state requirements for office space for faculty and administration, storage space, instructional areas, the Learning Resource Center, and a student lounge. Additionally, specifications are presented for external areas. Finally, plans for the use and growth of the facility are discussed. (AYC)",

This is followed by an examination of the relationship between these goal statements and the development of  department-level objectives for curriculum content, teaching strategies, minimum competency standards, advising and counseling, and program advisory committees. The evaluation phase of the PME system is then described, by which persons having primary responsibility for institutional and departmental goals are asked to rate the extent to which the goals have been achieved after a certain amount to time.

Data from this analysis, in correlation with enrollment figures from Fall 1977 to Fall 1978, were treated with a stepwise regression analysis using effectiveness scores as predictor variables for enrollment change. Major findings, based on a 53% response rate, revealed  that while the majority of colleges were effective in recognizing the value of the customer and in integrating the concepts of marketing throughout their institutions, they were less effective in performing strategic marketing operations.

Information was collected and analyzed from the literature, interviews, observations, participatory games, consultants, and a building type analysis. Findings are reported along 14 developmental goals (such as perceptual and gross motor development) to which environments for exceptional children should respond and along 13 design principles (including orderliness and consistency) to facilitate the goals. Three main products are discussed: the development of new methods in production and communication of design relevant environmental research; the development of a generic program document using an experimental format and stressing developmental goals and  design principles applicable to a wide range of indoor and outdoor environments for exceptional children; and the production of a detailed design proposal for an outdoor learning environment.

Walker), emphasizes the importance of local personnel involvement and provides a checklist for readers to assess their knowledge on the context, methodology, and application. G. Kuh, in \"The State of the Art of Needs Assessment in Education,\" defines the concept and related operational issues and answers 15 questions which should be asked when planning and conducting a needs assessment. S. Davis (\"Planning and Conducting A Needs Assessment\") examines steps in the process, describes strategies for data collection, and reviews considerations for selecting such strategies as interviews, observations, the Delphi  technique, and group process techniques. \"Needs Assessment in Practice\" by S. Davis et al. offers examples of the process in four local inservice education programs and identifies successful aspects of the needs assessment activities. P. Mann (\"Critical Issues and Persistent Problems\") discusses the importance of collaborative planning among administrators, community members, and teachers; and reviews the issues of credibility and program justification. In a final chapter (\"Benefits of Effective Needs Assessment\") M. Walker views mainstreaming from an ecological perspective and suggests that increased local ability to conduct inservice education can have a ripple effect on levels of the exosystem and the macrosystem. Among three appendixes are guidelines for constructing questionnaires,  an inservice training checklist for regular educators, and an outline of a group process technique. (CL)",

Characteristics and educational implications of specific handicapping conditions (including blindness, Down's syndrome, autism, cerebral palsy, amputation, physical handicaps, severe handicaps, multiple handicaps, spina bifida, and deafness) are detailed for the following aspects of development: visual pursuit and permanence of objects, means-ends relationships, causality, construction of objects in space, behaviors relating to objects, imitation, motor development, Stage I of the sensorimotor period and its  relationship to cognition, and language development. Emphasized in each discussion is the importance of understanding the effects of the infant's handicap on overall development, designing alternative strategies for minimizing or preventing the effect of the handicap, and recognizing when the infant is ready to acquire information from an interaction.

        "description":"A study is presented that considers the narrator's knowledge of conventional schemata for stories and the cognitive factors which seem to be affecting the selection and organization of material for narration. Children ranging in age from 3 years 10 months to 7 years 4 months were asked to watch a video tape cartoon and recount the story to a person who had not seen the cartoon. The same procedure was followed with 10 adult university students. It was found that both children and adults used a problem-resolution schema as the major source of content selection. The children differed from the adults in the following points: (1) they used very little introductory matter; (2) they did not resolve all the problems and in some cases neglected to present the problem initially; (3)  younger children included irrelevant information; (4) they generally did not provide a setting for the events; (5) they used different types of transitions between episodes; (6) sometimes they reversed the order of events; and (7) children often needed an image as a memory prompt. Examination of the data reveals which aspects of story schemata are being learned during a particular period, and suggests how development of discourse skills is influenced by certain cognitive developments.

The discussion of language in the classroom revolves around: (1) the speech situation, that is, a situation organized in terms of some nonverbal activity; (2) the speech event, that is, one directly governed by rules or norms for the use of speech; and (3) particular speech acts. The analysis of discourse at home finds the closest similarity between classroom and home in language games with infants and picture-book reading. Studies on these activities are reviewed and related to Vygotsky's concept of the \"zone of proximal development.\" The examples of speech in the home are discussed in terms of their  relationship to later speech development. The research reviewed in the previous sections is applied to language in the classroom with emphasis on the help children get in three activities, namely, answering teacher questions, participating in typical classroom-lesson discourse structure, and other discourse forms.

In addition to analyzing trends in the supply and demand for registered nurses, the impact of major health system changes, such as health insurance, on supply and demand is examined. The current status of programs authorized by the Nurse Training Act of 1975 and other federal programs that support nursing education and training are described.

The program provides grants and loans to students enrolled in college programs leading to degrees in law enforcement or criminal justice. Students employed full time by publicly funded law enforcement or criminal justice agencies are eligible for grants which need not be repayed if the recipient remains employed by the agencies for at least 2 years after completing the course. The investigation revealed inadequate controls and inaccurate records. Billing and collection problems and other accounting and management deficiencies are discussed. Among the  recommendations for correcting problems are the following: computer programs need to be changed to correct problems with billing and cancelled repayment; grant recipients who do not certify employment need to be billed; a comprehensive and aggressive collection program should be adopted; and procedures for controlling and processing payments are necessary.

To help in this new definition process, guidelines are here provided which take into account educational factors of desegregation. The following sections are included: defining institutional missions; assignment of new programs; provision of resources for black institutions; unnecessary program duplication; and desegregation of student enrollment, faculty, administration,  non-academic staff, and governing boards. To assure wise use of state funds, and to provide diverse programs for a changing student and teaching population, the guidelines should be applied with a degree of flexibility to design educational policies and practices that contribute to fair educational opportunity for everyone.

The literature is divided according to two perspectives: issues and tasks that are characteristic of chronological periods in the adult life cycle; and developmental stages that have no strict relationship to age. The discussion of life cycle stages considers age norms and cultural norms, epigenic timing and life tasks, the concept of life structure, and limits of life cycle research relating to sex differences, ethnicity, and social class. Since education has been organized primarily around the developmental tasks of early adulthood, the life cycle perspective may promote rethinking the role of education in relation to later stages of the  life cycle. The discussion of hierarchial sequences of development considers stages of development in a structuralist perspective, strands and levels of development, Loevinger's theory of ego development, and implications for education. Application of the theoretical perspectives to educational approaches is discussed with regard to: development as an outcome of study, education as a support of life transitions, program development and strategy, curriculum and teaching methods, faculty development and evaluation, and career development, counseling, and support services.

        "description":"A discussion of the need for feedback on course quality focuses on feedback needs once the courses have been used once or more and no longer need initial evaluation. This is termed the maintenance phase of course production. Three central questions are addressed. The first asks why feedback is needed at all, and it is proposed that it is to provide information on overall student reaction, for change in specific course content, for necessary modification in course innovations, to improve tutor briefing and support, for larger university planning, and to assist future students in making decisions about the courses available to them. The second question asks for whom the feedback is being collected. The four audiences, each having different needs for the information, are the course  maintenance team, faculty, university committees, and students and tutors. The third question asks what the intended use of the information is. The uses are outlined for each of the four identified audiences. (MSE)",

Changes in rates for men and women enrolled in each segment of California higher education from each country and statewide are documented. There was a net decline in the overall college-going rate found for Fall 1978, which placed it below the rates for 1975 and 1977 but above those for 1974 and 1976. The rates for the University of California and the California State University and Colleges in 1978 were the highest for the five-year period of study, but the community college rate was the second lowest for the period. The net decline in the rate for women was less  than for men, with the State University showing a comparatively large gain for women. The college-going rate does not include students enrolling in private institutions that do not grant degrees or institutions that do not have regional accreditation. Information on students who transferred from and to California institutions is also included. (SW)",

The research investigated the following: the needs for quantitative research skills in various degree programs; departmental requirements for research courses; the enrollment in graduate programs in the College of Education in Fall 1978; enrollment in specific research and statistics courses; and the extent to which each of the research skills was emphasized in the research courses. The investigation enabled description of course content, comparison of different instructors of the same course, and comparison of different courses. Guidelines for an appropriate College of Education sequence in research, measurement, and  statistics were formulated based on an evaluation of courses content or objectives and the needs of graduate students. An inventory of research skills, which is appended, was developed. The inventory, which provided a framework for the instructional development process, included 72 skills, classified within the following general categories: formulating research problems, designing and conducting investigations, analyzing data, and interpreting results and presenting information. Information on required quantitative courses and the instructional emphasis placed on research in selected quantitative methods courses are presented. (SW)",

The detailed examination of the content of the staff reports, the judgments of the relative importance of specific agency attributes, simulated decisions, and a conference led to the following conclusions: the existing criteria address the important issues in identifying agencies that perform effectively in evaluating the quality of educational programs and institutions; the criteria have been applied consistently, and the decisions reached have been appropriate. The study also showed, though, that while substantive changes in the criteria are not necessary,  the recognition process would probably be improved through a restructuring and clarifying of the existing criteria, and through development of more effective procedures for evaluating the criteria addressed to quality of performance rather than to the existence of appropriate procedures. Appendices include criteria for recognition, a questionnaire on the importance of accrediting agency characteristics, mean ranks of comparative importance, a questionnaire on changes in accrediting and approval, suggestions for modifying the recognition process, and an instrument for external validation of Office of Education judgments.

        "description":"The difficult job market for PhD's during the current period of retrenchment on campuses and the need for job search skills for the jobs in the nonacademic sector are addressed. It is suggested that colleges and universities should adapt a version of the Deeper Investigation of Growth (DIG) techniques pioneered by Richard Gummere at Columbia University to aid in the placement of PhD's. The training consists of two parts: the analysis of transferable skills necessary to write a functional, skills-oriented resume, and instruction in indirect job searching. In searching back over the experiences gained, the job searcher will find that certain skills stand out, and these skills will help identify values and the appropriate career direction to be pursued. The functional resume is  composed of an objective, a brief summary of qualifications necessary for the objective, and a summary of related experiences in graduate work or elsewhere. Educational background and work experience information are listed at the very end. The purpose of indirect job searching is to insert oneself into the network through which unadvertised positions are filled. The applicant asks friends and contacts for the names of people working in positions of importance to whom they can seek advice about the opportunities in their field, the nature of the work, and further contacts that may be helpful. Reference is made to the advice given by the popular guide for job searchers entitled &quot;What Color Is Your Parachute?&quot; (SW)",

Objectives of the study were (1) to determine the correlation between other library statistics (e.g., door counts and circulation records) and use of the public catalogs; (2) to calculate the ratio between use of the card catalog and the separate serials catalog; (3) to compare the library staff's use of the catalog with use by the public; and (4) to obtain information about use of the card catalog and the serials catalog in each of several autonomous library service points. The catalogs were observed in 234 10-minute periods. Numerical data gathered from observations are presented in the form of scatter diagrams  and histograms comparing card catalog use, circulation counts, and exit counts. The results indicate little correlation between numbers of card catalog users and other staff-gathered user statistics. It was also found that card catalog users arrive randomly, and neither their numbers nor their arrival patterns can be predicted through use of other library statistics. (SW)",

Two types of evaluation were performed: formative evaluation, monitoring system development and providing feedback leading to further refinement; and summative evaluation, which was concerned with the impact and effectiveness of the IIDA system. Formative evaluation was achieved through observation of system use by three groups: computer science majors, actual users, and library and information science graduate students and faculty. Programming errors were uncovered and system  responses examined through this test of the system. Summative evaluation was carried out through observation of searches performed by two groups of novice users--new students at the school of library and information science, and engineering students taking a technical writing course. Evaluative questionnaires were also completed by the two groups of novice users, and the results are briefly summarized.

The study involved the application of statistical correlation analyses to the data, which were collected from Fall, 10th-day enrollment figures and from annual financial reports compiled by the Illinois Community College Board. Major findings reveal that FTE enrollments at the colleges increased by 51.3% during the study period and that tuition and fees, in terms of constant dollars, rose by only 4.3%. Results of the  correlation analysis, based on computations of the Pearson R statistic, yielded no significant relationship between changes in student enrollment and changes in real or constant tuition/fee charges for any of the Illinois community colleges or for the state system as a whole.

The report then examines several conflict  situations which detract from the administrator's power, competence, and credibility. These conflicts involve personality disputes; gossip; stress related to changes in staff, resources, priorities, or procedures; alliances or cliques; and impasses caused by inattention to identified problems. Conditions for healthy working relationships are then outlined, including the clear definition of roles and objectives, good communications, and respect for professional ethics.

The former students, representing 10% of the Fall 1977 enrollees who did not return for the following semester, were asked to evaluate the courses and services offered at ELAC. In addition, the interview schedule contained questions related to reasons for attending ELAC and for not returning, the use students made of tutorial and counseling services, the students' current employment status, and what they liked most and least about ELAC. Major findings, based on 242 completed  interviews, reveal that most respondents chose ELAC because of its location, and that they typically attended for only one semester. The primary factor most liked about ELAC was the helpfulness of the faculty, and the least liked factor was \"a lack of relevance of the student's major to his/her career goal.\" Fewer than 33% of the students had consulted an academic counselor, and only 16% used tutoring services. Over 80% of the former students were employed--most (66%) in fields related to their education.

The report goes on to examine: (1) Spring 1980 registration rates by comparing the number of Spring 1980 registrants with the total number of Fall 1979 entering students who had not completed their degree; (2) the number of students who registered on a full-time  basis; (3) the number of credits attempted and earned during Fall 1979; (4) the number of students who changed their majors during Fall 1979 and the changes they made; and (5) the number of students who graduated at the end of Fall 1979. Major findings indicate that 69% of the students entering in Fall 1979 re-enrolled in Spring 1980 and that approximately 66% enrolled full-time. The average credit hours attempted were 10.0, and the average credit-completion ratio was 68%. Only 6% of the students changed their major during the semester. (JP)",

Part I presents an operational definition for \"management,\" and discusses five components of the management task: planning, organizing, directing, coordinating departmental efforts, and controlling. The concepts of organizational \"efficiency\" and \"effectiveness\" are clarified in Part II, and various research efforts undertaken to quantifiably measure educational productivity are assessed. Parts III and IV concentrate on community college management activities relating to community assessment, the determination of institutional role, administrative organization,  organizational climate, planning, budgeting, resource development, marketing, program development, personnel policies, management information systems, and institutional evaluation. Finally, Part V discusses the alternative instructional methodologies utilized by community colleges to increase productivity and suggests an empirical model for the productive management of labor-intensive, human service agencies. Case studies describing management practices at three representative community colleges are appended and bibliographies conclude each section of the paper. (JP)",

        "description":"A survey was conducted during Spring 1979 to assess the employment and/or educational activities of Lane Community College (LCC) vocational students who either graduated or dropped out during 1977-78. Members of the survey sample, comprised of 442 graduates and 306 early leavers, were asked to indicate: (1) the full-time/part-time status of their current job or enrollment; (2) their current salaries, if employed; and (3) the relationship of their job or current major to their field of training at LCC. Major findings, based on a 52.2% response rate from graduates and a 26.3% response rate from early leavers, indicated that while approximately the same proportion (78%) of both groups were not attending school, the employment rate for graduates (84%) was higher than that for early  leavers (68.2%). Of those who were employed, 83.7% were working full-time, and 74.8% were in jobs related to their LCC training. Salary figures indicate that graduates earned a median income between $900 and $999, compared to early leavers who earned on an average between $600 and $699; and that the median female income bracket was $200 to $300 lower than the male median. The survey report summarizes the sex, age, and ethnic characteristics of the respondents, indicates the percentage considered to be disadvantaged or handicapped, and provides a breakdown of findings for each of LCC's vocational education clusters: business/data processing, health occupations, mechanics/electronics, natural science, and public service. Data tables and the questionnaire are included. (JP)",

        "description":"This paper brings the perceptions of a social psychologist to bear on curricula as currently taught in the schools. Many discussions of the school curriculum hinge upon the questions what, when, and how, and leave the most important why question unasked and unanswered, perhaps because it is so difficult to answer. In contrast to such theoretical concerns, practical consideration of the social psychological constraints upon the curriculum suggests that the curriculum is primarily influenced by the following five factors: (1) the entering characteristics of the learners; (2) the nature of the subject material; (3) educational aims and instructional objectives; (4) personality variables of the teacher; and (5) the organization of plant and personnel (i.e., communication structures  and the social psychology of the institution). In England, and to a small extent in North America, it would seem that primary/elementary schools have, by and large, been fairly successful in accommodating influences one and five. Primary schools have not done particularly well in respect to influences two and three. Features grouped under influence four still need a great deal more research before even the crudest of generalizations can be made about their effect upon curriculum. However, it is apparent that the self concepts of teachers and students have marked implications for learning and curriculum planning. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"Psychosocial theory, based on the ideas of Erik Erikson and Robert Havighurst, is proposed as a useful framework for conceptualizing the potential for growth within the family. Erikson's (1950) eight stage theory of psychosocial development and Havighurst's (1959) concept of developmental tasks are used to take account of the stages of development of both parents and children in looking at the reciprocal influence of parents and children on one another. At each stage of development, the emerging competencies and the normative crisis of the period are seen to influence the skills and the preoccupations that family members bring to their interactions. Erikson's concept of psychosocial crisis is used to examine phases of development when there is the potential for support and  encouragement, or for heightened tension among family members. The theory postulates that at each stage of development society makes certain psychic demands upon the individual. The process of adjustment to these demands produces a state of tension or crisis within the individual that forces the person to utilize developmental skills that have only recently been mastered. Processes and skills of crisis resolution that are unique to each of the stages of the life cycle are outlined. The concept of coping, which is similar to White's (1960) concept of active mastery, is related to the process of crisis resolution. Coping involves a new approach that will bring the person beyond the problem and into a new relationship with the environment. (Author/SS)",

Conducted among American preschoolers, Navajo and Puerto Rican school children, and American, Mexican and Maori adults, all of the studies employ techniques of environmental modelling that permit objects such as buildings, trees and vehicles. A pilot test of the environmental modelling technique conducted in Puerto Rico in 1968 demonstrated that increasingly with age, children grouped the models in ways resembling landscapes. Subsequent studies indicated (1) positive features of the technique in assessing environmental cognition and (2) considerable ability among very young children. Among the Navajo the models were found to be very effective in eliciting talk about Navajo residence patterns. Environmental  modelling was used in 1972 to assess environmental cognition among adults in Santa Monica, CA, and, later, to assess the relation of sex roles and socioeconomic class to environmental knowledge among Mexican adults. In 1978, the modelling technique was used to solve a problem of environmental design when the Maori of Waahi, New Zealand, were awarded money to relocate and redesign important areas and structures in their community. Through the use of modelling techniques in planning seminars attended by community participants, planners and other environmental professionals, spatial attributes of Maori cultural organization became evident.

Research was carried out in three adjoining villages where well over half of the income of residents is derived from wage and salaried employment in industrial towns. The study consisted of interviews with over 30 mothers (or other caretakers) of more than 40 children, half of whom were under the age of two and the other half spread across the preschool years. Subjects were selected by going from house to house and enquiring about families with young children. The final interview schedule concerned six areas of behavior: feeding, sleep, bathing and dressing, strangers, sensitivity and illness, plus a general summary category called  personality. All interview sessions were taped. Informants stated that children were similar with respect to cleanliness, playing with others, and sleeping with parents, but that individuality among children was evident in their eating patterns, shyness or friendliness toward strangers, patterns of illness and speed of recovery, activity level and motor skills, and mood. Generally, Malaysian parents expect and encourage individual differences in children. They use language to control their children's behavior and provide easily understood reasons for warnings and restrictions. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"Preschool personnel (61 teachers and 34 administrators) from six locations throughout Texas were surveyed in order to describe the types of materials purchased and desired for preschool settings. A survey questionnaire was designed to address the following major questions: (1) who selects and buys materials? (2) how much money is spent on materials? (3) what type of media and materials are currently used? (4) how do personnel find out about materials? and (5) what types of media and materials are needed in the future? Results of the survey indicated that approximately $300 is spent per classroom on a yearly basis and that individual teachers personally purchase about $100 of additional materials. Purchases are made primarily on the basis of items seen in training workshops or  displays, local stores, and catalogs. Storybooks, manipulatives, toys, and games are very high purchase items (100%). In terms of future purchases, much of the same items are desired, plus records and pictures. Well over half of this group spend more than five hours of personal time each week in making materials. If given a choice, respondents would buy items which require some preparation time but provide greater quantity rather than a smaller number of completed items. (Author/SS)",

The survey was conducted in the form of a 22-item questionnaire administered during a training workshop for Head Start teachers. Teachers were asked about their professional experience, about the toys in their classroom, the toy preferences of teachers and children, accidents with toys and the need for more information on toy safety. Among the results, teachers appear to prefer Manipulative Toys and Miscellaneous Toys more than they perceive the children as preferring them. Teachers see children as preferring Action Toys and Make-Believe Toys more than do teachers. The  teachers indicated that dangerous toys such as darts and roller skates were desirable for classroom use. Other attitudes expressed by teachers concerning the problems of toys and the causes of accidents further indicate the teachers' lack of information about toy safety. A chi-square analysis was run to determine if two factors had any bearing on teachers' responses: education, and whether or not the respondents had children. This analysis is included in Appendix A.

        "description":"This paper suggests three major directions for improving the family-school relationship, and thus developing productive environments for learning. First, a meaning of curriculum is defined to determine where parents and teachers should direct their attention in order to improve the curriculum in families and schools. Second, four existing assumptions about education that separate families from schools are examined and criticized: (1) academic competence results from the successful completion of tasks under the direction of a teacher in a school; (2) teachers are primarily responsible for decisions about the academic (mainly cognitive) growth of children in school while parents are expected to make the major decisions about the physical and social or emotional development of  children in the family; (3) the important variables in the family that affect academic competence are essentially inalterable; and (4) the organizational conditions that hinder teachers from including home environment as part of the curriculum are practically impossible to influence from inside the school. New assumptions which might be used for forming closer associations between families and schools are mentioned. Thirdly, a design for teaming parents and teachers is proposed, one that would encourage both groups to collaborate in building complementary learning environments for elementary school children.

The term &quot;life plans&quot; included educational and occupational aspirations as well as expectations of age at marriage, number of children desired, and place of residence desired. Analyses were organized into background, parenting, middle childhood, and high school factors. The sample (planned to yield as many blacks as whites and to restrict the study to subjects from areas marked by poverty and high unemployment) consisted of 311 primarily rural females who were questioned in 1969 as fifth or sixth graders and again in 1975 (if they had not married or dropped  out of school) and the mothers of these girls. The following factors were found to be associated with &quot;age at marriage&quot; expectations: race; father's education; prestige of mother's occupation; perception of loving, punishing or demanding mother; occupational counseling of daughter by mother; self-concept; occupational and educational aspirations and expectations; occupational saliency; and residential preferences. Factors associated with larger family size expectations were: rural residence, black race, lower socioeconomic status, father unemployed, and lower prestige of desired and expected occupation. (AN)",

Exemplary data collection activities reported include the Spokane Reservation Population Survey, the Oneida Reservation Problems/Needs/Wants Survey, and the Tlingit-Haida Community Survey. These surveys are presented as representative projects with key elements that may be used by CETA, other government agencies, and Indian communities to improve the data bases that in part control planning, funding, and programming. For instance, it is reported that the Spokane survey confirms the reservation population to  be much higher than federal estimates and helps establish a new process for Bureau of Indian Affairs Labor Force Report updates. Following the discussions on the surveys, a suggested approach to coordinated community data collection is presented along with an outline and discussion of the five major tasks involved in the collection process. Appended are copies of survey documents, the Shoshone-Paiute Health Needs Survey instrument, the 1980 census supplementary questionnaire for American Indians, and a model for a community social profile.

Curriculum, scope, and sequence are defined, and suggestions are made for using commercially prepared curriculum materials (which often ignore minority representation) as supplements to individually planned programs. A list of 14 centers and organizations that specialize in American Indian-oriented curriculum is included. The problems of stereotyping and depersonalization of Indians, prevalent in children's literature, are described in the mini review, and guidelines for selecting unbiased reading materials are discussed. Ten methods and strategies for effectively using the literature, a challenge to present young readers with truthful and meaningful materials, and a list of instructional materials and reading selections are given. In the second fact sheet, a brief history of American Indian legislative funding is described, with an emphasis on particular pieces of funding being used to aid Indian education today. A summary of Alaska's development of Indian education is revealed as exemplary of some of the problems encountered in achieving quality education. It is suggested that further research, better use of funding, and continued pursuit by the Indian student will provide hope for a better education in the future. (JD)",

Four lines of comparative inquiry which are used to understand patterns of efficiency and effectiveness and to define those factors contributing to growth and decline in the population of farm production units are examined: (1) population characteristics, (2) organizational unit characteristics, (3) farm manager characteristics, and (4) environmental characteristics. Population studies of the farm industry seek to link ecological  characteristics to changes in the number and distribution of farm firms. Studies of farm organizational units examine the size, scale, and internal structure of farm organizations to determine their behavioral characteristics and responses to environmental conditions. Attention is paid to outcome measures of effectiveness and efficiency. Managerial characteristics represent a set of conditions suggested by open systems theory; openness to innovation, educational levels, and motivations of farm operators are fundamental forces determining organizational responses to environmental conditions and technological change. Additionally, the external technology of the organizational environment represents a central set of factors determining the range of solutions available for organizational and  productivity problems.

Data were gathered in a 1979 mail survey of registered voters in Kentucky which yielded 11,015 respondents for a response rate of 69.1%. Data were examined using log-linear analysis, bivariate cross tabulations, and analysis of covariance; and the results indicated that place of origin and value adherence had a significant effect on destination, while moves related to employment had only a slight effect on destination. Results also indicated: migrants tended to move to communities similar in size to those left  behind; migrants moving for employment reasons tended to make inter metro or inter nonmetro area moves; and migrants moving for nonemployment reasons were more likely to move according to adherence to Gemeinschaft (patriotism, humanitariansim and salvation) or Gesellschaft (personal freedom, individualism, and leisure) value orientations. Therefore, value adherence was seen as the key to the metro/nonmetro switch, and an understanding of value orientations was seen as essential for understanding population redistribution in contemporary American society.

        "description":"Data from the Annual Housing Survey indicated that 22% of all employed United States household heads commuted to a county different from that in which they lived in 1975. Commuting was more prevalent among men than among women and slightly higher for whites than for Blacks. Commuting tended to increase until age 25-34 and then to decline after age 45. Commuters had a generally higher income level than did noncommuters. Education was directly associated with commuting in metro areas but was generally negatively associated in nonmetro areas. Those who had recently moved from metro areas into nonmetro areas commuted at a rate double that of other nonmetro heads. Nonmetro-to-metro commuters outnumbered metro-to-nonmetro commuters. Median time spent going to work was 14.5 minutes for  nonmetro heads and 21 minutes for metro heads. Though automobile travel to work dominated in all areas, there was greater use of public transportation in metro areas and more walking or riding with others in nonmetro areas. Survey data point out groups that will be most affected by continued high prices of gasoline and other costs of commuting and the need for the development of alternatives to individual travel. Detailed tables are included in this study. (CM)",

An &quot;individual level perceived community function&quot; approach was used in a questionnaire/survey in which respondents were asked to rate the value of certain community attributes. Ratings were then factor analyzed by principal component-varimax rotation procedures. Results of the first study indicated that both over-65 and under-65 groups looked to their small towns and rural communities to provide 3 functions: personal relations (proximity of friends and relatives),  maintenance (jobs, shopping facilities, medical services), and personal development (availability of adult education opportunities). In larger communities, however, the groups differed as to which community attributes contributed to the three functions named above. Results of the second study indicated that both over-60 and under-60 age groups found satisfaction with maintenance attributes and personal relations attributes. In neither group, however, was the personal development area uniquely predictive of community satisfaction. The major difference between groups was that the under-60 groups found satisfaction in the recreational facilities attributes but the over-60 groups did not. Implications for future research were deemed many and varied. (AN)",

Length of time in the program made no difference in the seventh grade  performance of the experimental group in the three variables. While the control group scored higher in English reading comprehension, vocabulary, and English language skills at the end of elementary school, the experimental group achieved comparable performance in the seventh grade in all but the last of these measures. Although the experimental group appeared more anxious, there was no difference in self-concept between groups. Finally, the GPA of the experimental group was significantly higher during elementary school but this difference disappeared in the seventh grade. (SB)",

Additionally, addresses, contact persons, service areas, and samples of available materials from each of 16 Regional Resource Centers are presented. The second mini review is concerned with utilizing home-based education to provide good early childhood programs to rural areas faced with geographic isolation and limited facilities and finances. Six successful  early childhood programs focusing on very young children, pre-kindergarten children, and handicapped children are detailed. A fact sheet concerning rural transportation systems addresses the most common types of rural school transportation, their uses, driver preparation, ownership and management options, and the effects of extended travel time on students. A second fact sheet addresses the characteristically poor reading achievement in rural areas and details seven successful reading projects, including three which have incorporated an individualized approach to improve rural student reading achievement.

        "description":"Presenting a brief overview of federal aid to education, this paper approaches the equity issue by first detailing the unique characteristics of rural school districts and then examining rural program needs in terms of the appropriateness, sufficiency, and manageability of federal aid for rural schools. Emphasizing the diverse nature of rural school districts, this paper describes characteristics common to most rural schools: small enrollments, sparse populations, close school-community relations, and problems of isolation and finance. Specifically, the following questions are raised: (1) Do federal education programs offer 'appropriate' assistance to rural schools, given their unique characteristics? (2) Is federal education aid 'sufficient', given the nature and extent of rural  needs? and (3) Is federal education aid manageable in rural schools? This analysis suggests that the needs of rural school districts necessitate flexibility, specialized services, greater resources and educational opportunities, and greater levels of financial aid. Calling for programs designed to meet the special needs of rural schools, numerous steps are suggested for equitable adjustment in the federal aid program. Among these are: elimination of the \"density bias\" of federal aid programs; reduction of average grant sizes to increase availability to greater numbers of schools; increased availability of small grants to teachers for individual projects; allowance for greater latitude among grant recipients; and closer monitoring of state departments of education in their distribution of  federal funds.

Four types of estimation skills were identified by an estimation matrix. Three instructional strategies were selected: (1) a personal reference unit, (2) a cut or drawn unit of reference which was put out of sight before making an estimate, and (3) estimation without specifying an explicit strategy. The personal reference strategy was significantly more effective than the unit reference strategy for the estimation type that was the same as the instruction. (MK)",

The program, used in writing and mathematics, is based on three assumptions: (1) that classroom teachers are the primary untapped resource in schools, (2) that tests of any kind must be used as the imperfect measures of student learning which they are, and (3) that teacher efforts to focus their instruction must be encouraged and supported. The five key components of SAM - skill expectation, focused instruction, focused monitoring, instructional resources, and staff development - are explained and discussed. SAM is described as a dynamic program designed to link effectively instruction and testing in a symbiotic relationship.  Instruction is the vehicle for helping students learn, while testing is the vehicle for monitoring the success of instruction. (Author/MK)",

Some highlights of the report are: (1) Typical mathematics course offerings in both junior and senior high schools vary little throughout the state; (2) Community type is a better indicator of mathematics enrollment patterns than school size; (3) Most high school mathematics is elective, required courses in high school are more likely in rural and suburban schools; (4) Enrollment in mathematics in grades seven and eight is  predominantly required; (5) Male enrollment exceeds female enrollment in nine out of eleven typical high school mathematics courses; (6) Male enrollment in remedial mathematics exceeds female by 26% in both junior and senior high schools; and (7) Less than 1% of the enrollment in high schools is in advanced courses such as calculus, analytical geometry, or probability and statistics.

Using the obtained data, the authors' purpose was to determine if the logical operations under question were closely tied to specific content. Sixty-eight high school students (32 males and 36 females) enrolled in a biology course at Delphi High School in Delphi, Indiana served as subjects. The subjects did not perform more  formally on the subject matter free Longeot examination and on the biology examination than on the Piagetian tasks. It was concluded that Piagetian tasks are relatively content free and can serve as realistic indicators of concrete and formal thinking abilities. (Author/DS)",

There is much evidence that suggested young children have a concept of number for small numbers, but not for large ones. A concept of number was hypothesized by Piaget to rest on the child's ability to correctly integrate two stimulus dimensions, length and density. Piaget's analysis predicts that young children's judgments will obey the correct Length x Density Integration rule, whereas large number judgments would obey a one-dimensional rule. The study reveals that children's judgments of small numbers did follow the correct Length x Density rule, while the children used an incorrect Length + Density rule for large  numbers. These results show that a concept of number is present for small numbers but not for large numbers, in line with previous work. Contrary to Piaget's analysis of previous work, the absence of a concept of number does not imply the absence of stimulus integration. (MP)",

The information explosion in science and the shift in our economy from the production of industrial goods to a greater emphasis on science and knowledge-based industries has created a discontinuity in the nature of jobs and our educational needs. Computers are not a major part of American education, but have become indispensible to the operation of science, business, and government. Many schools have introduced computers into their curriculum, but the paper stresses that these local efforts only partially satisfy the country's needs at costs that are prohibitive and unnecessary when viewed nationally. Other nations have begun the task of restructuring their systems to include computers. It is stated  that there is a national need to foster computer literacy, or the next crisis in American education will be the computer literacy crisis. (MP)",

It is recommended that school districts adopt a policy with guidelines in regard to the use of calculators, and that calculators be used as tools to reinforce the basic skills, not as substitutes. Calculators can be used to facilitate the use of comparison and estimation in problem solving, including real life situations, at all levels, and to teach children critical thinking.

It is hypothesized that effective management within today's framework is the only way to progress toward the political and economic order that is necessary to assure peace and security, justice, and human rights, and to improve the quality of life. It is presented in three parts divided into 16 chapters. Part I is entitled \"Today's Predicaments.\" Chapter 1 discusses the pace and scope of global change in recent decades and lists six factors affecting that change. Chapter 2 discusses the rule of law on a global basis and postulates that the use of management techniques can help resolve global problems. Part II focuses on global issues that must be addressed. Eight chapters present  background and current information about peace and security, disarmament, world economic order, economic and social development, the resource/population balance, biosphere, and human rights. Each chapter defines the problem, outlines objectives, points out accomplishments and successful programs, states obstacles, suggests possible resolutions, and concludes with the posture of the United States. Part III consists of five chapters which discuss current and possible roles and opportunities for world organizations, nation-states, nongovernmental organizations, and the United States to take in resolving the problems. The final chapter calls for leadership. (CK)",

        "description":"This publication summarizes the history of education in Alabama. It is intended to enhance the interest in and appreciation for the state's educational system and to demonstrate to Alabamians the value of building and maintaining a strong educational system. Education began in Alabama with the Indians who inhabited the state. Alabamian Indians loved oratory and used this method to instruct their children in the history of the widespread migrations and heroic exploits of their tribes. Each generation of Indians in Alabama also taught to each succeeding generation the various skills necessary for the survival of its primitive culture. The various European countries, being interested in economic profits, did little to establish any educational system in Alabama. Later, however, when  Alabama entered the Union in 1819, the state strongly supported education for its citizens. The War Between the States in 1861 disrupted an adequate educational system that was making progress. During Reconstruction, the state government attempted to rebuild the school system and to extend education to those whites and blacks who were excluded in antebellum times. After Reconstruction, education in Alabama did not keep pace with the rest of the nation for a variety of reasons--a poor economy, excessive numbers of children, a dual school system, and a general disinterest in education. Currently, federal funds and more state government emphases on education have greatly strengthened the state educational system. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"The paper analyzes the failure of the ecology/environmental movement to develop into a social movement and to generate a mass following. The movement has had difficulty not only in organizing collective behavior but also in maintaining the necessary momentum to change into a full-fledged social movement. Obvious reasons are that ecologists conflict with pressure groups, big business, and capitalistic industries. Also, the mode of thinking in the United States is characterized by the frontier mentality. People do not accept the fact that environmental deterioration is irreversible; many point to the possibility of a technological breakthrough and suggest that great American know-how pulls us out of any crisis. In addition, society has institutionalized the idea of growth. To  change this type of thinking requires strong leadership and a committed, active followership. One of the major problems is that the ecology/environmental movement is preceived as fragmented and unable to coalesce its own common interests. Finally, the media, although not antagonistic, do not appear to support the movement because it is not perceived as leading to a positive change of society. Its goals are perceived as unattainable or attainable only with a great deal of sacrifice and participation in the movement is in the form of leisure time, disposable income activities. (Author/KC)",

Students study visual communication by analyzing advertising techniques, practicing fundamental drawing and layout techniques, creating silk-screen posters, and developing and printing photographs. Product design activities include describing elements and principles of design of various objects, constructing a prototype container, researching the market for various products, and designing a package. In environmental design, students design a house based on physical, emotional, and aesthetic needs, functions, traffic patterns, and energy conservation. Commercial Art II  repeats the three units of Commercial Art I. The emphasis in visual communication is on graphic design, displays, illustration, and media/photography. Product design focuses on industrial design. Students create a product based on several factors of design. In the environmental design unit, students study urban planning by formulating solutions to community planning problems. Instructional and performance objectives, a suggested sequence for instruction, a list of materials needed, and suggested assessment measures are included for each unit.

Problems are presented in two main categories--internal and external. Internal problems include high immigration levels, religious and cultural differences among various Jewish sects and between Jews and Israeli Arabs, a high inflation rate, negative attitudes among Israeli youth regarding Israel's social and political policies, and the paucity of Israel's natural resources when compared with her Arab neighbors. External problems center on Israel's location amidst unfriendly Arab nations. Israel's traditional education system consists of free and compulsory education for ages five through 16, free education from ages 16 through 18,  vocational schools, professional and technical schools, universities with selective entrance requirements, and education for Israeli Arabs under a separate but equal policy. Many innovations have been developed by the Ministry of Education and Culture to help those citizens whose needs are not being met within this traditional system. Innovations include upgrading rural Israeli Arab schools, recruiting teachers to serve in rural areas, designating rural teaching an alternative to army service, offering Hebrew language classes, hiring university students as tutors in elementary and secondary schools, and training young mothers with little or no formal education to work with other women in rural areas on topics such as child development.

        "description":"A survey to identify current school activities and interests in programs associated with citizenship education is reported. A random sample of principals from 593 elementary and secondary schools in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware responded to a survey questionnaire. Results indicate that areas of highest activity involve community members in schools and student involvement in school governance. Schools were most interested in developing activities which focus on inviting community members to school to work or speak with students on citizen education-related topics and conducting inservice training for staff on students' social development. Areas in which respondents noted high interest and currently low activity include moral/ethical/values education, and citizen-related  cognitive and social skills. Fourteen statistical tables depict the mean number of activities in 16 citizenship education areas, degree of interest in development of activities in these areas, and areas of high interest and low activity.

Unit I discusses the diversity of contemporary Mexican culture as a product of several cultures blending through three major developmental periods. Unit II focuses on the physical environment and its many contrasts. Unit III outlines ten periods in Mexican history and the contributions made by various peoples and events. Unit IV discusses contemporary society,  socioeconomic characteristics, and the influence of the family. Unit V emphasizes Mexico's economic situation and its economic development. Unit VI outlines the present political situation, government, and foreign relations. Unit VII focuses on Mexican-Americans and their culture. Each unit is accompanied by sketches designed to be made into slides. A briefly annotated bibliography lists 43 books, each keyed to a unit. (CK)",

        "description":"This report presents information on a search for measures of citizen education in elementary and secondary schools. It is intended to update information presented in ED 159 115 and to reevaluate the current state of affairs in measurement of citizen education goals. The document is presented in three sections. Section I explains criteria and sources used in the search. Criteria included that a measure must have been tested on at least one grade level, publicly reported, and judged technically adequate. Sources included &quot;Citizen Education School Improvement Effort,&quot; Research for Better Schools, 1980; and &quot;Current Index of Journals in Education&quot;, ERIC, 1976 to 1979. Section II presents results of the search with regard to 12 general citizen education goals: 1) inquiry skills, 2)  respect and caring for others, 3) commitment to equality, 4) commitment to personal freedom, 5) identification with participatory groups on all levels, 6) interpersonal skills, 7) action skills, 8) knowledge about predictions of social problems, 9) commitment to rationality, 10) knowledge of institutions and systems, 11) knowledge about social issues, and 12) commitment to action. Section III presents findings and identifies areas for further research. Findings indicated that goals one through five are now relatively well covered by measures for secondary school grades and that goals eight and nine should be further researched because they remain without appropriate measures at any grade level. The conclusion is that three measures should be highlighted as particularly useful--the&quot;Psychosocial Maturity Inventory,&quot; Greenberger, 1976 and two &quot;Educational Goal Attainment Tests,&quot; by Tuckman and Montare, 1975. An annotated bibliography concludes the document. (DB)",

Three teachers participated in the study. In response to a general request to state their plans for the lesson, the teachers consistently mentioned content to be covered and activities to be engaged in, and frequently mentioned the materials to be used in the planned lesson. The influence of the discrepancy between the teacher's expectations and the actual events during the lesson on teacher decision making is illustrated in three case studies corresponding to three different degrees of teacher-perceived discrepancy between plans and classroom reality.

        "description":"Findings are presented of an empirical study involving public, private, and parochial school systems' use of standardized test information by central office administrators. Examples of actual use are given, and descriptions of central office perspectives on standardized testing are detailed. Three categories were found to account for most of the criteria used in test selection: test content/design; information produced by the test and its potential use; and monetary and time costs. Test content/design was the most prevalent category. Overall, the frequently reported justifications for testing were individual student diagnosis and placement, program evaluation, and achievement measurement. Central office administrators were found to view testing as primarily serving  student-oriented purposes. Generally, testing did not appear to be salient to central office administrators; rather, they viewed it as necessary to provide test information to those in the organization who used it at the individual student level.

The methods are compared for both normal and non-normal distributions. When the distributions are normal, the rank and inverse normal scores methods are effective substitutes for the linear discriminant function (LDF) and the quadratic discriminant function (QDF). When the populations are non-normal, the LDF methods based on the ranks or the inverse normal scores are more effective than the LDF or QDF methods based on the raw data. Finally, when the criterion sample sizes are unequal, the inverse normal scores approach is more desirable than the rank approach. When the criterion sample sizes are equal, either of the two  procedures can be used. (Author/JKS)",

Specifically, the assumptions are: (1) that cases are assigned randomly to treatment conditions; (2) that the covariate is independent of the treatment effect; (3) that the covariate is measured without error; (4) that the covariate is linearly related to the dependent variable; (5) that the regression of the dependent variable on the covariate is the same for each group; (6) that for each level of the covariate, the dependent variable is normally  distributed; (7) that the variance of the dependent variable at a given value of the covariate is constant across treatment groups and is independent of the covariate. ANCOVA can be performed very easily when the assumptions are kept in mind from the onset, but if one or more of the critical assumptions are not met, alternative types of analysis should be considered.

Introduced in 1942, the scoring and items have changed after several items analyses. Form F contains 51 phrase questions and 44 word pairs. A critical review of reliability and validity studies raises four issues to consider when evaluating the Indicator: (1) correspondence between Jung and Myers typology; (2) adherence to Myers' typology; (3) predictive validity; and (4) uniqueness. Myers has a different concept of the extroversion-introversion and judging-perceiving scales, but the scales do not reflect this concept. The Indicator generally  does not reflect Myers' typology: classifications do not appear unchanging, interacting, or associated with different compounds of surface traits; in addition, type indeterminacy is unrelated to ineffective behavior and maladjustment. The Indicator may be useful for grade prediction in liberal arts schools, but its ability to identify vocational interest and creativity is limited. Finally, only the thinking-feeling scale is unique among existing scales; but factor analysis may uncover other unique properties. Norms are presented for high school, college, and graduate students; recently employed college graduates; and public school teachers. (CP)",

Fourth graders were given the questions orally without access to the passages. The percentage of questions answered correctly was calculated for each test. An analysis of variance procedure revealed that the Classroom Reading Inventory was the most passage independent followed by the Analytical Reading Inventory and Ginn 720 basal inventory respectively. An analysis of children's responses to the questions revealed that three question types in particular tended to be passage independent in nature. These question categories were: (1) general  information; (2) vocabulary meaning; and (3) affective. The investigation also examined the degree to which the respective inventory comprehension questions provided inflated estimates of the children's reading comprehension abilities. (Author/GK)",

Highlights of results indicate: (1) teachers are actually more knowledgeable about, and supportive of standardized achievement tests then NCME members expect them to be; (2) grades K-4 students' attitudes are far more positive than expected; (3) grades 5-12 students' attitudes reflect that the tests are less difficult, less unfair, and less likely to stimulate stress than expected.

All tests were computer-administered and consisted of five-alternative multiple-choice vocabulary items. Test scores were correlated with high school and college grade point averages and American College Testing Service Program subtest scores. The data showed generally higher criterion-related validities for the adaptive tests as compared to the conventional tests.

Testing procedures involving simple feedback, elaborated feedback, and subject verbalization were applied to the Raven Coloured Progressive Matrices (CPM), a test of nonverbal intelligence, and selected Piaget measures, and were tested in 434 second- and fourth-grade children from the general population. Applicability of the approach was demonstrated for populations of children between 5 and 10 years of age, and of &quot;normal&quot; intelligence (IQ), of learning handicapped, low IQ, and from Anglo, Black, and  Hispanic-American ethnic groups. Analysis was made of the interactive effects of testing condition with the cognitive style variable, impulsivity-reflectivity. Evidence was presented that compensatory effects can be obtained for impulsive children and children of ethnic minorities utilizing the procedures of verbalization and elaborated feedback. The indication that compensatory effects can be obtained in assessing between ethnic group differences may be useful in reducing test bias, but larger samples with control over factors such as socio-economic status are necessary before reaching firm conclusions.

The examinees, 61 students in an introductory psychology class, were required to type a sequence of moves that would bring an array of scrambled numbers (start configuration) into agreement with a second array (goal configuration), using as few moves as possible. Results suggest that four performance indices might be useful in indexing problem difficulty: (1) mean number of moves in the  sample; (2) proportion of students solving the problem; (3) proportion of students solving the problem in the optimal number of moves; and (4) a Special Difficulty Index, defined as the sample mean number of moves divided by the minimum number of moves required.

The use of a priori effect size criteria for evaluating the importance of research results, the greater use of measures of association, and more replications are advocated.

A procedure requiring the simple sums of two or three carefully selected variables has obvious practical advantages over elaborate score transformations. It can yield pretest measures having all the properties necessary for the special regression model.

        "description":"The potential reliability and construct and predictive validity of a 30-item Study Skills Questionnaire (SSQUES) was evaluated for its ability to: (1) predict student performance in a self-paced, individualized, or computer-managed instructional environment, and (2) identify students needing some type of study skills remediation. The study was conducted in the context of the Air Force Advanced Instructional System; subjects were male and female Air Force trainees in four computer-managed instruction courses during a nine-week period. Students evaluated their skills in four areas: reading comprehension, memorization, concentration management, and test taking. The questionnaire demonstrated substantial reliability and construct validity. Predictive validity results supported the  power of the SSQUES to predict student achievement and to discriminate between students who would perform well versus poorly. (Author/GK)",

        "description":"The appropriateness of the use of the standardized residual (SR) to assess congruence between sample test item responses and the one parameter latent trait (Rasch) item characteristic curve is investigated. Latent trait theory is reviewed, as well as theory of the SR, the apparent error in calculating the expected distribution of the SR, and implications of using the SR for item analysis. Empirical results using actual data are presented to support the theoretical anlaysis, as well as a demonstration of the practical implications of the failure to reject items which do not fit the model. Conclusions based on the findings include: (1) discriminations of all the items in a test must be very similar in order for Rasch model analyses to work in practice; (2) the SR mean square fit  statistic does not detect unacceptable variation in discrimination; and (3) item discrimination needs to be monitored and controlled using more exact tests of fit than the residual mean square. Finally, an alternate linear model is described which may provide a practical solution to problems encountered in the construction of item banks and tailored testing. (RL)",

If residuals are obtained from the pooled within-groups regression coefficient, ANOVA on the residuals results in an inflated alpha-level. If the regression coefficient for the total sample combined into one group is used, ANOVA on the residuals yields an inappropriately conservative test. In either case, ANOVA of residuals fails to provide a correct test, because the significance test in ANCOVA requires consideration of both the pooled within-groups regression coefficient and the regression coefficient for the total sample combined into one group. It is  recommended that the significance test of treatment effects in ANCOVA be conceptualized as a comparison of models whose parameters are estimated by the principle of least squares.

Among these problems are the inconsistency and lack of generality to many ATI findings, especially in classroom-based ATI investigations. It is suggested that such investigations may be of limited generality due to the nature of the phenomena. The importance of careful classification of aptitude and treatment variables is also discussed. Investigation of the interaction between individual differences in prior achievement and instructional method is proposed as one way to avoid some of the problems of other approaches, including examining interactions between cognitive processes and instructional method. Finally, it is suggested that ATI researchers precede formal investigations by an  observational phase: instead of beginning research by generating a prediction as to what students are likely to do in instructional situations offering a variety of alternatives, primary observation of the students' selection of options is preferable.

This report reviews possible causes of the worsening relative employment status of black youths, including market and structural trends in the sizes of labor force entry cohorts, competition in the low-wage labor market from women and students, the level and coverage of the minimum wage, occupational and industrial structure, and the geographic distribution of jobs. Social and demographic trends in school enrollment, armed forces enlistment, marriage and family norms, and receipt of public assistance are also considered. It is suggested that historical differences between blacks and whites in the occupational sectors in which they worked, in school enrollment patterns, and  in military enlistment patterns concealed the true racial disparity in youth unemployment because black youth entered the work force before whites and found work in the agricultural sector. Now that black and white school enrollment and military enlistment norms are more alike and unskilled jobs scarcer, it is held, the true inequality in employment is revealed. (Author/MK)",

Two acculturation scales were developed measuring self-reported behaviors and value dimensions. Four samples were used in the development and validation of the scales: (1) 265 Cuban Americans, (2) 201 white Americans, (3) 69 Cuban American high school students, and (4) 47 white American high school students. The behavioral scale provided a highly reliable and valid measure of acculturation and proved superior to the value scale in almost every respect. Behavioral and value acculturation were found to be linear functions of the amount of time a person was exposed to the host culture. The rate at  which the behavioral acculturation process took place was found to be a function of the age and sex of the individual. The findings suggest that intergenerational/acculturational differences develop because younger members of the family acculturate more rapidly than older family members. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed. (Author/MK)",

SIE statistics were also used to describe the age, sex, ethnic background, family income, employment status, and marriage rate characteristics of the dropout population. The dropouts' reasons for leaving school are analyzed in terms of those forces within the school which create dissatisfaction and alienation and those forces outside the school (jobs, marriage, child bearing) which attract students away from school. Personal and public costs of dropping out in the areas of employment and  welfare dependency, pregnancy and child bearing, violence and vandalism, and juvenile delinquency are assessed. A review of California programs dealing with the dropout problem includes descriptions and evaluations of attendance and truancy programs, continuation high schools, counseling programs, independent study programs, and vocational education programs. General conclusions which provide a framework for public discussions are offered. (Author/BE)",

        "description":"The Achievement through Bilingual Education Project (ABLE) served 360 Hispanic and Italian students in grades 9-12 in the Bronx, New York. Students received instruction in English as a Second Language, native language arts, and content areas (science, social studies, and mathematics) in their native languages. Additional program components included staff development, parental involvement, curriculum development, and supportive services. Program evaluation was completed using norm and criterion referenced tests of student achievement and evaluator observations. Findings indicated that (1) 47-60% of English as a Second Language goals were achieved by Spanish speaking students, (2) under 40% of all students showed gains in receptive and expressive English fluency, (3) all students  made significant gains in native language reading, (4) most groups of ABLE students achieved the criterion in mathematics, social studies, and science. Project ABLE students surpassed school wide attendance rates. All additional program components except supportive services were found to be effective. Recommendations for future program implementation are included in this report. (MK)",

        "description":"A project was conducted to increase participation of students enrolled in nonprofit private schools in vocational programs funded under the Vocational Education Amendments of 1976 (P.L. 94-482). Objectives were (1) to identify factors facilitating private student access to vocational programs, (2) to develop and field test implementation procedures for state and local agencies, and (3) to disseminate this information to state and local vocational program administrators. Practices used to implement P.L. 94-482 were identified through field studies in nine states, classified, and used in developing a videotape presentation which was disseminated along with related materials during workshops for state and local education agency staff responsible for implementing the amendments.  Research revealed that cooperative relations between private and public institutions are impeded by structural, philosophical, attitudinal, communication, and administrative barriers including the absence of accurate data bases, poor communications network among private and public institutions, state policies discouraging joint public and private programs, and traditional antipathy between public and private school administrators. Recommendations for improving private school student access to vocational programs include expanding provisions of the law to include all federally funded vocational programs, joint planning at all government levels, and development and dissemination of information about model cooperative programs.

Part 2 examines the people in adult education: learner characteristics, teacher training and traits, qualifications and duties of the  administrator/director of adult education, and the counselor's role. With diagrams, part 3 examines four programming models: Tyler's general design for analyzing an educational curriculum; Houle's system of education specifically for adults; Knowles's concept of program development based on &quot;andragogy&quot; (instruction of adults rather than of children), and an English as a Second Language/Adult Basic Education needs-based model.

        "description":"Researchers have studied both competence levels and competence motivation in children. Competence motivation is usually assessed in terms of children's spontaneous preferences for optimal cognitive challenge, but actual spontaneous preferences in free play have seldom been used to assess motivation. In fact, competence level and competence motivation are inseparable since motivation, as it relates to spontaneous preferences, must be assessed by comparison with measures of skill (competence) level. Three experiments assessed children's preferences and demonstrated how they and skill levels could be compared: The Development of Agent Use, The Development of Social-Role Concepts, and The Development of Agent Use and Role Concepts. Results showed that as age increased preschool  children showed more preferences for tasks at lower levels than their highest possible skill levels. Reasons included (1) more freedom in choice of activities and content, (2) increasing complexity of free play, (3) use of play as escape or rest from school and other demands, and (4) competence to choose when to meet a challenge and tax one's skills and when to save one's energy and not meet challenges. It was concluded that caution is needed in assuming that children's competence motivation is reflected in spontaneous preference for optional optimal cognitive challenge. (Author/YLB)",

Revision and reorganization of the materials into three volumes on learning entrepreneurship skills, applying them, and supplementary materials are discussed. After mention of student assessment and printing and binding of the materials, contents of the volumes are discussed. Following a discussion of adaptations of the materials for use in settings other than community colleges and for purposes other than  preparing people to become self-employed, procedures for establishing an approved course at Illinois community colleges are presented. Preliminary dissemination and implementation activities are outlined as a prelude to phase 4 which will include summative evaluation. The major appendix is the formative evaluation report (60 pages) describing pilot and main field tests at four Illinois colleges. Another appendix (45 pages) contains pre-designed projects for human service occupations developed by one teacher who adapted the entrepreneurship materials for training human service paraprofessionals.

        "description":"Sex-related variations in the formation of educational and occupational aspirations of fifth and ninth grade Brazilian boys and girls were assessed via comparison of their academic performance, level of occupational and educational goals, and about the influence of family, peers, and teachers in shaping these goals. Data were collected on 1,950 students in four counties representing great differences in patterns of settlement and economics. The Wisconsin Model of Status Attainment (modified by inclusion of the variables sex and parents' education level and occupation) served as a point of departure. Other variables included socioeconmic status, academic performance, and influence of others. Data indicated (1) grade level is related to occupational and educational aspiration  level; (2) sex is related to occupational but not educational goal level; (3) academic performance is not related to either goal; (4) acquaintances affect educational goals positively; (5) socioeconomic level affects male occupational aspirations more than female ones. Results suggest that the Wisconsin Model does not fit Brazilian data well. Recommendations call for more accurate measures to approximate Latin American Social and cultural milieu, comparative analysis of societal norms defining allocation of occupational status, improved accuracy of scholastic ability indicators, and documentation of percentages of women in higher educational and occupational positions.

Survey instruments consisting of a variety of question formats were designed and administered to teachers (1,000), administrators (277), students (1,000), and counselors (524). Variables considered included school size and type, vocational experience, sex, age, educational level, racial/ethnic background, and student employment status. Data summaries, frequency distributions determining the percent of respondants selecting particular question categories, and means and standard  deviations calculations were performed. Respondant perceptions indicated a need for improved job placement services and revealed that vocational education programs offer limited or no job placement services to adult vocational students. Both faculty and students indicated the existence of some sex-role stereotyping. Recommendations included local and state efforts to provide goals and structures for job placement services, establishment of an advisory committee, development of model programs, development of an affirmative sex-equity program, inservice vocational education programs, and the implementation of strategies for encouraging students to pursue nontraditional careers.

        "description":"Educationally, economically, or psychologically disadvantaged women suffer from even more social and economic injustices than do other women. Although a woman's ability to provide for herself rises with her educational level, approximately half of all American women lack a high school diploma. Family relationships, religious tradition, school practices, and blue collar attitudes foster women's feelings of fatalism and powerlessness. Interviews with three Adult Basic Education (ABE) program participants reveal that disadvantaged women feel a lack of freedom, fear of life, and lack of confidence. They resent the way they are treated as wives and are accustomed to being dependent. Four ABE objectives can alleviate these feelings: (1) to enable women to develop academic skills, (2)  to help women recognize and appreciate their abilities and strengths, (3) to promote the full development of each woman's intellectual capacity, and (4) to make women aware of available life-style options. To achieve these goals teachers must be able to teach women from disadvantaged backgrounds. Personal and vocational counseling, individualized instruction, and flexible programs allowing for women's childrearing responsibilities are necessary. Widespread sexism in learning materials with respect to roles, vocational opportunities, life-styles, and general characteristics must be eliminated. (MN)",

It reports discussions of experiences and recommendations of participants at miniconferences for local K-12 career education coordinators. The first section discusses whether a specific position entitled \"career education coordinator\" is essential. Recommendations made include the desirability of the position at the school district level and the necessary permanence of that position. A section on the duties and responsibilities of K-12 coordinators provides a few examples of some of the diversity in duties and responsibilities. In the next section specific examples are given of how,  in several communities, persons serving as coordinators are using building level personnel as \"key leaders\" in carrying out career education roles and responsibilities. The fourth section follows general discussion of participant recommendations concerning coordinator responsibilities with a list of fifteen responsibilities, divided into networking, information and public relations, and professional educational and community collaboration responsibilities. In the next section six qualities to look for in a coordinator are recommended. The final section consists of thoughts and recommendations regarding placement of the coordinator in education's table of organization. (YLB)",

Methodology included mailing sixteen sets of nine questionnaires to women in women's centers, displaced homemaker centers, and counseling centers in seven states. Questionnaires covered the type and extent of adult women's involvement in homemaking and parenting activities, volunteer work and community service, recreation and hobbies, formal and nonformal education, and paid work, and self-ratings on twenty-eight occupationally transferable skills. Questionnaires also were sent to nine junior college vocational educators to identify the importance of skills for selecting students for vocational programs and for awarding  advanced placement in nine program areas. Finally, the women's self-ratings and the vocational educators' ratings were compared to identify the skill areas with the greatest transferability for each program. It was concluded that self-ratings of adult women's life experience skills and learning have potential for use in counseling and placing women in postsecondary vocational education programs. Six tables show items rated for advanced placement or exemption from courses. A transferability analysis, based on the women's self-ratings and the vocational educators' ratings, is also included.

This publication is organized into eight major sections and two indexes. The major sections are categorized according to institutional affiliations: (1) state education agencies, (2) local education agencies, (3) regional education agencies, (4) universities and colleges, (5) technical institutes, (6) proprietary schools and colleges, (7) federal education agencies, and (8) other. Within each major section categorized by state where employment occurs, individual biographical sketches are listed alphabetically by surname. The indexes are presented: a program area of responsibility and an alphabetical listing. The program area of responsibility index lists individual names  according to the major program areas(s) directly under their administration. Women who administer nontraditional programs are identified in this index. The alphabetical index is a combined listing in alphabetical order of all persons in the directory. The introduction includes the purpose of the project, background data, summary findings, directions for using this document, and a sample resume. The appendixes contain the survey instrument and the classification system of educational agencies and institutions. (CT)",

        "description":"An examination of why cooperative work experiences work in light of Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's satisfaction and dissatisfaction factors can be helpful in maintaining and improving the experiences. Cooperative work experiences are successful because they satisfy two types of student needs (deficiency needs and growth needs). These experiences fulfill deficiency needs (physicological, security, belonging, and esteem needs) by enabling students to acquire the vocational skills and experience necessary to earn decent salaries and help insure job security by enabling students to enjoy the recognition and rights of tradespersons and by providing tangible products and advisible skills which help students meet their esteem needs. It is only after these deficiency needs  are met that students will be motivated by growth needs (aesthetics, self-actualization, and knowledge and understanding). Therefore, co-op employers and votech personnel must help students gratify their deficiency needs. Students should help their fellow students, co-op employers, and votech instructors meet their own deficiency needs as well. While meeting deficiency needs prevents student dissatisfaction, only the meeting of growth needs can provide student satisfaction. Therefore, co-op employers and votech personnel must help students meet both needs and should stress the latter. Students should also assume more responsibility in evaluating their vocation and co-op job site in light of motivational factors. (MN)",

Activities, evaluation instruments, and results related to seven program objectives are described and discussed: (1) to expose eight - to fourteen-year-olds to career education experiences via the creative arts (sewing, printmaking, clay, poetry, photography, animation, puppetry, and painting); (2) to enable fourteen- to eighteen-year-olds to develop skills and competence in Communications Arts Productions, thereby increasing career understanding and  options; (3) to provide counseling for participants in the Communications Arts production team units; (4) to provide participants with career education experiences fostering the development of responsible work habits and attitudes; (5) to develop communication skills; (6) to provide necessary assistance for participants with neurological, emotional, or other problems; and (7) to promote parent and community support of children's interests in the arts and art-related careers. Dissemination and special activities such as efforts to hire minorities and handicapped in an effort to project a variety of role models are mentioned. The conclusion is made that most objectives were reached and that this program is a model worth emulating. Appendixes constituting two-thirds of the document, contain  goals, survey and testing lnstruments, student logs, and work samples. (MN)",

Subsequent sections combine a description of a parallel, non-enriched labor-intensive comparison site with a comparative evaluation of the parallel projects. Final sections draw summary conclusions and provide a description of important, probably necessary, conditions which were present in the successfully implemented enriched project's program environment.  The three-part guidebook begins with a discussion of the Civilian Conservation Corps, the first enriched labor-intensive work project. Parts 2 and 3 have as their subject the history of the successful enriched project in Bellingham--Whatcom Creek Heritage Park and Maritime Heritage Center Project. Part 2 gives a synopsis of the comparative analysis of this project and a parallel work project to ascertain relative costs and benefits of operating an enriched project design.

        "description":"A comparison of the educational and occupational aspirations and expectations of 900 seniors in four Chicago high schools showed that college prep students had the highest educational and occupational aspirations and expectations. Vocational students had the greatest discrepancy between occupational aspirations and expectations, while general education students showed the least discrepancy between aspirations and expectations on either job or educational variables. Data, acquired from a student aspiration questionnaire, raw scores on a reading achievement test, and information from student records, also showed that achievement scores have very low correlations with expectations, but other achievement indices, like class rank, have higher correlations with expectations. Students  with higher expectations for education and jobs are more active in extracurricular activities and take more mathematics courses. (Tables show the relationship between educational aspirations and educational expectations, occupational aspirations and expectations, correlations among variables, and reading test scores for the students from a large vocational high school, an all-black school in an economically depressed neighborhood, a school with an economically and racially diverse student body, and a white, middle class high school.)

        "description":"The proportion of women in the labor force continued to grow during 1970-1978; more women headed families and worked despite the presence of children, according to the summary preceding the twenty-three tables which constitute the bulk of this report. Other findings summarized from the statistics are as follows. By 1978, a record 47.7 percent of all wives were working, compared with 40.8 percent in 1970, and the rate of working wives who have children under age eighteen has risen more rapidly than the rate for wives with no dependent children. Also, the proportion of wives (with preschool children) in the labor force has risen by more than the proportion of mothers with school-age children. On average, working wives contribute 25 percent of family income, a proportion that has  not changed in twenty years. Unmarried women headed 8.2 million families in 1978, up 48 percent from 1970; their median family income was less than half that of husband-wife families. Since 1970, never-married men and women have made up nearly half of the 16.7 million increase in the labor force, while the number of divorced men and women in the labor force has more than doubled.

Federal legislation provides mandates to reduce sex stereotyping and discrimination in vocational education. Sex stereotyping leads teachers to assume that males and females possess different sets of abilities, interests, values, and roles. These stereotyped expectations limit opportunities for individual development and lead females to develop unrealistic work attitudes and career plans. Stereotyping also results in increased work pressures for males. Although more women are in the labor force, wage and job segregation still exist. Vocational  education programs mirror occupational choices in the labor force. Information from the 1980 Status Report of Males and Females in Vocational Education in Georgia indicates a slow growth toward integration of programs by sex. Wage disparities still exist. The predominance of vocational instructors in teaching areas traditional for their sex and the overwhelming predominance of men at higher administrative levels leads one to conclude that the state and local administration of vocational education in Gerogia is almost entirely a male dominated area.

        "description":"Widespread and rapid changes in society, leading to knowledge and skill obsolescence, have provided impetus for the concept of lifelong education. Learning is not confined to a particular period of life or to formal educational institutions, but is a set of attitudes and skills to be used throughout life and in a wide variety of situations. As such, lifelong learning is distinct from traditional notions of adult education, or even recurrent and continuing education. Although the bulk of learning takes place outside the school, it is in the formal educational institutions that the skills and attitudes essential for effective self-directed learning are first introduced. Since social and economic pressures will continue to bring large numbers of students into the college and  university system, it is important to insure that higher education is responsive to new lifelong learning needs. This is perhaps best done by working through existing university teachers and encouraging innovations that place the emphasis on student-centered learning with real life problems, as opposed to traditional, didactic instruction. Instructional developers could play a key role by encouraging research on the relationship between different learning approaches and their relevance to students' needs in the world of work.

The scope of the study included all types of solar energy technologies and applications (space heating and cooling, ocean thermal conversion, photovoltaic conversion, wind conversion and biomass conversion), and all phases of work (research and development, manufacturing, marketing and distribution, and installation and maintenance). The study also identified new job specialties in the solar area, and developed a methodology for projecting short- and  mid-term future employment. A mail survey of 500 employees was also conducted to determine the work requirements of their jobs, their special skills, and their education and training. Detailed findings are presented along with five recommended activities for planning for future personnel needs in the solar industry. Appendixes include (1) survey questionnaires, screening form, and cover letter; (2) notes on response rate, establishment population, and nonresponse bias; (3) detailed tabulations; and (4) description of methodology used to formulate manpower projections.

        "description":"Vocational Education can play a key role in revitalizing the American economy particularly through research and development in four areas: economic development and productivity, equity and access, youth employment, and energy. It can enhance productivity by identifying innovative vocational education programs successful in enhancing community and economic development, developing entrepreneurship training, aiding in vocational agriculture teacher preparation, developing curricula that addresses community economic development needs, and emphasizing new technologies and leadership development opportunities. Research and demonstration projects can aid in expanding vocational educational opportunities for women, minorities, and handicapped persons. Vocational education can play a key  part in reducing youth unemployment by providing in-school and out-of-school programs for disadvantaged youth. It has already begun to respond to emerging industries and technologies needed for the energy crisis. The National Center for Research in Vocational Education can assist in this endeavor by improving national dissemination and utilization of research and development products focusing on the four priorities mentioned above, examining and describing critical issues confronting vocational education, assisting in strengthening the nationwide vocational education research and development system, and improving articulation among education, business, industry, labor, and economic development agencies.

In the first article, \"Old Dreams--New Visions,\" Virginia Cleland reviews the economics of medicine and calls for a new Surgeon General's Report to guide the development of public/professional relationships in nursing, especially the issue of reimbursing nursing services separately from the general hospital bill. The second article, \"Toward l999: Probing Ethical Dilemmas in Nursing's Future,\" is Mila A. Aroskar's analysis of the concept of justice and ethical issues in health care decisions. In the third paper, \"Social and Economic Issues,\" Luther Christman warns that the level  of nursing education must be drastically raised to keep nursing an equal of the other health care professions. The fourth article, \"Forces for Forecasting: Biological-Environmental Issues,\" by Cornelius Kruse, states that environmental regulations must be based on scientific fact and subject to years of research. The final article, \"Forces for Forecasting: Organizational Issues,\" by Dorothy J. Novello, describes the current state of the health care delivery system and poses questions for the future of the nursing profession. (KC)",

The statement addresses these topics: Will the Recession End Inflation?, Which Anti-Recession Measures?, But What About Inflation?, and A Policy of Restrained Recovery. The first background paper is The Need for a Contingent Countercyclical PSE (Public Service Employment) Program. It contains a brief policy review, discusses the rationale for and merits of PSE, and lists steps that need to be taken. Employment Policy for Recessions, the second paper, addresses questions that are being neglected. It looks at the critiques employment policy in the 1973-75 recession and reaches some  policy conclusions. The third paper, Getting at Fundamentals in the FY (Fiscal Year) 81 Budget, reexamines basic forces underlying the current economic situation. It considers the basic causes--inflation and unemployment--and proposes a solution involving reduced dependence on foreign energy sources, restrained total expenditures, increased productivity and production, and equitable sharing of the inevitably reduced standard of living.

The Organizational Assessment Package (OAS) consisting of 16 background information items and 149 attitudinal items was administered to military and civilian subjects (4,786) at five Air Force bases representing six major commands. Four factors were selected as dependent variables: general organizational climate, organizational communications climate, job related satisfaction, and perceived productivity. Factor scores were generated for each of the four variables and each subject's factor score for each factor served as the dependent variable in a series of one and two-way analyses of variance. Respondents with longer periods of service and high  educational levels and whose supervisors wrote their performance report scored highest on all criteria (except for Organizational Communications Climate). Higher criterion ratings were also affected by whether supervisors used group meetings to solve problems and establish goals and by intended duration of Air Force Service. Officers and civilians scored highest in Job Related Satisfaction and Perceived Productivity. Civilians with graduate work perceived General Organizational Climate highest. Graphs and tables present more detailed analyses of responses, and tables in an appendix (two-thirds of the document) provide analyses of variance based on twenty-two separate criteria. (MN)",

Microelectronic technology promises an array of benefits, and the electronic age is already well under way. As it progresses during the last two decades of the twentieth century, it will lead to improvements in productivity in factories and offices, changes in the way information is processed, stored, and communicated, and alterations in the content of many jobs. Differing rates of development of the electronics industry may lead to shifting advantages of competition in the international marketplace. Like all major  technological changes, the transition to microelectronics will raise difficult political issues, among which the impact on jobs and employment is the most prominent. (KC)",

Chapter 2, Working with Others, examines the process for working with resource persons while teaching special needs students. It also covers potential resources located inside the school and out in the community. Chapters 3-8 deal with these specific handicapping conditions: emotional impairments of learning, learning  disabilities, mental retardation, visual impairments, hearing impairments, and physical impairments. Each chapter is divided into three parts: (1) recognition of handicapped students, (2) strategies to modify vocational programs and to instruct students, and (3) information on existing exemplary programs and techniques already developed in vocational classrooms. Details concerning formal and informal vocational assessment are found in chapter 9. Chapter 10 presents nine models of vocational service delivery to handicapped students. (YLB)",

It is intended to help interested communities develop or expand labor's active involvement in the educational process. After an introduction, a section lists a number of concerns shared by organized labor and education. Other brief sections focus on career education as a vehicle for establishing communication with labor, Ohio's career development program, and labor-career education in Akron. Three sections concerning labor resources in education review the general structure and function of the various labor unions found in the community and identify areas of expertise and interests. In the next section guidelines for planning  and implementing inservice labor-education programs for educators are provided. Following a section providing direction for developing integrated curriculum units on organized labor, secondary-level labor-education instructional units with sample lessons and objectives are provided. The next section gives examples of additional ways in which labor education can be incorporated into other areas of the school curriculum. A final section provides direction for developing a labor-education multimedia resource center and describes the minimum materials which should be available. A bibliography is provided. (YLB)",

The chapter begins with a discussion of the major techniques used in employee selection, focusing on the competencies employers detect and their measurement properties. The second major portion focuses on the ways in which selection techniques are used as components of selection systems within a variety of organizations. Among the questions addressed here are the following: Do employers actually select on the basis of the competencies they desire in job applicants? How do selection practices vary according to the type of job and level of skill required at entry? What  biases enter into selection decisions as a function of the procedures used? To what extent do employers verify the importance of certain competencies to job performance or the effectiveness of their selection procedures? The chapter concludes with a discussion of how organizational realities and other factors affect selection practices and what educators can learn from current trends in these practices.

The difference in the perspectives held by the users and originators of assessment procedures and those held by the courts is developed by examining key court cases which followed upon the enactment of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. In light of the courts' present posture, the implications of this difference in perspective are discussed for selection, licensing and certification, and educational assessment. The topics addressed include the use of the diploma or degree as a hiring requirement; the fairness of licensing and certification procedures as gateways to professions, with an emphasis on  teacher certification; the use of IQ tests and other measures of general ability for classifying students; minimal competence assessment and the accountability of educational institutions; and the use of graduate school admission tests to select applicants fairly for the limited number of available places.

Recently in the helping services, career employment of paraprofessionals and the rapid unfreezing of the 1960's bias toward a psychodynamic, one-to-one approach offered only by highly trained professionals have allowed paraprofessional roles to expand beyond data-handling and other entry-level activities. Those employing paraprofessionals must develop a plan of systematic training, supervision, and evaluation. A clear specification of the tasks to be performed and the skills needed to perform these tasks can lead to the development of precise criteria for selection and training. Possible training methods include role playing; supervised practice; content lectures; technical task training; human  relations skills training; and sensitivity, encounter, or group counseling. Specific attention to the needs of paraprofessionals and individualized training programs can result in greater satisfaction, a stronger sense of identity with program objectives, and more favorable performance evaluations.

        "description":"In recent years the college dormitory has become a popular setting for examining chronic effects of crowding and high density in humans. Possible differences between corridor- and suite-type residents were investigated to examine the degree to which corridor- and suite-design dormitories influence assertive behavior of the residents. It was hypothesized that if corridor-type residents exhibited behaviors consistent with a learned helplessness explanation, they would be less likely than suite-type residents to use assertive behaviors. Results indicated that there were no differences across demographic and biographical variables between suite and corridor residents. However, summed scores on the Rathus Assertiveness Schedule revealed that suite residents reported being  significantly more assertive across a number of settings than corridor residents. In a second controlled laboratory study, data revealed that subjects who actually engaged in assertive behavior in the laboratory reported being more assertive on the Rathus Assertiveness Schedule than subjects who did not assert themselves in the experimental condition. Corridor residents were less assertive than residents living in suite-type dormitories. (Author)",

Empirical studies on the consequences of illegitimacy are generally limited to problems of recidivism, school dropouts, and welfare dependency. Whether getting married when very young because of pregnancy is more socially advantageous than being an unmarried parent has never been rigorously demonstrated. In initial and follow-up interviews, women who had their first births when they were teenagers were compared to women in their twenties at the time of first birth to examine differences in role aspirations and behavior. Teenage mothers: (1) were less likely to plan the timing of  motherhood; (2) found that the onset of childrearing responsibilities had a limiting effect on their role activities; (3) were less likely to realize their work aspirations; and (4) differed from older mothers in that a substantial proportion wanted no more than one child, and a sizeable group wanted four or more children.

If individuals see each other as occupants of positions the characteristics of which are independent of any individuals occupying them, and see each other's behavior as the product of their respective positions, the equity rule applies. If they are perceived as persons who might occupy any position and whose behavior stems from individual characteristics, an equality or parity rule of allocation will be followed. A social-perception test of the influence of personal and positional relationships on allocations was  conducted with male and female undergraduates. Results indicated that: (1) definitions of relationships are important determinants of allocation for both sexes; (2) sex differences exist for traditionally sex-typed individuals only when relationships are not dependent clearly either on person or position; and (3) both sexes see allocation of rewards as a determinant of future interactions.

Scores on the DACL have correlated with other measures of depression and have also been related to personal characteristics of depressed individuals. The DACL has been used in studies to assess depression across time in relation to physical and psychological conditions such as insomnia, and in studies of premenstrual mood change and mood change during pregnancy and following childbirth. Studies on the effects of drugs or medical treatments have used the DACL to investigate cyclic hormonal levels, response to electroconvulsive shock, alcohol withdrawal, drug intake, pain perception, and exertion. Evaluation studies of  therapy or behavioral interventions for the treatment of depression often use the DACL. Theoretical investigations of anger and learned helplessness have also used the DACL. Ease of administration and the benefits of matched repeated lists have provided investigators with a simple method for assessing depression across time and in relation to a number of concomitant events.

The moderating influence of EGNS on relationships between global job satisfaction and the job attributes of conflict and ambiguity were investigated. Production supervisors (N=57) completed questionnaires on role perceptions, job satisfaction, and EGNS. Results from moderated regression analysis suggest that EGNS significantly influences the relationship between role-conflict and satisfaction, but does not significantly influence the relationship between role-ambiguity and satisfaction. Findings point out the importance of individual differences as a moderator of the relationships between job attributes and employee affective response.

In order to look at male attitudes on childbearing, an investigation was conducted on personality differences between childless males preferring children within five years of marriage and those preferring to delay childbearing for a longer period of time. A pilot study questionnaire located childless males and divided them into two groups of 25 subjects each with respect to preferred childbearing following anticipated or present marriage. Subjects completed the Firo-B, the Nowicki-Duke Internal-External Locus of Control Scale, and a demographic-attitude questionnaire. A significant difference was found, indicating that males preferring to delay  childbearing wanted fewer children than those preferring children more immediately. Quantitatively measured attitudes on childbearing were not found to differentiate males of childbearing preferences. Males were found to have realistic attitudes with respect to childbearing and were enthusiastic subjects who discussed why they preferred children, reasons why persons might not want children, and issues of concern directly related to their own plans for childbearing.

        "description":"The movement to aid displaced homemakers began in 1975 and local programs received funding support from state legislation, Vocational Education, and CETA. There are no definitive statistics on the number of displaced homemakers in the country although the Department of Labor has estimated the number at 4.13 million. Information from 136 local programs reveals that most are affiliated with secondary or post-secondary educational institutions and were established within the last 18 months. Programs reported contact with over 26,500 displaced homemakers, indicating they could serve more. Half the programs had multiple funding and budgets between $25,000 and $75,000. Most offer job readiness workshops, skills and career assessment, and individual and group counseling. Displaced  homemakers need more job-specific training, financial support while in training, and opportunities in nontraditional occupations. Although displaced homemakers lack confidence in their own abilities, employers are satisfied with their work. The focus of the movement should remain with middle-aged and older women. There is a need for training of displaced homemaker advisors, counselors, and instructors. Program evaluations should consider funding, outreach, services offered, and methods of providing services.

        "description":"Academic perspectives are reviewed for consultation in substance abuse within four general issues: consultation paradigms, research consultation and psychology, sources for consultation, and academic issues. The mental health/crisis intervention model is the most common consultation paradigm. Most consultation research in the substance abuse area focused upon issues of treatment and/or referral of those with alcohol or drug problems. Very little research exists with respect to the evaluation of the consultation. Research consultation is one method of consultation for academically affiliated psychologists who can contribute expertise in knowledge of the literature, methodology, ethical issues, and grant and report writing. The crisis intervention approach is inappropriate within a  research setting; research consultation/evaluation should be a more continuous process. The role of the academician in consultation has been reviewed with respect to whether or not the academician who consults for pay may be shirking academic responsibilities. Research suggests that those who consult are generally more productive than their non-consulting colleagues, and that consultation for pay does not result in a reduction in academic performance.

        "description":"The application of stress management techniques to highly specialized populations and disorders has become an increasingly important clinical endeavor in recent years. Curiously, however, individuals undergoing one of the most stress-laden experiences, graduate school, have rarely been the focus of such efforts. There are three major forms of therapeutic intervention, namely, cognitive-coping, problem-solving, and time management, which may assist students in coping with the stressors imposed by a graduate school career. Intervention strategies which use cognitive processes in evaluating stressful situations include rational emotive therapy, systematic rational restructuring, and self-statement modification. Problem-solving incorporates generating alternatives, making decisions  about the alternatives, and verifying the chosen alternatives. Time management offers some general guidelines to help boost individual productivity by: (1) improving efficiency through basic self-management; (2) determining individual strengths and weaknesses; (3) planning work; (4) assessing progress; and (5) analyzing failures and learning from mistakes. These procedures and techniques can be employed on a self-management basis to facilitate adjustment to the graduate school environment. (Author/HLM)",

Responses to items on objective self-report measures of personality similarly can be regarded as self-disclosure or as self-presentations. In order to investigate whether objective self-report measures of personality are regarded better as sources of factual information about the self or as ways to instruct others about how one is to be regarded, self-disclosure and self-presentation were compared by testing the unique, divergent predictions each made about the kinds of personality variables associated with consistency  in self-description. For three groups of subjects (155 normal adults, 69 murderers, and 47 college students) almost all of the self-presentation variables were correlated significantly with consistency, while none of the self-disclosure variables was correlated with consistency. Results tended to support a self-presentation view of test-taking over a self-disclosure view. (Author)",

The way in which information about the self is processed by depressed individuals, in particular, the differences in self-schema content (the constellation of attitudes about oneself) between depressed and nondepressed individuals, was studied. Subjects rated a series of personality adjectives, recalled the adjectives, and completed a depressed-versus-nondepressed content rating task and a self-rating task. As predicted, depressed subjects displayed superior recall for self-referenced depressed-content objectives; nondepressed subjects displayed superior recall for self-referenced  nondepressed-content adjectives. Study results offer empirical support for the idea that there is a negative self-schema specific to the disorder of depression. (Author/CS)",

        "description":"This overview of the use of educational resources in teacher education discusses the concept of an educational resource as a reserve source of supply or support, and outlines a simple category system to describe the various types of educational resources: print, non-print, electronic/mechanical, management, intact, and human. The primary focus is on the use of resources in preservice and inservice teacher education and discussion is based on information from four sources: a national study by Joyce and others on preservice education, a comprehensive study of inservice education by Yarger and others, a field test of the Teacher Centers Program, and a content analysis of teacher center proposals. The framework for looking at the use of resources in preservice and inservice teacher  education includes consideration of the manner and level of importance in which resources are viewed, an assessment of the availability of resources, and an estimate of how frequently resources are used. An analysis of the status of resources in teacher education addresses two questions which emerge from data presented in the paper--why resources are inadequately integrated at all levels of education, and why resources with a more limited range of applications are used more extensively than those with greater potential. Some implications for future program development are indicated. (RAO)",

        "author":["Cohen, Arthur M."],
        "description":"Community colleges account for over half of the ethnic minority enrollments in America, and a controversy has developed over how well these students are being served. On one hand, community colleges are praised for providing open access to higher education. Critics, however, claim that community colleges track minority students into low level studies and reduce their chances of obtaining baccalaureate degrees. Indeed, this question of quality of service permeates the literature. Several ERIC documents, for example, explore the causes of minority attrition and the special services, including remedial instruction and academic counseling, that are provided to reduce this attrition. Other efforts to improve service include the Extended Opportunity Programs and Services in California  and the formation of community colleges especially for minority students. Yet the resolution of the basic controversy rests on the individual's interpretation of the community college mission. If the mission is to provide educational alternatives to high risk, non-traditional students, then community colleges have been a success. If their main goal is to provide traditional instruction leading to transfer to a four-year college, the community colleges are a failure by design. Thus, the question of what is done to assist minority students is intertwined with the definition of the community college's place in higher education. (JP)",

Safety guidelines regarding: (1) assembly, installation, maintenance instructions and identification; (2) materials of manufacture and construction; (3) sharp points and edges, protrusions, and pinch and crush points; (4) equipment that rotates about a vertical axis; (5) entrapment; and (6) falls from equipment are suggested. The guidelines apply to playground equipment intended for use in play areas of parks, schools, institutions, multiple family dwellings, private resorts and recreation developments, and other areas of public institutional use. They do not apply to  amusement park equipment, equipment normally intended for sports use, or to home playground equipment. In addition, components of equipment intended solely for use by the handicapped and necessarily modified to safely accommodate such users, are exempt from the requirement(s) applicable to those components. The supporting rationale for the specifications and requirements is extensively discussed. (Author/RH)",
