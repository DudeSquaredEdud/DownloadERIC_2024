        "author":["Leach, Jenny",
          "Lita, Zana"],
        "description":"This paper focuses on the ongoing development of an inservice teacher education program for teachers in Albania following the downfall in the early 1990s of a repressive totalitarian regime. The Kualida project's name is an acronym based on the Albanian words for training, distance, and teachers and is very close in sound to the Albanian expression for quality. The project was one of the first initiatives to address the challenge of restructuring teacher education in that part of the world, and it remains unique in the southern Balkans in the way it utilizes open learning methodologies for inservice training. The first section of the paper examines research currently occurring regarding the history of teacher education in Albania and outlines the historical context in which the  program is being developed. The second section presents the fieldwork and findings of the program evaluation, identifying three distinct but interwoven phases in the program: the context of criticism, the context of discovery, and the context of classroom practice. The paper concludes by formulating some key issues for those involved in the professional development of teachers through open learning. (Contains 32 references.) (SM)",

        "author":["Moon, Bob"],
        "description":"This paper argues that over time, future teachers will be offered and participate in more developed forms of professional development than is currently expected. The professional development will be significantly based on their own and local schools, and online electronic communication will be an important aspect of this increasingly international experience. Given this scenario, the paper argues that all forms of flexible and open learning will play increasingly more significant roles in teacher education. The paper suggests that traditional institutions developed around teacher education to serve the needs of the 20th Century are wholly inadequate for the 21st Century; the implicit and explicit models of development are insufficient to meet the changed circumstances of most  national contexts; and developing a research agenda to inform the processes of institutional change and rebuilding is an urgent priority. The paper explores the scenario for development by emphasizing the interrelated but contrasting movements toward: globalization of debate provided by the emergence of new interactive technology; localization of action through giving greater prominence to making the school a more central site for learning in teacher education; and emergence of new forms of professional communities of practice working through new modes of communication. The paper concludes by exploring key dilemmas that will occur in the transformation of teacher education and institutions of teacher education in the coming decades. (Contains 54 references.) (SM)",

        "description":"Historically, the approach to physical activity for people with disabilities has been couched in medical rationale and focused on rehabilitation. This does not account for physical activity for the joy of it as in play, exercise to improve or maintain fitness, or activity required in employment. The new paradigm of healthy, active lifestyles for people with disabilities is one of inclusion and integration. Today, adapted physical education programs in the schools include games, sports, rhythms, and aquatics suited to the individual needs, capabilities, and limitations of students with disabilities. This paper focuses on the benefits of physical activity and physical fitness for people with disabilities, the challenges to becoming physically active, and the effects of disabilities  on health-related fitness components (cardiovascular fitness, muscular strength, flexibility, and body composition). The paper also discusses how communities can promote physical activity and fitness programs for people with disabilities. It examines the move to inclusive education for students with disabilities, and it considers issues related to sports for people with disabilities. A list of pertinent professional organizations is included. (Contains 25 references.) (SM)",

Teacher education students are being prepared to meet the needs of school students through an inquiry-based program that incorporates self and learner examination, competent interaction with the knowledge base, habits of skilled inquiry and reflection, and professional and leadership development. Service learning is integrated into coursework. The program includes systematically designed field experiences culminating in a 1-year internship that will serve as a starting point for continuing professional development. The core  experiences are based on: emphasis on learners, emphasis on self as a professional, emphasis on pedagogical constructs, and emphasis on school, community, and instructional context. Restructuring will occur in four phases: Diverse Learners in School and Social/Cultural Contexts; Pedagogical Development I (Creating a Learning Climate); Pedagogical Development II (Planning and Assessing Teaching and Learning); and the Teacher As Leader in School and Community Cultures. This paper provides details on the implementation of Phase I. (SM)",

        "description":"This study investigated factors that affected stress, burnout, and job satisfaction among Hong Kong high school teachers. First, the researchers interviewed former Hong Kong teachers to determine possible teacher stress sources. On the basis of their suggested list of stress sources, the researchers created a questionnaire that included items specific to the Hong Kong situation. The six teacher stress sources were: students (misbehavior and undesirable attitudes); others (supervisors and inspectors); curriculum (exam demands); duty (nonteaching duties); teaching (time constraints and work output); and recognition (lack of recognition for teaching and administrative tasks). The three teacher burnout constructs were stress arousal, energy conservation, and exhaustion. A group of  259 high school teachers from Hong Kong responded to the survey, which examined sources of stress, burnout, and job satisfaction. Data analysis indicated that all six of the stress sources significantly related to all of the burnout outcomes. Among the six stressors, teacher workload was the strongest determinant of teacher burnout. The students and others factors had the strongest impacts on job satisfaction. (Contains 42 references.)

        "description":"This paper describes how one researcher's understanding of life history research evolved while conducting research with a high school English teacher. The life history examined the history and evolution of the teacher's beliefs about literacy and how those beliefs related to her teaching practices throughout her career. The paper begins by explaining what life history research is, then it elaborates on two experiences that helped make sense of life histories for the researcher. The first experience was around the issue of life history as an artistic interpretation (following an experience in an art museum). The second experience was a troubling conversation with a former mentor about what constituted educational research and why life history research was controversial as a topic.  The paper suggests that life history and narrative research can be as robust as or more robust than quantitative studies in terms of trustworthiness, and it notes that it can produce knowledge or insights that could be generalized to other teachers. The paper concludes by arguing for the importance of life history research. (Contains 58 references.) (SM)",

It also presents the content and impact of the action research projects from the voices of a university professor, classroom teacher, and principal. The partnership promoted study groups which involved preservice and inservice teachers and were led by university education faculty. The groups explored such topics as multiple intelligences, block scheduling, emotional intelligence, inclusion, literature-based reading programs, and cultural awareness of diverse students. The preservice and inservice teachers worked on their action research projects by focusing on five areas: problem formation, data collection, data analysis,  reporting the results, and action planning. Participants found the projects exciting and rewarding. The action research helped create systematic change in teachers' attitudes about themselves, their teaching, and their teaching abilities. It also helped improve student learning as teachers researched new areas, improved teacher effectiveness as teachers experimented and reflected on educational innovations, contributed to teacher professional development as they shared what they learned with colleagues, and helped teachers overcome isolation.

        "description":"This study examined challenges that Canadian educators faced when teaching aboriginal students in a large urban school. The study involved the school's principal, teachers, counselors, and coordinators of Aboriginal student programming. Participants, who were Aboriginal and Caucasian, completed semistructured interviews that examined personal information, challenges to teaching Aboriginal students, and suggestions for improvement. Data analysis indicated that challenges were directly influenced by students, parents, educators, and administrators. Most of the challenges were task-related rather than personal. Aboriginal and Caucasian respondents agreed on most of the challenges. Students' preparedness for school and inability to adapt to the school structure were challenges that  were especially relevant. Participants agreed that Aboriginal students learned in unique ways which educators needed to understand and work with. Parental distrust of mainstream education was a significant challenge. Challenges related to educators and administrators were associated with lack of preparedness for diverse students, cultural conflict, and district disrespect for the school. Most of the strategies suggested by respondents treated symptoms of the challenges rather than the causes. Aboriginal and Caucasian educators developed their strategies differently. The paper makes recommendations for practice and for further research. An appendix provides the interview schedule. (Contains 33 references.) (SM)",

The first section discusses the importance of linking preservice teacher action research investigation with inservice action research teams in schools. It explains that this approach begins with a structure and organization for partnership among experienced and inexperienced teacher researchers. The second section focuses on mutual inquiry on an identified curricular theme or topic, which is taught at both the university and school level. This section explains that the strategy begins with the substance and not the procedure for doing research. The third section discusses how to facilitate the partnering of institutions by bringing teachers  together across school systems for shared action research. The paper concludes that teacher action research has provided a forum for self-study and ongoing analysis of paths toward change in schools.

        "description":"This study identified how mothering knowledge influenced students' development in becoming teachers and explored how becoming a student and prospective teacher affected students' perspectives as parents. Participants were preservice teachers who were also mothers. All participants were undergraduate and graduate students in a New Jersey teacher education program. Each student completed an interview (or a questionnaire for those unable to be interviewed) based on questions developed following discussions with mother/students about issues that they faced. The interview addressed such areas as demographics, reasons for becoming a teacher, difficulties in mothering, mothering characteristics that influence teaching, the influence of preservice teacher education on mothering, and  advantages or disadvantages of being an older student. Results indicated that for most women, being a mother was the catalyst for becoming a teacher. Students believed that they would be flexible, patient, empathetic, and sensitive to children because of their mothering experience, and that they would be more realistic in terms of giving assignments knowing how long they can take. They believed they would have a more realistic understanding of the social and familial pressures pupils face. Overall, participants were enthusiastic about being in school at this time in their lives, with the advantages outweighing the disadvantages. (Contains 21 references.) (SM)",

The research group consisted of a new content area teacher, a transferring teacher from a different state, and a university researcher. The group met initially to finalize the research question, which addressed how they could make effective use of their mentoring program, then held meetings regularly throughout the study. Individual and group meetings were audiotaped, and participants kept journals. The researchers collected baseline data on current mentoring programs, teachers' attitudes, and future plans. They talked to other teachers and administrators about the current mentoring situations, then shared that information with the group. Teachers and mentors  were assigned to one another, and mentors received training through a mentoring workshop. This paper describes participants' experiences in the mentoring program, including information from their journals. It concludes that the strategies and techniques established to maintain a positive mentoring experience for all participants were successful, and the program was very effective.

        "description":"This study surveyed three groups of teachers to investigate their perceptions of problems faced by beginning teachers. The study reexamined the usefulness of Veenman's (1984) meta-analysis of the perceived problems of beginning teachers. Participants were Wisconsin beginning teachers, experienced urban teachers, and cooperating teachers. The participants received mailed surveys that investigated the extent to which they believed each of several areas were problems for beginning teachers. Participants also wrote in other comments and provided demographic information. Data analysis indicated that far more experienced cooperating teachers viewed beginning teachers as having more problems than did beginning teachers or teachers near the end of their beginning career stages. Wisconsin  teachers and urban teachers ranked lack of spare time, burden of clerical work, and heavy teaching loads as the three greatest problems. All of those problems focused on limited time, whereas the three greatest perceived problems in Veenman's study focused on students (discipline, motivation, and individual differences.) The correlation between respondents' rank order of perceived problems and Veenman's rank order was negligible or negative for Wisconsin teachers and urban teachers, and slightly positive for cooperating teachers. This study indicates that although Veenman's work is important, it is not current and requires careful treatment. Ten tables present relevant data. (Contains 20 references.) (SM)",

TEAC is a centralized system of data collection and assessment that conducts and publishes results of periodic assessments and evaluations of Central's teacher education programs by soliciting input from education faculty, preservice teacher candidates, program graduates (undergraduate and graduate levels), and principals of teachers prepared by Central. Study results indicate that 79 percent of the previous year's graduating class secured full-time teaching positions within the state (as opposed to 58 percent for 1996-97 graduates). Central's teacher education graduates were employed in 177 of Missouri's 525 districts. Most  students in the preservice program were female and white. Most of the first and second year teacher respondents planned on teaching 5 or more years from now. Teachers' top three areas of dissatisfaction in their current positions were salary/fringe benefits, level of support from parents and community, and opportunities for professional advancement. Fifty-eight percent of principals hiring Central's graduates who responded to the survey felt the teachers were strongly prepared for their current positions. The principals felt that methods used to evaluate teaching performance was the top area of dissatisfaction for teachers. The bulk of this report is survey materials. (SM)",

        "description":"This study investigated whether there would be a relationship between teacher candidates' pre-admission goal statements and their subsequent performance as intern teachers. Researchers examined graduate-level preservice teachers' personal motivations and interests in applying to be teachers with the Alliance for Catholic Education (which is based on faith, teaching, and service and offers 2 years of intern teaching experience in Catholic schools). They also asked students how the Alliance fit with their personal goals and what experiences, skills, and aptitudes they would bring to teaching. They compared student teachers' responses to university supervisors' and principals' ratings of teaching performance to determine if any patterns or themes existed. Analysis of data from  student teachers rated effective and less effective indicated that more effective intern teachers clearly identified career goals of becoming teachers and possessed prior successful experiences as teachers. Less effective interns considered teaching a path of service to God and others, and they did not have any appreciable experience. The researchers conclude that admissions to graduate teacher education programs should not be based solely on previous academic performance or test scores. An appendix presents the principal/supervisor rating scale. (Contains 18 references. (SM)",

        "description":"This paper provides an approach to building research-based knowledge in teacher education through program evaluation. This approach allows results of program evaluations to be compared and contrasted and theoretical constructs developed into practical models for use in improving teacher preparation. The paper examines Yarger and Smith's 1990 framework for studying teacher education programs. Their systematic approach included: antecedents or preexisting conditions, processes or transactions, and outcomes. They considered studies that followed this systematic approach &quot;linking studies.&quot; Yarger and Smith believed that the three components and the associated links provided a vehicle for discussing appropriate methodology for research on teacher education, implementation of teacher  education programs, and needs associated with program improvement. In following Yarger and Smith's writings, it is important to determine a unifying source which can pull teacher education institutions together in a common effort to build the research-based knowledge. Important initiatives are currently underway to develop more meaningful standards for teaching. This paper examines Stake's Countenance Model of Program Evaluation, which fits closely with Yarger and Smith's paradigm, and discusses a modification of Stake's Countenance Model, which is necessary to better fit the needs of today's education programs. The paper concludes that a research base in teacher education is possible if teacher education institutions publish research findings of their program evaluations (which are  developed for each specific site, include Yarger and Smith's three components, and are based on a national perspective).

Enacting legislation passed by the 45th Texas legislature put the Teacher Retirement System of Texas in business in 1937. The legislation limited membership to persons employed in professional and business administration, supervision, and instruction. Over the years, membership has been extended and retirement benefits have been increased. Various changes in retirement law have provided major benefit improvements to members.

The study examined programmatic features that interns considered influential in contributing to their success as teachers. Participants were graduates of a graduate-level preservice program within the Alliance for Catholic Education who had been rated as effective teachers by supervisors, mentors, and principals via a mailed survey. They completed an 11-question, open-ended, mailed survey that discussed influences on their success in the program. Questions addressed: public persona, personal and professional growth, beliefs about learning, self-confidence,  teaching skills, effect on student performance and achievement, support structures, achievement motivation, idealism versus realism, beliefs about teaching, the value of modeling respect and honesty for students, and recognition of the value, demands, and standards of teaching. Data analysis showed four major clusters: a learning frame of mind with a healthy self-concept, support from learning communities, thinking from the learner's frame of reference, and the emerging professional. The program had a profound positive impact on attitudes and beliefs and significantly influenced persona. Many program features contributed to participants' success as teachers. Participants named support by school administrators, mentors, and university supervisors as invaluable. (Contains 37 references.)  (SM)",

The study also examined principals' opinions about how well Texas universities prepared teachers to interact with and nurture growth in students attending these schools. The 44 participating principals completed a survey that asked for demographics on the principals, schools, students, and teachers and asked questions about the three research issues. Data analysis indicated that most of the principals were male and Hispanic, most of the teachers were Hispanic, and most of the students  were Hispanic and qualified for the free lunch program. This is in contrast to most schools in the U.S. and Texas. Teacher-student ratios in large schools along the border were above the national average. Principals reported highly valuing new teachers with an understanding of themes centered around the middle school, and they wanted to see preservice teachers get more exposure to middle grades classrooms. (However, there is no certification or endorsement for middle grades in Texas teacher preparation programs.) Principals believed Texas universities adequately prepared preservice teachers, but preservice teachers needed more information about working with children and parents living in poverty.

Teachers in graduate classes helped ascertain what grammar and usage knowledge was important for teachers to know. Researchers constructed evaluation items, and teachers were asked to affirm that the items had face validity. Four language arts instructors examined the test items and agreed that the items had validity. Researchers used the split-half method to determine  the reliability of the GIFT. They administered two forms of the GIFT to 40 preservice teachers to determine the split-half reliability coefficient (.76). The final instrument measured grammatical knowledge and knowledge of standard English usage, focusing on parts of speech, sentence elements, correct use of verbs, subject and verb agreement, and pronoun usage.

It questioned what they believed were the strengths of their master teachers and how those strengths contributed to their personal professional development. The two studies  spanned 1 academic year. Both studies used observation data, questionnaires, journal entries, and interview data. Findings fell into the following categories: professional development and interaction; tacit learning of how schools and classrooms ran; practice of generic and specific instructional models/strategies; translating knowledge from the disciplines into appropriate curriculum concepts, lesson planning, and assessment; practice of situational appropriate discipline; and classroom management. Student and master teachers found the partnering experiences positive and supportive and the feedback helpful. (Contains 21 references.) (SM)",

Data analysis indicated teachers ranked the Peace Corps experience highly in its effect on their  self-efficacy and cultural awareness, and less highly in its effect on their teaching. The results indicate that the Peace Corps functioned as a mastery experience. The effect was robust and persistent.

        "description":"This annual report analyzes the quality of academic standards in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico and monitors the extent to which those standards are driving education reform. The report describes criteria used to evaluate state standards and provides commentary on each state's standards, highlighting areas of strength and pinpointing weaknesses that must be addressed to improve the standards. The report also examines: states' activities and intentions to assess whether students are meeting the standards; whether states are providing extra academic help to students who are having difficulty meeting the standards; and whether states are attaching meaningful consequences to the standards so that students and others take them seriously. Findings indicate  that the standards-based reform movement is getting stronger in the states, and the overall quality of state standards continues to improve. Twenty states have incentives to motivate students to achieve a higher standard than required of all students. Recommendations for how states can strengthen their standards and develop policies to support their reform efforts are included. Two appendixes review state documents and present content resources.

After an introduction, Section 1 discusses \"Learning in Our Nation's Schools: Simple-Minded or Muddle-Headed?\" Section 2 focuses on \"Teaching for Understanding.\" Section 3 examines \"Barriers to Effective Professional Development and School Reform.\" Section 4 discusses \"Inquiry-Based Professional Development.\" Section 5 focuses on \"Collaboration with Children, Families, and Colleagues.\" Section 6 looks at \"Cherry Valley Elementary School, Polson, Montana.\" The report concludes that effective  professional development: is moving away from the model in which an expert transmits knowledge to teachers; is grounded in the questions and concerns of those who work closely with children; views teachers as intellectuals, leaders, peer coaches, and researchers; and allows ample opportunities for teachers and principals to engage in reflective study of teaching practices, experimentation, collaborative problem solving, and peer mentoring in a supportive climate.

The paper suggests that the ways in which people reflect individually are shared across cultures, but the ways in which people reflect together are structured differently by their varied cultures, and this may have important consequences for teacher education since student teachers come from diverse cultures. After presenting research on and examples of individual and collaborative reflection from several diverse cultures, the paper concludes that teacher educators must be prepared to teach their students how to access the tools of discussion, and the teaching should be guided by various cultural considerations. The  considerations include: learning to embrace one's own cultural tools for collaborative reflection; learning not to take for granted that other people share the same customs of reflection; being aware of the importance of establishing group norms for the college; welcoming the insights of other cultures into the reflective process; and meeting the challenge of learning how to share one's own understandings with people from different cultures.

A sociocultural analysis explored processes occurring on the personal, interpersonal, and community level that shaped their mentoring experiences. Organized by the university, the mentoring program paired a total of 52 female sixth graders from six middle schools with 52 female undergraduate students in their second year of college for a weekly after school mentoring program hosted by the middle schools. The undergraduates also enrolled in a 2-semester undergraduate seminar which included reflective writing, discussion, and readings about mentoring, tutoring,  communication skills, and studies of adolescent girls. The experiences of the pairs were documented through observations, interviews, written reflection papers, and log sheets. Additionally, the developmental stage of each participant was assessed in both the fall and the spring using the Subject-Object interview. A sociocultural and developmental analysis of the experiences of being a mentor or mentee was constructed. The study concluded that the type of support each person in a mentoring program needed in order to feel successful taking on different roles and developing a relationship with an assigned partner varied according to her developmental stage (early or late adolescence).

Children must learn to use the text to pick the answer, rather than relying on memory, especially when the story is a familiar one. Teachers can help students learn to look through the text and can provide practice opportunities with easy or familiar text in a format that resembles that of the test. Teachers can also help students create a context for words that may be on a test by relating those words to their own experiences. Learning to read the questions accurately is important, as is practicing choosing the answer based on the true meaning of the questions. Teachers should also advise  students not to overlook an answer choice because it contains an unfamiliar word. Students can also be taught to check their answers without reviewing every single response. In addition to teaching students these strategies, teachers need to set a positive tone for the day of the test. (Contains four references.) (SLD)",

A decade and a half later, the United States is still at risk because U.S. schools are failing children. Dropout rates have declined, and college attendance has risen, but student achievement has remained flat and college remediation rates have risen to unprecedented levels. The United States is the only country in the world in which children fall farther behind the longer they stay in school. In fact, a dual school system is developing, with a widening gap between good schools and poor schools. Poor and minority children usually go to worse schools, and their families have the least power to alter bad situations. Power over the education  system has increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few who really don't want change. Equal educational opportunity is the next great civil rights frontier. The main strategies for change should center on standards, assessment, and accountability and allow for pluralism, competition, and choice to ensure the best for all children.

When a constructivist approach is taken to assessment, evaluation is based on contextual situations. The portfolio represents a constructivist approach that can really sample student achievement. Computer-based tests have many advantages, especially in the immediacy of feedback to students, but they also have limitations centering on the lack of opportunity for  students to raise questions or have input into the curriculum.

        "description":"Many changes have occurred in techniques used to appraise student achievement in social studies, and these new approaches may put teachers in a better position to notice the progress of individual students and then plan for sequential learning. Some of the deficiencies of traditionally used standardized tests have been overcome through the use of criterion-referenced tests, which ensure better fit with a set of standards and better test validity. Weaknesses in criterion-referenced tests may be overcome with newer approaches. Among these are journal writing by students, student diaries, and student logs, techniques particularly appropriate for social studies. Pupil ownership and empowerment are enhanced when students are actively involved in developing portfolios for social  studies classes. Portfolio development emphasizes contextual skills and knowledge developed by students, rather than results from externally developed tests. Professional development portfolios are equally useful for teachers. Any approach to assessment should determine what students have learned and what remains to be learned. Appraisal procedures need to be &quot;user friendly&quot; so that plans may be made from the appraisal for improved teaching and learning. (Contains eight references.) (SLD)",

Tests of student skills were developed through a series of empirical trials and reviews. The third trial of the test was carried out by using whole classes selected randomly to yield two classes from four schools for each test. Results show that the developed elementary (grades 5 and 6) and intermediate (grades 7 and 8) tests are sufficiently reliable to proceed to national standardization. The tests for secondary school students has many difficult items, and will require further developmental trials before national standardization. Test results show that girls score higher and are rated higher than boys, and that students in  high-performance schools (&quot;high decile&quot;) score better than those at low and middle levels of performance. Older students also tend to do better than younger ones.

        "description":"The progress school districts throughout New Jersey made in implementing a system of portfolio assessment and the factors that promoted or prohibited the implementation of this system were studied. In all, 262 teachers and 109 administrators completed and returned questionnaires on portfolio assessment. Findings indicate that teachers and administrators believe that portfolio assessment can provide an effective means of assessing students' performance in schools, but that actual practices in their schools have not been as successful. Critical to the success of implementing a system of portfolio assessment is the need to identify clearly when and how portfolios are to be used. It is also important to identify the information that portfolios will contain, and teachers and  administrators thought that these issues had not been resolved. Survey results highlight the importance of adequate staff training for teachers and administrators involved in the implementation process. (Contains 17 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"The convention for selecting starting points (that is, initial items) on a computerized adaptive test (CAT) is to choose as starting points items of medium difficulty for all examinees. Selecting a starting point based on prior information about an individual's ability was first suggested many years ago, but has been believed unimportant provided that the CAT is reasonably long. However, starting with a medium difficulty item for all examinees has two potential disadvantages: unnecessary uses of the first one or two items and overuse or overexposure of the items around the medium difficulty. This study analyzed simulated CAT results and suggests significant benefits from administering the first CAT item at a difficulty level suitable to each examinee. Such an adjustment can  reduce the use of items around the medium difficulty in the item pool, providing extra help in controlling the exposure rate of the items beyond what standard exposure control methods can achieve. The effect of selecting examinee-appropriate starting points can vary depending on the quality of the information used about examinees' ability levels and the test termination rules applied.

A secondary purpose was to provide guidelines to practitioners to help in deciding whether to use an IRT model to analyze their data. In a simulation study, the unidimensionality assumption was deliberately violated by using two-dimensional data. The &quot;impact,&quot; or change in the error due to violating the assumption, was calculated to assess the effects of the violation on ability estimation. The effects of problematic variables on absolute impacts and their interactions were analyzed, and a factor analysis using the principal component method was conducted to provide guidelines to practitioners on the computer-generated generated data. The precision of  the estimated ability was determined in four ways. When the ability estimate was assumed to measure the average ability and the major ability of two unequally important abilities, the procedure was generally robust to the violation. However, when the ability estimate was assumed to measure one of the two equally important abilities and the minor ability of two unequally important abilities, the estimation procedure was not robust. Results from the analysis of variance were consistent with the results from analyzing the relative impacts. (Contains 5 tables and 47 references.) (Author/SLD)",

These item parameters are then reparameterized as a set of grand item parameters and sets of DIF parameters representing main and interaction effects of the factors on the items.

The DOSC-Form S, Japanese version, yields five scores associated with the five underlying dimensions of academic self-concept: Level of Aspiration, Anxiety, Academic Interest and Satisfaction, Leadership and Initiative, and Identification versus Alienation. Past studies involving Japanese college students have reported that Japanese college students display dispositions indicative of low self-concept relative to their American counterparts, but little empirical study has been done on the academic self-concept of Japanese high  school students. Japanese high schools constitute a unique subculture within the entire Japanese educational system, characterized by intensive preparation and competition for college entrance. Data from this study show lower academic self-concept for these students compared with U.S. high school students, but the subjects in this study represent only one segment of the diverse Japanese high school population.

Laughlin, 1998) is an item response theory model designed to analyze binary or graded responses that are based on a proximity relation. The purpose of this study was to assess conditions under which item parameter estimation accuracy increases or decreases, with special attention paid to the influence that a given item parameter value has on the estimation of another item parameter. This assessment was based on a recovery simulation in which the effects of sample size, item location, degree of item discrimination, and extremity of subjective category thresholds were varied. Results indicate that with 750 or more respondents, sample size has negligible effect on all but the estimation of subjective  response category thresholds. The true extremity of both item location and item discrimination did affect the estimation of these parameters themselves, and also affected the estimation of other item parameters in the model. However, these effects were modest and had little impact on the estimation of the corresponding item response functions. These results suggest that marginal maximum likelihood estimates of item parameters will provide accurate results across a variety of item parameter configurations when the sample size is at or above the recommended levels.

Kane (1994). Results from the standard setting example involving 29 judges for an  international certification program in financial management provide evidence that item performance estimates were both valid and reliable.

Reading achievement as measured by two tests, the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills and the Washington Assessment of Student Learning, was cross tabulated with teacher judgments. There was over 90% correspondence between the two tests, both of which were published by the same company, and there was a high relationship between teacher judgments and student achievement on external measures. Teachers had high validity in making judgments about student learning relative to their performance on external measures,  with good agreement for 90% of students. Some reasons for misjudgments about student achievement are discussed, and the need for additional professional development to ensure equity standards-based exit requirements is emphasized.

Changes were generally monotonic across three occasions. These data implicate test proximity and overestimation of future effort as influences on academic expectations that seem worthy of more attention by teachers. They may reflect a tacit student strategy of changing goal levels in order to maintain desire in the face of declining expectations. Also the influence of expectancy and two types of value on motivation seemed to vary with proximity to an examination.

The assessment war was raging more than 100 years ago, as historical records of testing student achievement demonstrate. Ralph Tyler, in the 1960s, did his best to bring about a truce in the assessment war by inventing the term &quot;assessment&quot; and suggesting that the focus be on the educational attainments of large numbers of people. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) advocated by Tyler called for the assessment of a sample of students, each of whom took only a fraction of the exercises, and none of whom received an individual score. Over the past 30 years these  objectives have just barely survived. Among other changes, scores are imputed for each child, and these are averaged for any specific subgroup. Many changes in the NAEP have been supported by psychometric considerations, but some have compromised Tyler's vision by supporting pressures for reported scores for school districts, schools, classrooms, and individual students. Many of the problems evident as testing stakes become higher are identified. It is shortsighted to accept test scores as the ultimate criterion of the benefits of education, and more appropriate criteria must be developed. Some attachments illustrate historical controversy over assessment. (Contains four references.) (SLD)",

Two hundred and twenty-three students were divided into 2 groups. The first group consisted of 46 instrumental music students in grades 4 and 5. The second group consisted of 177 students who did not participate in the instrumental music program. A two-sample independent t-test analysis was used to determine if there was a significant difference between the test scores of the students who were excused from class for 30 minutes twice a week for instrumental music study and those who were not involved in the music program. It was hypothesized that there would be no significant difference between the test scores of the two groups or that the test scores of the music  students would be higher than the nonmusic students as measured in five academic areas of the California Tests of Basic Skills: reading, language comprehension, mathematics comprehension, science, and social studies. Findings support the first hypothesis; that is, no significant difference exists between the scores of instrumental music participants and nonparticipants. (Contains four tables.) (Author/SLD)",

The three types of practices are: (1) translation and review (translation version); (2) translation, back translation, and review (back translation version); and (3) translation, back translation, review, and empirical validation study (validation version). The focus was on the relative effectiveness of back translation applied to the construction of Korean versions of instruments. Participants were 734 fifth graders from 3 public elementary schools in Seoul (Korea). Responses on the three test versions and two other motivation scales were collected  within a 3-week period at approximately 1-week intervals. Results show that the back translation version is superior to the translation version in terms of its similarity to the validation version and construct-related evidence. However, results from item-response theory analyses reveal that the quality of the translated items is similar. The nature of adapted attitude scales is discussed. Appendixes contain the Academic Failure Tolerance Scale (M. Clifford 1988, 19991) and two back translation versions. (Contains 13 tables and 33 references.) (Author/SLD)",

The variables under investigation were: (1) student-generated learning issues; (2) individual learning process; (3) reporting in the tutorial group; and (4) achievement. A questionnaire containing 21 items was developed. Data were collected in the first year from 195 students at the Medical School of Maastricht University (the Netherlands) in the 1997-98 school year. Data were analyzed with a structural modeling approach. Results indicate that the model fitted the data well. The path coefficients were moderately high, particularly between the explanation-oriented approach and the depth of the  reporting in the tutorial group. High path coefficients were also found between the depth of the reporting and achievement. In sum, the model gives insight into how important variables are related. It is recommended that data be collected to test the model repeatedly. (Contains 2 tables, 2 figures, and 14 references.) (Author/SLD)",

Although school districts generally gave high ratings to the contents of TerraNova (McGraw Hill), the testing instrument most recently used, there was dissatisfaction with the administration of the testing program in 1996-97. A review of testing program administration, scoring, and reporting was conducted, and the test procurement process was also evaluated. Three problems were identified as leading to significant inconvenience and frustration: (1) a delay in receiving testing materials for the Milwaukee public schools with an associated delay in testing and scoring,  delaying statewide results; (2) missing questions from the fourth-grade examination that required software modifications; and (3) pages that separated from test booklets, which caused scoring problems. Evaluation indicated that the testing process improved in the 1997-98 school year. Some issues in the test bidding process are considered, including problems of testing program continuity if the test vendor changes due to cost or other administrative requirements. Some changes are recommended to improve the testing program, but it is noted that frequent structural changes can diminish the program's ability to identify long-term trends. A response from the Department of Public Instruction to the State Legislative Audit Bureau is included. (Contains three tables.) (SLD)",

The third data source consisted of information gathered from 5 professional work groups, which differed from focus groups in that all 44 participants were professionals. Within the eight empirical studies, no clear pattern emerged  regarding effective instructional practices for English-language learners. A synthesis of these studies and other data sources suggests that a good English language development program should include three components: (1) a focus on the development of fluency and proficiency in English; (2) a concern with more formal, grammatical aspects of English; and (3) an emphasis on learning new academic content.

These results would tend to offset fears that regression to the mean precludes the highest achieving school systems from maintaining gains over a period of several years. Results show that it is possible for schools with a high percentage of disadvantaged students also to be high achieving, although the lowest achieving school systems had the highest percentages of students on free and reduced lunch status. Results also show that over the 8-year period from 1990 to 1997 the mean  science scale score by year statewide showed gains for 5 of the 8 years, with a slight decrease in 1997 prior to replacement of the CTBS/4 with the newer McGraw Hill TerraNova Test.

The assumptions and purposes underlying scientific and political evaluation as opposed to those of diagnostic assessment are probed, and the work of Jennie Oakes and others is used as the basis for deriving a recommendation for valid, reliable, and appropriate assessments on both individual and institutional levels to facilitate the development of effective schools. Despite the criticism of  high-stakes testing, it is not recommended that policy-driven high-stakes tests be abolished. Instead, their rational, effective, and judicious use should be the objective.

Co-op education is extensive in Canada, with an estimated 10% of the student population enrolled in co-op secondary education each year. The context for this study was a veterinary clinic in which four co-op students participated. The theoretical framework for the study considered the workplace experiences as curriculum, the special character of experiential learning, and a cognitive perspective on learning from experience. Methodological challenges were evident in four related areas: (1) observation in an unfamiliar setting; (2) goals of the workplace setting; (3) conceptions of knowledge and curriculum; and (4) varieties of learning. The  methodological challenges recognized in this study highlight the interplay among the theoretical framework, data collection methods, and data analysis procedures. (Contains 16 references.)

Evaluation, which is defined as the systematic investigation of merit or worth, can be characterized as planning, formative, or summative evaluation. All three types of evaluation involve the collection and analysis of data. In evaluating professional development, there are five critical levels of information to consider. These are: (1) participants' reactions; (2) participants' learning; (3) organization support and change; (4) participants' use of new knowledge and skills; and (5) student learning outcomes. In the real-world  setting of professional development evaluation, it is nearly impossible to obtain proof of the impact of the effort, but it is possible to obtain good evidence.

        "description":"The experiences and responses of high school biology students using the GenScope computer program are described. GenScope represents genetic concepts in a linked multilevel fashion to teach students to think like scientists. Many GenScope problems use a fictitious dragon species to illustrate genetics. Students can manipulate the dragons' genes to produce offspring with particular characteristics. Students in the two high school biology classes responded enthusiastically to using the computers and to the dragon &quot;design&quot; problems. The freedom to operate outside of typical instructional routines and related teaching methods appeared to begin a transformative experience for these students. Participating in learning through action also engaged students and changed their attitudes  about biology. An appendix describes the GenScope problem about the genetics of the dragons' horns.

Participants (n=297) were asked to judge the importance of each task. College students (n=476) were asked how confident they would be in doing these tasks as if they were beginning teachers. Rasch technique was used to scale the importance and confidence of the tasks. Most of the teachers considered these tasks important, especially those pertaining to &quot;guidance and counseling.&quot; Most of the college students considered themselves very confident in doing these tasks, especially those related to &quot;planning and preparing for instruction.&quot; They felt less confident about the tasks pertinent to &quot;classroom management.&quot; Nine tasks were identified as important but  relatively difficult to accomplish. The curriculum for teacher education should make efforts to cultivate the corresponding skills and knowledge for these nine tasks.

        "author":["Bloom, Jeffrey W."],
        "description":"This paper addresses contemporary (i.e., postmodern) concerns with the disintegration of meaning and fragmentation of knowledge. As society continues to move towards increased specialization and separation of disciplines, people are becoming increasingly disconnected from the broad connecting conceptions within the disciplines, i.e., the patterns that bridge the disciplines, to the natural world, and to each other. A potential remedy, based on the work of Gregory Bateson and Mary Catherine Bateson, for providing a way to develop such connections is explored. Such as remedy is founded on the framework of \"patterns that connect\" (G. Bateson, 1979). In this paper, the discussion of such patterns is situated in the context of a view of learning that is based on nonlinearity of  thought processes and on variation both as a source and outcome of thinking (J. Bloom, 1998; F. Capra, 1996). This view of learning leads to: (1) more cohesive and elaborate understandings; (2) an emphasis on meaning rather than decontextualized content; (3) emphasis on creativity; (4) a greater sense of connection to the learner's world; and (5) the development of a sense of ownership over what is learned.

Approaches to implementing standards may be organized into two general categories, indirect and direct. Indirect approaches are based on the assumption that even though student performance on standards is not directly tied to their performance in individual classes, teachers will naturally want to provide assistance to their students and will organize their classrooms accordingly. Teachers will usually choose the standards they will address in their classrooms. Direct approaches necessitate a change in classroom practice for  teachers because the specific standards teachers must address are mandated. Section 2 considers indirect approaches, and section 3 considers direct approaches.

The approaches were hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), ordinary least squares (OLS), and weighted least squares (WLS). Analyses were conducted using data from the 1998 Maryland School Performance Assessment Program for 23,461 third graders and 21,226 fifth graders. A two-level model was used for computing HLM school effects with four student-level predictors used to predict achievement in level one, and the school size used in level two to predict the level-1 intercept. The dependent achievement measure in OLS and WLS analyses was the average student score across the six content areas of the assessment. In OLS five  variables were used as predictors, at the school level only, and in WLS the same strategy was used except that the sampling variance of the dependent variable was estimated for each school and used as the weighting variable. For OLS and WLS studentized residuals were used as the school effects measure. Results of the analyses indicate that, from a practical perspective, and all other considerations being equal, the HLM approach should be used for school effects measures on the basis of stability. The use of either of the school-level models appears to be viable in the event that only school-level data are available. Reasons for the greater stability of the HLM approach are discussed.

Each of the state's 24 local education agencies was represented for 2 or 3 content areas. Forty-six pairs of teachers provided data. Half (the experimental group), received training in the state's Core Learning Goals, instructional strategies, and the use of rubrics as instructional tools. The remainder (control group), did not receive training. Data analyzed were effect sizes by form  by item type within teacher pair. Results provide some empirical support for instructional uses of rubrics. Support was strongest for constructed-response items in biology, but was also seen for selected-response and constructed-response items in algebra. Neither positive nor negative effects were seen for English or government. Whether positive effects remain at the same levels across different types of rubrics remains for additional study.

Quantitative and qualitative approaches were used in the development and validation process, and the questionnaire was then used to study the teachers' behaviors and their associations with students' perceptions and attitudes toward science and science academic achievement. Results show that all five scales of the TCBQ have satisfactory internal consistency reliability, discriminant validity, and factor  validity. There were strong associations between the scales of the instrument and students' attitudes toward science. Two of the scales were associated with cognitive achievement. This instrument adds to research on teacher-student interactions by focusing on the use of challenging questioning to promote students' creative thinking ability and the use of verbal and nonverbal feedback to enhance students' attitude toward science and their academic achievement outcomes.

This requirement was later extended to fifth grade students as well. Tests were constructed to measure student growth in mathematics during the summer school session. Differences between results on the test taken as a pretest and as a posttest were used as a measure of growth for each student. The average student gained between 3 points (grade 5) and 3.5 points (grade 8) in mathematics during the 15 days of instruction between the pretest and posttest. Over 76%  of fifth graders had positive gain scores, and about 70% of eighth graders had positive scores. The proportion of students who demonstrated growth may be attributed, at least in part, to the provision of instructionally relevant diagnostic information to teachers at the beginning of the summer school session as well as to the seriousness with which students faced the summer school experience.

Students taking these tests are told that their responses provide important information for evaluating the university's programs but that there are no individual consequences from test results. A brief survey measured student motivation during this testing. Results from the Scholastic Assessment Tests were used as measures of general ability. Motivation for these students was not correlated with ability, but the relationship between motivation and performance depended on ability, at least for the science test. The interaction between ability and motivation suggests  that conclusions about the overall effects of motivation do not apply to all ability levels equally. However, this interaction is an ordinal one in that motivation increases performance at all ability levels, but especially so for high ability students. (Contains two figures and nine references.)

Recent changes in the English educational assessment system and to the curriculum with the adoption of the National Curriculum have created considerable interest in the transition students face between the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) mathematics and the &quot;A level&quot; examinations required for university entrance. Responses by 67 colleges and schools to a questionnaire about the transition were used to select 5  institutions for case studies and interviews about practices. Specific information about difficulties schools and colleges noted about gaps between the two mathematics curricula are identified and grouped into concerns about teaching in the &quot;pre-16&quot; years, teaching related to the GCSE, and teaching for students after the age of 16 who are beginning their A-level courses of study.

The test is two-staged in that the first 15 items, of median difficulty, were to be completed beforehand by all students as a &quot;placement&quot; test. Where students were to start the second portion of the test was determined by their scores on the first 15 items. The dimensionality of the scale, the item fit, item bias, and item invariance were considered in applying IRT modeling. The scale obtained reflected the relative ability of the students. Results suggest that mean scale scores can be safely compared between jurisdictions, genders, or age groups. The proposed  approach seems reasonably appropriate when a two-stage testing procedure has been used to evaluate students' performance. (Contains 1 table, 5 figures, and 19 references.) (SLD)",

The paper uses an alternative qualitative model to examine issues of power, equity, and race in the particular context of the African American woman. It discusses the writings of Zora Neale Hurston as a framework and compares the ethnographic stories in three Hurston short stories with a fictional ethnographic interpretation of related academic experiences. Telling a life experience as fiction is comparable to, and perhaps the same as, the &quot;fiction&quot; gathered during ethnographic moments. Researchers accept the ethnographic narratives gathered as data as experiences recreated by the narrator. Creating fiction can be a way to create  objectivity through distance from a complex experience. (Contains 36 references.) (SLD)",

Questionnaires were randomly distributed to 175 students who were enrolled in college Algebra I and II. The sample included 142 students (classified as developmental on college entry by their own reports) who responded to a 21-item questionnaire, which included both traditional and nontraditional variables. Results indicate that students' entry-level characteristics, aptitude, and family-support variables were interrelated and had indirect effects on students' academic performance through institutional experiences and integration. Course grades have direct effects on academic performance, and students' motivation, ability, and familial  influence on students' personal goals, have direct and indirect effects on academic performance through course grades. The result favor the developmental students regardless of gender and female students without regard to college grade point average. The trend analyses indicate that as levels of family income, family education, and school and community activities increased, the student's academic performance decreased.

Data for the study were obtained from the Student Opinion Survey processing history files of ACT Inc. for 10 institutions. Students at these colleges had responded to the survey about college services used, but the average number of students  responding to all items was less than half the total number of respondents.

Monte Carlo methods were used to generate replications, and means and standard deviations of observed Type I error-rates and percentages of observed Type I errors within the 0.95 confidence intervals were determined for per-experiment and experimentwise conditions. Effects of numbers of groups and group sizes on these Type I error rates were examined. Of primary concern was the accuracy of these procedures  compared with the nominal alpha. Results indicate that none of these tests should be conducted as protected tests, but only as unprotected tests, particularly when alpha is 0.05 or less. If the Type I error control philosophy is experimentwise, Tukey's HSD, as an unprotected test, is clearly the most accurate procedure across all three alpha levels.

The vast proportion of the literature in this area, however, is qualitative without empirical data. Among the empirical studies that have investigated this issue quantitatively, there appear to be considerable inconsistencies. A meta-analysis was conducted to synthesize the quantitative literature about the relationship between parental involvement and students' academic achievement. The findings reveal a moderate, and practically meaningful, relationship between parental involvement and academic achievement. Using moderator  analysis, it is revealed that parental aspiration/expectation for children's education achievement as the strongest relationship, while parental home supervision has the weakest relationship, with students' academic achievement. In addition, the relationship is stronger when academic achievement is represented by a global indicator than by a subject-specific indicator.

As intuitively expected, score reliability for the data for which only one rater is used for scoring is always lower than the score reliability for the portion of sample data for which two raters are used. A sample of  published studies is provided from difference disciplines that gives inter-rater reliability coefficients obtained from a small proportion of a sample.

Over the first 3 years of the collaborative, the faculty development activities that involved cross-campus and cross-discipline collaboration occurred in large conferences, workshops, curriculum working groups, and through case studies. Formative evaluation has focused on facilitating faculty development, providing baseline data on courses, documenting change within the Collaborative courses, developing peer reviews of course documents, and to a  lesser degree, assisting faculty in end-of-year course evaluations. Case studies of the Collaborative courses have been an important part of the ongoing evaluation, and an outline has been developed to guide faculty members in writing case studies. Evaluation of the CETP is important for both funders and evaluators. Both funders and evaluators are interested in careful review of project proposals and early warning systems for potential problems. Evaluators may have a more consultative function, but funders, who have responsibility to a broader constituency, may need to serve more as judges.

Perspective Text Analysis, the system presented, is a basic methodological part of a larger system of analyses. Linguistic data in the form of free text production is important so that the prejudices and attitudes, that both the researcher and the text producer may have, do not enter into the researcher's analysis. This guide describes the fundamentals of the method, and the principles of test analysis are given through prototypical examples. The applied model is based on the assumption that its components are reflecting &quot;perspectivation,&quot; in which a source and one or more operators can be  distinguished and differentiated from one another in the building up of a perspective. When the perspective is formed, the text producer takes a position toward something he or she wants to express. (Contains 41 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"The degree of inequality of selected fiscal variables between a big city school district (the school district of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), and the top spending school districts in the same state was studied across time. Comparisons were made on the basis of size and location of districts and the following variables: expenditures, wealth, local revenue, state revenue, and federal revenue per student. The study was conducted during a period of conflict between the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the School District of Philadelphia over the state's funding of the district. Data were extracted from reports from the state department of education. Philadelphia educates 12% of the state's students. Study findings suggest that the state's efforts to compensate for the needs of the  big city still leaves a wide gap between the fiscal capabilities of the big city and the state's 25 top spending districts. State legislators need to be aware that their actions on fiscal policy have much more impact on the big city than on the top spending districts, which are much more dependent on local politics.

        "description":"This study investigates the correlates and consequences of grade repetition on student academic progress and social and emotional development using the first grade cohort data from the \"Prospects\" longitudinal database. Analyses looked at two types of comparisons, same age and same grade, on three contrasting groups of students: (1) retained students versus all never retained children; (2) retained students versus all never retained students adjusting for factors that influence retention; and (3) retained students versus a low-achieving sample of nonretained children. In this study, consequences of grade retention on social and emotional development were measured by teacher rating of student attention, cooperation, and participation. Patterns of differences between retained and  promoted students varied somewhat with the sample used and whether same age or same grade comparisons were being made. Differences in ratings of attention/motivation to learn, however, were consistently observed prior to retention. These differences were consistently reduced after retention across the various samples and comparisons being made. Differences between ratings of cooperation and participation prior to and following retention were not as striking or as consistent as those for attention/motivation. Comparison of the experiences, classroom organization, instructional content, and approaches in the regular and retained year found the two years highly similar in many dimensions, suggesting that grade retention does amount to repeating the same grade. Implications for practice are  discussed. Six appendixes provide study data and detailed analyses. (Contains 40 exhibits and 14 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"The impact of changes in the 1994-95 reauthorization of Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act on the operations and effectiveness of Title I programs in the Great City Schools was studied through a survey of urban school districts. Responses were submitted by 34 school districts, representing approximately 23% of the Title I student population. Survey findings indicate that the 1994-95 reauthorization of Title I had a substantial impact in the member districts of the Council of Great City Schools in terms of those served by the program, how it is operated, and the results it achieves. The number of students and schools benefiting from the program increased significantly, a growth that was partly the result of increased funding and partly the result of changing the  eligibility of schools designated as &quot;schoolwide&quot; program sites. The number of eligible students in private schools increased, as did the number of private schools served. The survey also shows that a number of urban school districts also have content and performance standards in place for their Title I students, indicating that the work that has been done to raise standards in urban schools since the reauthorization has been significant. These findings are a progress report on Title I in urban schools, but do not represent the results from a complete program evaluation. They do suggest that the standards-based approach of the reauthorized Title I is bearing fruit in urban schools. Appendixes contain Title I data by district and sample Title I program descriptions.

        "description":"By understanding why children engage in name calling and responding thoughtfully to such events, parents and teachers can help both the name caller and the victim to grow in their abilities to understand themselves and others. In their own social interactions, children mirror the negative evaluations they have observed. Left unchecked, such beliefs and attitudes can become the foundation of life-long prejudices. Name calling doesn't have to be part of childhood. Children can learn that words do hurt. When a child has been hurt by someone else's language, it is important for the child not to internalize the negative messages he or she has received. The parent or teacher should assure the child that the name caller was wrong. If name calling or exclusion is a frequent problem in  school, teachers can implement character-education lessons that help all the children in the class be more sensitive to and accepting of each other. Those who work with children must be sure that they model appropriate behavior and they don't ignore the use of bigoted language by other adults so that children can learn that they can help overcome racism, sexism, and other forms of bigotry.

        "description":"Using the Scale of Intrinsic versus Extrinsic Orientation in the Classroom (S. Harter, 1980) and the Self-Perception Profile for Children (S. Harter, 1985), this study of 222 urban early adolescents (median age=149 months) examined differences in motivation that might affect academic achievement and perceptions of competence. Socioeconomic status (SES) was found to be an important factor in academic performance, with poorer performance noted for lower income students. Like earlier research, cross-sectional analysis (controlling for SES) of composite intrinsic/extrinsic scores indicated a decline in the motivational component and an increase in the informational component from sixth to seventh grade. However, in contrast to previous research on predominantly white samples, this  study finds these urban and minority students to be more intrinsically motivated. Academic motivation of students from single-parent families was found to be greater than that of peers living in two-parent families. Other within-group differences also contributed to academic outcomes. Actual academic achievement was higher for students who did not rely on teacher evaluation to know when they had succeeded or failed academically. Variability in perceived scholastic competence influenced motivational orientation more than did actual academic achievement. These findings suggest ways in which schools can help at-risk students succeed. (Contains 3 tables and 17 references.) (Author/SLD)",

Data come from detailed questionnaires filled out by parents, teachers, and administrators from these schools. These responses indicate that 55% of these school buildings are virtually a half century old, and 9% of the elementary schools and 7% of the high schools date back to the 19th century. Many of the schools need major repairs, and in 29% of the elementary schools, instruction takes place in hallways, gyms, and other converted spaces. In 41% of the elementary schools, 63% of the middle schools, and 64% of the high schools, 6 or more full-time teachers lack permanent state certification.  Class sizes are large, and equipment is often missing. Textbooks and even desks and chairs are often lacking. The causes of these resource deficiencies are structural problems in the present state aid system. New York City is routinely shortchanged by the state aid system. For the past 15 years, its per-pupil expenditures have lagged behind the statewide average. The documented gap grows even larger when the needs of the city's students are taken into account.

The analysis identified student behavior variables related to three measures of school violence: (1) personal behavior, such as being sent to the office for misbehaving, parents being warned about behavior, or fighting with other students; (2) victimization, whether having something stolen, receiving a drug offer, receiving threats or harm; and (3) perception of violence indicated by student responses to how they perceived violence problems in their school. Background variables included in the analyses were sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status  quartile, school type (public, Catholic, other religious private, nonreligious private), and school community location (urban, suburban, and rural). Associations of school violence measures plus student background characteristics on student achievement show that when the incidence of negative personal behavior increases, there is a negative effect on achievement. Students experiencing victimization and students' perceptions of violence in their schools show lower levels of effect on achievement. Implications for school practices and suggestions for future research are discussed.

It was hypothesized that individuals with an unexamined ethnic identity would be more likely to have explored the meaning and significance of their ethnic group membership and that those with an achieved ethnic identity would be more likely to endorse active responses to acts of discrimination. It was also hypothesized that adolescents who were alone during an act of discrimination would respond differently from those who were accompanied. Two hundred male African American adolescents at an urban high school participated, completing a discrimination response index presenting scenarios of acts  of discrimination and a measure of ethnic identity status. Both hypotheses were partially supported. Regardless of the audience present, adolescents who had explored the meaning and significance of their ethnic group membership were more likely to endorse hostile responses than adolescents who had not explored their ethnic group membership.

The BrainPower curriculum is a systematic application of principles of attribution theory. The experimental group for this study consisted of 50 children, aged 7 to 11 years, from 2 Los Angeles housing projects. A comparison group of 40 children did not participate in the afterschool program. Teacher and parent ratings of aggressive behavior were collected, and children's intentionality beliefs and beliefs about aggression were assessed with an  instrument designed for this research. Data support the characterization of a supervised program of activities as a protective factor in the face of high rates of community crime.

Individually tailored intervention procedures are implemented for children identified by classroom teachers as achieving below-grade level. A longitudinal study was designed to assess the success of this program in the Detroit Public Schools (Michigan) over the 5 years from 1993-94 to 1997-98. A total of 135 students were studied, 75 in the experimental group participating in Reading Recovery and 60 in a comparison group who were approximately at the same reading achievement level at the start of the study. Data from the California  Achievement Test, the Metropolitan Achievement Test, and the Michigan Education Assessment Program were used to measure student achievement. The Reading Recovery group showed improvement throughout the study--an improvement sustained over the 5 years. However, the Reading Recovery group consistently scored below the achievement levels of the comparison group.

        "description":"This digest reviews current research on girls' delinquent and violent behavior, the factors contributing to it, and effective programming strategies to prevent it. Girls are more involved in violent crime than they were a decade ago. Their murder rate is up 64%, although status offenses (offenses only because the perpetrator is a minor) continue to comprise most of girls' arrests. The violent crimes committed by girls differ from offenses by boys. Girls are more likely to use knives, more likely to kill someone as a result of a conflict rather than during a crime, and more likely to murder or fight with family members. Current research on adolescent violence and delinquency considers how social class, race, ethnicity, and culture interact to cause young women to behave violently.  To serve young women effectively, programs must develop culturally sensitive, gender-specific approaches to intervention. A recent review of existing programs for girls suggests that three common elements combine in program success: (1) comprehensive counseling; (2) educational and occupational support; and (3) support for young women not able to remain with their families.

        "description":"This second annual report on the condition of U.S. cities outlines the challenges for cities if the United States is to reach its full potential in the 21st century. Data from many sources reveal three major findings: (1) cities are fiscally and economically the strongest they have been in a decade; (2) cities still face the triple threat of concentrated poverty, shrinking populations, and middle-class flight; and (3) cities face fundamental opportunity gaps in jobs, education, and housing. Urban schools are failing to prepare an alarming number of U.S. children to meet the challenges of the new high-technology economy, and minority children are paying the highest price. In addition, many urban schools have trouble recruiting and keeping teachers. Basic achievement is lagging,  and there are low graduation rates in urban high schools. School violence is concentrated in large urban schools, and many urban schools are literally falling apart. Some suggestions are made for urban school reform, including linking schools and universities and improving school facilities through School Modernization Bonds. Reducing class sizes, attracting teachers, accessing the information superhighway, and expanding before- and after-school opportunities and opportunities for lifelong learning are all necessary for school improvement. An appendix contains highlights for cities from the 1999 federal budget. (Contains 20 exhibits.) (SLD)",

        "description":"This is the third report from the evaluation of the Multicultural Education Program in Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania), a major effort to address racial and ethnic diversity in a middle school. Section 1 of the report provides background on the multicultural education movement and the aims of the Pittsburgh program. Section 2 describes the status of the program's challenges, presenting information on program implementation based on information from students, staff, and parents who are participants in the demonstration program. The third section describes the levels of implementation achieved and the implications of development to date. Seven program components have been developed to address the challenges of multicultural education: (1) conflict resolution; (2) cultural awareness; (3)  learning and teaching styles; (4) cooperative learning; (5) multicultural curriculum; (6) parent and community involvement; and (7) elimination of tracking. The evaluation found mixed results at the Prospect Center, the school at which the program was implemented, but substantial progress was made at the district level. Multicultural education continues to be a priority for the Pittsburgh Public Schools, but the responsibility for change resides mainly in the individual schools. An appendix contains a policy statement on multicultural education, and student, staff, and parent surveys. (Contains 13 figures and 32 tables.) (SLD)",

        "description":"The largest single federal investment in schooling, Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (P.L. 103-382) has provided supplementary resources to schools with large numbers of low-income students throughout the past three decades. In 1994 the program was reauthorized according to the Improving America's Schools Act (IASA), which carries with it a number of revised legislative expectations even as it increases the number of schools eligible to operate schoolwide programs. The new legislation expands opportunities for schools operating schoolwide programs to integrate their services, strategies, and resources to reform their entire educational programs. This document provides an overview of the legislative intent and expectation of the Schoolwide Program Provisions  of the IASA. Summary statements are given in shaded boxes, and these statements are followed by questions that administrators, teachers, and other school staff can use to reflect on their activities in the context of what is expected by the legislation. Information on basic programs and procedural components is followed by material about legislative expectations in the areas of: (1) student performance; (2) state standards and assessments; (3) curriculum and instruction; (4) professional development; (5) parent and community involvement; and (6) resource flexibility, system supports, and accountability.

The study is designed to develop a national database on program features, implementation requirements, and outcomes of Title I schoolwide projects in order to provide assistance to local schools with their own schoolwide projects. Initial findings from this study indicate that more effective schools are implementing the Title I schoolwide legislative expectations more faithfully than less effective schools. Teachers from more effective schools agreed that their schools were emphasizing high standards for all students and implementing instructional  practices to promote academic achievement. Parent responses were not as favorable, with parents who speak a language other than English or are bilingual tending to rate the schools lower in most areas. Classroom observations indicate that students predominantly meet in large groups and are usually independently working on-task. The difference in instructional interaction time for more effective and less effective schools is not statistically significant. (Contains one figure and three references.) (SLD)",

Latham, Patricia H. Latham) explores the legal rights of adults with specific learning disabilities in the areas of education and employment.

Local school districts generally develop and implement their own school-to-work programs, and the state provides oversight, technical assistance, and coordination activities (primarily through cooperative efforts involving the DPI, DWD, and WTCS). The University of Wisconsin is involved in the following areas of the school-to-work initiative: program transfer agreements;  competency-based admission process; teacher preparation; curriculum development; and research. In 1998-99, a total of $7.2 million in federal and state funds were allocated to state agencies for Wisconsin's school-to-work initiative. School districts, WTCS districts, and partnerships also allocated funds for the initiative. The initiative's tech prep programs are developed and implemented locally by tech prep consortia consisting of a WTCS district and all K-12 districts within the WTCS district's boundaries. Each consortium's tech prep program must include six components: articulation agreement; curriculum; inservice teacher training; counselor training; preparatory services; and equal access for special populations.

The study sample consisted of two cohorts of 24 students each (students entering MATC's associate degree nursing program in August 1995 and August 1996 and graduating in May 1997 and 1998, respectively). Each cohort was selected through a randomized selection process from the first-day applicants who fulfilled all the program's prerequisites for entry. The students' critical thinking skills were examined by having them complete the California Critical Thinking Skills Test (CCTST) before starting and after completing their program of study. The study  confirmed CCTST pre- and posttesting to be a viable means of assessing changes in students' critical thinking skills. One cohort exhibited a significant increase in critical thinking. Both cohorts manifested significant gains in their evaluation and inductive reasoning skills; however, neither cohort demonstrated significant gains in their analysis, inference, and deductive thinking skills.

Preliminary research indicates that workplace learning leads to higher academic achievement; reduced dropout rates; better attendance; better college preparation; and better results for African Americans. STW programs produce high-achieving, well-educated, dependable, motivated students who are more likely to become professionals that employers need to meet business challenges. The National Employer Leadership Council has worked with a voluntary group of eight companies to develop a way to define the aspects of return on investment and measure success. The companies have participated in STW programs  that focused on contextual learning designed to raise academic achievement. Each company has created and implemented a formal STW program collected data on costs and benefits and gathered experiences and outcomes to share with the public. The companies have achieved these quantifiable benefits: higher productivity of STW program graduates; reduced recruitment costs; reduced training and supervision costs; and productivity of students. Other benefits that did not show up in hard numbers are as follows: improved employee productivity and morale; favorable publicity; increased diversity; clearer focus; and stronger system for developing skilled workers.

Its goal was &quot;Participants will learn information to help students acquire accurate knowledge of Tech Prep programs to use when making class choices and career plans.&quot; Cooperative learning activities developed a student profile, prerequisite list, suggestions for application form improvement, and formal student interview schedule. Five major out-of-class assignments were classroom visit; student interview; inservice presentation; action plan development; and program design. Participants enjoyed the visit most; interviewed 23 students; rated inservice reception as highly positive, but liked it least; and found action plan development least helpful. Comparison  of the pre-post survey indicated counselors had a much better grasp of tech prep knowledge and felt much more confident about their role in sharing that knowledge. The post workshop survey of activities indicated participants wanted more activities and interaction with representatives from business, labor, teachers, students, parents. Four items on the expressed major concerns instrument were cited by 13 or more participants: potential employers &quot;buy in&quot; to tech prep; how to maintain academic and employer standards and get numbers for tech prep; college acceptance of curricular programs; and commitment from labor unions.

A facilitator reduced the size of the V-TECS instrument. The resulting document was tested using several colleagues of the principal investigator before it was used in the field. The sample was stratified in a specific way. Small business owners, site managers of franchises, and shift managers of larger firms were selected for the interview group. Opinions of persons new to management who had only recently risen from the ranks were of primary interest. From the original V-TECS material, 12 generic criteria emerged: developing an employment plan; seeking and applying for employment opportunities; accepting employment;  communicating on the job; interpreting the economics of work; adapting and coping with change; solving problems and critical thinking; maintaining safe and healthy work environment; demonstrating work ethics and behavior; demonstrating technological literacy; maintaining interpersonal relationships; and demonstrating team work. The survey of 57 items organized in the 12 sections was administered to 136 individuals (131 usable responses). A five-point Likert scale was used, with 5 as the highest ranking. Most ratings were generally high. Even the lowest rated item, assess entrepreneurship skills, received an above average rating of 3.27.

The study addressed the questions of whether schools that did not propose to adopt widely known or implemented reform models were able to design a reform process that met current thinking about effective reform as evidenced by the nine criteria specified for acceptable Comprehensive School Reform Demonstration (CSRD) applications. Of particular concern was the presumed lack of availability of technical assistance in the rural areas of the central United States served by McREL for alternative models compared to that typically provided by developers of nationally known models. Contrary to  expectations, however, an examination of CSRD applications submitted (56 funded and 109 nonfunded) suggest that sites selecting alternative models were not judged as lacking in planned technical assistance. Further study as CSRD programs are implemented in these schools will indicate the degree to which the applications match practice.

Scoring rubrics are descriptive scoring schemes that are developed by teachers or other evaluators to guide the analysis of the products or processes of students' efforts. Scoring rubrics are generally used when a judgment of quality is required, and they may be used to evaluate a broad range of activities. The evaluation of writing is a common use of scoring rubrics. Several types of scoring rubrics are available. The first distinction is between analytic and holistic scoring rubrics. An analytic scoring rubric allows for the separate evaluation of each factor considered in the evaluation. A holistic scoring rubric may be preferable when there is an overlap between the criteria set for the  evaluation of the different factors. Rubrics are also divided into general versus task-specific rubrics, and may be designed to contain both general and task-specific components. (Contains 12 references.) (SLD)",

The first step is to identify clearly the qualities that need to be displayed in a student's work to demonstrate proficient performance. These qualities will be the top level or levels of scoring criteria for the scoring rubric. Then the decision must be made whether the information desired from the evaluation can best be acquired through an analytic or holistic scoring rubric. The evaluator may then to choose to define the criteria for the lowest level of performance, and if desired, comparisons can be made between the criteria for each existing score point. Each score category should be defined using descriptions of the work rather than judgments about the work. To determine whether a scoring rubric provides  adequate descriptions, another teacher may be asked to use the scoring rubric to evaluate a subset of student responses. Differences between the scores assigned by the rubric developer and a second scorer will show how the rubric may be clarified further. There are many resources available to teachers who wish to use scoring rubrics in their classrooms. Some of these are listed, including the ERIC Clearinghouse on Assessment and Evaluation.

        "description":"This Digest introduces the advantages and disadvantages of three commonly used methods of reporting test score changes: (1) change in percentile rank; (2) scale or raw score change; and (3) percent change. The change in percentile rank method focuses on the increase or decrease of the mean percentile ranking for a group of students. This method has two main problems. The first is that calculating the mean percentile rank based on an individual's percentile ranks can provide an inaccurate estimate of a group's mean performance. The second is that, because of unequal intervals separating percentile ranks, changes in percentile ranks represent different amounts of growth at each point on the scale. A second method is scale or raw score change. The main drawback to this methods is  that when raw scores are used to determine change, it is difficult to compare change across tests with different score ranges. A third approach, that of reporting percent change, causes further distortion. resulting in a statistic that is difficult to interpret and misleading. All of these methods should be avoided when summarizing change in test scores. A separate Digest suggests better ways to summarize changes. (SLD)",

The results are reported in this document by school level: elementary, middle, and high school. Although 25% of Wake County's students are African Americans, only 17% of the returned high school forms were from parents of African American students. Overall, a lower percentage of parents in all categories and all schools returned completed surveys in 1999 than in 1997. Fifty percent of all elementary and middle school parents returned surveys, but only 35% of high school parents returned surveys. Although the decline in return rate from 1997 to 1999 is a cause for concern, the results of the 1999 WCPSS  survey are encouraging. Higher percentages of parents are agreeing that the school system is providing a high quality education and academically challenging their children. Comparisons of the WCPSS Parent Survey results with some of the most recent national surveys consistently indicate that parents have higher opinions about the quality of their own child's school than that of other schools in the area or public schools in general.

State mandates emphasize a measurement philosophy of education in which testing is the name of the game to determine how well students are achieving. One of the advantages of a state mandated curriculum is that the curriculum is aligned with the objectives of instruction for teaching. Students are asked to achieve at a higher level, and exit objectives are more likely to be stressed. However, the setting of objectives may be arbitrary in terms of students levels to be achieved. There are flaws in large-scale state testing, such as inadequate pilot testing or scoring errors. Test writers are at a distance from local classrooms, and standardized tests may not provide enough information  about what the individual student needs. The portfolio approach is a local effort at assessment that emphasizes the accomplishments of individual students. Using a portfolio allows the application of constructivist principles and the development of the curriculum internally within the school or classroom to reflect student needs and abilities. (SLD)",

Participants were 52 English-speaking students in Australia and 12 Chinese-speaking students in Hong Kong. For these participants, there were 383 records of scores. Although Difficulty typically used in previous cognitive load research, reasonably well reflected cognitive load, a Workload measure incorporating Difficulty, Incompetence, and Effort proved to be a better predictor of cognitive load.

To accomplish these goals, the study focused on the structural relationships of academic self-efficacy in five school subjects, allowing the exploration of four generality levels: general, academic, domain-specific, and subject specific levels of students' self-efficacy. Korean high school students (n=430 males and 470 females) responded to general self-efficacy, academic self-efficacy, and subject-specific self-efficacy scales. Students' end-of-year achievement scores were  used as a predicted variable. To examine the predictive power of academic self-efficacy expectation and the hierarchical structural relationships of differing levels of generality of self-efficacy, covariance structural modeling was used.

Guilford. The SOI program, developed by R. and M. Meeker, uses a combination of structured curriculum in the form of modules and an in-school SOI Learning Center to teach and develop important learning abilities for students. The SOI program focuses on 26 learning abilities claimed to be critical for effective learning. In year 2, 19 elementary schools in Oregon participated in the SOI pilot program and evaluation. The evaluation also studied 19 comparison schools that did not participate in the SOI  program. Data were collected through observation, surveys of staff, and qualitative evaluations through site visits. The evaluation focused heavily on the impact of the SOI program on students. In year 2, as in year 1, no measurable or easily identifiable benefits for students were detected. However, SOI specialists and technicians and most school administrators remained enthusiastic about the program, and most students seemed to enjoy the SOI Learning Center activities. Two-thirds of teachers surveyed believe that the SOI curriculum is helpful for student learning. Overall, the absence of SOI program effects, given the newness of the program and the difficulties of starting any new program, is not surprising. Some recommendations are made for increased accountability and program  improvement. Ten appendixes contain supplemental information about the SOI schools, some materials used in the evaluation, information about survey respondents and focus groups, and some data collection forms.

Advantages of including English language learners in the assessment program include increased school accountability for all students, a shared vision of student goals and standards, and an authentic picture of student learning. Assessment portfolios that include English language learners really can reflect assessment reforms. Among the drawbacks to the use of portfolio assessments that include English language learners is the fact that reliability is lower than for more traditional assessments, making comparisons more difficult. It is difficult to ensure standardized testing  conditions, and the cost of administering portfolio assessments is higher than that of many other forms of assessment. Portfolios also pose a scoring dilemma because of staff development and training requirements and the item required to score portfolios correctly. Developing and implementing a large-scale assessment portfolio that includes English language learners requires extensive planning and discussion and requires considerable resources. Some steps to developing and implementing such a program are outlined. (Contains 16 references.) (SLD)",

They include overcrowding, low test scores, and the problems associated with numbers of students who do not speak English well. Low student achievement is not necessarily due to ineffective teachers. A good evaluation system should measure actual teaching. Standardized tests do not really show enough about the quality of teaching. Some alternative assessments, based on a constructivist point of view, can provide better information about student achievement. Portfolio assessment is an approach that can reflect what students actually have learned. Both testing and portfolios have roles to play in student  evaluation. Adequate space and quality instructional materials are must-haves for schools before assessment takes place. (SLD)",

Personal variables would no longer function as effective mediators and context variables would then wield significant direct effects on student motivation. Participants were 392 freshmen from a girls' high school in Seoul, Korea who completed surveys early in the school year and in the second semester. Results show that effects from the context variables were  already strong on student psychology in the first few months of high school. Consistent with the initial hypothesis, these effects became stronger during the second semester.

Chapter 1 discusses why assessment is viewed as a powerful tool for education reform, what the shift from testing to assessment means, the choices educators must make, and the implications of using a standards model for large-scale assessment programs. Chapter 2 discusses the characteristics of ELLS, how language and culture affect how ELLs learn, and the hopes and cautions of assessment  reform for ELLs.

Four sources of data were used: (1) data on 39,140 prospective teachers who took the Praxis II examinations for teacher licensure; (2) data on the 152 postsecondary institutions these teachers attended; (3) data on 76 of the 152 teacher education programs at these institutions; and (4) SAT scores for 9,078 of the Praxis test takers who had also taken the SAT. Data indicated that higher education institutions that have teacher education programs vary greatly in background characteristics and average licensure scores of their students. Five characteristics of  institutions and programs were identified as conducive to higher teacher licensure scores. Private institutions outperformed public ones, and universities outperformed colleges. Teacher education programs with a higher number of traditional students outperformed those with fewer such students. Teacher education programs with ethnically diverse students outperformed those with overwhelmingly white faculties. Institutions with large proportions of education majors and minors and large proportions of their budgets devoted to teacher education performed worse than institutions with small proportions of education majors and minors and small proportions of their budgets devoted to teacher education. Findings show that teacher education programs are neither uniformly successful nor uniformly  unsuccessful. (Contains 9 figures and 25 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"The balance between conformity to state standards and creativity in providing for individual differences in the classroom is discussed. With the current emphases on accountability and standards, learning opportunities for students are supposed to be aligned with state-mandated objectives. This may lead to a situation in which rote learning, memorization, and teaching to the test make up the curriculum. Some principals feel that the measurement movement is objective, that it provides a meaningful indicator of learner progress in school, and yields data for parents and guidelines about what should be taught. In contrast, some principals, who are more subjective, believe that teaching is an art that involves creativity. Taking a constructivist point of view, these principals  emphasize that student work can be analyzed with remediation efforts following in teaching. The use of portfolios fits well with the philosophies of principals who emphasize constructivism. Regardless of the approach taken by the principal, it is vital to be involved in curriculum development and accessible to help teachers in the classroom. (SLD)",

        "description":"The implementation of a plus/minus system of grading to replace the traditional A through F grading system for graduate students was studied at a midsize Midwestern university. Decimal equivalents were established to enable the computation of grade point averages (GPAs) that reflected the dispersion of grades through the plus/minus system. A survey was administered to graduate faculty to assess their perceptions of the effect of the plus/minus system on graduate grades, and the analysis was based on 250 responses. Then an analysis of the graduate GPA in the first three graduate courses for 4,944 master's level students who were enrolled under the A-F system was compared to that for 3,144 students enrolled after the implementation of the plus/minus system. Students perceptions  before the implementation of the system held a measure of truth in that GPAs did decline, especially in some academic areas. The most conspicuous decline was in the number of \"A\" grades awarded. Faculty perceptions of the effects of the plus/minus system varied by academic area, with sharp differences among faculty in different disciplines. Faculty members did not tend to think that the plus/minus grading system helped the weaker students, but they did think that the stronger students got higher grades as a result of the new system. Implementing the new system was expensive in terms of dollars and work hours. Overall, data point to clear differences in grading philosophies among the academic disciplines.

The study was based on E. D. Hirsch's theory that having a strong foundation of core knowledge in one grade is necessary for growth and the understanding of new and more complex information in the upcoming grades. A student who does not have the core knowledge in one grade could struggle as he or she becomes more and more &quot;informationally deprived&quot; (D. Rogner, 1997). The study, which evaluated 38 sixth graders, did reveal correlations between the core knowledge and mathematics and reading achievement scores. The majority of the students in this sample seemed to have a low level of core knowledge for their  grade. The question is asked if some problems, such as poor daily performance, low achievement scores, and discipline problems, can be related to students' having a low level of core knowledge.

ACT Assessment were studied and compared to results from other states and the United States as a whole. The highest combined number of Texas public school graduates ever (113,807 or 61.8%) took either the SAT I or ACT before or during 1998-1999, meaning that a greater number of Texas students than ever before sought external feedback about their academic readiness for college through these tests. Performance, as measured by the combined number of tested graduates achieving either SAT I total scores of 1110-1600 or ACT Composite scores of 24-36 (30,901 students) was highest in 1999. The percentage of SAT I- and ACT-tested graduates scoring  within these higher ranges on either test was 27.2% in 1999, a 2.2 percentage point gain since 1991. African Americans, Hispanics, Whites, males, and females showed similar trends in overall improvement since 1991. The numbers tested have increased since 1998, but the state's mean performance has held steady at 20.3 on the ACT Composite and has been virtually the same at 993 for the SAT total. The percentage of all Texas SAT takers completing 20 or more academic course credits continued to increase, as did the percentage of ACT takers completing an ACT-SAT I defined core set of academic courses. Thus, the most general suggestion for strengthening SAT I and Act test performance overall, or students' academic readiness for college, is to focus on improving the academic preparation of all  students while encouraging testing participation.

Maryland was one of two states chosen for a similar analysis; the other, North Carolina uses an assessment composed entirely of multiple-choice questions, while the MSPAP is entirely constructed-response questions. The panel concluded that the differences found between the MSPAP and the NAEP at grade 8 along the content dimension are not sufficient to account for the magnitude of difference between  proficient performance on the Maryland test and proficient performance on the NAEP. Neither are the slight differences between the Maryland test and the NAEP test at grade 8 along the cognitive dimension sufficient to account for the magnitude of differences between proficient performance on the Maryland test and proficient performance on the NAEP. The panelists offered three possible reasons for the discrepancy: (1) differences in stakes or consequences between the two tests; (2) the connections between the test and instruction; and (3) the standards-setting processes used.

Most principals and teachers indicated that they were moderately or very familiar with the purpose, content, and format of the MSPAP, and most were familiar with the MLOs. Most students, who represented two &quot;on&quot; years (grades 5 and 8) and two &quot;off&quot; years (grades 4 and 7), indicated that they were familiar with the purposes of the  MSPAP. The majority of principals and teachers indicated that both mathematics procedural knowledge and problem solving were assessed by the MSPAP to a moderate or great extent, and most felt that the emphasis was appropriate. The majority of teachers (82%) indicated that MSPAP had a moderate or great impact on their classroom activities, and that this impact increased over the years. Most fifth and eighth grade students indicated that the use of MSPAP-like tasks in their instruction helped them answer the MSPAP tasks. Analyses of student performance over time showed significant differences in MSPAP school performance in 1997 and in MSPAP gains from 1993 to 1997. Findings also show that schools for which teachers reported that MSPAP had greater influence on their instruction had greater  MSPAP performance gains.

The final study sample consisted of 90 elementary and middle schools. Using growth models estimated within a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework, several factors from each of these dimensions were observed to explain a significant amount of the variability in school performance. These factors as well as the design of evaluations that hope to study the impact of assessment programs on students, teachers,  and schools were discussed. Instruction-related variables were found to explain differences in MSPAP performance levels across the subject areas, and for some subject areas, to explain differences in rates of change in MSPAP performance over time. In addition, the perceived impact of MSPAP on instruction/assessment practices was also found to significantly explain either differences in MSPAP performance levels or rates of change over time across the subject areas. Findings suggest that the design of a validity or impact study could be improved by measuring the outcomes chosen for this study concurrently with assessment performance over time.

        "description":"Maryland participated in the State National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) in 1996 and 1998 when samples of approximately 2,500 fourth and eighth graders in 100 schools participated in the testing sessions for mathematics (1996) and reading (1998). This report is an initial attempt to return information to Maryland about the relations between the state assessment and State NAEP data. This initial prototype report, versions of which are tailored to individual participating states, contains six sets of tables: (1) correlation of school mean state assessment and NAEP scores; (2) NAEP subscale weights in accounting for state assessment results; (3) differential sensitivity of the two assessments' results to poverty; (4) differential sensitivity of the two assessments'  results to minority status; (5) differential sensitivity of the two assessments' results to urbanicity; and (6) percent of NAEP-proficient students in high, medium, and low scoring schools. At the school level, most statewide reading and mathematics assessments have been moderately or highly correlated with NAEP assessments of the same subject matter. NAEP and statewide assessments measure similar achievement gaps between rich and poor schools, and they agree in the finding that in a few states the gaps are noticeably smaller than in other states. This initial report is issued as a prototype because there are many sources of variation in the relations among test scores. Overall, however, the results are encouraging. An appendix contains a list of state assessment measures used in this  report. (Contains 16 tables.) (SLD)",

This report explores differences in survey design and execution that may have contributed to the discrepancies between the estimates for the October 1994 Current Population Survey Education Supplement (CPS:Oct94) and the National Household Education Survey, Parent and Family Involvement/Civic Involvement component of 1996 (NHES:96). Data for the CPS:Oct94 came from household sampling that includes two interviews and six telephone follow-ups for each family surveyed. The NHES:96 was a random-digit dial telephone survey. Differences in sample coverage and response rates are discussed. Missing data are not likely to affect the CPS:Oct94 estimate greatly, but the effect of the lower NHES:96 household  response rate cannot be estimated. Observational errors can be introduced by data collection procedures, survey instruments, and respondents. The impact of data processing errors should also be considered, but, in fact, the potential direction and magnitude of estimate differences could not be predicted for most of the methodological differences between the two surveys. The study raises research questions that should be examined to ensure accuracy in estimating the numbers of home schooled students. Appendixes contain technical notes and standard error tables.

It relates to student membership in public schools and school districts in the United States and outlying areas during the 1998-1999 school year , and to revenues and expenditures for fiscal year (FY) 1997. The 100 largest public school districts, representing less than 1% of all school districts in the United States were responsible for the education of 22.9% of all public school students. These districts employed 20.6% of U.S. public school teachers and accounted for 16.6% of all public schools and 18.9% of public high school graduates. The 100 largest school districts had larger school sizes than the average school district  and higher mean pupil/teacher ratios. Three states, Florida, Texas, and California, accounted for about 40% of the 100 largest school districts. The proportion of minority students in these districts was 66.9%, compared to 38.8% in all school districts, and 52% of students in these districts were eligible for free and reduced price lunch, compared with 38% of students in all school districts. In FY 1997, current expenditures per pupil in the 100 largest school districts ranged from a low of $2,902 in Puerto Rico to a high of $11,578 in the Newark School District, New Jersey. While the numbers of students, teachers, and schools has increased between 1988-1989 and 1998-1999, the proportion of the national total that the 100 largest school districts comprised was essentially unchanged.

As part of this initiative, one local authority, Aberdeen City, has introduced Baseline Assessment on entry to primary school with a follow-up assessment at the end of Primary 1 (P1) stage. Analysis of the assessment data at the beginning and end of P1 makes it possible to evaluate the effectiveness of the EIP. Levels of attainment of literacy and numeracy varied considerably for these students, but their attainment tended to be lower if they were younger than average, had English as a second language, came from relatively poor families, or lived in areas of multiple deprivation. On  entry to P1 there was no evidence of gender differences in attainment of literacy or numeracy, but gender differences emerged during P1. By the end of the first year, girls had made more progress in reading and less progress in mathematics than boys. Inequity in literacy increased during P1, and students from disadvantaged backgrounds made less progress than others. Inequality in numeracy decreased during P1, with some evidence of catching up by students who started with relatively low attainment in mathematics. (SLD)",

The report also shows that different methods are used to count dropouts at the school district and state levels. The Advisory Committee on Civil Rights also received information about the use of waivers to exempt Hispanic students from taking the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills. The school district claims that exclusion is for the benefit of limited English proficient students, but community advocates claim that the waiver is  a form of discrimination that targets Hispanic students and does not allow the school district to assess their educational potential properly. Several presenters at the forum recommended that the number of bilingual teachers and bilingual school personnel be increased, the curriculum be improved, and that there should be more parental involvement, with the removal of barriers that hamper communications.

The welfare legislation placed a lifetime ban on TANF and food stamp benefits for convicted drug felons, although states were allowed to opt out or modify the ban if they chose. This study attempts to evaluate the issue and project the likely impact on needy families in San Francisco, CA, where the state has not only opted into the federal provision, but has also excluded those who are disqualified from TANF by the federal ban from receiving state General Assistance benefits. According to the assessment, the drug felony provision will unquestionably  have a disproportionate effect on women, the majority of adult TANF recipients, and the new provisions will also be systematically biased against racial minorities. It will increase state costs, especially for foster care and criminal justice, and it will result in decreased treatment opportunities for convicted drug addicts. A survey of the practices of other states shows that 32 opted in, 8 opted out, and two modified the provisions in some way. Five states excluded those convicted of drug sales, but not possession, and two states allowed TANF and food stamps for drug felons, with payments made to a third-party vendor. Recommendations are made to ease the impact on San Francisco families, centering on modifying the ban, changing prosecution policies, and granting local public assistance  to parents excluded from the state program.

This report, inspired in part by recent school shootings, attempts to place the question of school violence and its accompanying reactions in a larger statistical and legal context. Data from several government agencies were analyzed to compare the real risks children face in school to the distorted image reported by the media. A survey of recent policy changes at the state and national levels shows the new security measures being taken in light of the shootings at Columbine High School. The study also analyzes recent case law concerning school  violence, concluding that there is no discernible trend by either federal or state courts to impose liability on school districts where children are injured or killed at the hands of other students and third parties. The findings actually suggest that administrators may risk liability if they act too impulsively to exclude youth from school without proper due process protection. The report also considers the efficacy and impact of excluding large numbers of mainly minority and disabled children from schools. National data is reported where possible, with a more in-depth look at states like Maryland and Massachusetts and school district data indicative of national policy trends. Recommendations highlight the practices researchers say will work to reduce school violence. (Contains 3 figures  and 111 endnotes.) (SLD)",

This bill would blur the distinction between juvenile and adult criminal systems, making it easier to imprison children as young as 14. Supporters of S-10 were citing statistics to indicate that juvenile crime was on the rise. In fact, the bill, if passed, would place teens arrested for robbery in the same conditions of confinement as runaways, closer to adult felons in county jails. This report analyzes data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation to show that most children being arrested are arrested for petty crimes, and that violent offenses among youth are not increasing. In fact, the Attorney General announced in October 1997 that juvenile crime was on the decline.  According to the findings of the report, the approach pending before the Senate is too far removed from the current context of juvenile crime to meet the needs of U.S. children and the wide social need for public safety.

        "description":"Using a review of the literature and national longitudinal data on 1,087 youth aged 11 to 17, this study investigated whether religious commitment reduces drug use among poor urban teenagers. Standard multivariate statistical analysis of data from the National Youth Survey (1997) showed that inner-city adolescents who were more religious were significantly less likely to take drugs than other young people living in the same neighborhoods. Highly religious youth living in urban neighborhoods were less likely to use illicit drugs than nonreligious youth living in suburban neighborhoods. This study indicates that the degree to which being religious decreased a youth's probability of using illicit drugs decreases the older a teenager becomes. Youth who had good family relations, did  well in school, had nondrug-using friends, and possessed antidrug attitudes were even less likely to use illicit drugs when they were also religious. The effect of religious commitment among poor urban teenagers was statistically significant for all categories of illicit drugs, including hard drugs.

From 1978 to 1998, teenagers showed a major decline in arrests, while young adults showed a minor increase, and adults aged 30 years and older showed major increases in felony arrests. Different population groups showed sharply different rates of felony arrest. Among white teenagers, murder rates and trends resembled those for adults, but murder rates among Black, Latino, and Asian youth showed large cycles with sharp increases in the early 1980s  and early 1990s. The analysis of official crime statistics shows that today's teenagers are not more criminally prone than past generations. The popular claim that the rising teen population means more crime and violence is a myth. An appendix contains two tables of California arrest rates. (SLD)",

A telephone survey was conducted by Opinion Research Corporation to determine public opinions about the provisions of S-10. A national probability sample of 503 men and 504 women, aged 18 and older, was surveyed. Survey results show strong public opposition to some of the most important elements of S-10. Respondents overwhelmingly opposed housing juveniles in adult jails, jailing status offenders with adults, sharing arrest records with prospective colleges, expelling students for smoking cigarettes, and granting prosecutors exclusive jurisdiction over whether juveniles should  be tried as adults. Respondents also strongly supported setting aside funds in the new act specifically for juvenile crime prevention programs. (SLD)",

The analysis focuses on approximately 7,000 students who finished their schooling by 1988 and for whom there were valid test scores, transcripts, and data from the 12-year followup survey. Findings provide no direct evidence that taking mathematics and science courses affects earnings. Analysis results do show some indirect effects, in that there is evidence that taking relevant courses improves later skills as measured by test scores. Recent evidence from other sources suggests that skills are an increasingly important determinant of earnings.

        "description":"Using data from the National Corrections Reporting Program, this study examined trends in imprisoning drug offenders in the United States, focusing on the numbers of incarcerated drug offenders and the relationship between incarceration for drug use and rates of drug use. Overall, the increase in drug admissions to prison from 1986 to 1996 is astonishing. In 1996 there were nearly four times as many admissions as only 10 years before. Increases in incarceration for drug use far surpassed increases in commitments for other nonviolent and violent offenses. The growth in drug commitments has been disproportionately borne by blacks. Even in the states with a decrease in commitments for drug use, Hawaii and West Virginia, the decrease has been entirely attributable to a decrease in  white incarceration. From 1986 to 1996, there has been a 291 percent increase in the rates at which young people were incarcerated because of drug involvement. Little connection has been found between drug incarceration rates and drug use. In spite of the massive increase in drug admissions to prison for young people, a recent study found that drug use among high school students increased in the 1990s, with twice as many high school students reporting the use of cocaine. Faced with the increasing numbers of people incarcerated for drug use and the human and economic costs they reflect, states are beginning to experiment with ways to address substance abuse without unnecessary imprisonment. Among these propositions are reform initiatives in Arizona and New York that provide substance abuse  treatment to nonviolent offenders in place of incarceration.

It also examines change in CPS enrollment patterns that may be related to the development of new magnet schools and magnet school policies. The report begins with a brief history of magnet school policies and a description of Chicago's magnet schools and programs. Data from 32 of the 47 elementary schools that the CPS calls magnet schools are used in this report. The next section describes the location of magnet elementary schools, enrollment patterns at these schools, and changes that have occurred since the implementation of the comprehensive magnet school policy. High schools are examined  in the third section. The report concludes with implications for access to magnet schools suggested by population growth patterns over the last several years. Findings show that students in the wealthiest sections of the city have access to many more magnet schools than other families in Chicago, with the least access available to Latino neighborhoods and very low-income African American areas on the South Side of Chicago. African American students must travel farther, on average, than other students to attend the highest achieving schools in the city. Findings also show that many magnet elementary schools do not meet the desegregation goals of the Desegregation Consent decree for CPS. (Contains 42 figures.) (SLD)",

The study investigated how child care patterns differ by the age of the child, family income, race and ethnicity, parental time available, whether the mother works traditional versus nontraditional hours, and by state. The report uses data from the 1997 National Survey of America's Families to investigate child care patterns for children aged to 12. Of the nonparental child care arrangements, before- and after-school programs and relatives are the most commonly reported among 6-to 9-year-olds, with 21% of children in this age group in each of these  forms of care while the mother is working. Five percent of 6-to-9-year-olds have self-care as their primary child care arrangement while the parent is working, and overall, 10% of children in this age group regularly spend any time in self-care. Like younger children, a significant percentage of 10-to-12-year-olds rely on relatives as the primary caregiver (17%), but smaller percentages of these children are in before- and after-school care. Twenty-four percent of the children in this age group have self-care as their primary form of care while the mother is working, and 35% of children in this age group regularly spend any time in self-care each week. Children from lower income families spend more time in their primary child care arrangement each week. In the younger age group, Black  children are more likely to spend time in before- and after-school programs than Hispanic children, but, among 10-to-12-year-olds, White children are twice as likely as Hispanic children and almost three times as likely as Black children to use self-care as the primary form of care.

        "description":"This document addresses frequently asked questions and issues and promotes greater understanding by administrators, teachers, and parents of the potential benefits of education standards for the rapidly increasing population of students whose first language is not English. The standards movement challenges educators and the public to understand that high standards are as important in education as they are in other professions. Standards define what is essential for successful performance and encourage people to strive for the best. Setting high standards for all students means that the quality of education offered the best and the brightest should be the quality of education available to all. However, varied and innovative instructional strategies will be essential to enable  students with diverse needs and varying levels of English proficiency to learn at high levels. To effect these strategies, the United States will need highly skilled teachers who can offer a range of learning opportunities that connect to different learning styles, some of which may be culturally based, and also provide the necessary accommodations and supports that enhance student learning. Initial test scores are an important foundation for identifying where current curriculum and practices do not promote high standards of learning for all students, and where curriculum improvement and staff development are necessary if equity in learning is to be achieved. Three appendixes contain tools to assist educators in implementing policy, practice, and professional development: a discussion of  professional development to support standards, a discussion of assessment that supports standards based learning, and guidelines for determining the appropriateness of performance assessments for students from diverse backgrounds.

In operation since 1988, the Haitian Literacy Program is the longest running high school literacy program in the region for bilingual students with limited formal education. Through a case study approach, the educational success of these students and the program traits that staff and students believe have enabled academic achievement, high school graduation, and participation in higher education are examined. The program is designed for secondary school students with less than a fourth-grade level of formal education or no literacy skills in their native language or English. It is an intensive, self-contained program  focused on developing the skills needed to participate in bilingual education classes. In its 9 years of operation, the program has averaged 20 students each year. Data were collected through case study and collaborative approaches from document reviews, ethnographic observations, interviews, and focus group discussions. Key elements of program success were identified as: (1) the commitment and dedication of the native language teacher; (2) the relationship between English as a second language and native language teachers and instruction; (3) the interdisciplinary, thematic, and self-contained instructional format; and (4) the self-determination of the students.

This digest describes some of the ways that PDSs can improve the school experiences of urban students. It also describes some of the pitfalls of PDSs. In the area of general school support, a PDS has the advantage of the presence of additional personnel who can perform many useful functions. The professional development the university professors offer inservice teachers and the integration of organized service programs in PDSs also benefit schools. One possible challenge is that improving education in the participating school may not be the primary goal of the university partner,  given its mandate to educate its own students. An important aspect of the PDS model is the action research that can enhance instructional strategies. Another advantage of a PDS is the infusion of a multicultural perspective into learning. The parent and community involvement that are planned for in a PDS become important elements in school improvement. The information in this digest is geared to guiding schools that are considering a PDS partnership.(Contains 11 references.) (SLD)",

Computer and Internet access varies widely across the United States, with better educated people, those with more money, and whites more likely to have Internet access. In the early years of the Internet, schools with lower concentrations of poor students and suburban schools were more likely to have Internet access, but by 1996 all schools were equally likely to have Internet access. Urban schools, however, remained more likely to have more students per computer with Internet access. Underserved communities are gaining access to the Internet, but there are four significant content deficiencies for these  communities: (1) lack of local information; (2) literacy barriers; (3) language barriers; and (4) lack of cultural diversity in Internet material. Public policies and private initiatives are attempting to expand affordable access to information resources in both homes and communities.

The percentage of U.S. citizens living in poverty declined to 11.8 percent in 1999, the lowest poverty rate since 1979, as poverty rates for people aged 65 and over, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and people living in the South fell to all-time lows. The poverty rate for children dropped to 16.9 percent. Median household income rose to a new high in 1999. The reduction in poverty was concentrated in U.S. cities, with 81 percent of the decline in poverty occurring in urban areas. Some points of concern are still apparent. Census data show that while the number of poor children has fallen markedly, those who remain poor have, on average, grown poorer. Poverty rates remain high for  certain groups of children and families. The striking reduction in poverty and the improvement in the median income in 1999 appear to be due primarily to the continued robust performance of the economy. The effects of low unemployment and rising wages on low-wage and minority workers highlight the significance of policies that maintain low unemployment rates as well as policies that help restore the value of the minimum wage.

Efforts to serve these fathers through Temporary Assistance for Needy Families welfare-to-work grants, and demonstration grants are also discussed. According to the NSAF, 2.6 million nonresident fathers have family incomes below the poverty line, and most of them face multiple employment barriers, including a criminal record, lack of a high school education, relatively little recent work experience, and poor health. Although these employment barriers are similar to those faced by poor custodial mothers, poor nonresident fathers are  significantly less likely than poor custodial mothers to participate in training, education, and job search activities as well as income security programs. Given that Congress expects poor nonresident fathers to contribute financial support to their children, it may want to consider making employment services and work-support programs more available to poor nonresident fathers.

The support changes in this bill would allow more of the child support collected from noncustodial parents (the majority of whom are fathers) to reach the children on whose behalf the payments are made. It would ensure that once a family left welfare, the family would have first claim on all child support paid by the father, rather than having child support go first toward the debt to the state. The bill would also create incentives for states to allow families to benefit from child support paid on their behalf. The fatherhood  provision of the bill would provide funding to community-based and state programs working directly with low-income noncustodial parents. H.R. 4678 includes a number of provisions that would be beneficial to low-income children, families, and noncustodial parents. These provisions represent an investment in stronger families that should make child support easier to administer as states become empowered to integrate collection and distribution of child support with welfare reform strategies.

The interdisciplinary gathering gave professionals a chance to sense, as well as discuss, issues of deprivation among students. Conference participants representing various disciplines explored how they defined and assessed problems of deprivation and disadvantage. It was hypothesized that the syndrome of deprivation and disadvantage is universal, with stylistic features that deprived people display universally. Among the topics discussed in the wide ranging sessions were questions of creativity,  culture, communication, what it means to be disadvantaged, theories of learning, and issues related to educational equity.

        "description":"This report presents findings from the evaluation of the second year of the professional services agreement between the Detroit, Michigan, Public Schools and Sylvan Learning Systems, Inc. Under a contract with the school system, Sylvan attempted to improve the reading achievement of low-achieving students in 10 Title 1 schools. The program operated in seven elementary schools, two middle schools, and 1 middle/high school. The program agreement specified 72 hours of reading instruction to each of 1,433 students identified as having the greatest need for such services. Each of the school principals indicated that he or she would continue the Sylvan instruction if given the chance. Teachers' responses to the program were mixed. Students received considerably less than the contracted  number of hours of service. Although 2,805 students participated to some degree, only 532 received 55 hours of instruction or more from one administration of the state standardized test to the next administration of the test. Overall, 49.3 percent of grade 1 students in Sylvan schools cored at or above grade level in reading, while 45.3 percent of students in a comparison group scored at or above grade level. Three of the seven participating schools had an increase in the number of students in the &quot;satisfactory&quot; category of the fourth grade test. Because of the positive responses of principals, it is recommended that the program be continued for the duration of the contract, but additional monitoring is recommended to increase the number of hours of instruction delivered and adjust them  as needed.

        "description":"This study examined the role of Title I in 18 secondary schools (9 intermediate and 9 high schools) that serve disadvantaged students, are engaged in comprehensive school improvement efforts, and have consistently high or improving student achievement. The study was prompted by the changes to Title I under the 1994 Improving America's Schools Act. The schools in the study reflect geographic and racial or ethnic diversity and use varied approaches to school improvement. Data were collected in 3-day site visits, with interviews with administrators and instructional staff. The schools relied on three major strategies to improve and maintain the quality of teaching in their classrooms: (1) providing teachers with multiple opportunities to expand their professional expertise; (2)  instituting school accountability systems that require students to demonstrate their intellectual growth; and (3) using data collection and analysis to guide the school's decisions. The larger middle schools and half of the high schools created smaller learning communities to combat the impersonality of the large schools. They attempted to engage students in the life of the school, offered support services for students, and made strong efforts to involve parents. For the schools in the study, Title I provided valuable academic assistance, and, although Title I played a limited role in supporting other elements of schoolwide improvement efforts, it did not impede such efforts. District Title I coordinators exerted minimal control over the schools' use of Title I resources. The findings  show that if federal policymakers want Title I to play a prominent role in promoting higher standards and improved achievement in secondary schools, they will have to find ways to give the program more leverage in the schools. Implications for federal, state, and local policies are discussed. (Contains 21 references.) (SLD)",

Because the scholarships were awarded through a lottery, the evaluation allowed for the conduct of a randomized experiment in which students were randomly selected for a treatment (scholarship) group and a control group. As reported by parents, the schools attended by scholarship students were smaller than the schools attended by public school students. Private school parents were less likely to report serious problems such as fighting, absenteeism, and racial conflict at their children's schools.  Students in private schools were asked to complete more homework than students in public schools. On standardized tests, students offered scholarships generally performed at about the same level as students in the control group. African American students offered scholarships scored about three points higher than similar students in the control group, and the impact of going to a private school for two years for African American students was four percentile points. No impact was seen for Latino students. Overall, findings suggested that the difference between the scholarship group and the control group remained about the same over the two years. About 62 percent of the students offered scholarships used them for two full years, and 12 percent used them in the first year but not the second.  24 percent of students offered the scholarships refused them. The most frequently cited obstacles that prevented parents from sending their children to the preferred school included cost (35 percent), transportation problems (14 percent), and lack of space at the school (10 percent). Findings show that 40 percent of parents who switched from public to private schools gave their schools an A; less than 10 percent of similar parents in the public schools gave their schools an A. Five appendixes contain discussions of baseline characteristics for the treatment and control groups, sample weights, the analytic approach, supplemental data, and estimates of ever attending a private school.

        "description":"This report provides data on the current educational condition of Hispanics from early childhood through graduate and professional education. It also offers strategies for multiple sectors, parents, schools, communities, the private sector, and the government, to improve Hispanic educational achievement. The majority of policy decisions on education are made at the state and local level. However, the President's Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for Hispanic Americans also recognizes the role of the federal government in eliminating the educational achievement gap among Hispanics and other groups. Hispanics today are the youngest population group in the United States, and they represent approximately 15 percent of the U.S. K-12 population. It is expected that by 2050,  Hispanics will represent approximately 25 percent of the population in the United States. Though the Hispanic population continues to grow, its educational achievement lags behind that of the rest of the United States. The differences in preparation between Hispanics and non-Hispanics become evident before kindergarten and continue through high school and college. The multiple factors that have caused the educational achievement gap between Hispanic students and their peers require multiple solutions. A concerted action plan must begin with a sense of urgency and the recognition of the vested interest and responsibility of all sectors to improve the education of Hispanic youth. The following factors are essential: high academic standards and the necessary resources to enforce those  standards; experienced and qualified teachers; recognition and use of the diverse cultural and linguistic assets of Hispanic students; parent involvement; a culture of success that promotes high expectations; and financial and other support services to make postsecondary education accessible to Hispanic students.

The study analyzes how court-mandated remedies were implemented and seeks to determine what role public engagement played in these reforms. Some have suggested that a general skepticism and lack of confidence in reform in Colorado have delayed funding reform, coupled with such obstacles as strict limits on public spending and a strong desire for local control. Nevertheless, the combined effects of two lawsuits have brought some reforms to the state's school finance system, even without a major victory for the plaintiffs. One suit, &quot;Lujan v. Colorado State Board of Education,&quot; addressed spending disparities among school districts. Although the plaintiffs lost this case, it was evident that the Justices of the  Colorado Supreme Court agreed on the necessity of changing the state's educational finance laws. &quot;Hafer v. Colorado State Board of Education&quot; alleged a denial of adequate, rather than equal, educational opportunities under the state's revised educational finance law. There is also growing recognition that a statewide dialogue on education finance is critical. The latest legal challenges, especially &quot;Giardino v. Colorado State Board of Education&quot; with its focus on school building construction, may bring about this dialogue. (SLD)",

Rodriguez&quot; in 1973. A generation ago this decision was regarded as a major setback to education reform because, faced with stark inequities in the funding of education for poor and minority children in Texas, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to order relief and declared education not a &quot;fundamental interest&quot; under the federal Constitution and that poor children did not constitute a &quot;suspect class&quot; entitled to special judicial scrutiny. One reason the Supreme Court did not rule in favor of the &quot;Rodriguez&quot; plaintiffs was that there were not &quot;judicially manageable standards&quot; for  developing effective solutions to the problems. The search for judicially manageable standards has provided a potent legal initiative to ensure educational adequacy. The fact that legislatures and state education departments have developed clear criteria regarding the skills children will need to function productively as citizens in contemporary society has allowed courts to perceive more easily the core adequacy goals in the state constitution education clauses. In recent years a synergy has developed between education reform initiatives and judicial formulations of adequacy requirements that is resulting in the development of a concept of adequate education that may provide genuine opportunity for all students.

Cox (1997) were used in the creation of a teen leadership program in Fort Worth, Texas. With support from several sources, the Texas Agricultural Extension Service in Tarrant County created 4-H Youth for Community Action (4-HYCA), an after-school leadership development program targeting teens in three inner-city middle schools. The program provided opportunities for inner city youth to learn and practice leadership skills in a service-learning environment. The program used an experiential model to teach youth leadership skills. Program leaders met weekly with each group of students for 12 weeks. Participants were asked how they perceived their knowledge level prior to the program as part of  a posttest. The use of experiential activities combined with service learning proved to be a successful model for teaching leadership skills to these students. The students also successfully carried out three significant community service programs in their neighborhoods. Students from two sites painted houses of elderly women, while students from the other school repaired an area of erosion in a park. The model used in the 4-HYCA program is one that can be implemented in any youth-serving organization. (Contains 12 references.) (SLD)",

Differences between urban public and military high schools concerning these variables were also examined. Participants were 102 high school students from an urban public school and 94 students from an urban 4-year military high school. The study revealed relationships among humanistic control behavior of teachers, robust classroom climates, and student self-control. Differences in control behaviors and classroom climate were found between urban public and military high school classrooms. However, no differences were found in students' self-control between urban public and military high school classrooms. (Contains 6 tables and 41 references.) (Author/SLD)",

States also have the option to count a portion of the cost of a child care tax credit toward their &quot;maintenance of effort&quot; requirements under the TANF program. There is an important limitation on using welfare finds for child care credits, however. Federal regulations require that any tax credit financed under the TANF program must be &quot;refundable,&quot; one that gives a family a payment when the credit amount exceeds a family's tax liability. The regulations specifically provide that welfare funds may be used only for the portion of a credit that exceeds a family's tax liability.

        "description":"In 1996 the Chancellor introduced Performance Driven Budgeting (PDB) to the New York City schools. PDB is a form of decentralized budgetary decision making intended to provide local educators with increased control and flexibility over the use of resources. The plan established a framework of goals and principles, outlined a phased-in implementation, and called for outside funding for an evaluation. This first year evaluation, from the inception of PDB in September 1996 through August 1998, focuses on how and to what extent the conditions necessary for the successful implementation of PDB are being created in the districts and the central office. The second and third annual reports will assess the level and effectiveness of schools' implementation of PDB. The critical feature of  PDB, linking budgeting to improvement in instruction and student performance, distinguishes the approach from other school-based budgeting approaches being implemented in the United States. In this first year, surveys were completed by 87 planning team members from PDB elementary schools and 16 team members from non-PDB schools and 44 team members from PDB high schools. Significant changes were apparent at the central level, with purposive activity attempting to link and integrate many traditionally fragmented operations and functions apparent centrally and in the schools. Strong leadership and a sustained focus will be needed to implement changes at the school level as the program progresses. Six appendixes describe current and proposed policies, give details of planning team interviews,  and explain how to use the PDB Web Conference Center. (Contains 3 charts, 31 tables, and 4 figures.)

        "description":"This report reviews the second-year implementation of the New York City public school system's Performance Driven Budget (PDB) initiative. The Galaxy budgeting system that is part of the PDB initiative generates a school's budget from its table of organization, and then derives district and Central budgets by aggregating all school budgets. After 2 years of implementing PDB in New York City, the outline of a radically different budgeting and instructional improvement system may be emerging. While the first year's evaluation focused on the conditions for implementation, the second year evaluation documents and analyzes the effectiveness of PDB design and implementation at Central, district, and school levels. Information from a number of data sources indicates that the central  office and districts and schools have begun to create the school-driven, instructionally focused budgeting system that the PDB planners envisioned. There is some evidence that the changes have begun to have some effect in PDB district and schools. The findings of the second year evaluation are based on the assumption that changes in seven areas of policy and practice must occur in order for the successful implementation of PDB: movement of authority in budgeting, personnel and instructional planning to the school level; restructuring of resource allocation to support instructional planning and budgeting; improvement in the provision of demographic and outcome data to schools; development of the capacity to support school-level planning and budgeting; creation of more participatory  decision-making structures at the school level; establishment of effective accountability in PDB districts; commitment to a system-wide culture that supports school decision-making and improvement. Three appendixes provide supplemental information about PDB. (Contains 21 charts and 25 tables.) (SLD)",

These districts have from 6 to 10 years experience in site-based budgeting. The study is based on interviews with reform office staff and budget office directors, as well as principals, teachers, leadership team parents and staff members, district budget trainers, and external training program directors and trainers. Training materials and training evaluations were also examined. Descriptions of the programs in the three cities resulted in the identification of five key practices for model training: (1) institutional support for site-based  decision making; (2) comprehensive training and information programs; (3) accessibility of training; (4) understandable training and materials; and (5) external training and technical assistance. The lesson that can be drawn from New York City is that the task is large and requires good decision making and substantial amounts of time. Training for all parent and community members is critical, and trainers need to help school leadership teams review all their schools' resources. (SLD)",

Most of the 22 instructors who submitted the study's body of student writings (n=114) provided their students with some sort of written feedback, and most of their students incorporated that feedback into their subsequent drafts. Instructors tended to focus most on standardizing their students' written output, with measurable success. Student papers received little feedback about content or organization, and these qualities generally did not change over successive drafts. Despite the proliferation of reform programs targeting urban schools, classroom teachers may  need more support to improve the skills and knowledge necessary to implement reform practices in the teaching of writing. The present study could help focus these reform efforts by helping teachers improve the quality of their feedback on student writing at both the elementary and secondary level.

        "description":"This report illustrates how poverty rates in the United States vary by selected characteristics: age, race and Hispanic origin, nativity, family composition, work experience, and geography. The estimates in the report are based on interviews with population samples. The Current Population Survey each March interviews approximately 50,000 households across the United States. Findings indicate that the poverty rate dropped from 12.7% in 1998 to 11.8% in 1999, the lowest rate since 1979. The poverty rate for people under age 18 dropped from 18.9% in 1998 to 16.9% in 1999, also the lowest rate since 1979. Poverty rates and the number of poor declined for every racial and ethnic group. Poverty rates have fallen below or equaled the lowest rate ever recorded for each group except  whites. Four-fifths of the net decline in the number of poor occurred in central cities within metropolitan areas, where only 29 percent of all people, and 41 percent of the poor lived. In seven states and the District of Columbia the poverty rate declined significantly. Using different methods to measure poverty, however, changes the perception of who is poor. Four experimental measures show standardized poverty rates to be lower for children and people in female householder families, and higher for the elderly and people in married-couple families than under the official poverty measure. Three appendixes discuss technical aspects of the surveys and estimates. (Contains 23 tables and 6 figures.) (SLD)",

Each state qualifies to receive an amount of federal funds under the CCDF each year and can receive additional federal funds by spending state dollars for child care subsidies and quality initiatives. Federal law established requirements that states must meet to receive CCDF funds, but states have very broad discretion in many of the basic design features of their low income subsidy programs and quality initiatives. It is estimated that about 1.5 million children receive CCDF-funded child care subsidies each month. To  be eligible, a child must be under 13 years of age (or older if physically or mentally incapable of self-care). The child must reside with a family in which income does not exceed 85% of the state's median income for a family of the same size. To be eligible, a child must also reside with a parent(s) or legal guardian(s) who are working or attending job training; or a child must receive, or need to receive, protective services and resides with a parent(s) or guardian(s) who are not working or receiving job training.

Data are presented on a variety of measures of nonmarital childbearing, including numbers, rates, and percents of births to unmarried women. Most of the data are from the National Vital Statistics System, but additional data are from the National Survey of Family Growth, the U.S. Census Bureau, and other national surveys. After rising dramatically in the half century from 1940 to 1990, out-of-wedlock childbearing leveled off, or slowed its rate of increase, in the 1990s. Many factors contributing to the long-term  changes, as well as more recent trends are described. These include changes in marriage patterns, sexual activity, contraceptive use, and abortion. The experience of the United States is put into context with data on nonmarital childbearing for other industrialized countries.

        "description":"This report contains a compendium of the opinions and concerns of a task force that researched current conditions that affect court-involved youth and identifies the most promising strategies for connecting court-involved youth to the labor market. The report includes three introductory chapters, four chapters related to task force discussion areas, and eight appendixes. The first chapter provides information about court-involved youth and the challenges in developing programs and systems that meet their needs. The second chapter provides information about the structure of the juvenile justice system. Information about the structure of the workforce development system is summarized in Chapter 3. The fourth chapter provides an overview of youth and the labor market. The fifth  chapter suggests strategies for linking youth in juvenile justice system programs to the labor market and presents an overview of issues related to youth development, exemplary practices, and promising programs. The sixth chapter summarizes strengths and weaknesses of the juvenile justice, work force development, education, social services, community-based support, and labor market systems that affect the delivery of services to high-risk youth. The final chapter makes recommendations to assist policymakers to meet the needs of court-involved youth for work force preparation. Eight appendixes list task force members, forecast employment trends, provide contact information for local and state labor contacts, list additional programs, define terms, and provide contact information for  programs, funding sources, and current initiatives in youth development, policy-making, juvenile justice, education, and work force development.

Using the data collected from 2,507 end-of-course surveys of students in the Graduate Studies in Education program at Indiana Wesleyan University, analyses were run to test for correlations between the independent variables (19 instructional strategies) and each of 10 dependent variables (10 meta-skills). The three key findings of the study were the following: (1) instructional strategies clustered into four identifiable composites, each supported by a current and credible educational theory; (2) the curriculum composite of instructional strategies strongly correlated with reported attainment of all 10 meta-skills; and (3) the assessment  composite of instructional strategies correlated with reported attainment of no meta-skills. The study concluded that curriculum and assessment are essential components of any educational program and require substantial resource investment and attention to design, and that direct meta-skill instruction should be a component of courses offered in formal adult education programs.

Data were from an additional set of questions on the Australian Bureau of Statistics' 1993-94 Agricultural Financial Survey and an interview survey of 65 Tasmanian farmers. Findings indicated that farm businesses that had no one in the management team with education to year 10 level were least likely to make a change to their practice; 68 percent of farm businesses that participated in training in the past year and 39 percent of non-training farm businesses had made a change to practice in the past 3 years; farm businesses with a low level of education were over-represented in the group that identified no training  events as worth attending; 31 percent of farm businesses in the lowest education category and less than 10 percent of farm businesses with higher education attended no training events and planned no training in the next 3 years; farm businesses that trained and made changes to practice had a higher average gross operating surplus; prompts for change were (in descending order of importance) other farmers, training events, family, and staff; and almost two-thirds of Tasmanian participants in three survey classes made at least one change to practice as a result of attending a course.

        "description":"A study identified some implicit concepts, knowledge, and skills that a seemingly standard adult literacy and numeracy &quot;lesson&quot; contains. Conversation analysis was used to show instances of how adult numeracy is embedded in adult language and literacy. The &quot;conversation&quot; was a transcript from an adult literacy class for long-term unemployed adult men that began with a recall segment about question and answer patterns. Two types of questions were compared: those occurring &quot;naturally&quot; as part of the &quot;common sense&quot; made during the classroom conversations and those asked as part of the instructional content of the lesson appropriate to the subject matter of mathematics. Analysis showed how language and literate practices in the adult literacy classroom created the reality that adult  learners come to recognize as the subjects mathematics or numeracy. Two implications were explored. First, considerable differences between school mathematics and real-life numeracy raised the dilemma of what should be taught. Second, embedding of language with particular sets of valued &quot;content areas&quot; caused teachers to reproduce school-based practices and discourses for adults who had already experienced school failure and implied that literacy and numeracy teachers be trained in language interaction patterns and ways for teachers and adult students to manage them to achieve an identified purpose.

The focus was on beef producers undertaking training in quality assurance (QA). Analysis of observations of QA process on three case study farms and examination of Cattlecare (the QA program developed for the beef industry) manuals suggested skills required to access QA. Findings indicated the following: (1) numeracy skills required for the non-chemical handling parts of Cattlecare were mostly arithmetic; (2) chemical mixing and administration involved more complex tasks; (3) Cattlecare manuals had a higher readability index than farming and popular newspapers and magazines; and (4) many Cattlecare  forms were at the more complex end of the structure spectrum. The knowledge required to access QA was identified. These two possible reasons were suggested for failure to proceed with QA: the relatively high level of literacy and numeracy skills required and the high cost of necessary changes and accreditation. Underpinning the whole question of access was that farmers had to first value learning as important. Numerical and literacy activities were not prerequisites for learning about QA. Development of self confidence was shown in the values stage of learning. (Contains 25 references.) (YLB)",

Findings indicated non-metropolitan Australia is diverse in terms of population density, educational experiences of the population, occupation, and industries for employment. Rural people were less likely to have post-school qualifications, participate in post-school education and training, be employed, and be a professional working in manufacturing, property and business services, or finance and insurance. Rural people were more likely to have left school early, be unemployed or out of the labor force, work in small business, be self-employed or an employer,  be a laborer or have other low-skilled occupation, and work in agriculture, forestry and fishing, mining, construction, or tourism. The following seven issues demonstrate differential impact or need further research: local involvement in planning; thin markets; cost of training and measurement of cost and effectiveness; flexible delivery; no tradition of VET or history of valuing education; quality and availability of trainers and assessors; and community sustainability, social capital, and the value of VET to communities.

        "description":"Research into indicators of learning occurring in e-mail discussion groups investigated how to maximize factors that enhance learning and networking using e-mail and how to minimize factors that inhibit learning using this medium. Data from a range of e-mail discussion groups formed the basis of the research, with focus on e-mail discussion that supports informal learning contexts. These three professional development groups were followed: organizational development and learning (Group A), primary and high school administrative issues (Group B), and women's health (Group C). Five days of discussion and three topics per group were analyzed to explore how communication was being mediated and managed. Findings indicated the prevalence of challenge in the interactions among members  in all groups. Group A exhibited a consistently positive outcome from the challenges. Features contributing to this outcome included high moderator involvement; a climate of respect, support, and consideration for the other members; minimum of personal attacks; successful clarification processes; and a discussion that progressed and developed. Factors that contributed to an increase in dissonance in Groups B and C and to lack of progress and positive development were individual misunderstandings and misinterpretations of a previous post and spending more time on restating opinions rather than discussion.

        "description":"A project has been designed to identify how a non-metropolitan community consolidates and develops sustainable social and economic activity. For many authors, the political position reiterating vocational education and training (VET) as the pivotal contributor to building national economic sustainability is framed in terms of human capital imperatives, economic rationalism, and corporate managerialism. Contemporary research on VET's value or outcomes often focuses on industry outcomes or particular activity rather than value to its wider community. The project would examine whether models of vocational provision constructed to service one sector, as opposed to mutualities of sectors, may mitigate against attempts by non-metropolitan communities to reposition themselves  economically and socially in an increasingly globalized economy. A more inclusive definition of VET may be appropriate to more accurately describe the true value of VET activity and its benefits to communities in their quest for economic and social sustainability. The research method combines the focused interview process with open-ended questions. The sample consists of two strata: those employed in 17 industry groupings delineated for benchmarking performance in VET in Australia and those affiliated with community groupings operating in the study community.

The research used a focused interview process with open-ended questions with these 2 major sub-groups in the community and explored their interrelatedness: 2 people employed in 17 industry groups delineated for benchmarking performance in vocational education and training (VET) and 1 person affiliated with groups of community organizations. Sources of learning in these three contexts were explored: in recent paid work, in community activities, in home activities. Respondents rated the value to them of these five sources of learning: at school, through post-school qualifications, through work,  outside of work from involvement with community groups, and associated with home activities. Findings indicated nonformal and informal learning contributed to a substantial proportion of an individual's learning. Formal learning through schooling and post-school qualifications were assigned a relatively lower value. While 46 percent of VET graduates regarded VET qualifications as of high or medium usefulness, trade qualifications and higher level awards were more highly valued. Regarding their most important skill, 47 percent named empathy for others and 42 percent named communication skills. (Contains 19 references.) (YLB)",

        "description":"Changes in the nature of work have resulted in a significant loss of employment opportunities for Australian youths. Since the 1980s, the Australian government's perspective on the problem of youth unemployment has moved from emphasis on job availability to emphasis on individual job readiness. A 1999 Tasmanian study of early school leavers and their attempts to gain employment confirms the disjunction between the world of work and the educational experiences of youths who leave school after completing compulsory education. For the 63 Tasmanian youths studied, the pathway to work was not easy. Many reported negative experiences in their job searches, and many viewed themselves in a no-win situation as welfare officials pressured them to find employment without providing them with  any meaningful assistance in doing so. However, the respondents did not perceive all attempts to assist them negatively. Those who participated in short training programs emphasizing generic skills and knowledge in specific areas of work generally considered the programs beneficial. Vocational training programs with no waiting periods were seen as key to easing the Tasmanian youths' transition from school to work. It was recommended that the issues of youth unemployment, forging school-business partnerships, and revising existing curricula be revisited. (Contains 13 references.) (MN)",

        "description":"The methods used by Australian farm managers to obtain the skills and knowledge needed to manage their businesses were examined. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 85 farm owners/managers from South Australia, the Northern Territory, Queensland, Tasmania, and New South Wales. The farmers interviewed identified a wide range of learning sources in the following categories: (1) training (formal and nonformal educational activities); (2) people who are not part of a training activity (other farmers, acquaintances, employees, consultants, and other experts); (3) print, audio, visual, and electronic media; and (4) experience and observation. Most farmers consulted multiple learning sources before altering their management practices. The sources for learning varied  according to the purpose of the learning. Training was used relatively more often by those changing their methods of keeping records. All 85 businesses surveyed had used knowledge or skills gained from participation in at least one organized education or training activity in their farm management practices, including when making changes to their practices. However, people were the most frequently cited learning source for all changes, including new enterprise and record-keeping changes. Women were more likely to report learning from experience, whereas men were more likely to use organized training activities as a learning source. (Contains 22 references.) (MN)",

A 31-item questionnaire, called the Professional Development Kit Needs Assessment, was distributed to each 466 adult education programs nationwide (five survey packets per program). The mailing of 2,330 questionnaires yielded 423 usable responses (response rate, 18%). The survey revealed a striking degree of similarity between the preparation and experience of adult basic education, General Educational Development, and English-as-a-second-language teachers. Nearly half those surveyed stated that the primary purpose of  professional development activities should be to provide teachers with classroom techniques that they could use immediately. The respondents' highest professional development priorities were as follows: add to instructional skills, add to knowledge of teaching adults, improve knowledge of how people learn in content areas; learn to incorporate technology into instruction; learn how other teachers conduct their practice; and improve classroom management skills. Eighty-eight percent of respondents believed that they made the correct decision when deciding to become an adult education practitioner. (The bibliography lists 19 references.

Whereas most past studies and practical applications of MI theory have focused on learners in grades K-12, recent projects are extending MI to adult education. For example, Shearer has published an adult version of his instrument for measuring MI. In the adult version, three assessments of intellectual style have been added to the scales for the eight intelligences. Much of the work on MI for adults addresses the following areas: (1) adult literacy learners and adults with learning disabilities who may have experienced early schooling failure by being labeled by earlier, more limited conceptions of  intelligence; (2) use of MI in the workplace to increase creativity and productivity by enabling workers to use their strengths; and (3) the connection between MI and multimodal learning using technologies such as the World Wide Web. MI theory is not prescriptive, and adult educators must use their own experience to decide how to apply it.

        "description":"Incidental learning is unintentional or unplanned learning that results from other activities. It occurs often in the workplace, during the use of computers, and in the process of completing tasks. Incidental learning occurs in many ways, including the following: through observation, repetition, social interaction, and problem solving; from implicit meanings in the classroom or workplace policies or expectations; by watching or talking to colleagues or experts about tasks; and from being forced to accept or adapt to situations. Incidental learning is situated, contextual, and social. It is thus characterized by those features that are considered most effective in formal learning situations. Incidental learning can result in improved competence, changed attitudes, and growth in  interpersonal skills, self-confidence, and self-awareness. Not all unplanned learning is effective, however. Because incidental learning is often not recognized or labeled as learning by learners or others, it is difficult to measure and harness for use. Adult learners often do not distinguish between formally and incidentally acquired learning or prefer incidental learning opportunities to formal ones. Several researchers have examined the issue of how educators can help learners make incidental learning outcomes explicit.

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine the effectiveness and efficiency of federally funded work force development programs, such as employment and training programs. Information, including budget data for fiscal years 1999 and 2000, was gathered on federally funded employment and training programs for which a key program goal is providing assistance to persons trying to find employment or improve their job skills. Information on the groups of individuals these programs target, the services each program provides, and possible areas of overlap was also obtained. In addition, researchers sought the type of information needed to assess whether these programs are duplicative and inefficient and raised issues to be considered in developing options to improve the efficiency of federally  funded employment and training programs. The study identified 40 federally funded employment and training programs for which a key program goal is providing assistance to persons trying to find employment or improve their job skills. The 35 programs that provided data on how funds were used indicated that $11.7 billion funded work force development activities and that 6 of these programs accounted for nearly two-thirds of the $11.7 billion. Thirty-three of the 40 employment and training programs served primarily a single target group, and most of them offered participants a wide range of employment and training services. Programs overlap when multiple agencies administer programs that are designed to achieve similar outcomes, creating the potential for administrative inefficiencies and  duplication of, or gaps in, service delivery. The study recommended more coordination and cooperation among programs to eliminate duplication of efforts. (The report includes information on each of the programs and comments about the report from the departments of Education, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Labor, and Veterans Affairs.)

        "description":"Again today, as 40 years ago, the idea of setting standards for career and technical education (CTE) has come to the fore. CTE practitioners have learned some lessons about implementing standards, among them that there is no \"standard\" standard; instead, there can be a confusing variety of standards. An analysis of standards reveals that there are content standards that state what learners should know and be able to do, whereas performance standards describe how well learners should know or be able to do something. Standards can cover these three general types of knowledge and skills: (1) technical standards that cover the knowledge and skills workers need in different jobs; (2) academic standards that cover traditional school subjects; and (3) employability standards that cover  thinking, problem-solving, communication, interpersonal, and technology skills and personal qualities, such as responsibility and integrity. Technical standards can be divided in these three ways: industry core standards, occupational family standards, and occupationally specific standards. Practitioners must validate the set of standards to ensure that they are relevant to the local situation. The validation process should include all key stakeholders, use appropriate methods of review, and pilot test and refine standards. Once validated, standards can be incorporated in the CTE curriculum. In addition, academic and CTE standards should be \"crosswalked\" in order to show how academic skills are used in occupations. Financial and policy support are needed to implement standards. (Contains  14 references.) (KC)",

        "description":"The process of assessment in career and technical education (CTE) is changing significantly under the influence of forces such as emphasis on assessment for individual and program accountability; emphasis on the investigation of consequences of assessment; emergence of item response theory, which supports computer adaptive testing; and pressure for authentic assessment by critics of standardized testing. The use of technology for assessment is being increasingly stressed. Potential advantages of computerized assessment include rapid feedback, money savings, enhanced security, more curriculum time, and capability to track process-oriented variables. Potential disadvantages include costs of equipment, personnel, and training; increased marginalization of groups based on ethnic or  socioeconomic status; and missed opportunities to implement authentic assessments. Examples of applications of technology to evaluation in CTE include test design, item creation, presentation, item scoring, and location (through use of the Internet). In moving toward computerized assessment, consequences should be considered in line with current evaluation and validation models. Especially for policy makers and administrators, implementation is an important aspect of computerized assessment. Technology can support the broad changes in assessment that are ongoing as a function of internal and external scrutiny, and both authentic as well as traditional assessment can benefit from technology.

At its direction, a series of focus group inquiries were conducted into issues surrounding the development of a system of professional credentialing. Requirements varied widely in 13 states found to have some form of mandatory credentialing process; options were available in most states with credentialing programs. Essential elements were identified. Focus group discussions identified these three major challenges in instituting a credentialing system: ensuring that all adult education systems are learning organizations that engage in meaningful, transfer-centered professional development; providing consistent, accessible opportunities for professional growth; and  providing the systems and resources for professional development that meet the needs of the field and produce the improvements in student performance that credentialing is intended to serve. Recommendations included BA/BS degree minimum; required new instructor orientation program; standard requirement of professional development activity; reward for participation in professional development; database for recording professional development compliance; and hold-harmless provision to retain current instructors. Next steps were public input and establishment of an advisory group to develop a plan for gradual institution of credentialing. (YLB)",

Five procedures were used to complete this product. First, a literature review was conducted that assisted in the development of the product validation criteria. A review of benchmark studies for program effectiveness provided direction in the evaluation instrument completion. Second, basic education staff held a series of investigatory meetings at which demographic trends affecting the ABE program were outlined. The information obtained that was used to develop the validation criteria for the PEI. Third, the formative committee refined the  validation criteria, which included monitoring and screening data, indicators of program quality in ABE, and development of the PEI. Fourth, all criteria considered critical in an effective PEI were measured as a standard against the developed PEI. The PEI was determined to be appropriate for the intended use. Fifth, the PEI was presented to the summative committee, which validated that the PEI met required criteria and was appropriate for the ABE program's evaluation process.

        "description":"A relevant question for educators is how adult learning and education can cultivate change with individuals and groups. M.D. Hohn (1998) identifies four types of change: change by exception, incremental change, pendulum change, and paradigm change. A change agent tries to bring about a change deliberately. The change process is transformative, is political, involves learning, and takes place over a period of time. Adult educators frequently act as change agents. Literature describing the change process and the learning that occurs as part of it uses terms or describes processes associated with adult learning, particularly transformative learning. Reflection is another term associated with both adult learning and change. The political aspects of change, including power, are also  topics in adult learning. Because a change agent deliberately tries to bring about change, some adult educators may feel conflict in helping adults become aware of how society is structured and how their own experiences have been shaped by such factors as gender, race, and class. As Stephen Brookfield (1995) believes, the teacher of adults has the responsibility to help learners become critically reflective and think of themselves as individuals capable of taking action and changing the world. The adult educator who assumes the role of change agent should pay attention to the context; be prepared to be proactive; attend to learning; and build in action. (Contains 18 references.) (YLB)",

It tells the story of how FSWW created the idea of developing a microcredit project; describes project management, goals, and geographic areas involved in the project; profiles the project participants; and explains why the women need loans, what they spend them on, and how they cope with running a household and a business at the same  time. Clear benefits from and barriers to the project are analyzed. The paper concludes by addressing these topics: some of the issues women face; outcomes for FSWW; what has been learned; what the FSWW experience can offer others in the field; and the future direction of FSWW in the field of microcredit. Appendices contain a list of project landmark dates and data tables. (KC)",

A &quot;search engine&quot; is an application used to query existing information on the WWW. The three types of search engines are computer-generated indexes, directories, and meta search engines. Computer-generated indexes (or web-crawlers or spiders) seek sites that contain words that match search terms. Directories are lists of selected sites organized according to topic. A meta search engine searches other search engines. Two sites that provide up-to-date comprehensive information on search engines are Search Engine Showdown and Search Engine Watch. One tool in the WWW that can quickly help in narrowing the long list of  potential search engines is Noodle Quest. Based on the results of research conducted by the author on five searches, HotBot and Google appear to be fairly good search tools to use when in a hurry to find a few relevant sites related to a given training topic. However, other large search engines such as Fast, iWon, and AltaVista, are not included in the experiment. Furthermore, new and more powerful search engines continue to be developed (Virtual Search Engines). (YLB)",

Data sources were published statistics on growth of non-standard work; research on reasons for the growth and the business and training practices of organizations that use non-standard labor; case studies of 8 organizations in New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland using non-standard labor; and individual life histories of 16 non-standard workers. The study found that 58.8 percent of the work force is employed as permanent employees; most growth is in casuals and contractor forms of employment; and employer disincentives to investing in training are  related to cost. Findings from case studies and life histories indicated many non-standard workers would prefer more ongoing, certain employment; levels of non-standard employment were rising; and employers using labor hire or outsourcing have tried to shift the burden of training on the labor-hire firm or outsourced service provider who are trying to minimize any investment in training. Stimulating employer expenditure on training was proposed. Case study evidence pointed to the need for the VET sector to target the non-standard work force.

Following a literature review, stage 1 data collection involved observations and interviews in 18 enterprises in New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia where trainers were facilitating learning with one or two employees/learners. Five key functions and 32 trainer actions were identified and formed the nucleus of stage 2, a telephone interview survey of 350 workplace trainers. Findings indicated penetration and impact of workplace trainer competency standards were low; informal workplace training was very common; there was a high incidence of trainer actions related to encouraging self direction in learning in employees and structuring and shaping  processes to accommodate learning; frequency of many trainer actions in the workplace was significantly mediated by context-specific factors; the majority of trainer actions did not directly match competencies in the training packet; and only very few respondents reported that juggling working and assisting others to learn was not an issue. Learning network theory provided a useful framework for rethinking the role of the workplace trainer. Implications relevant to the National Strategy for VET were concerned with quality of training provision, building a training/learning culture, and further research.

Part I provides an overview of key contextual changes influencing development of policy for building a learning culture in the countries; sets out the approach adopted towards culture; indicates major themes in the interaction between contextual imperatives and culture in the countries; and gives an overview of general approaches to policy coordination as background to specific policies adopted. Part II analyzes two dominant themes in the general directions for policy in building a learning and training culture: building infrastructure, partnership, and community and developing active access strategies in  a lifelong learning perspective. Part III focuses on five policy areas significant in national strategies to build a learning and training culture that relate to ensuring that foundations, incentives, information and marketing, role of technology, and private sector practices are linked. Part IV is a summary of main findings and implications for Australia that point to the need for a new phase in vocational education and training development that addresses the imperatives of the new economy, strengthens linkages between VET and other sectors of education and training, and has an overall demand-side orientation in policy.

        "description":"For more than 20 years, Arizona's Maricopa Community College district has aggressively invested in and experimented with technology to improve teaching, learning, and the management of college and district services. However, Maricopa's leaders have acknowledged the ephemeral nature of its achievements in these areas and the need to keep reassessing their relationship to technology. Leaders in higher education are faced with the following competing views of the future of technology in education: (1) the future as cyber-freedoms (a model that is derived from the Internet and assumes that individuals can communicate in their own time, under their own conditions, and with everyone everywhere); (2) the future as collectives (a view defined by the special interests that drive policy  direction and become more important than schools, governments, or universities); and (3) the future as media (a view based on the supposition that the media shapes global attitudes, causing our multicultural world to become increasingly monocultural). As new waves of technological change and competing views of the future continue to approach, Maricopa's leaders are continuing to reassess its relationship to and use of technology. Maricopa is currently orienting its technology future in two strategic directions: Internet-based software architecture and distributed learning systems. (MN)",

        "description":"As in other countries, older adults in Australia could benefit from acquiring information technology (IT) skills in many ways, including improved access to information on health issues and development of the skills needed for employment in high-demand IT-related occupations. The research on adult learning and the problems faced by many older adults when using IT suggests several strategies for meeting the learning needs of older adults seeking to learn about and use IT. Knowles' work on how adults learn can provide insight on how older adults learn. Designers of workstations to be used by older learners using IT should be aware of age-related differences in older adults' cognitive function. Having younger students assist older people with IT can be a rewarding experience for both  groups. Older adults tend to have had little exposure to the constructivist learning experiences that promote development of the problem-solving and independent learning skills needed to engage in lifelong learning. The introduction of digital television into the home is an opportunity for Australia to address this problem at the national level. This technology will make it possible to customize materials so that they can be presented to older adults in meaningful and practical ways. (Contains 12 references.) (MN)",

Special attention was paid to the following areas: features of HE institutions in the 21st century; the relationship between the state and HE institutions; curriculum development in support of learning for the workplace; flexible, open, and distance learning; technology and learning; the corporate university; and virtual education. The following were among the main conclusions reached: (1) HE policymakers and managers must base their policy decisions on forecasts of the skills needed in the workplace; (2) education providers must aim to bring equality of access to learning and encourage the state to  fund installation of the infrastructure and new technologies needed to extend education to wider communities; and (3) policymakers and mangers wanting to provide their communities with wide, affordable access to learning must look to new technologies with the potential for mass education, including virtual universities based on the creation of partnerships offering courses and learning materials that have been developed by other institutions and subsequently awarding their own credits/degrees by assessing students' prior learning of the materials.

        "author":["Lochhead, John"],
        "description":"Thinkback is a new instructional process that uses &quot;thinking aloud&quot; strategies developed by Arthur Whimbey and derives its name from the technology of instant video playback. Thinkback is a generalization of techniques described in the program &quot;Problem Solving and Comprehension,&quot; which has been used for more than 20 years. The key element of the program is Thinking Aloud Pair Problem Solving (TAPPS), a process wherein a listener asks questions that probe the problem solver's thinking. The Thinkback technique spans the gap between unstructured constructivist-style instruction and lock-step memorization drills, and it can convert a teacher-centered rote memory lesson into an intellectually challenging student-centered exploration while simultaneously maintaining specific content  mastery objectives in areas such as mathematics, language arts, social studies, or science. Thinkback can also be used to add subtle structure to an open-ended creative exercise, thereby allowing students at all ability levels to benefit from the exercise. Before students begin the TAPPS process, they are presented with a model case consisting of dialogue between a problem solver and a listener. As a student gains experience, the listener's questions become increasingly probing. The process culminates in reflective thinking, the ability to listen to and follow one's own thought process.

The course has evolved based on student and instructor evaluations. The businesses proposed by course participants have targeted industrial, commercial, consumer, and government markets and have been based on the development and sale of products such as the following: hardware, software, systems, chemicals, biomedical products, biologicals, consulting services, and instrumentation. Class members  have included engineering students (juniors and seniors), faculty, professional engineers and scientists, and retirees. Many class members have been professionals whose advanced degrees did not prepare them for entrepreneurship. Some course completers have started their own businesses or used the techniques taught in the course within larger businesses. Some businesses planned in the class have incorporated and had sales. One course participant started a company that now has offices in other countries. (An abbreviated copy of a syllabus recently used for the class is appended.) (MN)",

Nevertheless, as a medium for delivering lifelong learning, the Internet is still fraught with the following problems: (1) learning not tailored to meet individual learners' needs in a culturally specific manner may be ineffective; (2) because English is the predominant language of the Internet, many learners who are not native English speakers cannot make full use of the Internet; and (3) learning materials may need to be redesigned for the online environment. A group of New Zealand educators who have  offered education via the Internet since 1995 and who now have major mirror sites in Belgium, Brazil, Finland, Canada, and South Africa, offer the following lessons to educators seeking to embrace lifelong learning on the Internet: (1) interaction is a key ingredient in the learning process; (2) providing feedback is an essential element of learning on the Internet; (3) offer courses in learners' native languages; (4) abandon the concepts of copyright and ownership; and (5) when designing courses, seek a balance between investment and change by designing courses for obsolescence.

The model was aligned with national standards encompassing the formal qualifications for four certificates in office administration. Since 1997, the model has combined the positive aspects of traditional classroom structures with the benefits of new technologies to enhance the model based on the following principles: (1) development of an appropriate technological infrastructure; (2) development/enhancement of training materials specifically designed for online delivery; and (3) implementation of workplace training plans. The Web site of the  course for administrative and clerical workers contains four key areas as follows: course information; an orientation area; a course resources area; and a communications area that supports informal interaction between students and staff while minimizing intrusion into the workplace. South West TAFE's course coordinator/administrator took the following actions to ensure successful implementation of the flexible delivery model: (1) analyze (review students' histories to identify appropriate entry points); (2) design (develop customized workplace training plans); and (3) implement (contract the professional staff).

        "description":"Changing conditions in the global market have necessitated that students be taught to adopt new knowledge by understanding it in depth and having it spontaneously available for use in the real world. All students, especially those in science and technology, must learn to construct new meanings and understandings independently by restructuring experience through reflection. A pedagogy promoting development of these abilities must be initiated in early childhood and continued throughout higher education. This pedagogy must be based on utilization of the following items: learners' knowledge about their own ways of thinking; learners' self-control and self-regulation; and learners' beliefs and intuitions. Students must be given opportunities to engage in reflective abstraction and  construct new meanings for themselves by using the following metacognition skills: judgment (the ability to see particular cases or situations as parts of a greater whole and select relevant approaches to given problems); understanding of the relevance of their existing knowledge, skills, and experience; and analysis and synthesis (the ability to put experience into appropriate and meaningful mental categories). Learners must engage in &quot;situated cognition&quot; that draws on the culture of people actually working in the field (thus putting them in a position similar to that of apprentices).

        "description":"The Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Minnesota developed a new engineering design curriculum to meet the pedagogical needs of undergraduate and graduate engineering students and to excite and retain engineering students of both genders and from all backgrounds. The curriculum is based on a series of guided, hands-on experiences and significant collaboration with industry. The cornerstone of the undergraduate program is a new introduction to engineering course that teaches through product dissections and creative hands-on activities. At the graduate level, teams of business and engineering students undertake product development projects in collaboration with sponsoring companies. The resulting level of interaction between the university and industry has  been shown to benefit students, faculty, and partner companies without requiring the expenditure of significant university resources. The curriculum's designers offered the following lessons for others considering similar programs: (1) engineering and business must lead the program equally; (2) creating appropriate confidentiality and intellectual property policies and agreements takes time and requires considerable negotiation between company and university lawyers; (3) the course's formal academic component should center on learning a product development process; and (4) close geographic proximity between company and university leads to greater company-university interaction.

A framework for open, flexible, and distributed learning has been developed to provide guidance in designing, developing, implementing, and evaluating instructional and training materials on the Web. The proposed framework is based on eight interrelated and interdependent dimensions and associated subdimensions as follows: (1) pedagogical (content, goals/objectives, design approach, methods and strategies, organization, instructional medium, evaluation); (2) technological (infrastructure, hardware,  software); (3) interface design (page and site design, navigation, usability testing); (4) online support (instructional/counseling support, technical support); (5) management (maintenance of learning environment, distribution of information); (6) resource support (online resources, offline resources); (7) ethical (social and cultural diversity, geographical diversity, learner diversity, information accessibility, etiquette, legal issues); and (8) institutional (academic affairs, student services). The proposed framework is said to have the potential to provide guidance in designing Web-based learning materials; reviewing Web-based instruction and training courses; organizing resources for Web-based learning; designing comprehensive authoring systems; and designing distributed learning  systems, virtual universities, and cyberschools.

The curriculum was based on materials posted at the Internet sites of universities in the United States, United Kingdom, and Malaysia itself. The new curriculum calls for 3 or 4 years of study (depending on whether students enter the program before or after earning the equivalent of the United Kingdom's General Certificate of Education A-level). In accordance with the Malaysian government's policy of producing graduates with the English skills needed to compete in the international arena, the curriculum's language of instruction is English (except for certain subjects such  as social science and humanities). Because Malaysian employers have expressed interest in engineering graduates who are well-rounded and who possess a multidisciplinary, systems perspective, the curriculum calls for a mix of mathematics and social sciences, humanities and social sciences, engineering and design, and free electives). The extended program calls for an additional 30-32 credit hours, inclusive of technical electives and courses in ethics and professional responsibilities. The model allows students to plan their own program with minimal supervision and includes provisions for international exchange or internship during the extended year. (MN)",

The program, called Passport to Flexible Learning, was organized in the form of workshops that run concurrently over a 5-day period during the university's orientation week. During the workshops, participants acquired hands-on experience with a range of interactive teaching technologies. During the workshops, students were required to complete the following activities: participate in large-screen and small-screen videoconferences, a teleconference, and an audiographic session; summarize the main points from a tutored video instruction lecture; communicate via e-mail; download data from the Internet; and search and locate  information from on-line library catalogues. A total of 400 internal and external students and 20 academic and general staff from a number of faculties and divisions participated in the program. Upon successful completion of the program, students received a passport documenting their participation in a range of activities representative of the world of electronic classrooms. Students who completed the program credited the workshops with increasing their knowledge and basic understanding of communication technologies and greatly increasing their confidence in interfacing with various media and participating in learning involving interactive technology.

        "description":"Four models of online teaching are currently being used within the Faculty of Informatics and Communications at Central Queensland University in Australia. The naive model, which is the most widely used, may be characterized as &quot;putting lecture notes on the World Wide Web&quot; with no opportunities for interaction or feedback. The standard model attempts to make active use of the Web's technology by allowing a significant degree of communication and interaction between students and staff, including through a subject home page, electronic copies of the printed materials dispatched to students before the semester, lecture slides in Powerpoint format, additional notes arising from on-campus lectures and tutorials, copies of past examinations, and links to the electronic mailing list for  the subject. The evolutionary model attempts to address several key issues not addressed in the standard model by allowing the exact method of a course's delivery to evolve from semester to semester, based on identified strengths and weaknesses and weekly anonymous feedback from students. The radical model dispenses with lectures entirely. Instead, students are assigned to groups and learn by interacting among themselves and using existing Web-based resources, with academic staff members providing guidance as and when required.

        "description":"The engineering profession and, consequently, the education process for engineers must respond to several new realities in order to be successful in the 21st century. Some aspects of the new reality that are relevant to engineering education are as follows: the globalization of commerce; the information revolution; innovations in technology; the new emphasis on sustainable development; recognition of the need for lifelong learning and gender equality; the role of engineers in nations' future prosperity and the political process; the rise of multinational corporations and new start-up companies; the trend toward transformation of the study of engineering into the &quot;new liberal arts&quot; coupled with emphasis on basic engineering/specialization; industry-university partnerships; the  need for engineers to receive training in innovation/entrepreneurship and communication; and the need to attract more women into the field of engineering. In recognition of the new reality, the University of Calgary in Alberta has adopted the position that a four-year university program in engineering is reasonable for producing graduates that either enter the work force as &quot;engineers-in-training&quot; or enter further studies in engineering or in business, law, or medicine. However, the university strongly recommends an additional 16-month internship in industry for students wishing to advance into leadership roles. (MN)",

        "description":"Australia's Queensland Education Department and Central Queensland University (CQU) jointly developed a pilot program, called the Tertiary Awareness Programme Pilot (TAPP), to ease the transition of students advancing from Queensland's Glenmore State High School to the university. Unlike most previous transition-type courses, the TAPP relied heavily on a process of acculturation and socialization in conjunction with the delivery of a variety of traditional learning and student-centered life skills. The TAPP was designed to integrate the academic, social, economic, and environmental aspects of transition. Its primary aim was to encourage development of appropriate lifelong learning skills by senior high school students who were preparing for their first year at a university. The  10-week TAPP was delivered on campus at CQU to allow participants to experience a high degree of &quot;socialization.&quot; The TAPP materials were delivered through a combination of lecture and tutorial formats. In addition, students took part in activities outside the classroom, including orientation programs with CQU's student association and meetings and social functions with faculty, and social functions with various departments. Postprogram evaluations confirmed that the TAPP significantly improved students' levels of understanding of a wide range of transition-related issues. (Contains 14 references.) (MN)",

The goals of the project, which involves creating a fully outcomes-based curriculum across the institution and housing that curriculum in a database that is accessible to NAIT instructors over the World Wide Web, are as follows: make NAIT more responsive to the fast-changing requirements of industry; provide instructors with shared curriculum development tools; and provide students with more learner-centered learning materials that follow a pedagogically accepted and systematic instructional design model. The project began with course-by-course identification of learning outcomes for all NAIT courses. Outcome statements were fashioned in a consistent  institutional format incorporating an accepted list of verbs that can be classified according to Bloom's taxonomy. The project offered an opportunity to update the competency profile development process to normalize the function of curriculum validation and renewal in the context of instructors' regular work. Other important benefits of the shared database are its interdisciplinary nature and the fact that it keeps the overlapping of efforts to an absolute minimum. The curriculum database will also be an invaluable resource for NAIT's business unit as it designs customized training for a myriad of industry clients. (MN)",

        "description":"This paper argues that the concept \"empathy\" will be fundamental to successful human learning futures. However, while the need for empathetic education workers will increase, the paper also suggests that the possibility of them being so will become increasingly problematic. The paper first provides an outline of some conceptions of empathy and presents a brief argument for why the need for empathetic education workers is both morally obliged and a practical necessary. It then looks to education futures that suggest that education workers and students will increasingly interact with one another regardless of differences in cultures, contexts, time, and space. Within this context of increased diversity among workers and students, the paper addresses how two paradoxes are created: a  pragmatic paradox is created, because communication within immediate education futures will involve restricted body language and physical presence and lead to the use and interpretation of words becoming even more crucial, and a moral paradox is created, because the need for empathetic education workers will increase and being an empathetic education worker will become harder, while communications between some groups and about some things will just not be allowed. Finally, the paper suggests why education workers should not give up on continuing to be empathetic. (Contains 13 references.) (YLB)",

        "description":"This paper problematizes the bifurcation of technology and tradition and its implied unidirectional transformative authority of technology. It divides the multitude of responses to the relation between technology and culture into these three categories: technology as the messenger and the message, technology as a messenger without an inherent message, and technology as a messenger unaware of its message. A study is reported that used examples from 48 Islamic World Wide Web sites and suggests that Muslim identities are incessantly being reinvented and reconstructed via, rather than despite of, new technologies. The paper reports that the study demonstrates that a conscious appropriation and appreciation of technology not only does not undermine cultural distinctiveness, but it may  also enhance the production of a more vibrant cultural environment. It sees technology as neither bad nor good, but both a blessing and a burden. It also argues that the proponents of the technology-tradition binary perceive tradition as a set of static practices, a social order incapable of generating and adapting to change.

        "description":"This paper details a research project in Brunei Darussalam that explored vocational education teacher trainees' and their future students' views about the function of reading in vocational education and about reading in English. Part A, a review of current theoretical perspectives in literacy as a socially constructed phenomenon, is organized by these main premises: literacy is an everyday social practice that individuals participate in; literacy is not a neutral practice but relates to how individuals read the world; literacy is a political enterprise; and the pedagogy of literacy empowers particular social groups. Part B describes the questionnaire and its theoretical underpinnings. These findings from 117 student questionnaires are reported: they were most likely to consider  aspects of code breaker and text participant roles of readers and less likely to consider aspects of text user and text analyst; and gender and work experience analyses indicated no significant differences. These findings from 21 teacher questionnaires are reported: they conceived of reading in the traditional manner--as a code breaking activity, with some reflection on the text participant role--and teachers usually or always think about aspects of meaning while reading. Part C suggests that teachers of English for vocational purposes work from a model where reading is seen as an individual skill that can be taught in isolation in the classroom.

        "description":"This paper focuses on the filtration process of culture during communication in education with reference to visual elements. An introduction provides a review of some communication models--graphic representations of theories that attempt to predict and explain the process of communication. These simple models are discussed: Aristotle's model of linear communication; Laswell's model; Shannon and Weaver's model introducing the concept of \"noise;\" Schramm's structural model; Goss's structural model; and Berlo's Source, Message, Channel, Receiver (SMCR) model. These more complex models are then described: Pettersson's structural model; Rogers's convergence model; and Galtung and Ruge's linear gatekeeping model. This review shows that communication, as depicted in structural models,  consists of several components that relate to each other and that several elements in the communication process can affect the eventual outcome of the communication process. The next section provides a perspective on the integration of culture and communication and focuses on factors with a potential negative or positive effect on the outcomes of picture-text learning material, such as the receiver's cultural and social status. The paper shows that culture and communication are inseparably linked and that culture is a lens or filter through which people receive, interpret, and transmit messages. (Contains 15 references.)

Common historical fate has influenced this development and given these countries some common problems, but there is some progress and new ideas are replacing the post-colonial way of thinking. One of the most important and distinct features of the modern world is the infinitely expanding ability of information suppliers. Information serves for communication, learning, a means of controlling society, and a weapon allowing some cultures to dominate others. The info-cultural space is an area whose borders do not match geographical, political, or economic borders of  the modern world. The West has the necessary technical resources to easily penetrate info-cultural borders not protected by any laws or conventions. One defense of third world countries to aggression in this sphere is religion, especially in the most concentrated, aggressive form of traditionalism: fundamentalism. Kazakhstan has legislative measures to limit foreign participation in mass media. Special measures must be taken to protect the national info-cultural space. They should be worked out by government and non-governmental organizations. Each country's distinct culture must be given all the opportunities to develop and flourish. (YLB)",

        "description":"The importance of international trade and investment to the achievement of economic diversification objectives has increased need for professionals skilled in trade policy development and negotiation, a field known as commercial diplomacy. A severe shortage of these professionals limits developing countries' abilities to take full advantage of opportunities offered by international trade and investment and globalization of the world economy. Development of networks of regional and national training centers for commercial diplomacy staffed by local experts would alleviate the problem. Local experts would be trained to provide hands-on training, have access to generic training materials reflecting global best practices, and be able to develop materials reflecting local trade  policy, laws, institutions, cultural values, and practices. A comprehensive training program calls for courses in many disciplines and would be structured as a sequence of these four stages of instruction: theory, institutions, techniques and skills, and integration. Required training materials are instructional modules, teacher's manuals, textbooks, case studies, negotiating simulations, and guides to preparation of effective operational documents. Distance learning resources should be an important component. Coordination of efforts of various international trade agencies, multilateral organizations, national economic development agencies, and private institutions working in the area is also desirable.

        "description":"Historically, the spread of universal formal mass education in the West is closely linked to emergence of nation-states. This is also true of the Third World. The salient feature of education today is that it reflects a model of society in which citizens, including children, are seen as a potential to be tapped for development of the nation, as well as of its individual members. In Syria, education has expanded tremendously in scope and scale. The importance of education in Jordan can be shown by the simple fact that out of around 4 million inhabitants in 1991, almost 2 million were pupils. Comparison of essays written by students in Syria, Jordan, and Sweden shows that Middle Eastern pupils' essays reflect what they have been taught to see as desired and desirable goals, and the  pupils stress unanimously their duty towards national development. Swedish pupils are very different. None seem to have any particular national aspiration; few have any clear educational plan. Pupils in Syria and Jordan are educationally geared toward higher education despite needs in vocational careers. The Middle East has a fairly low participation of its educated women in the work force. Swedish women are, according to educational authorities, too traditional in program choice in higher education. Swedish students are confident in their future plans, but Middle Eastern students feel cheated since jobs suited to their educational levels are not available. (12 endnotes) (YLB)",

        "description":"Nonverbal learning disorders are less common than the typical language-based learning disabilities identified by school staff. Appropriate intervention is highly dependent on the accurate diagnosis of this disorder. Emphasis on performance and behavior management often obscures the etiology of a child's difficulties and leads to ineffective treatment approaches. The differential diagnosis can be confusing. As a result, many children do not receive adequate intervention and teachers are unable to develop appropriate techniques for their education and management. It is important to understand the cognitive, academic, and neuropsychological characteristics of students with non-verbal learning disorders and how these attributes translate into behavior and performance in the  classroom. The focus of this paper is to clarify the diagnosis of nonverbal learning disorders, differentiate them from other learning disorders, and introduce effective educational intervention strategies. The acquisition of this knowledge will enable school psychologists, teachers, parents, and clinicians to understand the characteristics of a child with a nonverbal learning disorder, identify these children earlier, and initiate effective remedial programs.

The variety of settings in which the meeting can be used and the range of student concerns that can be effectively considered in open meetings are outlined. It looks at the developmental aspects of the process of the meeting as they relate to classroom settings and presents ideas on how to evaluate them in specific school settings. Ten guidelines for conducting successful open classroom meetings are examined. Open meetings can have a variety  of uses within the classroom and school setting. In addition to solving typical concerns that focus on climate issues, open meetings can become part of the overall approach to building a more democratic sense of community among students, teachers, and school staff.

Also, adult workers are encountering involuntary career transitions. The goals of career information delivery and career employment counseling are changing. Clients must be prepared for the likelihood that they will occupy several different types of jobs. The counseling focus must  shift from helping people decide what they want to be to helping people learn the skills they need to become healthy, self-reliant citizens, able effectively to cope with the many work and other transitions they will encounter in their lives, and to maintain balance between work and life roles in rapidly changing labor markets.

The model helps orient teachers to an ecological view of students' problem behaviors. The solution-focused perspective means teachers approach problems by looking at competencies instead of deficiencies. It emphasizes positive change and does not attempt to determine the cause of the behavior. The model serves as a change agent and offers hopeful possibilities. Workshop activities are used to demonstrate the solution-focused approach. A script for role-play is included which can be used to help foster the development of the ecological perspective. The outcome from the use of  the model was that the number of referrals for assessment to the school psychologists was reduced at the elementary and middle school levels because teachers had more tools to solve problems on their own.

        "description":"This paper discusses some misconceptions about person-centered therapy being incompatible with brief counseling. Three major reasons contribute to why the person-centered approach has been omitted from the literature related to brief counseling. First, brief counseling was initially identified with the cognitive-behavioral school of therapy. Second, the person-centered approach is considered more of a philosophy. A third misconception concerns the misunderstanding surrounding empathy. In reality, therapists in short-term, time-limited situations are using many aspects of the person-centered approach. Both therapies share approaches that are based on similar beliefs, such as: psychotherapy should be formulated to meet the uniqueness of the individual's needs; every individual has  the potential towards growth; and therapists realize the significance of the therapeutic quality of a solidly built relationship. Included in the paper is an excerpt from a third session (out of 10 sessions) of a person-centered brief therapy with a 30-year-old woman who is working on improving her low sense of self-efficacy.

        "description":"The graduate research training environment is instrumental to the development of students as scientists (Gelso, 1993, 1997; Gelso and Lent, 2000). Investigations of research training environments in counseling psychology graduate programs have provided some of the empirical support necessary for educators to draw upon Gelso's (1993) theory when designing and enhancing training programs. Research thus far has been exclusively cross-sectional, and students' perceptions of the training environment are only measured as they are perceived at a single point in time. Past research has not addressed how short-term changes in the training environment relate to changes in research self-efficacy and research interest. This paper explores these relationships and how changes in one specific  aspect of the training environment, namely the student's relationship with a mentor, relate to changes in research self-efficacy and research interest. Counseling psychology doctoral students (N=125) participated in this study. Two training implications were determined from the results. First, it suggests that training interventions may be effective at the level of the individual mentor and need not be program-wide to impact student development. Second, the research supports the practice of reassigning mentors if a student is unsatisfied with the mentor early on in training. (Contains 4 tables and 19 references.) (JDM)",

        "description":"Informal mentoring has always served as a means of fostering development and growth of the younger members of our society. Mentoring programs take on many forms. Some target youth development, while others foster development within professions, such as the mentoring of new teachers. Prior research on influential factors in mentoring outcomes focused on mentee and/or mentor attitudes, which might be found to affect mentoring success. This study seeks to broaden the range of factors considered in analysis of mentoring relationships, and to evaluate both programmatic and individual influences on the nature of mentoring outcomes. It uses three measures of mentoring success: psycho-social support received, career support received, and personal evaluation. Two conclusions can be drawn  from the study: (1) analysis of structural and personal variables allowed for more comprehensive description of mentoring relationships, as situated in a formalized context; and (2) although the sample population was drawn from a single mentoring program, the program was structured such that variations were present along variables of interest, allowing comparative analysis to be conducted successfully. Several recommendations for mentoring program design are included.

        "description":"Over the past quarter of a century, the Monitoring the Future study has tracked young American's use of psychoactive substances, both illicit and licit. In this volume, findings are presented on the prevalence and trends of drug use and related factors for secondary school students (eight, tenth, and twelfth graders). Distinctions are made among demographic subgroups of these populations based on gender; college plans; region of the country; population density; parents' education; and race/ethnicity. This study demonstrates that key attitudes and beliefs about use of the various drugs are important determinants of trends in use over time. Attitudes are tracked as well as students' perceptions of certain relevant aspects of their social environment, including perceived  availability of substances, peer norms, use by friends, and exposure to use. Chapter One provides an introduction. Chapter Two gives an overview of key findings. Chapter Three presents study design and the procedures. Chapter Four discusses the prevalence of drug use among the different grades. Chapter Five explains trends in drug use. Chapter Six looks at the incidence of drug use in the lower grades. Chapter Seven discusses the degree and duration of drug-induced highs. Chapter Eight details attitudes and beliefs about drug use. Chapter Nine includes the influence of the social milieu. Chapter Ten explains other findings from the study. (Contains 5 appendixes, 152 tables, 105 figures, and references.) (JDM)",

This volume presents the results of the 1977 through 1999 follow-up surveys of the graduating high school classes of 1976 through 1998, as the respondents progressed through young adulthood. Prior to this study, little nationally representative trend data existed on college students. It also presents for the first time prevalence and trend data on 35- and 40-year-olds. A major purpose of the study is to serve as a social monitor or social indicator intended to characterize the levels and trends in certain behaviors, attitudes, beliefs, and conditions in the population. Social indicators have important  agenda-setting functions for society, and they are useful for gauging progress against national goals. Another purpose is to develop knowledge that increases understanding of why changes in behaviors and attitudes are taking place among the population. In order for this volume to stand alone, Chapters Two and Three from Volume One have been repeated. Following the introduction in Chapter One, Chapter Two provides an overview of the key findings presented in both volumes. Chapter Three presents the design of the study. Chapters Four and Five discuss prevalence and trends of drug use in young adults. Attitudes and beliefs about drugs are included in Chapter Six and the social milieu for young adults is considered in Chapter Seven. Prevalence and trends of drug use specifically among college  students are considered in Chapters Eight and Nine. (Contains 74 figures and 30 tables.) (Author/JDM)",

        "description":"The number of reported hate crimes has steadily increased. Racial prejudice motivates most of these crimes, which typically are committed by a small, loosely associated group of adolescent offenders. In addition to the physical pain and material loss associated with these crimes, they can be psychologically devastating to the victim. New approaches to responding to hate crimes have been developed, including penalty-enhancement strategies and educational programs for perpetrators. Efficacy of the proposed approaches in modifying the attitudes and behaviors of perpetrators is questionable, and many of these programs do little to address the needs of the victims. Victim-offender mediation is explored as a strategy for intervening between the adolescent offenders who commit racially  motivated hate crimes and the victims of these offenses. It is suggested that in comparison to the current responses to hate crimes, this approach will offer greater benefits for victims, offenders, and society. (Contains 14 references.) (Author/JDM)",

It was designed to assess the nature, extent, and quality of prevention and intervention activity directed at problem behaviors in a representative sample of the nation's schools. Five kinds of information were collected: (1) examples were collected of prevention and intervention models being used; (2) principals identified activities their schools had in place to prevent delinquency, drug use, and other problem behaviors; (3) individuals knowledgeable about school prevention activities were surveyed to obtain detailed descriptions of specific prevention activities; (4) teachers and students were surveyed to obtain reports of their own participation in  prevention activities; and (5) principals were surveyed a second time about disciplinary actions and crime in their schools. Activity questionnaires were used to obtain detailed descriptions of the nature, level, and quality of implementation of specific prevention activities. From the total sample of more than 17,000 prevention activities identified, one activity in each of 14 categories was sampled. Questionnaires were sent for about 7,100 activities and 3,700 were completed. All D.A.R.E. and peer mediation programs were sampled. (Contains 1 reference and 6 figures.) (JDM)",

Prevention programs within a school system were identified and an activities questionnaire was developed to measure each of the hypothesized factors leading to high implementation. Over 17,000 prevention activities were sampled. Data on the quality of implementation came from 3,700 reports on 14 different types of program activities that were obtained from 550 schools. The results suggest that attention needs to be given to help raise the quality of implementation of prevention programs. In conclusion, there is plenty of room for improvement in the  quality of implementation. The effectiveness of prevention activities can most likely be boosted if ways can be found to improve the quality of what schools are already doing. Improving training, supervision, structure, and availability of information can broadly improve the quality of school-based prevention of problem behaviors. The results also suggest that prevention interventions are most likely to be well implemented if they are integrated with the regular school program and initiated by school insiders.

Nationwide, 7% of schools or an estimated 6,451 schools reported to law enforcement personnel at least one incident of physical attack or fight with a weapon during the year. These numbers may not accurately reflect what is occurring and suggestions are giving why principals under-report crime in their schools. One such reason is that principals are reluctant to report minor crimes because of the negative image it projects. In the survey, teachers reported on victimization in schools and on classroom disorder; 27% of teachers reported that student behavior kept them from  teaching a fair amount to a great deal of the time. Students reported about their own participation in a variety of delinquent behaviors and drug use and on their experiences of personal victimization. The differences among schools in the levels of problem behavior suggest efforts should focus on schools most in need of improvement. In view of the data showing little convergence between principal's reports and other indicators, it seems unwise to depend on data about behavioral disorders reported by school administrators alone.

It describes new research extending an examination of one part of the theory, environmental identity, to a large sample of school environments. The Organizational Focus Scale (G.D. Gottfredson and Holland, 1996b) was administrated to teachers in a large sample of schools. Intraclass correlations were examined resulting in a 16-item scale. Other school characteristics were measured including: measures of classroom orderliness; measures of school safety; and reports of principals about rates of crime reported to police. The scale was found to have remarkably high correlations with school morale and quality of administrator leadership. Despite limitations, this first  study reporting on the application of the Organizational Focus Scale to implement the environmental identity construct produced promising results. Organizational focus was significantly and substantially correlated with a range of salutary organizational outcomes based on the reports of both students and teachers. The correlations with the Morale Scale can be taken as a general measure of organizational health. Appendix A is &quot;Organizational Focus Questionnaire.&quot; (Contains 3 tables and 21 references.)

This workbook is designed to assist these students in using their ASVAB scores for career exploration purposes. It is intended to be interactive and to motivate students to become involved in interpreting their ASVAB scores. There are opportunities throughout the book to complete exercises that help determine individual interests, values, skills, and educational goals, while giving students a chance to think about the features they want most in an occupation and career. Students are guided towards occupations that match their interests, abilities, and personal preferences. In this way they can develop career plans to investigate the occupations they determined of  interest. The ASVAB workbook introduces a group of students who are also in the midst of career exploration. Their experiences and discussions can be used to guide users of the workbook in their discoveries. The text is interspersed with cartoon scenarios, charts, and diagrams to further explain concepts and to assist in keeping students engaged. (Author/JDM)",

        "description":"This paper focuses on the reasons why media violence research is often misunderstood. First, it explains the methodological limitations of studying media violence and argues that these limitations are similar to those accepted in medical research. Second, it explores the role of emotional response that media violence can produce and possible techniques for redirecting its harmful consequences. Two areas of emotional research are explored: (1) media violence affects on desensitization and hostility; and (2) its contributions to children's fears and anxieties. The paper cites studies that indicate exposure to intense media violence increases hostile feeling in the short-term and can produce an enduring hostile mental framework that affects interpersonal relationships. It also cites  research demonstrating the widespread contribution of media violence to children's nightmares and the usefulness of cognitive development research in predicting what will frighten children. In conclusion it argues that knowledge of the emotional impact of media violence can be useful in designing strategies for combating the problem. A newly published study suggests that encouraging children to focus on feelings of the victim of violence can counteract the typical aggression impact of a violent cartoon. (Contains 28 references.)

        "description":"Teasing is an attempt to look better at the expense of someone else. This abuse may be as mild as verbal bantering or as severe as group violence against others. The chronically oppressed student may conclude that school is a frightening and unfriendly place. Teasing has recently become the focus of psychological research and this paper provides a theoretical framework to help understand the developmental process of those who bully. Research on family dynamics reports that the absence of a father is a factor for the children involved in bullying. Data also suggests that aggressive youth have experienced more punitive, hostile, and abusive family treatment than their peers. The paper highlights research that suggests that a school-based intervention program produced promising  results in reducing bullying and victim problems. (Contains 23 references.) (JDM)",

        "description":"This paper reviews the findings reported by Dyer and Tiggemann (1996) in Australia studying the effect of single sex versus coeducational school environments on body concerns in adolescent females. It details the reasons why parents and their children choose to be educated in single sex versus coeducational environments; and reviews literature revealing that single sex education tends to promote adherence to particularly confusing gender role attitudes. The paper then describes the connection between disordered eating and a sense of gender ambivalence resulting from increased exposure to conflicting gender role prescriptions. Based on the argument developed, it is predicted that girls attending single sex schools will exhibit greater body dissatisfaction and eating disorder  symptomatology than their counterparts. The hypothesis is tested and supported in a re-analysis of the data. The paper concludes with a discussion of the counterintuitive nature of these findings and future implications of the research.

Using a customer satisfaction approach, data were collected from 39,940 currently enrolled students in 2,145 programs in 361 postsecondary institutions in 14 states. The study examined what kinds of persons enroll in postsecondary sub-baccalaureate career-oriented educational institutions and programs; how people make decisions to enroll; how students adjust to life after enrollment; how students rate the institutions they are attending; and employment experiences of former students six months after leaving the institutions. These data were summarized on computer disks and provided to school counselors. Studies found that counselors judged the disks  to be useful to them when helping students make decisions regarding their postsecondary plans. Results show that when furnished with pertinent data and information, many of today's school counselors are highly motivated to try helping all secondary school leavers concerning their needs to seek some kind of postsecondary education that will equip them with skills needed in tomorrow's occupational society. School counselors have demonstrated the usefulness of career development information supplied them by the Counseling for High Skills Project in helping students make more informed and reasoned decision regarding postsecondary education.

Once this enhancement of face-to-face instruction occurs, it is tempting to move to the delivery of courses through distance education means. Counselor educators receive guidance from within the profession as they determine how technology can be used to enhance the preparation of counselors. However, sometimes it is instructive to review statements from other disciplines. This digest discusses two studies; \"What's the Difference? A Review of Contemporary Research on the Effectiveness of Distance Learning in Higher Education\" (Phipps and Merisotis, 1999) and\"The Virtual University\" (Gladieux and Swail, 1999).

This will help provide a context for counselors in which to reflect on their use of computer technologies in the future. Counselors have not avoided engagement with computer technologies but have become more involved with them as they have become a more plentiful resource and more user friendly. Counselors have used computers for therapeutic and educational purposes. In addition to learning to use the technology, counseling as a profession must  cope with the many ethical questions that arise from implementing computer mediated training and therapy.

        "description":"A review of 25 years of research in &quot;Human Communication Research&quot; indicated that the mass media are a significant source of learning and that the media can and do affect attitudes, which in turn influence behaviors. Based on a community sample, a study sought to extend such findings by establishing a direct link between media use, sexual attitudes, and risk-taking behaviors. Study participants were randomly selected from several communities in western Pennsylvania; 162 adolescents and adults anonymously completed the survey instrument. Overall media use was found to be related to a number of risk behaviors and to the age of first sexual encounters. Better indicators of risk behavior were attitudes toward the media, preference for sexually explicit films, listening to music, and  viewing television. Findings suggest the need to study preferences for individual media within different context for different users, to establish a link between media use and risk behaviors.

The number of citations relating to commercializing activities can provide only a rough approximation of the scope and development of the phenomenon. The number of citations reporting commercial activities in the schools has increased 154 percent--suggesting that the 1990s have become the decade of sponsored schools and commercialized classrooms. The largest area of schoolhouse commercialism appears to be sponsorship of programs and activities (199 percent increase). The fastest growing commercial activity appears to be exclusive agreements between schools and bottlers, sports apparel  manufacturers, and other firms (495 percent increase). An emerging category of school commercialism is electronic marketing, which includes television, radio, and the Internet/World Wide Web. The categories of sponsored educational materials and incentive programs are well-established commercial categories. The number of citations describing sponsored educational materials grew 313 percent. Despite the pervasiveness of commercialism and its growth, the education press has had virtually nothing to say about the issue.

        "description":"This digest discusses student profiling and describes strategies for reducing the risk of violence in schools. &quot;Student profiling&quot; refers to a process in which checklists of behaviors and personal characteristics associated with youth who have perpetrated violence are used to determine a student's potential for future violence. A central concern over the profiling of students is whether school personnel should attempt to make predictions about an individual student's propensity for violence. U.S. Education Secretary Richard Riley opposes behavioral profiling by schools and believes that creating a caring environment is a better way to prevent violence. Those who support profiling argue that keeping schools safe warrants extreme measures such as profiling. However, the question  remains whether profiling is reliable. Some experts contend that teachers, because they observe students on a daily basis, are reliable sources of information about students. Such observations become even more important in the absence of a standard set of indicators that identify troubled students. Some questions raised by student profiling include the risk of misidentifying a student as potentially violent and the profiler's qualifications. Other violence-prevention measures available to schools include investing in emotional and social learning, using incident profiling rather than student profiling, and performing functional assessments.

        "description":"This digest examines what is involved in evaluating whole-school reform programs. Such evaluations are necessary to renew Comprehensive School Reform Demonstration (CSRD) program grants and are intended to help schools determine what is working and what needs to be changed. Two primary goals of CSRD evaluation are to create a flexible design and to keep the design realistic. Performance measures should be aligned with the intended outcomes of comprehensive reform programs and should produce data that are both quantitative and qualitative. The key to a comprehensive evaluation is to address key questions early in the program so that the process will reflect the needs, interests, issues, and resources unique to the school. Since the manner in which whole-school reform is  implemented affects results, the evaluation design must reveal how well the program's implementation is working and what concrete results it has achieved. Elements that can derail an evaluation plan include districts that lack resources for the evaluation, the presence of key stakeholders who do not have the skills to work together, and educators' fear that the evaluation will be used against them. After gathering the data, the results should be formatted for ease of use and then used to improve the program. (Contains 11 references.) (RJM)",

        "description":"This digest explains why public-school governance is receiving increasing scrutiny. It identifies who is held accountable for results in the current governance system and describes recent proposals for transforming governance structures. Since many reforms of the past decade bypassed the school board and district office, reformers are now targeting this neglected middle level of governance, with much of the discussion of governance focusing on the sometimes rocky relationships among teachers, principals, superintendents, and school boards. Some critics wish to change the system entirely, whereas others favor workaround solutions, such as vouchers, choice, and privatization. Most critics, however, recognize that firing the superintendent as a first step is no longer a viable  option. The National Commission on Governing America's Schools has recommended two forms of governance: (1) publicly authorized, publicly funded, and publicly operated schools based on promising trends in public-education governance; and (2) publicly authorized, publicly funded, and independently operated schools based on promising alternatives. A few economically based strategies for changes in school governance have also been proposed, such as the creation of basic standards created by states and local boards. Notable among recent developments in school governance has been the takeover of several districts by outside entities and reforms initiated by mayors. (Contains 11 references.) (RJM)",

It describes how school-funding policy issues in the two cities have dominated legislative discussion in Missouri and lists the landmark dates in desegregating the state's two largest cities. The article describes the amount of federal aid received by various states and the early formulas that were used for establishing education equity. It discusses a 1993 decision that ruled that Missouri schools were among the most inequitably financed in the nation. This decision determined that inequity in school funding was on the rise and that disparities between the 10 highest spending school districts and the 10  lowest spending school districts increased steadily from 1987 through 1993. The court ruling stated that the amount of money available for schools affects the educational opportunities that can be provided to Missouri's children. Financial data that were taken from 1998-99 show a slight deviation from the steady decline in the disparity ratio since legislative fixes were put in place, along with a revised funding formula that had gradually improved equity of funding among Missouri school districts. Two charts portray spending ratios among states and spending disparities. (RJM)",

The first paper, &quot;Reflections on the Limitations of Our Ability to Measure Schools' Productivity and Some Perspectives from the Past,&quot; assesses the inherent difficulties in measuring school productivity, particularly if one is concerned with more than test scores. The next paper, &quot;Education Financing and Outcomes in Philadelphia,&quot; eschews efforts to measure productivity in the economic tradition, preferring to compare a school district with similar peer school districts in order to benchmark spending and performance. The third paper, &quot;School Choice in Milwaukee: Are Private Schools Creaming Off the Best Students,&quot; discusses potential threats to the measurement of public school  productivity, such as removing the most talented students through implementation of school-voucher programs. The following paper, &quot;School-Level Resource Allocation in the Chicago Public Schools,&quot; focuses on a natural experiment in which funding responsibility was shifted from the district level to the school level. Two papers, &quot;The Productivity of School Finance Equalization: An Analysis Using Hierarchical Linear Modeling,&quot; and &quot;Active Graphics Methods for the Analysis and Display of Education Data,&quot; assess fiscal equalization. The final paper, &quot;Developing Student Resource Variables for the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey,&quot; describes how the National Center for Education Statistics has adopted a student-level finance measure that has the ability to accurately assess questions of the  relationship of resources to student outcomes.

Prior to this federal program, more than 85 percent of students were in classes with over 18 children. However, 1 year after its inception, the program enabled 1.7 million young children to learn in smaller, more personalized, classrooms. The program allowed schools to hire approximately 29,000 new teachers, and as a direct result, 61,000 additional teachers saw their class sizes shrink. Class-Size Reduction funds helped create more manageable classrooms so that teachers could focus on teaching and learning and spend less time on discipline. The program has turned around low-performing schools, has improved reading achievement, and has  boosted individualized instruction and classroom management. The report discusses how federal dollars are sent to where they have the greatest impact, and it offers several anecdotes from teachers who testify to the benefits of the program. It describes ways to support state efforts at class-size reduction and offers specific examples of state programs that have benefited children. The text details research that supports the efficacy of class-size reduction, and explains how such program work and why they are cost effective. (RJM)",

The report arose from legislators' concerns about budget problems that caused many school officials to eliminate academic programs and trim other expenses. The following questions are addressed in the evaluation: How has public school enrollment changed over the last decade? How have district fund balances varied over the last decade? How have staffing levels and salaries changed over time? How have past trends varied depending on the size, location, and other characteristics of school districts? and Why are some districts experiencing financial problems? The findings of the study reveal that the financial condition of school districts improved during the 1990s. Spending on special  education increased as did inflation-adjusted general fund revenues per student. Although over one-third of the districts made budget cuts in 2000, the statewide teacher-student ratio was expected to hold at or near the high reached in the prior year. Although spending increases resulted from class-size reduction efforts, declining enrollment, low staff turnover, growing transportation costs, and inadequate management practices, no single factor explained why some districts experienced declining fund balances or had to cut spending. Two appendices list the districts surveyed and those districts in statutory operating debt. (RJM)",

The initiative was designed to help members of the Forum for the American School Superintendent enhance their advocacy for children by addressing communitywide changes needed to ensure children's success, linking schools with community-based prekindergarten education and health and human services, and encouraging developmentally appropriate early care and education. It focuses on the early years, from birth through age nine, and principals are the primary target audience. The project described here was designed to assist seven districts that comprise the Success for All Children Initiative of the Superintendents' Forum. The project  created a Principals' Academy to provide a cross-district learning community for potential early-childhood leaders and to assist participant districts in developing districtwide plans for implementation of responsive teaching. Results indicate that the academy was effective in five of the districts. Two districts achieved a high level of engagement at the individual, school, and district levels, whereas three districts were moderately successful in their implementation of the program at these three levels.

The model is designed to be used by educators, mental-health professionals, and law-enforcement agencies and is intended to help refine and strengthen the efforts of the National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime. Its fundamental building blocks are its threat-assessment standards, which provide a framework for evaluating a spoken, written, and symbolic threat, along with a four-pronged assessment approach, which looks at the personality of the student, the student's family dynamics, the school dynamics, the student's role in those dynamics, and social dynamics. The model is not a profile of the school shooter or a checklist of danger signs pointing to the next adolescent  who will bring lethal violence to a school. It discusses misinformation about school shootings; how to assess a threat, including motivations; types of threats; factors in threat assessment; and levels of risk. The document cautions that one or two traits or characteristics should not be considered in isolation or given more weight than the others. The text outlines the intervention process and closes with a number of recommendations. Four appendices list methodologies used in the report, suggested readings, and other information. (RJM)",

The report discusses the Tennessee Student-Teacher Achievement Ratio program and the Wisconsin Student Achievement Guarantee in Education program. Evidence that private school vouchers raise student achievement remains weak. This report discusses the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program and the Cleveland Scholarship and Tutoring Program--two programs dealing with  voucher issues.

Little is known about what kinds of collaborations exist, and how many are true &quot;collaborations&quot; (as opposed to &quot;cooperations and &quot;coordinations&quot;). Additionally, very little is known about the structures that need to be in place for collaborations to work and the factors contributing to their success. This study attempts to fill this void by surveying the landscape of existing public/private collaborations, by describing their types, by assessing the degree to which the arrangements are truly collaborative, and by considering factors that contribute to success. Findings indicate that structure influences the success of public/private school  partnerships. Collaborations, the most structured type, have more qualities that contribute to a higher degree of mutuality among members. Collaborations have the most successful environments, fewest restrictions to success, and the most positive responses to those restrictions in contrast to cooperations (in all cases) and coordinations (in most cases.) Collaborations are more likely to express the desire to break down barriers and destroy myths about the other partner's environment than the other two partnership types. (DFR)",

The paper reviews the literature covering many facets of school and classroom culture--including literature on school reform-and includes the author's experience of implementing one prominent school-reform initiative: the Accelerated Schools Project. The paper concludes that where a match between the cultures exists, or is desired by the majority, the reform is more likely to be successfully implemented. On the other hand, where the culture of the initiative and that of the school or that of many classrooms differ greatly, it is unlikely to succeed. This  perspective points to the importance of developing tools to help school communities understand cultural compatibility, and it explains why one model may be appropriate for some schools while another model meets the needs of other schools.

The schools in this study reflect schools across the country and represent various levels of readiness. Earlier findings in these schools indicated that &quot;although schools are attending to many things, many of them are not attending to matters that make a difference in the way schools operate and in the outcomes for students.&quot; Using Hord's five-dimensional model as a comprehensive design, the study's findings indicate that the key factor in whole-school reform is the leadership of the principal. Leadership practices in high-readiness schools were more effective than those in low-readiness schools in all  areas under study: shared leadership, inspired responsibility for a shared vision, empowered decision-making, and inclusivity of staff. Principals in high-readiness schools were not coercive or controlling; they shared leadership, imaging it in the likeness of new conceptions of leadership. These principals were selective in their focus on a shared vision. Some elicited the dreams of others, while some shared their own visions and sought to mobilize efforts accordingly.

Results showed a great deal of overlap and convergence between the different groups.

        "description":"Collective bargaining to establish salaries, benefits, and working conditions for public school employees is now an institutionalized fact of life in California. Virtually all public school districts participate in collective bargaining. School districts can implement most new laws--from class-size reduction to teacher evaluation--only after they have bargained the impact. This can be significant in a district's labor-management relationships. Further, although districts bargain independently, control of revenues for public schools is centralized in Sacramento--leaving districts with limited flexibility to satisfy competing requests for resources. This report explains how school-district collective bargaining works in California, how conflicts are resolved, and who the players  are. (DFR)",

        "description":"Legislators and school districts are reviewing alternative compensation plans in an effort to attract and retain qualified teachers. Limited merit-pay based plans have been abandoned, and the single salary schedule remains in place nationwide. A tight labor pool, greater scrutiny by legislatures, and new laws create pressures to raise salaries even while half of new teachers resign within five years and policymakers remain reluctant to allocate more resources. The four major systems in use today are: (1) pay for performance linking compensation to student achievement; (2) knowledge- and skills-based systems employing new assessment tools; (3) school-based award programs offering financial bonuses for reaching specific goals and benchmarks; and (4) compensation for certification  with the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS). Beginning in 2002-2003, Cincinnati will be the first large city to drop traditional salary structures: teachers with less than 22 years' experience will be compensated based on evaluations of teachers grouped into five career categories. A Pilot program in Denver and Douglas County, Colorado, includes, respectively, a mix of three pay-for performance and a blend of pay-for-performance plans and knowledge-and-skills based plans. School districts can turn to a variety of resources for guidance in evaluating approaches to compensation, including the Consortium for Policy Research in Education's Teacher Compensation Project, a Milken Family Foundation report, and publications by the American Federation of Teachers, the  National Commission on Teaching and America's Future, and Education Week.

Study circles use small, highly participatory, facilitated groups to explore such issues as race relations, crime, and violence. This program and research effort is the first focusing on the use of study circles in education on a statewide basis. Arkansas Friends endorsed the assistance of superintendents in efforts to involve parents in study-circle programs. Preliminary analysis of research data from 262 questionnaires and 216  post-questionnaires compiled by The Center for Research on Teaching and Learning at the University of Arkansas and the University of Oklahoma at Norman from 5 Arkansas cities indicates a positive response to this type of group dialogue and collaboration. The data indicate involvement of superintendents enhances parental participation and the use of trained facilitators in small-group deliberation is vital to the dialogue process. Superintendents could be the catalysts for educational change in Arkansas using better communication strategies through study circles to improve community involvement and school performance.

Committees comprised of all major stakeholding groups, including administrators, teachers, counselors, support personnel, parents, and community members should be formed by schools to oversee every step of a reform program. These steps include a self-study, research-based reform, entry-level standards, intensive intervention programs, a safe learning environment, high academic standards, full certification, organizing personal communities, and creating student learning incentives. At present, little research backs block scheduling, year-round schools and late-start days, and interdisciplinary education is vague.

Schoolwide reforms have been independently proven, have been replicated beyond a pilot program, and are supported by a professional infrastructure.

This is a two-fold problem: (1) Principals with high overall academic ability are more likely to be viewed as leaders in re-intellectualizing instruction with teachers so that they achieve academic success with nearly all students; and (2) principals should be highly analytic about their work in storing and retrieving information in ways that result in high-quality decision making and problem solving. In this study, researchers examined the Graduate Record Examination of examinees intending to enter EA graduate programs from 1982-96. Two key findings were that examinees  planning graduate work in the field of education have lower verbal, quantitative, and analytic scores than those of examinees in the other 7 fields, and within the field of education, the verbal scores of examinees intending to study administration are 11 points lower than the mean for the entire field of education.

The district can receive up to $450,000 over a 3-year period for such things as technology, software, curriculum, and professional development. Following the end of the 3 year period, the district must document that the high school has stopped offering a general education track, developed an ongoing school/community  partnership, and provided evidence that the number of dropouts has decreased. With substantial progress toward these objectives, the high school can be designated an \"A+ High School.\" The paper illustrates a case study of a high school that strives to maintain these goals.

School reform in Alberta suggests that educational leaders challenge their beliefs and assumptions and leads to the following questions: (1) How can the international components of teacher education and graduate programs at postsecondary institutions be made most meaningful? (2)How can the structure and function  of schools be reconceptualized to maximize the possibilities offered by information and communication technologies? (3) What is the relationship between educators' traditionally conservative assumptions about schooling and imposed change by legislators? and (4) What is the limited capacity of public schools to change and the challenge this presents to the schools' credentialing, social, and custodial functions?

The 1999-2000 report added an 8th category: fundraising. The total number of press citations found in CACE's database searches increased 23 percent between 1998-99 and 1999-2000. Commercial activities in schools appear to be continuing the upward trend observed throughout the 1990s. Furthermore, the growing interconnection of schoolhouse commercializing suggests that marketers are attempting to create a seamless advertising environment that surrounds children  in and out of school. The drive to put technology in schools appears to be opening new channels for commercial activity in schools. In spite of the apparent increase in commercial activity, signs of disenchantment are beginning to emerge. Increasing attempts at the local, state, and federal levels to regulate or ban certain types of commercial activities are another indication of a developing public awareness of potential negative consequences of such activities.

Following three defeats, in 1999 the Oregon legislature authorized charter schools, either as new entities or expansions of existing programs. Schools must be open to all and offer a comprehensive instructional program. Charter schools are exempted from state laws governing schools, excepting academic standards, assessment requirements, and health, safety, and antidiscrimination laws.

Because practices of social groups play a critical role in self-identity, the violent actions of Eric Harris and Dylan Klybold at Columbine, directed at athletes and religious students, are best understood as expressions of collective violence, including the passive violence of adult nonresponsiveness. Typical models of justice, incorporating ideals of perfection, rationality, and fairness, fail to reveal the social context of violent acts. Only a focus on injustice explains the oppression perceived by Harris and Klybold and  reveals their motivations. Where present, as at Columbine, Young's five following structures of oppression make violence predictable: (1) exploitation signified in exclusion despite computer work at school; (2) marginalization of so-called geeks; (3) powerlessness; (4) cultural imperialism by exclusionary groups; and (5) violence made inevitable beyond certain student anger thresholds. Only by understanding social causes can schools realistically address school violence. (TEJ)",

Establishing rigorous academic standards will revolutionize education and improve equity, and standards enjoy popular support. Standards require: (1) proficiency by students of all grades in a variety of subjects; (2) assessment testing; and (3) cooperation with textbook publishers. Much current criticism of standards focuses on the relationship between democracy and education. Dewey's broad, dynamic understanding of this relationship in a lived democracy included developing a shared common purpose through communication, but current discussions too often exclude the experiences of teachers. Many critics and supporters believe current standards are too precise and do not ensure student  understanding. Frequently overlooked are the substantial limitations of standardized tests, which ignore factors outside school.

The project facilitated meetings involving educational associations, businesses, policymakers, charter- school operators, faculty, and parents; performed site visitations; created newsletter and web sites; and convened meetings between public-school and charter-school officials. The project isolated 12 crucial public-policy issues appearing in the early stages of charter-school experimentation: (1) character of entities controlling charter granting; (2) adequate facilities support; (3) defining charter schools''fair share' of funds; (4) limiting  numbers; (5) resolving differing points of view regarding teacher certification; (6) assessment and accountability protocols; (7) accountability standards applied to alternative schools; (8) the nature of the state's monitoring role; (9) achieving appropriate racial balance; (10) funding of state agency supports; (11) policy considerations commonly arising after legislation requiring amendments; and (12) fostering collaboration instead of competition with other public schools during implementation stages.

        "description":"Recent studies suggest unionization constrains administrators, impedes reform, and makes achieving accountability difficult. Interviews with 11 principals and analysis of the collective bargaining agreement between the New York City Board of Education and the United Federation of Teachers indicates rigid work rules prevent the flexibility and autonomy schools require to meet educational missions. The contract complicates transfer decisions by favoring veteran teachers, a problem not addressed in recently negotiated School-Based Options plans. Few teachers are disciplined because tenure provisions impede termination, and protocols discourage and delay disciplinary actions. The contract places teacher seniority ahead of administrator judgment in assignments and relieves teachers of  noninstructional obligations. Rigid rules governing work hours and conditions undermine teamwork by not requiring teacher meetings with students and administrators, limiting class size, and specifying preparation periods. The most recent contract extends union power and perpetuates divided authority and unclear lines of responsibility, stalemating reform. Recent school leadership teams reflect these unfortunate trends and further undermine principal authority. (TEJ)",

        "description":"Overcoming decades of labor, financial and performance troubles, the Chicago school system has enjoyed improving test scores 3 consecutive years, rising attendance, and labor peace under a new contract balancing the budget. Despite some criticism, the Chicago system enjoys reform successes in six areas: (1) improved governance; (2) greater flexibility in resource allocation, work rules, and seniority requirements; (3) uniform high standards and expectations; (4) greater accountability systemwide; (5) expanded early support for children and mothers; and (6) willingness to consider varied unconventional policy options. The district is incrementally raising low minimum promotional standards, as at risk students are identified for support. Bilingual education became a transitional  program, with some of the existing bilingual education resources shifting into foreign language programs. The insistence of reformers opposed to top-down solutions remains the primary obstacle to reform. The broader public supports a system that aids parents by offering safe schools and buildings, financial stability, and labor peace with substantially unchanged funding. (TEJ)",

An introductory chapter provides an overview of developments leading to passage of Public Law 94-142, the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 and the reauthorizing and renaming of this legislation as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The scarcity of research relating to the effect of IDEA on art education is noted. Findings indicated that art educators felt they serviced more students with EEN than regular classroom educators. Most teachers surveyed felt their preservice college background did not  do a good job in preparing them to work with students with EEN. Teachers were overwhelmed by the variety of types of EEN encountered. Teachers generally had a poor understanding of the educational assessment process that leads to student placement in an EEN disability program. The paper concludes that institutions of higher education need to consider adding preservice course work relating to work with students with EEN as part of graduation and license requirements. The survey is appended. (Contains 48 references.) (DB)",

Results of the study indicate: (1) expectations for meeting standards are higher for students with disabilities who are served primarily through general education than for those served primarily in special education resource rooms; (2) most students with mental  impairments (developmental disabilities) are not expected to meet high standards; (3) few elementary age students with disabilities use accommodations; (4) educators who have received training on the implementation of high standards are more likely to implement the high standards; and (5) middle school teachers expected a great number of their students to meet high standards, worked with more students on using accommodations, and discussed standards with more Individual Education Program teams than teachers at other grade levels.

This report examines the historical development of out-of-level testing (the administration of a test at a level above or below the student's age or grade level), how the literature defines out-of-level testing, how out-of-level testing has been studied and the rationale supported by the approach taken, and what is missing from the literature. Three interrelated themes are discussed as the rationale for testing students out of level: (1) overly difficult tests promote  increased guessing and student frustration, which reduces the accuracy of the test results; (2) students who are tested at their level of functioning receive test items that are better matched to their instructional delivery, which increases the precision of the test results; and (3) no definitive data support either the use or nonuse of out- of-level testing with students with disabilities. The review supports the rationale for the construct of out-of-level testing, while an entry point into understanding the effects of testing students out of level, is neither extensive nor complete.

For this analysis, 170 reports were collected between March 1999 and August 1999 from state accountability offices and state special education offices. Despite requirements of the 1997 Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) for public reporting of assessment participation and performance data from students with disabilities, results indicate that only 14 states included participation data and only 17 states included performance data for students with disabilities in state assessments. There were increases in the reporting of performance data for students  with disabilities, but not to the extent that might be expected given the timelines in IDEA. More than two-thirds of the document that did not include data on students with disabilities did include data on regular education students' performances. Only eight states reported data on students with disabilities for the first time in this analysis. Furthermore, three states that reported data on students with disabilities in previous years did not report data this time. Recommendations are presented. (Contains 11 references.) (Author/CR)",

It provides brief case studies of the assessment practices in two states, thereby highlighting the reality of gray areas as states implement their assessment systems. After a review of the national reform context, a model with five interrelated questions is presented that provides a basis for defining and addressing gray area concerns: (1) what is driving large-scale assessment programs and how does it affect gray area concerns; (2) how does a state or district approach to  content and performance standards affect gray area concerns; (3) how do test accommodations and modification policies affect gray area concerns; (4) how do assessment formats affect gray area concerns; and (5) how does the nature of the high- and low-stakes accountability system affect gray area concerns.

It examines the literature available on school safety and security and the principles of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED), and presents a survey of Florida's 67 school districts examining incidences of safety and security problems and steps taken to prevent such incidents. Concluding sections include a set of design guidelines in which CPTED principles are developed specifically for schools, and evaluates Chapter 6A-2 of the state's Uniform Building Code with recommended changes and commentary. Survey data show the CPTED principles do have broad-based application to the design and/or re-design of Florida's schools, but these principles must  be carefully assessed, particularly those involving life-safety, educational policy or intent, costs, and overall educational environment. Appendices provide the CPTED design guidelines, a sample of the Florida District Questionnaire and statistical results from the survey, a sample of the National Survey Questionnaire and statistical results of the survey, and a security maintenance checklist.

Such questions have arisen within the context of a growing emphasis on communicative activities and student-to-student interaction in the EFL classroom and concerns about the limited access to input and feedback from native speaker (NS) teachers and to native speakers outside the classroom. In order to address these concerns, the interactions of seven dyads of EFL learners were compared with that of seven dyads of English native speakers on two communication tasks. Results of the comparisons revealed that learner-learner dyads were not significantly different  from learner-NS dyads with respect to their contributions of input, feedback, and output as they participated in the common communication tasks. Results of the study thus supported the EFL environment as a learning environment; however, linguistic inaccuracies on the learners' parts suggested that in addition to communicative activities, more targeted, grammar-oriented approaches may also be in order.

It discusses interviews from a critical discourse perspective. In particular, it suggests that interviews are sites of struggle where individuals strive to construct representations of themselves, where they choose among possibilities for stating a particular idea and align themselves with both certain ways of understanding the social world and the people who have historically understood the social world from that perspective. They identify themselves with certain subject positions, the notion of which is thought to capture the idea of social identity. Research questions include the following: what social and linguistic  resources are available; how do interviewers delimit the ways in which these resources are used; how do specific instances of resource use function as acts of self-representation. While acknowledging there are some constraints imposed on individual knowledge and other circumstances, this article illustrates how individuals manage to construct multiple, complex, and dynamic representations of themselves within the confines of a highly ritualized form of talk.

The paper uses and expands upon three categories of classroom language use (control, curriculum, and critique) to present data on how a Puerto Rican American teacher uses repetition and discourse styles that have African and African American origins to perform a variety of classroom functions: to control classroom behavior and talk, to better teach and highlight elements of the curriculum, and to critique the use of standard English in an elementary classroom context. In the first section, findings are provided on the form and function of repetition in research on African oral traditions and African American language use in church and classroom contexts. The context of the study  is described, including a the setting, participants, and methods of data collection and analysis. It is concluded that the teacher's use of culturally specific forms of repetition enhanced the way she controlled classroom talk and behavior and increased students' participation and learning of the curriculum.

The article ends by claiming that teachers and researchers must engage students' literacy practices in order to enrich classroom life and conduct meaningful and socially just research. The study reinforces the need to continue the scholarly debate about the wisdom and efficacy of trying to impose standard English on all speakers and  writers and argues that new ways to validate alternative literacies should be found that can be used as a means of helping students to become proficient users of dominant literacies.

        "description":"This article provides an account of some characteristics of the current situation of culture teaching in foreign language education. The focus is that existing approaches need to be revisited and redefined, because the superficiality characterizing the way culture is taught is not very helpful in raising learners' cultural awareness and developing their intercultural competence. It is argued that a more focused model that explores various aspects of the &quot;How&quot; and &quot;Why&quot; of the culture construct is required towards fostering understanding and acceptance of difference. Rather than aiming to attain a native-speaker-like level of competence, the essence of culture teaching should be extended to include illuminating how the world must not be viewed from a one-sided perspective.  Learners need to learn to decenter and relativize their view of the world around them. This paper departs from the premise that language and culture embody and perpetuate different worldviews. The objective is to argue that one of the noble aims of culture teaching should be to develop intercultural competence that leads to empathy, openness and understanding vis-a-vis the target culture and its people. An approach to the study of language and culture that aims to explore what, how, and why culture can open a wide range of perspectives to the learner. (Contains 24 references.) (KFT)",

        "description":"This book is the result of an effort by English language arts teachers and foreign language teachers to collaborate with the understanding that writing improves student learning across the curriculum, and that increased mastery of writing skills in a student's first language will improve foreign language learning. This fact notwithstanding, few foreign language teachers feel competent to teach writing. The purpose of this guide is to give foreign language teachers additional help for teaching writing in the foreign language class and to foster a spirit of collaboration with their English language arts colleagues. This guide is divided into ten chapters. Covered topics include the following: elements of good writing programs, the writing process, writing strategies; writing in the  North Carolina Standard Course of Study, the first and second language connection, dialogue journals and learning logs, suggestions for writing, multiple intelligences, the role of grammar, and assessment. There is also a bibliography and four appendices covering the North Carolina Standard Course of Study, ACTFL Writing Proficiency Guidelines, Focused Holistic Scoring Guides, and Graphic Organizers. It is concluded that developing good writers is a goal shared by all teachers. Learning another language is synonymous with learning to communicate and communication takes place in a variety of ways, one of which is through writing. (KFT)",

        "description":"This book describes 7 successful foreign language programs that start in preschool or the elementary grades and continue through high school, including both foreign language in the elementary school (FLES) and immersion programs. Written in clear and nontechnical language, this book is designed to be of use to anyone developing an early foreign language program or looking for ideas on how to maintain, enhance, or expand an existing program. Above all, this book aims to provide ready access to clear and reliable information about effective practices in language education. It begins with an overview of the topic and each of the 9 chapters. Each chapter focuses on a particular program, practice, or practitioner that has shown to be successful. The chapters describe the strategies  and techniques used by effective teachers and administrators and offer practical guidelines and suggestions to help others implement similar strategies in their own classrooms, schools, and districts. Each volume closes with a summary of key points in the book and general guidelines and recommendations. Each chapter showcases one or two K-12 schools or school districts and typically contains the subheadings: &quot;Program Philosophy and Goals&quot;; &quot;In the Classroom&quot;; &quot;Program Overview&quot;; &quot;Articulation&quot;; &quot;Assessing Student Achievement&quot;; &quot;The People Behind the Program&quot;; &quot;Challenges&quot;; &quot;Linking the Program to Families and the Community&quot;; &quot;Keys to Success.&quot; Forty-six references and 4 appendices are included.

        "description":"This qualitative study is concerned with exploring the transcultural experiences of ESOL students and connecting their lived experiences to literature in the classroom. The purpose of the study was to describe and explain the transcultural perspectives of six high school and community college students-- four Cuban-born and two American-born but raised in the Cuban-American culture. It investigates their lived transcultural experiences. The data was collected in the form of student interviews, a researcher's journal, and document reviews. The following exploratory questions guided this study: (1) From the perspective of four Cuban-born non-native English-speaking students (NNS), what are the essential structures of their transcultural identities? (2) What are the underlying themes  that account for the Cuban NNS students' transcultural experiences? (3) What are the universal structures found among Cuban NNS students' transcultural experiences and the Cuban-American, native English/Spanish speaking (NESS) students' experiences? (4) What are the possible structural meanings of the Cuban NNS students' interests in relation to their transcultural experiences? (5) What are some of the connections between the structural themes inherent in the Cuban NNS students' transcultural experiences and their teaching literature in English as a second or other language (ESOL)? Results of the survey provide a better understanding of these students' transcultural experiences and show the potential of connecting their perspectives to literature in the classroom.

        "description":"Dual language programs are bilingual education immersion models designed to address the needs of limited-English-proficient students and native English speakers by proving an additive language approach. In this program, English and Spanish are used for the purpose of developing bilingual and biliteracy skills. The project was structured after the 90/10 model, which provides 90 percent of instruction in Spanish and 10 percent in English instruction in kindergarten and first grade. Instruction in English is increased by 10 percent with each grade until a balance of 50/50 is reached in fifth grade. This paper provides information about this Title VII-funded program as implemented in two inner-city elementary schools. The teachers and instructional assistants foster high academic  achievement by teaching content areas using both English and Spanish, and literacy skills are acquired in both languages. The structure of the class is such that English and Spanish-dominant students are placed together so that students learn from each other as well as the teacher. The results have been positive: after 2 years of dual instruction, students are performing better than expected in both language acquisition and academics. Nine references and six appendices (covering a description of Title VII, sample lessons from classroom observations, an assessment calendar, a training summary, a professional development survey, and a classroom observation checklist) are included.

In this way, the everyday concerns and issues facing them in the classroom may be translated into disciplined and structured research questions, which can then form the basis of small-scale investigative projects. Teachers may then be encouraged to comprehend how the outcomes of their projects can provide them with insight into the language learning process as well as enrich their teaching expertise, encourage collegial team work and create a collaborative atmosphere. This may also empower teachers to speak in an authoritative way about their profession, the language learning process and their teaching  skills.

By using popular videos to dramatically illustrate these barriers, students and clients of ESP/ESL programs can understand how the glass ceiling affects them. The paper includes definitions of the various aspects of the glass ceiling and its attendant barriers, as well as the data gathered from interviews on the needs of professors in MBA and other professional programs, and the implications  for program design and lesson planning on the part of ESP/ESL professionals. Details are included on how to use video and incorporate appropriate communicative skills in the classroom for the student or client to gain the necessary skills for success.

It sought to identify the proportion of the graduating class that went on to a postsecondary school, the type of college students chose, and reasons behind choice of college. In 1999 it conducted a fourth survey in the series, consisting of telephone interviews with a randomly selected sample (N=1,301) of Oregon's high school graduating class of 1999. Results indicate the proportion of the graduating class that attended a postsecondary institution, the type of college chosen, and the reasons for choosing the college. If a graduate did not attend college, a reason  was sought. According to results, college attendance rate for this graduating class is approximately 84%. A greater proportion of 1999 graduates than 1997 graduates enrolled in four-year institutions. The number of students leaving Oregon to go to four-year colleges has increased. Academic reputation, availability of a desired major, costs to students, and proximity to (or distance from) home are reasons cited in choosing a college. (HB)",

        "author":["Schramm, Susan"],
        "description":"Although mentoring is a popular practice in academia, mentor-protegee relationships are, for women faculty, problematic in several areas including power dynamics and cross-gender interactions. This paper discusses mentoring among academic faculty in the context of a feminist analysis of mentor-protegee relations, and suggests a feminist mentoring approach. Untenured female faculty often encounter marginalization, and affiliation with feminism may increase that marginalization. The paper discusses marginalization and looks at mentoring from four perspectives: 1) myths about mentoring, 2) liminality, 3) transforming sexist culture, and 4) mentoring with female values. In typical mentoring programs, inherent inequalities lead to imbalanced mentor-protegee relationships. Many mentors  do not have adequate training in cross-gender mentoring. Feminist mentors should help to identify sex bias as problematic. Mentors of both sexes should participate in understanding, working within, and transforming sexist culture. Feminist mentoring emphasizes interpersonal relationships, empowerment and personal development, self-esteem, promotion of enhanced knowledge, skills and political awareness, personal autonomy, and politics of gender.

Intended to address the needs of elected officials, educators, and governing bodies, the report discusses California's complex higher education issues in the context of increased enrollment projections, diversity, and institutional accountability. California's institutions of higher education will be expected to enroll approximately 715,000 additional students by the end of the decade, an increase that poses a challenge to the system. This challenge is addressed by the more than 40 recommendations stated in the commission's report. Facilities improvement is a highlighted issue. Other factors  include demographic shifts within the state that will lead to increased diversity; technology's presence within the economy and in education; and the relationship between the economy and public education. Recommendations focus on each of three audiences: 1) policy makers and government bodies, 2) leaders in higher education, and 3) the Commission and other coordinating entities. Education access, affordability, and accountability comprise the major topical areas of the recommendations. (HB)",

        "author":["Carriuolo, Nancy"],
        "description":"The term &quot;educational pipeline&quot; refers to the lifetime of educational experiences incurred by students in the American education system. It is thought that students' experiences at any point in the pipeline can affect future outcomes. For colleges and universities, access and retention are critical issues affected by &quot;leaks&quot; in earlier segments of the pipeline. Recent efforts by the federal government to improve institutional accountability have looked to student retention rates as important markers. Successful retention programs consider the early educational needs of diverse populations. School-college partnerships identify and engage multiple stakeholders across the educational spectrum in an effort to redesign and bolster the pipeline and to help ensure success for students  once they reach college. School-college partnership isn't new; collaboration has existed for much of the 20th century. In the 1980's, the movement for increased partnership gained momentum. Today, technology plays an important role in helping to develop these partnerships. Differences in configuration include varying sizes and scopes of partnerships. Both benefits and impediments exist within partnerships. Overall, school-college partnerships are important to the success of students, regardless of cultural or gender differences and learning needs. Contributors to this volume discuss specific examples of working programs in existence today. (HB)",

These challenges include a surge in enrollment; the need for new, first-rate faculty; and Ontario's potential role in leading innovation and research. The report makes five recommendations in the following five areas to policymakers and planners in Ontario's higher education arena regarding quality indicators and quality enhancement. First, Ontario's universities are at a critical juncture in the quality of their work, and in striving to enhance quality, they face major challenges. Second, quality refers to excellence in the work of universities. It is considered in terms of the  institution, academic program or department, and the university sector. Third, quality indicators refer to evidence of characteristics associated with quality and overlap with performance indicators. Fourth, the paper looks at Ontario's specific experience with indicators at three levels. Lastly, international perspectives on quality are considered. One appendix is included. (HB)",

The Task Force on Learning Technologies was established to address Ontario universities' need to utilize learning technologies and to guide their implementation in the Ontario higher education system. Many workplaces in Ontario, Canada require development of advanced technological skills, and continued education and training. Opportunities exist for appropriate uses of information and telecommunications technologies in the realms of teaching and learning, particularly with regard to Ontario's university system. The task force recommends that each institution develop  specific strategies for learning technology (LT) at the institutional and system level; that there is a need for a more supportive environment for faculty and students who use learning technologies; and that there is a need for significant investment in learning technologies by government, private sector, and institutions, facilitated by strategic partnerships and collaborations.

Data suggest that the academic workforce in physics has remained relatively steady. Overall, the data indicate stability in hiring and turnover and in the physics faculty population as a whole, although individual departments have experienced change. The number of FTE (full-time equivalent) faculty in physics departments that grant Ph.D.s and Bachelor's degrees was relatively constant; however, the number of master's degree-granting departments has  decreased. Overall, physics departments employed slightly more physicists in 1998 than in 1996. Women faculty in physics departments increased in number; almost half of physics departments employed at least one female member in 1998.

The report suggests on the basis of that data and other findings that the state of California has made financial and budget policy decisions which work against African Americans, and that prison building has become a priority while higher education has lost ground in the areas of state budget, number of jobs, affordability, construction of new institutions, population increases, and salaries for professionals. It is argued that African American communities have suffered as a result. Compounding the problem, a public university education is becoming less affordable. Grants have decreased, and tax dollars spent on  various budget items reflect increasingly higher proportions spent on corrections. The trend is expected to continue in the next decade. The report suggests implementing policies that will limit growth of the prison population, and shifting budget priorities to promote affordability and accessibility of higher education, particularly for African Americans.

        "description":"In consideration of conclusions reached by the Council of Ontario Universities (COU) in March 1999, the COU presents data in support of recommendations for the 2000 Ontario budget. Significant issues include the substantial increase in demand for university services, need for faculty recruitment, facilities improvement, and expanded research capabilities. The paper discusses student demand, expected to reach an additional 88,900 students by the year 2010. In addition, almost 11,000 new faculty will be needed over the next decade. According to analysis of research capacity, Canada lags behind its G7 counterparts in expenditure on research and development. Facilities renewal will comprise a substantial future expenditure. Quality, accountability, diversity of educational  opportunity, and responsiveness to student and marketplace needs are highlighted. The brief outlines government actions indicated and the university system's commitment in attaining goals for the system. The report highlights Ontario universities' areas of innovation and responsiveness, economies and efficiencies, and commitment to accountability. Data indicating Ontario's expenditures on research and development, and future facilities costs, are presented, as well as a chart outlining four-year changes in support for higher education in Ontario as compared to other provinces and the United States.

Market forces have created new pressures and new opportunities for higher education to integrate technology into their missions and practices. Interactive technology reduces the power of institutions to define the parameters of knowledge and learning. This essay addresses ways to preserve a broader social conception of learning in a world where markets and technology are combining to reshape higher education. The availability of a new medium yields an expanded range of educational providers. Traditional students should be addressed as consumers who have choice in the educational market. Successful institutions will effectively navigate the tension between gown and badge while retaining their core missions  and values. Institutions must devise strategies to remain engaged with a changing educational market, and willingly seek out the new learning tools technology makes available. Faculty members should look at learning processes and apply those lessons to their own teaching in order to best provide effective educational experiences to students. Electronic learning tools, including Web-based programs of instruction, can help institutions become more effective and more accountable. (HB)",

Creativity can be defined in several ways; in this context, it is related to the effectiveness of a teacher. The document discusses results in light of the IPL's goals of production, acquisition, maintenance, and transfer of knowledge. In teaching, creativity and effective teaching are similar concepts. Symbolic interactionism and role theory provide a theoretical basis for examining the respective roles of teachers and students, as does leadership theory. The research involved a survey questionnaire of 852 students and 245 lecturers to examine variations of lecturers' and students' perceptions of  various aspects of creativity and effectiveness in teaching. Research results indicate that the importance of creativity, and of creative teaching, may vary depending on the role of the observer. (HB)",

Data came from: the 1990 Entering Student Survey (student characteristics, academic skills, study habits and plans); the 1990-91 Freshman Outcomes Survey (family support, study habits, faculty/staff contact, social and classroom experiences, academic plans, academic/personal growth, and school satisfaction); and the 1998 Student Information Records System (grade point average, credits, departure status, and degree obtained). Data were combined to explore relationships among pre-college characteristics, freshman year experiences, freshman year outcomes, and long-term educational outcomes, including self-reported growth and objective performance records.  Researchers developed intellectual, personal, and overall growth measures from lists of specific skills self-reported by students concerning their own growth at the university. The study investigated what led to positive outcomes in the freshman year and which of the pre-college and freshman year variables were most influential in predicting longer-term outcomes assessed by the 8-year college history. Results indicated that freshman college experiences were better predictors of outcome than were pre-college characteristics. Classroom experiences, faculty relations, and peer relations were the most influential predictors of subsequent outcomes. (Contains 9 references.) (SM)",

        "description":"This study focuses on initial student interest in or demand for public, land-grant universities (PLGUs) within the six New England states for the years 1976-99. The study has three distinguishing features. First, time-series data for the six New England states are combined into a panel data set, and fixed effects and random effects models are used to estimate how selected factors affect the demand for PLGUs in the region. Second, this study utilizes data on the proportion of seniors in each state who had their test scores sent to particular PLGUs within the region as a measure of demand. Finally, student demand models are estimated for (1) demand for their own in-state PLGU and (2) demand for the University of New Hampshire among non-New Hampshire seniors in New England. The  results for New England show that the changing pattern in the demand for PLGUs from 1976 through the late 1990s has been largely due to: changes in the relative price of attending public and competing institutions; changes in median family income; and the rising degree aspirations of college-bound seniors.

        "description":"This study investigated how minority versus nonminority students performed on different measures of college progress, particularly as the two groups experienced the campus environment in different ways. The study also examined whether satisfaction with various aspects of the college environment affected student growth and development more in some outcome areas than others and whether differences existed between minority and nonminority responses. Satisfaction was measured in four areas (faculty-student relations, academic atmosphere, campus climate, and college experience) and compared to four types of college outcome (math and science development, intellectual and skill development, career development, and problem solving development). Full-time undergraduate students at one  university completed the College Outcomes Survey, which asked about student background and status; the importance of certain college outcomes and progress made toward the outcomes; satisfaction or dissatisfaction with given aspects of the college; and how the college experience contributed to student growth. Student satisfaction with faculty-student relations, program quality, and campus environment closely related to student progress in specific areas. Observed relationships were the same for minority and nonminority students. In nearly every case, student satisfaction with various aspects of the college experience positively related gains made in college. (Contains 32 references.) (SM)",

Impact studies can be useful for evaluating unit and individual performance, resource allocation, and planning. In higher education, impact studies can be used to demonstrate how work done by people on campus is worth continuing and how the work merits support from federal and state governments, funding agencies, students, parents, and the general population. The paper begins by defining impact studies, explaining that they provide a distinction between outcomes (achievements) and impacts. The next section discusses the development of a system of  gathering and using impacts, focusing on problems and procedures and highlighting seven principles (e.g., if there is a lot of support for this activity, find something else to do; start with a likely success; become a master scavenger; commit to long-term follow-up; and expect expenses). The paper presents examples of impact evaluation, discusses relationships to other effectiveness and evaluation models, and notes pilot project results. (Contains 14 references.) (SM)",

The study compared statistical and substantive results of multilevel modeling (or hierarchical linear modeling) to the traditional regression approach. Two dependent variables measured faculty research productivity: (1) publications over 2 years and dollar amount of external research funding and (2) total external grant dollars for the 1992-93 academic year on which the faculty member was a principal or co-principal investigator. The independent variables included human capital, personal tastes, career status, teaching workload, demographics, and academic discipline. Data analysis indicated that using  multilevel modeling was very important in studying faculty productivity. There were significant relationships between several independent variables and faculty publications. The results suggest that the group effect of academic field of study should be accounted for when modeling faculty productivity. The results also suggest that faculty work is extremely complex and cannot be explained using single measures for research productivity. (Contains 30 references.) (SM)",

The process is designed to address the next step of what to do with institutional effectiveness data after it has been collected and reported. Many institutional effectiveness processes stop with the publishing of data. While this serves accountability purposes, it does little to ensure that data will be used for improvement purposes. To stimulate improvement around the college's core indicators of effectiveness, Estrella Mountain has designed a group interview process with stakeholders responsible for delivering on different aspects of the mission and goals of the college. Using a set of interview questions, the college  stakeholders identify standards for the core indicators of effectiveness, develop strategies for improvement, and take ownership of these strategies. The interview approach has been used by the college for 3 years and has resulted in enhanced awareness of the institutional effectiveness process, increased participation by all stakeholders, and the development of concrete improvement strategies that are reviewed on an annual basis.

Step one involved identifying the need for information as different institutional changes were implemented. Over 4 years, the university: launched a comprehensive strategic growth plan; designed and implemented a new university-wide system of academic program review; created an Office of Teaching and Learning and Assessment; implemented initiatives under a Title III Strengthening Institutions grant to improve undergraduate retention and advising; and began moving administrative information systems to PeopleSoft. Step two involved identifying the program portfolio and the opportunity to change. The portfolio unified and integrated ongoing  university change initiatives rather than increasing their numbers. Step three involved defining the structure of the portfolio program, which brings together information from many sources and provides it to managers and decision makers in an integrated way. Step four involved defining the program portfolio's data elements (student and faculty demographics and activities, programmatic activity, financial information, program characteristics, and program outcomes). Step five involved clarifying the customers and their needs, emphasizing academic program review, management decision making, and strategic planning. Step six involved examining next steps in developing and using program portfolios. (Contains 25 references.) (SM)",

It examined influences upon time-to-degree for all students earning Bachelor's Degrees in 1998-99 at one university. Dependent variables were total elapsed semesters to degree attainment and total semesters enrolled. Data on students' time-to-degree, demographic and precollege educational characteristics, remedial course and summer freshman program participation, enrollment behaviors, and academic outcomes were assembled into a series of files and merged with student financial aid data and data from two surveys of students' pre-enrollment perceptions and graduates' undergraduate experiences. Average credit hours per term strongly predicted more rapid degree  completion. Transfer credit hours was the only strong predictor of credit hour load per term. Total credit hours earned strongly predicted time-to-degree. A positive relationship existed between number of summer semesters enrolled and longer time to degree. The paper discusses: implications for academic advising concerning student course loads; mixed implications for the role of financial aid speculation over the negligible role of student experience and perception variables on time-to-degree; and recognition that timely degree completion is only one of several desirable student outcomes.

All participated in at least one regional or national e-mail listserv or electronic newsletter serving college/university institutional research professionals. Participants received e-mailed information about the Web-based survey, which collected data on institutional characteristics and assessed respondents' opinions on implementation of institutional effectiveness plans, programs, and procedures. Two-thirds of the 324  respondents reported that their campuses had institutional effectiveness plans. Nearly half of the plans were developed collaboratively. Stronger support for the plans related to their being viewed as important and their outcomes being integrated into planning efforts. Academics and administration were the areas most likely to be evaluated. Implementation was most often seen as a job requiring several people. Respondents reported that institutional research offices were charged with implementing the plan. Several technical issues were encountered in collecting data using listservs and Web surveys (e.g., lack of control over who received the communications). (Contains 17 references.) (SM)",

Data analysis indicated that the success of the cohort based on traditional measures of persistence,  graduation, and transfer to the university was 44.7 percent, but after transfer, the success rate dropped to 35 percent. The incidence of non-linear transfer behavior, such as returning transfer, re-transfer, and co-enrollment was small but diverse.

The conceptual model of assessment closely parallels systematic scientific inquiry, especially the portion of inquiry that corresponds to qualitative research. Therefore, the paper argues that the conduct of assessment based on this model is qualitative research that often takes the form of both action research and institutional research. The paper reviews quantitative and qualitative research paradigms and defines assessment, action research, and institutional research. The conceptual model explains assessment in higher education  at all levels of the academy and in regard to all of the academy's ends. Within the parameters of this conceptual model and the purposes of assessment, three primary foci of assessment (classroom assessment, program review, and institutional impact) are discussed. The paper posits that action research and institutional research are the forms of systemic inquiry that support the institution's internal information management and planning needs and the need to meet accountability mandates from external constituencies. It also discusses generalizability, suggesting that generalization is the responsibility of the reader and not the institutional researcher. (Contains 11 references.) (SM)",

A group of 816 students received a notice that included their grade and suggestions for improving performance. Students' advisors also received copies of the notices. A month after receiving the notice, students completed a Web-based survey that asked what actions they took after receiving the notice and how they felt when they saw it.

Results indicated that early alert notices  stimulated students to take action, generally such personal actions as studying more or getting better organized. Students were likely to talk with parents or peers regarding their notices.

Data from the 1998 National Educational Longitudinal Study were used to examine the three tasks. A model was developed to portray the college choice process as the by-product of interrelated influences beginning in 8th grade and continuing until college enrollment. The influences included: academic ability, amount and quality of parental involvement/encouragement, early educational and occupational aspirations, acquisition of college qualifications, and availability of information  about college. Most of the lowest SES 8th graders had parents with no college experience and were exposed to factors placing them at risk of dropping out of high school. About 81 percent of 8th graders who completed the three tasks enrolled in college by 1994. Securing college qualifications correlated with SES, with the lowest SES students least likely to secure minimal qualifications. Parental involvement, early planning for college, and experiencing at-risk factors most affected students' chances of becoming college qualified. Rate of graduation from high school correlated and college application rates varied in direct relation to SES. (Contains 61 references.) (SM)",

The data were compiled from annual surveys of the state's colleges and universities and are presented in the categories of basic student charges, fall enrollments, residence of students, degrees conferred, faculty and staff, and finance. Pennsylvania data are compared with national data drawn from the results of surveys conducted by the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). Major findings include: (1) the increase in undergraduate basic charges was greater than the Consumer Price Index; (2) female enrollments have outpaced male enrollments; (3) over 78 percent of total enrollees were Pennsylvania residents; (4)  the largest growth in degrees conferred occurred at the first-professional and graduate levels; (5) Pennsylvania had the ninth-highest average salary for full-time instructional faculty on nine-month contracts among public four-year institutions in the nation in 1997-98; and (6) total current-funds revenues for public institutions rose to $5.6 billion in 1998-99, an increase of 6.5 percent; expenditures rose similarly.

The report uses data from the Scottish School Leavers' Survey (SSLS), a biennial sample survey of school leavers conducted in the spring after leaving school from 1978 to 1993. It is the first of a series of five reports based on analyses of the SSLS. The report is set in the context of recent developments in Scottish higher education, notably the rapid expansion of participation. It explores key policy issues, including the aim to widen access for school leavers from less advantaged social backgrounds, the role of sub-degree provision, and the role  of secondary grades as preparation for higher education. The report maps school-leaver entry as of 1993, describes recent trends, and models the process of entry in order to understand student-level factors, which influence participation.

The SOAR system collects information about college performance of new high school graduates in Maryland, including: remedial work needed in math, English, and reading; grades in first math and English courses; and cumulative grade point average. Data about students' high school experiences are drawn from the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) and the American College Testing (ACT) program. This report looks at students who graduated from a Maryland high school during the 1997-98 school year and who enrolled in a Maryland college or university during the 1998-99 academic year. All public two- and four-year campuses in  Maryland and 11 state-aided independent institutions are included. The report contains four sections: the first examines the differences between college performance of students who did or did not complete a college preparatory curriculum in high school; the second presents the results of a multiple regression analysis which seeks to identify factors that best predict first-year college performance; the third examines trends in the data over the past five years; and the fourth, new to this year's report, presents the four-year graduation and transfer rates of students from Maryland community colleges and the five-year graduation rates of students from public four-year institutions on the basis of whether or not they took a college preparatory course of study in high school. Thirty-five  tables summarize the data. (CH/EV)",

These include conflicting standards for students, unequal opportunities for different groups of students to succeed in postsecondary education, placement exam confusion and intensive remediation, high college dropout rates, and finger pointing. It then looks at some ways this gap can be addressed by \"institutionalizing\" a K-16 perspective and improving teaching to meet  more demanding K-16 standards. The following suggestions are included: (1) develop standards for teachers that are linked to standards for students; (2) develop new linkages between education school faculty and arts and science faculty; (3) improve teacher recruitment, especially in underserved school districts and subject areas; (4) provide better mentoring and support for new teachers; and (5) rethink and improve professional development.

The study surveyed institutions where the Ed.D. was the first-ever-doctoral degree offered and where the degree has been implemented within the past 15 years. Like SCSU, the surveyed schools were not classified as Doctoral/Research I Universities, and their faculties commonly carried a 9 or more credit hour teaching load. Findings suggested that implementing  the Ed.D. as the first-ever doctoral degree at an institution of higher education has mainly positive implications for the college of education and the university. The university may realize a greater appreciation for research at undergraduate and graduate levels, faculty may have the opportunity to teach doctoral courses and advise doctoral dissertations, students may realize higher career goals, and the campus may gain additional doctoral programs in areas other than education. However, in order to accommodate doctoral-level teaching and research, substantive issues and problems must be resolved pertaining to program development, faculty appointments and new positions, funding, and transforming the campus culture.

However, many voters still favor fair and just means for promoting ethnic diversity in higher education. In light of these new conditions, researchers are interested in finding alternative measures of merit that can be used in the admissions process. One approach to admissions that holds promise is to construct a &quot;merit index&quot; by subtracting the average test score for the individual's high school from their individual score. When this method is used in admissions in addition to the SAT (or other admissions tests), then it is easier to screen a diverse applicant pool. This study assessed the effects of the merit index on persistence in the first  year of college. It compared the predictive capacity of the SAT and the merit index using a set of sequential logistic regressions. It found that the merit index predicts first-year college persistence about as well as the SAT. (Contains 34 references.) (Author/EV)",

Institutions provided information about secondary assessment for placement in college-level courses. The State Regents implemented multiple initiatives to enhance student preparation for college. Improved high school preparation positively affected students' college remediation. Two-year colleges are the primary source of remediation in the State System. Remedial education in higher education serves a  large percentage of students without draining state appropriated funding.

        "author":["Eaton, Judith S."],
        "description":"This paper discusses regional accreditation, a common form of institutional quality assurance, noting its application to distance education. Six core academic values sustain regional accreditation: institutional autonomy; collegiality and shared governance; faculty intellectual and academic authority; the degree; general education; and site-based education and a community of learning. Regional accreditation identifies these core values with institutional quality. Several regional accrediting commissions have addressed distance learning by accommodating distance learning initiatives within existing accrediting standards and developing distance learning guidelines for institutions. As currently configured, regional accreditation standards and the distance education guidelines tend  to focus on similarities between site-based and distance education, which diverts attention from challenges that distance learning poses to each core academic value of accreditation. This paper examines challenges posed by distance learning to each of the six core values, offering a transitional framework for rethinking values and accreditation standards in response to each challenge. The framework highlights differences between distance and site-based learning. It calls for the recalibration of capacity and process standards to reflect the changing role of time and place in higher education delivery. However, it does not address the growing need for accreditors to pay additional attention to educational consequences. (SM)",

Two large volumes have been published on what is known about student learning in college. A distillation of what is known can be extracted from research on: seven principles for good practice in undergraduate education; three critical conditions for excellence; and nine strategies for improving student learning. The seven principles of good practice emphasize: student-faculty contact; student cooperation; active learning; prompt feedback; time on task; high expectations; and respect for diverse talents and ways of knowing. In order to know how students learn, it is  essential to find out what makes them tick. Research should become the working partner of both personal experience with learning and focused conversations about learning with colleagues. Faculty must know what to look for (through research), observe themselves participating in lifelong learning (self-reflection), and be much more aware of students' learning. A powerful advantage of using research findings to start conversations about learning is that it is a way to involve faculty and administrators actively in learning. (Contains 18 references.) (SM)",

TLC provided cognitive, metacognitive, affective, and behavioral skills and literacy training in five areas: basic skills literacy, specialized skills literacy, cultural literacy, multicultural literacy, and composite world literacy. During FOW, students lived together and met with a personal learning specialist. TLC included weekly group meetings with the program director, peer mentoring, and study groups. Data were collected via written assessments of what students felt they could and could not handle during the semester and strengths  and weaknesses of the program. The FOW developed a strong sense of solidarity among 23 participating students and between these students and participating faculty and administrators. This solidarity and initial bonding helped integrate students into the academic, dormitory, and campus life throughout the semester. All 23 students felt they would be more successful academically and socially following the FOW. They all finished the fall semester, and 91 percent preregistered for the spring semester. Their mean fall semester grade point average was 2.3. (Contains 16 references.) (SM)",

The post-tenure review policy was implemented in fall 1987. Two full cycles of periodic 5-year reviews were completed in 1997. Interviews were held with 21 tenured faculty, and separate focus groups were held with deans, department chairs, faculty evaluation review committee members, and union representatives. Tenured faculty and academic administrators completed surveys. There was no consensus on purposes for post-tenure review, though accountability was the most commonly cited purpose. Respondents believed the policy was ineffective.  Faculty felt the review should be retained because of its potential use in professional development and reflection. Faculty were critical of the procedures and processes, while deans and chairs were more positive. Participants identified potential benefits, none of which were being reached because of administrators' inability to explore more strategic policy implementation to achieve desired results. Overall, the policy had many problems, including lack of resources to support faculty development plans. Recommendations for change included changing who performs the reviews and fortifying review outcomes. Interview questions are appended. (SM)",

        "description":"This paper examines the effectiveness of the University of North London's Early Childhood Studies Scheme (ECSS), exploring student characteristics and how its YC100 Study Skills module addressed students' needs. The module empowers nontraditional ECSS students by building a self-confidence and skills infrastructure that teaches them how to study, learn, and communicate in school. Five students participated in the study. They identified need for self-development and improvement as the reason for attending. Students were taught six key components: good students are made, not born; getting the overview is essential; creativity is vital, and it can be taught; knowledge of academic forms or genres eases anxiety and promotes success; fear plays an enormous role and must be actively  addressed; and reflexivity is vital. The five students completed interviews examining their: goals; feelings about study and themselves as students; experiences with ECSS; experiences with the study skills module; experiences with support; and recommendations. Students had clear goals for themselves but were anxious and fearful. They reported positive experiences with the ECSS and gave the YC100 module very positive feedback. Most students were not aware of other university support available. Recommendations emphasized better communication, including more formative feedback. (SM)",

Section 2, &quot;Responding to Diverse Learner Needs,&quot; explains how more Americans are earning college degrees; more employers are creating corporate universities; and baby boomers are likely to continue working longer. Section 3, &quot;Paying for Lifelong Learning,&quot; notes that tuitions are climbing; loans far surpass grants in student aid; and most undergraduate students work while in college. Section 4, &quot;Adapting to the Digital Age,&quot; explains that  Internet technology has spread at a remarkable rate; more institutions are offering online education; and students are using the Internet increasingly for research. Section 5, &quot;Shaping Higher Education for a Global Economy,&quot; describes how the global economy is becoming more integrated; most American undergraduates studying abroad do so in Europe; and the United States has the largest online population.

Section 1 highlights quality control, discussing such key questions as how accountability and responsibility for creating instruction are determined and what the faculty's role is in determining how courses are to be adapted and delivered. Section 2 discusses the trivialization of instruction, noting that adopting instructional media methods deprives faculty of creative roles in instruction. Section 3 discusses the resulting homogenization of instruction. Section 4 examines the timeliness factor, or the loss of dynamic elements in instruction when using this static form of delivery. Section 5 discusses curriculum control, noting the potential for administrative tyranny. Section 6  discusses effects on the institution and the faculty who create such courses. For example, an institution loses control over the product which carries its name and reputation, and faculty who participate in course development for technological delivery take a back seat to production and technical personnel. Section 7 explains how to offer quality off-campus students instruction via modern technology, noting that instruction will be of higher quality if distance learning programs and technologically delivered instruction allow faculty to achieve the full realization of their professional responsibilities.

        "description":"This paper emphasizes the importance of avoiding stereotypes about older people in college and university centers for retirement, noting that members of centers for retirement are members of a generation recently in command. There is much folklore about older people and the aging process, and Americans tend to believe too much in the myths of aging. The sense of group denigration and deindividualization of older people is more pervasive than it has been at any time in the human life cycle since adolescence. Society tends to patronize older people, and this occurs in the university environment as well. Though there are real biological limits set upon people as they age, there are few limits to learning. It is important to take into account individual learning styles in programs  for older people. Older people are different from one another, though they share certain characteristics (e.g., the biological aging process). Older people are a natural resource to be cultivated by younger people. Retirement centers offer intellectual stimuli for healthy, alive individuals. They are not places for rehabilitation but for development. (SM)",

        "description":"This report offers an array of steering mechanisms to help advance South Africa's higher education goals (equity and redress, efficiency, development, and accountability). Building on the experiences of other nations, the paper proposes both base formulas and non-base funding mechanisms that, combined, suggest that such policy-driven steering devices are not only possible, but also desirable in these times of rapid change and increasing instability for higher education. The paper uses three examples (the use of 3-year rolling averages, the realignment of government contribution factors, and the use of a performance-based mini-formula) to demonstrate how these proposals might impact the distribution of base funds. It also illustrates how a new non-base funding stream of  performance-oriented mechanism could be developed. The paper focuses on: the higher education funding context in South Africa; a description of steering mechanisms; the overarching purposes of steering; and policy-driven steering mechanisms. The paper concludes that development of the new funding system must be simultaneous with the restructuring of the entire institutional landscape. Appended are: data on South African higher education trends and influences, a glossary of abbreviations, and a table on alternative calculations of subsidy students. (Contains 31 references.) (SM)",

        "description":"This literature review assesses where higher education is in relation to faculty development and where faculty development efforts need to go. Literature on faculty development has addressed the nature of faculty development in light of faculty needs at various stages of their professional careers. Results suggest that career stage affects teachers' attitudes and job behaviors. The literature also indicates that faculty development is closely related to strengthened faculty morale and vitality, improved teaching performance, enhanced research motivation and productivity, and increased job satisfaction and work commitment. Some research shows that teaching conditions and quality of life affect faculty morale. In order to foster faculty development and enhance faculty improvement  programs, specific methods have been suggested and practiced, including: treating faculty with respect, valuing faculty as professionals, allowing faculty governance, and offering rewards. Some paid leave programs, including sabbaticals, have been appreciated by teachers because they provide sufficient time to carry out research projects or engage in instructional development education. Faculty commitment is a key element in effective faculty development. Results justify the necessity for faculty development as a means of improving higher education institutions as a whole.

The university has a body of courses that are fundamental to leadership instruction. The minor gathers those courses into a curriculum that provides the expertise students need to assume a leading role in an organization. Most of the course options for the theoretical component of the minor fulfill Livingston's area requirements and count for departmental credit. Because it regroups existing courses, the program maximizes the benefits of those courses. The theoretical courses are supplemented by a series of extracurricular programs that give students the opportunity to meet with their cohorts and apply their knowledge of organizational leadership. In all, the minor  consists of 21 credits divided into 2 foundation courses, 3 theory courses, and 3 applications. A presentation outline describes the institutional framework of the minor program and emphasizes &quot;Logic, Reasoning, and Persuasion&quot; and &quot;Introduction to Organizational Leadership&quot; as key courses in the minor program. The final section of the outline provides a model approach to the development of a leadership education program, listing the steps that should be taken. (SLD)",

        "description":"This paper examines trends in access rates to the University of Wisconsin (UW) system from the mid 1970s to the late 1990s with particular emphasis on how enrollment management planning for the mid to late 1990s affected the overall UW system access rate for resident undergraduates and how the application and admission patterns of these high school graduates contribute to that rate. Also examined is the degree to which access rates by gender and race/ethnicity parallel the overall UW system access rate. The effect of academic preparation on application, admission, yield (proportion of admitted students who enroll), and access rates is analyzed. The focus is on immediate new freshmen, students who apply for admission to UW institutions for the fall term following high school  graduation. Access rates for immediate new freshmen rose between 1976 and 1986 and have remained steady for the past few years at approximately 33%. System access rates for Wisconsin immediate new freshmen have consistently been more than 10 points above the national average. Men have a lower access rate than women, and that gap is increasing. The access rate for students of color was relatively stable between 1995 and 1999, even though enrollments of immediate new freshmen of color grew 35%. An examination of academic preparation shows that UW institutions are attracting well-qualified students. The admission rate for fall 1994 was 94%, and the yield rate was 79%. The yield rate for whites is almost seven percentage points higher than the yield rate for admitted students of color.  Students of color constituted approximately 10% of Wisconsin's high school graduates and the same proportion of ACT Assessment test takers. However, students of color represented only 7% of immediate new freshmen enrollments. One of the objectives of the UW enrollment management system will be to increase the number of students of color enrolling. Fourteen appendixes contain detailed tables of admissions and yield information. (Contains 14 tables.) (SLD)",

This represented an increase of 1,319 students and $16.2 million above 1995-1996 levels. Over half of all undergraduates and one-third of graduates received financial aid in 1996-1997. Over four out of five financial aid dollars (84%) in the UW system were provided, or underwritten, through a federal program, and state funded sources accounted for 8% of the total, with the remaining dollars from institutional (4%) and other sources (3%). In 1996-1997, 70% of total aid was in the form of loans, 27% was in the form of grants, and 3% was  in the form of work programs. Over two-fifths (41%) of all UW students borrowed through a financial aid loan program in 1996-1997, and less than one-third (29%) received grants. Approximately one quarter of the undergraduate aid recipients were classified as independent for financial aid purposes. Nearly three-fifths (58%) of all UW resident undergraduates have debt on completing a Bachelor's degree, compared to two-thirds in the mid-1980s. The average undergraduate's debt on graduation was $13,332, and 27% of this debt came from non-need based loans. Five appendixes contain technical notes, detailed data tables, and a discussion of the design of a financial aid package. (Contains 19 tables.) (SLD)",

        "description":"In 1995 the Alabama Commission on Higher Education developed a new 5-year plan for higher education that emphasized cooperation among all stakeholders. The plan is designed to focus attention on important strategic issues facing Alabama higher education and the state, and to forge new or enhanced relationships to work cooperatively toward common goals and issue resolution. In establishing the framework for higher education planning, it is necessary to consider the current system of higher education in the state, the shared-power environment for issue resolution, and trends and issues likely to affect higher education. The Commission establishes, in this document, five goals for Alabama higher education: (1) access; (2) cooperation; (3) excellence; (4) responsibility, and (5)  responsiveness. The strategic issues facing Alabama higher education for the 1996-2000 planning period include finding ways to demonstrate educational and financial accountability and ways to respond to demands for educational needs and services. Another strategic issue is that of identifying and addressing access, completion, and equity issues. Some actions are outlined to work on each of these strategic issues as the Alabama system of higher education responds to the needs of students and society through wise stewardship of state resources.

To ensure their continued responsiveness and success, action is needed in four core areas: (1) quality assurance; (2) public engagement; (3) access and inclusion; and (4) communication and advocacy. To ensure the quality of the educational product, college and university presidents and chancellors will have to establish a climate that demands quality, develop the resources to support it, and work for assessment and accountability. To ensure public engagement, it  will be necessary to work for better education at elementary and secondary levels and work closely with communities and businesses. Access and inclusion must be addressed through a variety of approaches so that students receive equal educational opportunities regardless of race and social status. Better communication and advocacy will ensure that the public receives accurate information about the costs of public higher education and the needs of institutions and students. (SLD)",

        "description":"As part of a review of functions and administrative processes, the Illinois Board of Higher Education commissioned a comprehensive evaluation of higher education grant programs. The evaluation focused on the goals defined in the policy document, &quot;The Illinois Commitment,&quot; and the extent to which the grant programs are contributing to the achievement of these goals. The evaluation process included a review of funding trends and the policy history of each program. Statutes, administrative rules, and policy studies were reviewed. Appropriations were considered in the context of the entire higher education budget, and participation in grant programs among sectors and methods of distribution were examined. Additional information was collected in a series of meetings in August 2000.  Summaries of these discussions are included in section I of this report. Section II provides the findings of the evaluation and the consultants' recommendations for consideration by the Board of Higher Education. The programs evaluated were: (1) Health Education; (2) Financial Assistance; (3) Higher Education Cooperation ACT (usually known as HECA); (4) Engineering Equipment; (5) Educational Opportunity; (6) Work Study; (7) Graduate Incentive; (8) Research Matching; (9) Illinois Century Network; and (10 ) Eisenhower. Overall, the grant programs were found to have credible policy foundations. They have been administered with close attention to the priorities for higher education, and they reflect a substantial commitment to access and success for minority students. Many of the programs  leverage higher education's resources effectively. Overall, there appears to be a high level of satisfaction with the grant programs among the higher education community. Some areas for improvement are outlined. An attachment contains the goals of the &quot;Illinois Commitment.&quot; (SLD)",

        "description":"Changes in the system for the delivery of health care constitutes a challenge for U.S. academic medical centers (AMCs), which are being called on to produce physicians who can function effectively in the 21st century. This paper discusses issues facing AMCs and suggests some steps that might be taken to deal with the challenges these issues present. There is considerable evidence that the demand for physicians is decreasing as the United States moves from a delivery system based on fee for service to one based on managed care. In addition, there is an oversupply in many specialties, and the oversupply of specialists seems likely to last for many years. Other problems are faced by the geographic and racial maldistribution of physicians. Minorities are still underrepresented in the  physician workforce. Still another issue is the concern that current medical education and training programs are not preparing physicians adequately for practice in a health care setting dominated by managed care. The numbers and types of physicians needed in the future will be influenced heavily by developments occurring in other segments of the health care industry. Some steps are already being taken to address some of these issues. Many medical schools are revising their curriculums to incorporate items of importance to managed care. There is also some optimism that the problems of physician oversupply will be addressed in the near future and Congress has requested that the Institute of Medicine develop some options it can consider in revising Medicare graduate medical education  programs.

        "description":"For more than 70 years researchers have studied the validity of the Scholastic Assessment Test I (SAT I) and its predecessor, the Scholastic Aptitude Test, through hundreds of validity studies conducted at various colleges using the SAT in their admission process. The majority of these studies use high school records and SAT scores as predictors and freshman grade point average as the criterion representing success in college. Validity studies have consistently found that high school grades and SAT scores together are substantial and significant predictors of achievement in college. In these studies, although high school grades are typically slightly better predictors of achievement, SAT scores add significantly to the prediction. These findings tend to hold for all subgroups of  students and for all types of measures of academic achievement: freshman grades, course grades, cumulative grades, and measures of persistence. Because persistence in college is influenced substantially by nonacademic factors, the validity coefficients for predicting persistence are slightly lower than for predicting specific academic criteria. For predicting nonacadmeic criteria and nonacadmeic criteria after college, high school grades and SAT scores are not good predictors. (Contains 1 figure, 6 tables, and 19 references.) (SLD)",

Predictions of freshman grade-point average (FGPA) for the entering class of 1994 (who had taken the old SAT) were compared with predictions for the class of 1995 (who had taken the new SAT I: Reasoning Test). The 1995 scores were evaluated both on the original SAT Program scale and on the recentered scale introduced that year. The changes in the test content and recentering of the score scale had virtually no impact on predictive validity. Other analyses indicated that the SAT I predicts FGPA about equally well across different ethnic groups. Correlations were slightly higher for higher levels of parental education and  family income, and grades were more predictable for students with intended majors in math/science (mathematics, engineering, and biological or physical sciences) than for students with other intended majors. Correlations of the SAT I and the composite of SAT I scores and high school grade point average (HSGPA) with FGPA were generally higher for women than for men, although this pattern was reversed at college with very high mean SAT I scores. When a single prediction equation was used for all students, men tended to get lower grades than predicted, and women got higher grades than predicted. African American and Hispanic/Latino men received lower grades than predicted, but women in these groups performed as predicted by the composite. Both men and women with intended majors in  math/science got lower grades than would be predicted by an equation based on scores for all enrolled students.

        "description":"This report discusses policies that guide housing for students on college and university campuses in matters that concern relations among status groups based on ethnic, religious, racial, and sexual backgrounds and orientations. The issue of self-segregation has emerged as a crucial one to many colleges as enrollment of minorities has increased. Although self-segregation does not start or stop at the door of the college residence hall, housing arrangements play a significant role in promoting or deterring interaction, dialogue, and friendship. There are several views of how a university can best foster a pluralistic campus. The first approach, the Integration Model, stresses the importance of interaction between people of different races, religions, ethnicities, and creeds. The  second approach, the Multicultural Model, emphasizes a plurality of cultures and values, as well as the importance of recognizing diversity. The third approach acknowledges the merits of both the integration and multicultural models, but this model, the Diversity within Unity Model, strives for a society of layered loyalties in which people have allegiance to their particular subgroups and to the greater society in which they live. Some examples of each of these models in practice illustrate strengths and shortcomings of each. The integration model appears to be too confining in practice, and the multicultural model seems to be too polarizing. Integrating housing at universities where there is a demand for self-segregated residence halls can be expected to exacerbate tensions without  curtailing separatism. The diversity within unity model appears most likely to preserve cultural identities while fostering better intergroup relations. (Contains 44 endnotes.) (SLD)",

        "description":"Some of the things parents can do to prepare Canadian high school students for success in college are outlined. Helping students prepare for a university education is very important at this time because of new job skill requirements, a potential shortage of university teachers in Canada that may reduce the number of students admitted to college, and the increasing numbers of students who will apply. It is essential that students select their high school courses to satisfy the prerequisites for admission to the university program of choice. Parents can help students find out about requirements and financial aid available. They can also help students prepare for life on campus without many of the sources of support they had at home. Coping skills are very important in the first  months of college life, and parents can help students develop these skills. As students develop a sort of social cushion, they can begin to learn &quot;tricks of the trade&quot; from each other, especially in developing writing skills. Parents can encourage students to use all the resources available from the university and their social networks. Some special initiatives are available for students with various forms of physical or learning disability, and parents can help students find out about these programs. In addition to helping students obtain information and develop survival skills, parents can help them in the transition to college by encouraging the belief that they will be able to manage challenges they encounter.

A variety of key participants in the student loan market were interviewed and/or surveyed, including federal officials, eligible lenders, ineligible lenders, guaranty agencies, and loan servicing organizations.

Records were available for 916 graduate students who were considered at risk because they did not meet the minimum admission requirements but were given the opportunity to begin coursework. Success was measured in two ways: (1) whether or not the student completed the degree; and (2) categorization of the graduate grade point average obtained after 9 hours of graduate coursework as either 3.5 or above or below 3.5. The predictor variables included Graduate Record  Examination (GRE) scores, undergraduate grade point average, Carnegie classification of the student's undergraduate institution, and personal variables. GRE scores were combined with undergraduate grade point averages as compensatory and conjunctive to determine the best predictor for each area. The accuracy of prediction using the logistic regression models ranged from 63 percent to 84 percent. (Author/EV)",

Academic records of 918 graduate students who were classified as at risk (i.e., did not meet minimum admission requirements but were given an opportunity to take classes to show their proficiency at the graduate level) were analyzed. Success was defined as completion of the graduate degree, and the predictor variables studied were Graduate Record Examination (GRE) score, graduate grade point average (GGPA) in the first nine hours of graduate study, undergraduate grade point average (UGPA), age, gender, academic area of study, and type of institution from which the baccalaureate degree was earned. When all  records were analyzed, the GRE verbal score combined with either UGPA or GGPA were significant predictors of degree completion. The highest graduation rate occurred among students who earned their undergraduate degrees from master's level institutions; students from bachelor's institutions had the lowest graduation rate. The results varied, however, when individual academic areas were assessed. (Contains 44 references.) (Author/EV)",

During the course, two working methods were used: free debate and role play. The aim of the study was to clarify how these two working methods activated students in mutual argumentative dialogue and affected its quality. The research questions were: (1) &quot;How interactive were the students' messages?&quot;; (2) &quot;How argumentative was the interaction?&quot;; (3) &quot;What roles did the students assume during the interaction?&quot;; and (4) &quot;Was the quantity and quality of interaction affected by working method and gender?&quot; An analysis of students' messages indicated that most (78 percent) were interactive, but most of those only involved two students. Most  messages took a neutral position. Thus, findings suggested that one of the tasks of the course, to encourage students to engage in active argumentative discussion with contributions by many students, was not satisfactorily achieved. Role playing increased argumentation, and gender differences were noted. (Contains 17 references.) (EV)",

The seven sections of this handbook (an eighth will follow) explain the accreditation process of the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada (ATS). The first section, &quot;An Introduction to Accreditation by ATS,&quot; provides brief descriptions of the meaning, purposes, characteristics, and benefits of ATS accreditation. Section 2, &quot;Guidelines for Conducting an Institutional Self-Study,&quot; provides guidance to schools undertaking a self-study in terms of: (1) the overall purposes of the self-study; (2) the primary work of the self-study; (3) recommended procedures for conducting a self-study; and (4) expectations of the Commission on Accrediting regarding the final  self-study report. Section 3, &quot;Guidelines for Institutions Receiving ATS Accreditation Evaluation Committees,&quot; describes the activities that the school should undertake prior to the visit, during the visit, and following the visit of the evaluation committee. It also describes ATS procedures related to accreditation evaluation visits. Section 4, &quot;Guidelines for Members of ATS Accreditation Committees,&quot; presents guidelines on: (1) the qualifications, appointment, and expectations of committee members; (2) the work of the committee, including preparation for the visit, conducting the visit, and tasks that follow the visit; (3) a typical schedule; and (4) administrative procedures and policies. The fifth section, &quot;Using the ATS Standards of Accreditation in Institutional Evaluation,&quot;  discusses: (1) how characteristics of the standards influence their use in institutional evaluation; (2) how the general model of evaluation in the ATS standards informs the self-study and accreditation peer processes; and (3) questions for each area of the standards that schools can ask in the context of their self-studies and accreditation committee members can ask in the context of their evaluation visit. Section 6, &quot;Guidelines Adopted by the ATS Commission on Accrediting,&quot; contains guidelines on: (1) petitioning the ATS Commission on Accrediting for approval of extension education programs; (2) evaluation of proposals for programs of international theological education; (3) petitioning the Commission for approval of new or revised degree programs; and (4) petitioning the Commission  for candidacy for accredited status. Section 7, &quot;Guidelines for Evaluating Globalization in ATS Schools,&quot; assists schools in the self-study process to consider how they will address the globalization theme in the ATS standards and assists accreditation committees in the evaluation of institutional and educational efforts toward globalizing theological education.

The tandem effort was designed to encourage students to explore the subjects more deeply than would have been likely in one class alone. In addition to description of the teaching effort, the paper includes discussion of linking macro-level studies with micro-level experiential essays, timing of the course material, using Appalachian and class inequality as a framework for understanding other forms of oppression and the integration of oppressions, and reinterpreting Christianity to challenge rather than justify inequality. The paper concludes that pairing  the writing and sociology courses, while not entirely successful in ridding all students of entrenched belief systems that reinforce oppression, makes the task more enjoyable and effective.

        "description":"This paper, the third in a series of Research Informing Practice Short Papers commissioned by the National TRIO Clearinghouse, reviews some of the recent literature related to student retention in higher education, with particular emphasis on factors affecting students from low income and first generation backgrounds. According to the paper, this emphasis was chosen for two reasons. First, because students from first generation and low income backgrounds are among the least likely to be retained through degree completion, institutional retention efforts must take the needs of such students into account if more equitable educational attainment rates are desired. Second, strategies that work for first generation and low income students are likely to be successful for the general  student population, as well. By contrast, strategies that are designed for general campus populations without taking into account the special circumstances and characteristics of first generation and low income students will not often be successful for the latter. After describing theoretical models of retention, special characteristics of these students, and retention efforts addressing them, the paper concludes by recommending promising strategies for implementation by Student Support Services programs, McNair programs, and other programs addressing the needs of these students. It suggests that structured first-year and learning community programs respond in practical ways to established retention theory and to the specific needs and characteristics of students from low income and first  generation backgrounds.

The publication discusses different modes of rationality, including institutional, legal, technical, economic, political, and personal.

The Commission on Higher Education and the Adult Learner has outlined five priorities for adult education that demand attention and action: (1) occupational maintenance, education aimed at helping people do their jobs more effectively; (2) retraining for displaced workers; (3) equal opportunity for all students; (4) eliminating adult illiteracy; and (5) achieving competence in the information age. These five priorities are not an all-inclusive agenda, but they illustrate some areas in which individual institutions might bring their own resources to bear. Educators must examine their own institutions to see how  best each can serve the adult learner. A more effective division of labor among the providers of adult education is required. The development of rigorous standards for continuing education programs is needed, as is the recruitment of high quality administrators and faculty. Colleges and university divisions of continuing education must be responsive to new markets and the special needs of adults. Stronger alliances must be built between colleges and universities and other providers of adult education. A final point is that, to meet the needs of adult learners, educators must urge federal, state, and local governments to support continuing education. (SLD)",

Today, the United States is no longer an industrializing nation, and the relevance of higher education is in danger of diminishing. As the United States becomes a technological, automated, information-based society, communication is replacing production as the most important factor in the economy. Higher education has a structure well-adapted to meet a clear set of national needs, but those needs are no longer top national priorities. Major realignments will be necessary. The most important change will be in the nature of  the student body served by higher education. In the information age, almost everyone is a student, and adult learners will be an ever more important factor in U.S. higher education. Continuing education programs are a crucial means for the dissemination of new information, and they are among the few reliable means for maintaining professional competence in a world of rapid change. By their structure and fundamental tenets, continuing education programs have a primary focus on learning as a lifelong process that will make them natural coordination points between colleges and students who choose to keep working for a degree after launching a career.

        "description":"Committee R on Government Relations of the American Association of University Professors created a subcommittee on distance learning to explore some aspects of distance learning. Distance learning is the process in which the education of a student occurs when the educator and the student are separated geographically, and communication is accomplished through a form of technology. The committee, recognizing that distance learning is a current reality with nearly unlimited growth potential, examined questions of how distance learning can be used to maximize the learning experience of the student and how the faculty's traditional role in determining academic and pedagogical issues can ensure that maximization. One issue of interest that the Association is strongly committed to is  the importance of academic freedom in a classroom setting, regardless of the technological medium used to transmit the course material. The Association has not published a formal policy statement governing intellectual property rights, but two intellectual property issues seem essential in the distance learning context: (1) the ownership and control of the intellectual property in a distance learning course; and (2) the effect of different modes of transmission in a distance learning context. Faculty workload is another issue that must be examined in the distance learning context, with some protections for the faculty from excessive workload because of large enrollments or frequent student contacts. As a pedagogical tool, distance learning has the potential to enhance the educational  mission of institutions of higher learning, but cost-cutting aspects of distance learning need to be recognized as often being cost-shifting, and they need to be addressed in the context of the educational mission of the institution.

        "description":"This digest addresses the history, motives, key players, potential effects, and future of the graduate student unionization movement. The course of faulty unionization efforts is intricately tied to that of graduate student unions. Graduate student employees have attempted to unionize at both public and private college and universities. There has been a significant increase in the use of teaching assistants since 1975, and the use of graduate students as instructors has tightened the already competitive academic job market. Graduate students and part-time faculty fear that there will not be space for them in the permanent, full-time, tenured positions of academia, and many look to unionization as a means to secure their current positions and force universities to acknowledge the  dilemma. The issues that typically arise are whether graduate students can be considered employees, and whether unionization is appropriate for graduate students. These decisions vary by state. Within institutions, most opposition has come from full-time tenured faculty. To date, few studies have been conducted on the effects of graduate student unions, but universities without graduate assistant unions and with heavy use of part-time faculty and graduate students have experienced stagnation in full-time faculty salaries. The future of graduate student unionization is uncertain, although in public higher education institutions, the path appears to be widening for such unions. Graduate student unions at private institutions face additional complications, and the issues related to these  unions merit further consideration. (Contains 14 references.) (SLD)",

In recent years there has been a particular emphasis on cross-cultural comparisons of common concerns, as evidenced by the growing number of journals that focus on international education. The new knowledge-based economy has resulted in a move toward utilitarian views of higher education in which economic values are emphasized and fiscal resources are the true measure of value. This change in values requires balancing the focus of economic growth with the traditional functions of universities. Several other trends notable in the literature about international higher education are seen in the interest expressed in: (1) bureaucratization; (2) accountability; (3) quality; (4) access;  (5) redefining higher education; (6) globalization; and (7) lifelong learning and continuing education. Higher education is a priority in every country. Accountability and quality movements have been going on for years in some countries, and these countries can offer assistance to others. Entrepreneurialism is a growing model, and the impact of the shift in this direction needs further exploration, especially since so many commentators advocate this model. (Contains 21 references.)

        "description":"Financial issues remain a concern in the higher education literature. From the early to mid-1990s, cost containment was viewed as the primary solution to strapped finances. Several factors altered the higher education landscape in the latter part of the 1990s as the stronger economy benefited many campuses. This economic upswing cannot last forever, and some campuses are anticipating a downturn in the economy. A review of the literature on finance in higher education revealed some trends: (1) an increase in public funding; (2) the use of funding priorities; (3) focus on faculty salary issues; (4) use of profit sharing; (5) use of multiple financial strategies; (6) new revenue generation; (7) the proliferation of for-profit higher education; and (8) increased marketing. Although  it is often difficult for researchers to keep up with changes in practices and market conditions and to provide educators with needed information, innovative ideas are shared in the literature about promising models. This type of sharing is profitable for the collective future of higher education institutions. (Contains 15 references.) (SLD)",

A large percentage of the literature from 1999-2000 on administration describes the common themes of presidential leadership, leadership/management styles, administrator stress and role confusion, lack of training for administrators, and surveys of staff or faculty in different positions examining role alteration. Important trends reflected in the literature on administration include: (1) management fads; (2) commercialization; (3) privatization; (4) determining priorities; (5) human interaction; (6) mediation; (7) planning; (8) legal issues; (9) diversity; (10) assessment; (11) technology; and (12)  collaboration. These trends demonstrate the need to reconcile corporate and academic values. Performance assessment, planning, and legal issues reflect the rise of corporate values, whereas human interaction, diversity, collaboration, and mediation represent the traditional values of the academy. The current literature on administration reflects an attempt to blend these values. Although there is a significant amount of literature discussing these themes, little, if any, research has been conducted on the impact of blending these values or on strategies for resolving tensions. The administration of the university has become the seat of the battle over what the university of the 21st century will look like. (Contains 31 references.) (EMS)",

Perhaps no other trend has grown as rapidly as the literature on external constituencies, outreach, and public relations. This increase makes it clear that higher education institutions are focused on ways to develop relationships with businesses, non-profit organizations, schools, communities, and political organizations. These partnerships are commonly referred to as the \"responsive university\" or \"engaged campus.\" Typically outreach was seen as being important to a democratic society and for improving the economy. These traditional arguments have been refined to be responsive to the new knowledge  society, economy, and political system with a focus on: (1) the responsive university; (2) multidisciplinary research; (3) business partnerships; (4) K-16 partnerships; and (5) international outreach. Many institutions are developing models to serve as guides for developing partnerships. As partnerships become implemented, a balance between traditional academic values and the different value systems of outside groups must be found. External partnerships should not be limited to the local community. Emphasis should be placed on building an infrastructure for collaboration on international outreach. The social value of colleges and universities to prepare young people for their roles in society as it exists today and creating a new and potentially better society must be acknowledged.

        "description":"Educational Research Information Center (ERIC) Trends are analyses of higher education literature contained in the ERIC database, describing major concerns in institutional practice. There has been little real change in the literature on faculty in the last 5 years. Workload for faculty remains higher than many professions, and faculty often experience acute conflict as a result of the various roles they must assume. Advocates for new approaches continue to propose new visions. Some newer trends in the literature that higher educators need to be aware of include: (1) the new faculty: older, not more ethnically diverse; (2) internationalized faculty; (3) growth of part-time/contractual faculty; (4) new definitions of research: technology, application, and revenue generation; (5)  fall of tenure and rise of productivity/workload; (6) collective bargaining; (7) rewarding service and the scholarship of teaching; (8) aligning priorities/rewards and mission; and (9) restructuring doctoral programs. Every aspect of the faculty role is being reconceptualized. Workload, attacks of tenure, changing roles, and lack of diversity among faculty have been themes throughout the 1990s. The restructuring of doctoral programs, the scholarship of teaching, and the rewarding of service show promise for assisting in this time of transition. However, the rise in part-time and contract faculty, the growing antagonism represented in the growth of collective bargaining, and the lack of diversification of faculty represent serious looming problems. These interrelated issues need to be  examined together, as they typically are engaged. (Contains 22 references.) (EMS)",

Student demographics/characteristic/profiles, retention, and funding for college were the three most prevalent issues in the literature about students. However, it remains unclear whether and to what degree institutions actually use this information. The amount of research on students has also declined from previous years. The research that was conducted tended to follow traditional themes such as retention, student adjustment, student satisfaction, student development, student access and recruitment, rather than examining new issues such as technology, transfer students, multiple enrollment, student  success, or student outcomes. A few new themes have started to emerge in the literature though, including: (1) ethics and integrity; (2) alcohol use; (3) adult student and graduate student needs; (4) diversity and student access; and (5) student activism. Perhaps the emphasis on integrity is a response to the problems of cheating, alcoholism, and other unethical behaviors. As institutions confront these issues, they must also rethink the needs of students as the enrollment of adult students and graduate students continue to rise. The success of students from diverse backgrounds must also be assured. In previous years, student activism focused on issues of social justice, war, and political and economic problems. However, today's student activism relates closely to these trends seen in the  literature, diversity and integrity. Researchers of students and student development need to keep attuned to these emerging issues. (Contains 25 references.) (EMS)",

Literature on teaching and learning has grown within the higher education literature base over the last decade. However, the themes are basically still the same as they were in the mid 1990s. The emphasis on interdisciplinarity and quality has decreased over the last few years, while discussions of active learning, assessment, and diversity have advanced. However, there was no theme more prevalent in the literature than technology; it comprised approximately 40% of the literature in this area. Research on active learning advocates the benefits and illustrates the positive outcomes it produces. Since  diversity is one of the other major trends in issues in teaching and learning, collaborative learning is demonstrated to have great promise among educators. Research shows that being in an environment with students from diverse backgrounds increases cognitive development and critical thinking. The literature on assessment of learning focuses on how to conduct assessment at the classroom, department, institution, and state level. Alternatives to traditional grading, including student involvement in the grading process, are also being considered among researchers. The results of outcomes research on distance education and technology usage in the classroom have illustrated the value of using both technology and traditional in-person methods to have a balanced and successful experience.  Service learning, learning communities, and an emphasis on the human aspect of teaching reflect a concern with the bureaucratic form of teaching that has emerged within most universities due to the tremendous growth of higher education. Active learning, service learning, learning communities, and technology are seen as the main solutions to this problem. (Contains 31 references.) (EMS)",

The book is organized into 4 parts, with 11 chapters. Part One focuses on identifying the problem with Chapter 1 describing the problem, research questions, significance and limitations of the study, definitions of terms, and research methods and procedures. Part Two illustrates the historical background of the study: the traditional period (57 BC-1910 AD) and the modern era (1910-1990s). Chapter 2 introduces the context of Korean higher education in the traditional era, and Chapter 3 illustrates the background of Korean higher  education in the modern period. Part Three explores the religious and philosophical factors historically influencing Korean higher education from the perspectives of organizational structure, leadership, and organizational culture. Chapter 4 examines Buddhism in the traditional period, Chapter 5 focuses on Confucianism, and Chapter 6 illustrates Christianity and Western thoughts. Chapter 7 discusses Japanese imperialism under Japanese colonial rule, Chapter 8 shifts the focus to Americanism under the U.S. military government, and Chapter 9 analyzes contemporary thoughts on examining the characteristics of contemporary Korean higher education from the perspective of educational administration. Part Four presents a summary, conclusions, and implications for Korean higher education. Chapter  10 describes the summary. Chapter 11 pulls together a general discussion of the implications of evaluations or findings for educational administrators, as well as practitioners, and recommendations for future study. Appendixes contain information on the chronology of Korean history; the development of Korean higher education, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Christianity; the organization of the Ministry of Education and a typical Korean university; statistical data on Korean higher education; and various legislative acts.

This guide, a product of those discussions, highlights case studies and some of the best practices regarding these hateful acts. A hate crime is generally defined as a crime which is motivated by the offender's bias toward the victim's race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, or disability. Universities should have a hate crime policy and procedural administration and law  enforcement protocol in place, and they should cooperate with the CRS to provide mediation and reconciliation services. Reporting procedures should be established to make reporting as easy as possible, including the possibility of accepting confidential reports. Support should be made available to all victims of an incident whether they were directly or indirectly involved. A media policy should also be in place to allow the university to provide accurate and timely information about the episode to the community. Finally, campuses should remember that they are part of the broader community in which they are located. They should unite with other local colleges and their community neighbors against intolerance.

This information, as well as other personnel and faculty workload data, are recorded in CUNY's central administration's computerized City University Personnel System (CUPS). Each campus is required to submit electronically data on faculty workload at the end of each semester and annually. This audit examined CUNY's ability to measure its teaching workload for the period July 1, 1997 through June 30, 1998, specifically looking at what steps CUNY needs to take to improve the reliability of CUPS data for the purpose of measuring and comparing its faculty teaching workload. One of the significant limitations found was that colleges were updating the data to reflect maximum  credit hours permitted under the faculty contract rather than the actual workload performed by the faculty. It was also determined that CUPS showed no teaching workload for some faculty members while other faculty members were credited for non-structured courses such as lectures, independent study, and class sizes of less than six students. In order to accurately access the impacts and validity of the data collected in CUPS, colleges must record their actual teaching workloads, resolve instances where faculty are listed without any teaching workload, implement procedures which provide for the detection and correction of incomplete or inaccurate teaching workload data, and document all formulas and guidelines used in reporting faculty teaching workload to CUPS.

Besides basing these attributes on the best professional judgment of the physicians and medical school faculty, there has been little quantitative research to determine the psychological factors that predict success as a physician, medical student, or premedical student. It was hypothesized that a combination of preadmission factors and psychological variables would predict academic performance in premedical studies better than preadmission alone. Participants (n=371) were premedical students in a combined bachelor's-M.D. degree program. Preadmission factors were obtained from student records and included high school  grade-point averages (GPA), American College Test Composite scores, gender, and racial/ethnic classification. Psychological factors were measured using 40 variables from Cattell's Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire, Lanyon's Psychological Screening Inventory, the California Occupational Preference System Inventory, and a modified Thematic Apperception Test. Results show that psychological factors improved the prediction of overall GPA and college science-mathematics GPA. Multiple correlations for the overall GPA increased from .33 using only preadmission variables to .42 when personality variables were added to the analysis. The science-mathematics GPA correlations showed a similar improvement going from .33 to .43 when the psychological factors were added. Contains 22 references.  (EMS)",

First, it reviews the amount they borrowed as undergraduates, including amounts borrowed through student loan programs, from parents, and from other private sources. It also describes any additional borrowing by those who had enrolled in a graduate degree program. Next, it examines the progress that borrowers had made in repaying their loans by 1997. Finally, the study describes their debt burden by examining the relationship between student loan payments and income and by searching for other indications of the impact of borrowing. Borrowers at various levels are compared to nonborrowers in terms of their  expenditures for certain major items such as rent or a mortgage, a car, and credit card purchases, and their specific lifestyle choices such as family formation, buying a home or car, and savings. The analysis uses data collected through the 1992-93 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study and two follow-ups conducted in 1994 and 1997. Conclusions show that about one-half of all 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients borrowed to help pay for their undergraduate education, and about one-half of those that went on to graduate school also borrowed. By 1997, 62% of the 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients were debt free. Among those with no further enrollment after their bachelor's degree, those who still had debt in 1997 owed and average of $7,100, and were making loan payments averaging  $151 per month. Eighty-eight percent were employed full-time, earning an average of $35,300. Overall, borrowing does not appear to affect major lifestyle choices, purchases, or the propensity to save.

While the 4.4% increase in tuition and fees and the 5.0% increase in room and board from 1999-2000 to 2000-2001 represent a slightly higher rate of increase than the previous year's, such increases remain near their lowest point in more than a decade. In comparison to the national average, American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU) institutions maintained the same rate of increase, but average tuition and fees remain below the average for all public four-year institutions ($3,190 compared to $3,510). At the master's level, the average increase nationally was 5%, while for AASCU  institutions it was 4.6%. At the doctoral level, the national average increase was 4.5%, while at AASCU institutions the increase averaged a slightly higher 4.7%. The findings from this data underscore for all public four-year institutions the relationship between states' economic and fiscal conditions and its tuition rates. The past several years have been marked by economic expansion and significant budget surpluses, which have helped state colleges and universities to post only modest tuition increases. As the economy shows signs of settling, many states are becoming more conservative in their fiscal decision-making. As a result, the rate of increase for student charges has edged up slightly. Understanding this relationship, particularly in light of the fact that higher education is  the largest single discretionary item in most states' budgets, is important to crafting tuition policy that can moderate the boom/bust cycle that has manifested itself over the last two decades.

        "description":"This booklet provides basic information about selecting an educational opportunity abroad. Its chief focus is on postsecondary academic programs, but it also includes information related to work, travel, and volunteer programs in other countries. The first step to studying abroad should be to define one's goals for doing so. The next step should be to identify programs that match defined objectives. Students going abroad today have a wider choice of programs to choose from then ever before. Students in all fields can choose programs of varying length. They can choose to study independently through direct enrollment in a foreign university or participate in a U.S.-sponsored program, or just participate in an internship or summer study program. The next step should be to develop a  plan that includes evaluating language skills, arranging for academic credit, setting up transportation and housing, getting the proper paperwork done, and setting up finances. Programs sponsored by U.S. institutions tend to be more expensive, but they also tend to include more of the major expenses: tuition and fees, room and board, books, local transportation, and medical insurance. Students enrolled in an academic program that normally includes a formal program of study abroad may also be considered for federal financial aid. Other opportunities abroad should also be investigated including, learning vacations, volunteer work camps, trainee programs, and working or teaching abroad.

Goodling, Chairman, Committee on Education and the Workforce, House of Representatives follows up on a previous report by the U.S. General Accounting Office to determine changes in college affordability at public and private 4-year colleges and public 2-year colleges in the last 5 years. The analysis focused on comparing changes in college tuition and fees, median household income, and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for academic years 1995-96 through 1999-2000. In conducting this work, tuition and fee data on public and private 4-year colleges and on public 2-year colleges were obtained from the College Board. Median household income data from the Census Bureau and CPI data prepared by the Bureau of Labor Statistics were used to compare  increases in tuition and fees, median household income, and consumer prices. In summary, in the last 4 years since the last report on tuition increases conducted for academic years 1990-91 through 1995-96, private colleges have continued to become less affordable when compared to median household income while public colleges have become slightly more affordable. Four-year private college tuition and fees increased 31% in the 5 years ending in academic year 1999-2000, a faster rate than median household income and the CPI. The 25% increase at both 2-year and 4-year public colleges was slightly less than the increase in median household income, but about twice the increase of the CPI. Contains seven figures. (EMS)",

        "description":"Despite some recent reversals in enrollment trends, the number of baccalaureate degrees in Economics has declined substantially from the beginning of the 1990s. The combination of declining enrollments and the rising costs of higher education has placed pressure on Economics departments to increase their numbers, especially in upper-division courses. Consequently, Economics faculty must consider new ways of attracting students if the discipline is to remain a significant element of the university experience. This paper focuses on the intentional efforts of the part of the Economics program at Belmont University, Nashville, Tennessee, to implement a multidiscipline, multifaceted approach to curriculum and program development. These strategies seek, among other tactics, to overcome  current enrollment and cost inefficiencies through program and course integration with a number of other disciplines within the social sciences and humanities. Appendixes describe the Bachelor of Science programs in International Economics, Political Economy, and Business Administration at Belmont University. (Contains 3 charts and 26 references.)

Fourteen faculty members hired within the last 3 years, whether inexperienced, experienced, or returning (those who had worked in another field before changing careers) were interviewed. One problem faced by these new faculty members was a sense of isolation that made these new teachers think that the problems they were experiencing were unique. Faculty from all three categories expressed surprise at the amount of time spent preparing for class, and most wished that they had more time for scholarship or research. Of the 14 respondents, 6 thought that they understood the  requirements for tenure, and 8 thought that the requirements for gaining tenure were unclear. Most of the respondents felt that the pressures were greater for teaching than for publishing, but most seemed to overwhelmed to think about future scholarly endeavors. When asked about the greatest disappointment they had experienced since taking the position, many cited the labor-management conflicts the campus was experiencing. (Contains 26 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"This paper analyzes approaches to facilitating school-university transition in South Africa and explores the theories underlying this process. A review of the literature and a case study of the process at the University of Port Elizabeth (UPE) show what is happening to the school-university transition at the end of apartheid. UPE has taken a broadly based approach to facilitating this transition, focusing its efforts on what can be achieved on campus in preference to extending its limited resources to the school context. There is a privately sponsored Saturday morning program designed to prepare disadvantaged students for the university. Several modules have been developed to help students adjust to the university, notably &quot;English for Academic Purposes&quot; modules for those for  whom English is a first or second language. Students in South Africa clearly need support in their transition from school to the university, but most support is given on campus shortly before and just after initial registration, with little effort made, for financial and capacity reasons, to prepare students before they reach the university. There is little chance that the selection of the secondary school system described as disadvantaged will emerge from its difficulties in the next few years. This suggests that institutions of higher education will need to provide the best possible context for incoming students. (Contains 65 references.) (SLD)",

A Service and Learning typology suggests four variations found on many campuses in which service and learning have some relationship: (1) service-LEARNING, where the primary emphasis is on learning goals; (2) SERVICE-learning with the primary outcomes service oriented, and learning goals second; (3) service learning, with the service and learning goals separate; and (4) SERVICE-LEARNING, where the goals are of equal weight and enhance each other. In designing programs for linking service and learning, it is necessary to define the participants, their purposes, the entity that  defines the service and learning, the relationship of all parties involved, and the primary learners and servers. These things are determined by looking at the experience of program planners, reflections on changing views of service and learning, openness to new perspectives, and open dialogue. (SLD)",

Interviews were conducted with 47 faulty members at 2 California research universities, 1 public and 1 private. In keeping with the grounded theory approach, an iterative process was used for data analysis. Although this was not intended to be a study of emotions in academic work, the open-ended protocol ensured that issues salient to the respondents would emerge. The passions and personal connections that motivated these educational researchers were unmistakable. Strong drives for social or educational change were tempered, however, by circumstance and process, especially the pressures of  working in an organization in which individuals are expected to work toward promotion and tenure. The tenure process emerged as the strongest indicator of whether these researchers experienced constraints as they set their research agendas. Assistant and associate professors were more likely to think of their work with passion and resolve. The data reveal the complex way in which motivations and constraints interact as new faculty find their place in the academy. (Contains 54 references.) (SLD)",

The goal is to highlight the ethical and procedural issues encountered in the Internet study of an online student culture. The primary purpose of the study was to examine how closeted gay students experience their identity on campus and in an online environment. Other than the invitation to participate, no messages were sent to chat rooms and no conversations or discussions were initiated in the public forums. Researchers only responded to inquiries that were directed to them privately, and were careful to follow the community guidelines for chat rooms they entered. Ultimately 13 individuals consented to participate in the study, and 7 agreed to be interviewed online. In addition to the  formal data collection, researchers engaged in more than 100 exchanges with potential participants. The research application was readily accepted by the college's institutional review board. Several technical problems were evident, especially with regard to Internet access. A positive aspect of the research was that costs for data collection were minimal. The greatest benefit of the approach was that the participants' anonymity was virtually assured. It also appears that the anonymous culture of the Internet caused many dropouts and no-shows among those the researchers expected to participate. The researchers thought that they were not altogether successful in negotiating the Internet culture, and they recognized some problems with reliability and validity. They did attract respondents  from 11 different states and at least that many institutions, and they thought the study made a real contribution to knowledge about closeted gay students on campus.

There are significant differences in college-going rates for the major racial-ethnic groups. Recent public high  school graduates of Asian descent have the highest public college-going rate at 67%, while recent Latino public high school graduates have the lowest public college-going rates at 42.5%. Considerable differences also exist between various regions in California in the proportion of recent high school graduates who enrolled as first-time freshmen in California's public institutions of higher education in 1997. California's college-going rate is among the highest in the nation, although a relatively small proportion of these graduates enrolled directly in baccalaureate-granting institutions.

Twenty-one mid-life students in 9 universities throughout the United States and 1 in Canada comprised the sample. Consistent with systems theory, the holistic research used in both questionnaires and in-depth telephone interviews included the multifaceted experiences of the respondents. Examined categories included: (1) decision to enter; (2) admissions process; (3) early classroom admissions; (4) socialization and acclimation; and (5) balance of work, family, and student roles. Findings indicate that mid-life doctoral students exhibit many characteristics of the adult learner while also maintaining characteristics unique to this  mid-life doctoral demographic.

Lincoln University, founded in 1866, is an 1890 land-grant comprehensive institution that is part of the Missouri state system of higher education. As one of tow historically black colleges in Missouri, Lincoln has survived the challenge of maintaining an identity and state presence as a historically black university while simultaneously emphasizing the need for integration and a diverse student population. The university's mission statement emphasized racial diversity and the extent of racial heterogeneity in student enrollment from 1983 to 1998. To complete this analysis, historical trend data  were analyzed to determine the effect of the mission statement on student enrollment. Finding show that the mission statement has been the catalyst for achieving racial diversity. Lincoln is the only 4-year state institution in Missouri to have achieved diversity in student enrollment, and, as such, it serves as a multicultural model.

The analysis is based on 3 programs in each of these 4 fields and interviews with 148 stakeholders (faculty, administrators, students, and alumni). Through these interviews, five teaching and learning practices were identified that, from the perspectives of those interviewed, enrich students' doctoral experiences in ways that contribute meaningfully to learning and development. These areas are: (1) the problematization of professional knowledge  and practice; (2) the use of relational teaching and learning throughout the doctoral experience; (3) an emphasis on integrative inquiry; (4) individualized mentoring of students; and (5) student engagement in authentic, research-based discovery activities. Taken together these five teaching and learning practices form a learning environment, a culture, that appears to value collegial and reciprocal engagement among faculty and students in a community of practice.

The model is premised on a socially designed and consensus oriented approach which is achieved through teacher and student self-disclosure. It is intended to help instructors understand the importance of being culturally responsive when teaching writing. Collaborative writing approaches for culturally diverse students include: peer tutoring, peer editing, co-authoring, combining the previous three methods, workshopping, and knowledge making. The model proposes to change the traditional image of the  student and the teacher during the writing process. The paper notes implications for further research and concludes that while studies have produced mixed results concerning the benefits of peer response groups, they have definitely influenced the move away from traditional pedagogical methods in today's classrooms at all levels.

They learn best in an interactive format with heavy emphasis on the practical application of their learning. The paper discusses the development of adult education in the 20th century, examines the design of adult education programs, and describes today's adult learners. It highlights the design of the Division of Adult and Professional Studies at Indiana Wesleyan University. The university's model features a semi-independent structure, interactive learning in study groups, and experiential learning. The model is an application of adult learning theory and includes  scattered sites and evening and weekend scheduling to make education accessible when other programs would create barriers. The interactive nature of the classes and a curriculum rooted in students' everyday experiences motivate these learners to persist toward meeting their educational goals. Retention data for this program are examined and implications for adult education are discussed. (Contains 31 references.) (SM)",

The study's conceptual framework followed Mysers' theory of the six stages of the education of Blacks, especially the enhancement stage, during which Black colleges must focus on enhancing educational offerings for this population to prevent complete integration of Blacks into predominantly white institutions and the demise of Black colleges. Principles of population ecology and life cycle development are also applied to the analysis. Specifically, the study examined curriculum change at Howard University during this period, the student profile during this  period, governance and organization structure, and the institution's adaptation and adjustment to such changes as student unrest and the civil rights movement. The study concludes that Howard University successfully managed its development and adaptation during this period through such proactive changes as: a raising of admission requirements; on-going curriculum development; and the strategic merging of certain schools within the university.

Most students in both years agreed that faculty evaluations are used to improve instruction, are administered in a manner guarding student identity, and are given without faculty influence. Reflecting an upward trend of 7-12  percentage points in the 2000 survey, students responded that evaluations are given at the right time of the semester and are an important use of university funds. Downward trends of 4 to 9 percent were seen in response to the statement that \"students are influenced by a student's grade in the course more than the by quality of the course\" and that \"students are influenced by course content more than teacher personality.\" An attached table details respondent demographics and beliefs.

Addition of the department's questions and chairperson's signature to the survey resulted in increased response rates from graduates in social work of 18 percent, in engineering technology of 24 percent, and in elementary education of 31 percent. In the following year the college institutionalized  the survey with 30 academic departments participating.

A survey was responded to by 707 institutions of which 549 reported they offered at least one senior seminar or capstone course. The major finding of the survey was that these courses are generally designed to leave students with an understanding of and appreciation for single academic disciplines. Other findings indicate that: (1) the least likely instructional components to be found in such courses are those that take students out of the classroom; (2) senior seminars and capstone courses are most often taught and administered by single faculty members representing single academic departments; and (3) most of these courses are not part of a  comprehensive assessment process. Following an introductory chapter, aggregate survey findings are displayed in Chapter 2, followed by findings and analysis on discipline- and department-based courses in Chapter 3. Interdisciplinary and other courses are addressed in Chapters 4 and 5. The final chapter offers a summary of all analyses and conclusions. Appendices include examples of each course type, the survey instrument itself, and a list of responding institutions. (Contains 25 references.) (DB)",

They were also asked to suggest how colleges could ease the difficulties encountered by young faculty members. Respondents appeared sincerely committed to teaching and many reported being attracted to small colleges because of their own experiences as students. They reported struggles in balancing teaching, research, and service while  making long commutes or adjusting to life in a rural community. Their suggestions include being honest in portraying the college and the community to faculty candidates, realizing the importance of intrinsic motivators, recognizing that faculty do not need to live in the local community to be valued members of the college, discussing with senior faculty the negative effects of old grudges and political factions on new faculty, and creating the position of Director of Faculty Development to oversee development of new faculty.

Qualitative analysis of results indicated wide variations in the courses using discussion boards, in provision of instructions to students, in discussion organization, in professorial participation, in student participation requirements, and in assessment of discussion participation. Overall, professors felt the online discussion format encouraged students who did not participate in class to express themselves and encouraged all students to formulate  their thoughts at a deeper level.

The Oklahoma Racial Attitudes Scale (ORAS) was administered as well as a demographic questionnaire. The ORAS is based upon the construct that White racial awareness is characterized by four categories of ethnic identity as defined by the presence, absence, or consideration of two variables: exploration of one's ethnicity and commitment to one's ethnic group. Achieved White racial consciousness may include four types of attitude clusters from dominative to integrative. Unachieved racial attitudes are those avoidant, dependent, or dissonant attitudes that are not securely integrated into the individual's belief system. Results indicated a wide range of  racial awareness attitudes with most students having an &quot;Achieved&quot; level of racial awareness. The largest number of students in the &quot;Achieved&quot; racial awareness category expressed reactive attitudes (believing White society wrongly benefits from and promotes discriminatory practices). However, 17 percent expressed dominative attitudes (believing Whites to be superior to other groups). Higher levels of family income were related to development of conflictive or dominative attitudes. Minority composition of the high school was not related to racial awareness attitudes.

        "description":"This study examined the impact of institutional culture on the change process within colleges and universities. It used an ethnographic approach and two tiered cultural frameworks to investigate comprehensive change at six institutions. The conceptual frameworks of culture used were Berquist's theory of institutional archetypes of culture and Tierney's theory of unique institutional cultures. The six institutions in the study included one research university, three doctoral-granting universities, a liberal arts college, and a community college. Data were collected on a semesterly basis by participant-observers at each institution and by outsider researchers. Data analysis involved theme analysis of institutional change strategies, development of institutional culture profiles  based on both Berquist and Tierney frameworks, and analysis of whether institutional culture patterns could be identified in the change strategies. The report focuses on three of the six institutions describing change initiatives at each institution, their cultures, and discussion of how each culture affected institutional change strategies. Results support the value of exploring change strategies through a cultural approach, the usefulness of Berquist's four cultural archetypes, and the need to consider the unique nature of each institution's culture. Results suggest the need for campuses to conduct audits of their institutional culture before engaging in the change process. (Contains 34 references.) (DB)",

It reports on six ethnographic case studies of six institutions over a four year period. The six institutions in the study and their change initiatives included one research university (reconceptualizing the goals of general education and faculty roles); three doctoral-granting universities (changing faculty roles and rewards, creating a more rigorous academic environment, and integrating technology into the teaching and learning process); a liberal arts college (creating a campus community grounded in civic responsibility); and a community college (becoming more student centered). Qualitative research techniques  were used including interviews, participant observation, site visits, and document analysis. The key findings included: identification of five core strategies for transformational change, all of which facilitated organizational sensemaking; (2) the important inter-relationship among core and secondary strategies and the non-linear change process; (3) the need for balance among strategies; (4) the importance of social cognition models for future studies of transformational change; and (5) the efficacy of combining multiple conceptual models.

The first, restructuralism, calls for radically restructuring postsecondary institutions from the ground up to respond effectively to social, demographic, and economic changes in society. The second, incrementalism, seeks evolutionary change as it preserves cherished principles of academic freedom, tenure, and faculty oversight. Although methods designed to achieve these ends will vary according to several factors, a foundation of common understanding based on research findings should center the debate and provide the basis for an acceptable resolution. The author addresses three questions: (1) What barriers to  higher education must be removed to make its digitalized resources more universally acceptable? (2) What issues of cost and affordability must be addressed to ensure universal access? and (3) How will American higher education's reputation for quality and effectiveness be assured and maintained in the new technologically mediated environments? He then offers seven conclusions based upon research findings and ends with seven recommendations addressing the issues of access, cost, and quality. (Contains 13 references.) (PW)",

This increased need has spawned joint initiatives and programs involving the university, the corporate community, and the community at large.

(2) How have private and nontraditional institutions of higher education grown?

        "description":"Higher education has increasingly turned to outsourcing to improve service in the face of declining resources. Outsourcing has traditionally been used to operate campus bookstores and dining services and has more recently become a legitimate option for additional campus functions, such as facilities operation, computer services, security, child care, and remedial classes. Advocates argue that the private sector provides service more efficiently and at lower cost than the public sector, which is unmotivated by profit. Critics of outsourcing point out its human resource consequences. Jobs may be shifted from the college or university to the contractor performing the outsourced function, resulting in decreased salaries or benefits. Contract staff may have less loyalty to the  university than university employees. While research about outsourcing is scanty, anecdotal evidence shows that many institutions find outsourcing an effective means of reducing costs, upgrading program quality, and increasing customer satisfaction. A 1996 survey found that colleges and universities are increasingly turning to outsourcing, with more than one-half expecting to contract for more services in the coming years. Only 5.9% of colleges and universities surveyed produced all services in-house; the most popular outsourced services were food (74.3%), vending (65.3%), and bookstore operations (33.7%). (SLD)",

Questions include whether or not movies may legally be shown as part of distance education course offerings, who holds intellectual property rights to a distance education course  constructed by faculty, what intellectual property right individuals should pursue when creating distance education materials, and whether faculty may legally distribute to distance education students electronic copies of materials that would normally be placed on reserve for them in the school's library.

The BSCW system is a Web-based groupware tool for asynchronous and synchronous cooperation that extends the browsing and information download features of the Web with more sophisticated features for document upload, version management, member and group administration and more, to provide a set of features for more collaborative information sharing accessible with standard Web browsers. This paper describes the system and the experiences of using the system to establish a virtual  learning environment for M.A. students of the Social Science Department of the Gerhard-Mercator University in Duisburg, Germany. The field study took place in summer 1998. It demonstrated the usefulness of the system for students and teachers as well as the need for further research and socio-technical redesign. (AEF)",

With the host of software tools available, adapting courses to the on-line learning environment does not pose insurmountable technical obstacles, and can be almost routine. What becomes a challenge is preserving the original value of the instructional design and adapting the pedagogical nuances of a course to best leverage the modalities of on-line instruction. This paper illustrates how a graduate level course at  Teachers College, Columbia University, tailored for face-to-face instruction, was adapted for distant learners, and how the instructional design was captured and replicated by a Web-based distance education authoring tool.

Traditional classroom lecture learning and self-directed CALL environments were employed as control groups. Learning performance and learning attitude, including interpersonal relationships, learning interests, and self-esteem, were the dependent variables. Sixty-four seventh graders from a local public junior high school were randomly assigned to four treatments. A 10-day experiment was conducted with one 30-minute learning session each day. No significant group differences were found in any dimension of attitudinal measures. Significant performance  differences were revealed among the different learning environments. Plausible explanations include: (1) there may exist a threshold for accumulated learning performance to be significant, and the eight-day learning task may not be long enough to achieve this threshold; (2) the amount of various active learning time may contribute to learning performance; and (3) the actual cooperative level may vary.

        "description":"International collaborative learning is becoming more viable through a variety of Internet enabled software products. Group Support Systems appear to offer promise. But it is not well understood how to facilitate the teaching and learning process in electronic environments. If education is to involve an interactive process of collaborative inquiry and dialogue between remote groups of learners, then designing meaningful learning experiences presents challenges in logistics, technology support, software design, and pedagogy. To better model the facilitation process in such environments, a theoretical framework based on an extension of Adaptive Structuration Theory is suggested. This framework is then related to experiences with custom application software development using Lotus  Notes Domino(TM), internal trials and a limited scale collaborative learning exercise between students at Auckland Institute of Technology and Uppsala University. The paper concludes by providing some recommendations for the redesign of the application, suggesting revisions to the collaborative process based on the framework presented, and discussing further extensions to the trials.

        "description":"A successful Web-based training (WBT) system must be highly adaptable to already existing training procedures and software in a special environment. In corporate environments internal communication and collaboration is usually standardized throughout the company. The success of a WBT system therefore mainly depends on the ability of the system to utilize the well known communication channels instead of defining new ones. WBT users do not want to deal with new software; companies have their standardized software packages installed on most of their computers and very often do not allow the installation of new ones. These considerations led to the design of GENTLE (GEnerated Networked Teaching and Learning Environment) as a flexible WBT platform rather than a fully integrated  software package. This paper demonstrates the concept and features of GENTLE and describes the modules that make up the GENTLE system. Also outlined are the three steps to performing an online discussion using the high-level online collaboration tools of GENTLE. (AEF)",

The study of collaborative learning has shifted in focus to the relationship between the process of collaboration itself and the learning results. This study focuses on the latter. The study proposes two elements that were encountered during analysis of cross-age tutoring investigations. The first is that both learners' questions and tutors' advice is representative of their externalized metacognitive experience. The second is the manner in which interaction between learners and tutors develops the learner's monitoring abilities. If learners notice differences in meaning in the responses tutors give to learners' questioning and perform  conscious cognition of the tutor's externalized metacognitive experiences, the learner's reflective thinking caused by the tutor's responses produces the learner's monitoring as affected by the tutor's criterion.

        "description":"While working collegially, academics usually maintain an objective distance from the work of their peers. Higher education institutions also tend to differentiate themselves from other institutions and define their own special niche in the marketplace. These attitudes are concerned with establishing uniqueness and they contribute to an academic culture that pervades the education system from the individual academic to the institution level. This culture rewards teachers for designing unique courses. In Australia in particular, this personal course development is accepted practice to the extent that cross-institutional formal evaluation and comparison of courses does not generally occur. An academic will not normally adopt another academic's course without personalizing it.  Individual academics (or small groups) put together courses and computer-aided learning packages. Consistent with the cultural practices, few other academics in the same discipline at other institutions adopted these inflexible courses. The conclusion is that the uptake of learning programs by teachers and institutions will only occur if the programs are consistent with the academic culture and are customizable. A recent development in Australia, the National Teaching and Learning Database (NTLD) project is designed to provide access to educational resources. Course developers submit a URL of the location of those learning materials, but ownership is retained by the institution that developed the original material. The NTLD is a distributed database that provides access teaching and  learning materials to be customized, assembled, and utilized in a manner that suits the individual academic or institution style.

Traditionally, the most common form of learning has been apprenticeship, where a novice learns through active participation in a task, initially only peripherally, and then assuming more control and ownership. Originating in the socio-cultural perspective of Vygotskyan theory and developed by later theorists, the concept of scaffolding has been extended by practical applications in technology-based environments. As the World Wide Web becomes increasingly integrated into the delivery of learning experiences at primary, tertiary and secondary levels, the concept of scaffolding needs to be redefined because it is not readily translated into contexts where the  teacher is not present, as in on-line environments. This calls for a reconsideration of the nature of scaffolding and for the alignment of theory with practice. (Contains 26 references.) (Author/AEF)",

        "author":["Twigg, Carol A."],
        "description":"On July 15-16, 1999, a group of 20 higher education leaders gathered in Roanoke, Virginia to participate in an invitational symposium on the topic of \"Redesigning More Productive Learning Environments.\" The goal in Roanoke was to examine the validity of the conceptual framework that undergirds the projects being implemented in the Pew Grant Program in Course Redesign. The purpose of this program is to encourage colleges and universities to redesign their instructional approaches using technology to achieve cost savings as well as quality enhancements. This paper, like the discussion in Roanoke, builds on the existing theory of how to redesign more productive learning environments, which is well established. Discussion focused on specific ways to implement the theory, drawing upon  the experience of large-scale redesign projects from Virginia Tech, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Rio Salado College, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. By iterating between the planning methodology and actual implementations, the intention was to draw lessons that can be used as a guide to practice throughout higher education. This paper represents the result. (AEF)",

        "description":"This paper looks at challenges that face the epistemological model on which formal education is based as a result of the rapid growth in use of new communications and information technologies (CITs). The argument has three parts. The first describes some phenomena associated with the development during recent decades of these new CITs and their large scale incorporation into diverse social practices. While much of the detail is based in the growth of new technologies in the First World, the nature and directions of this growth impact powerfully on trends in countries like Mexico. The second part of the argument briefly describes what the author sees as an epistemological model underlying formal education. The third part considers some of the ways the phenomena described in the  first part challenge this epistemological model, and to that extent, educational practices based upon it. The conclusion to the argument is that in the current context there is an urgent need for educational philosophers, along with other educational scholars and researchers, to consider the implications for epistemology of the new technologies and social practices of the digital age.

        "author":["Yang, Yu Nu"],
        "description":"The rise of the World Wide Web as a new information processing technology has attracted the attention of educators worldwide. The purpose of this study was to seek a consensus among art education experts regarding how the Web should be integrated into the art teacher education curricula. The Delphi Method was applied for seeking a consensus. A panel of experts' anonymous individual ratings on specific components of curriculum guidance were recorded, and subjected to several iterations before converging to a final agreement. The concept of integrating Web-based technology into an art education curriculum was accepted by the majority of the panel. Several priority factors found in this study were strongly associated with the popular feature that a Web-based learning style is  excellent for immediately delivering information or pedagogical knowledge. In contrast, the concepts related to the potential feature that the Web-based curriculum can develop high learning skills such as problem-solving or creative thinking received less support. Those scale ratings which score lower are proper candidates for additional research as the Web becomes better integrated in art education programs at the college level. The current Web-based technologies will have positive impacts on art education curricula. As the Web-based technology makes progress, the promising features of Web-based learning styles can be incorporated into a sound instructional design. Appendices contain: the criteria for choosing the qualified candidates of the panel; questions of the round one  questionnaire; convergence criteria of the coefficient of variation (CV); the round three questionnaire; CV values, difference CVs, and item-level correlations between round two and round three; and the stability and internal reliability coefficients for the total scale and subscales of round three.

Options that departments may adopt for assuring that competencies are achieved were recommended. Four goals for insuring the infusion of instructional technology into  professional education programs were endorsed by the Professional Education Council: professional education faculty will have skills needed to model the use of teaching with technology in a transparent manner; standards and curriculum of the professional education program will be designed to efficiently use technology to enhance learning; professional education faculty and students will have access to appropriate technology to enhance teaching skills and to model the effective use of technology as a teaching tool; and collaborations will be developed and strengthened among university departments and with outside agencies.

The models presented show that the system for adjusting faculty compensation for traditional courses can accommodate ALN course development and teaching. Models for ALN teaching include regular pay, augmented regular pay, overload pay, pay-per-class, and pay-per student. Models for ALN course development include paid development, unpaid development, royalty, and share of revenue. The problem of assigning ownership of ALN intellectual property must be resolved if faculty are to fully embrace ALN teaching methods.  (Contains 16 references.) (Author/MES)",

The sample for the study was the 348 full-time faculty at the university. A survey was designed to determine the faculty's self-reported knowledge and use of technology, factors influencing their use of technology, and perceived barriers to the use of technology in the classroom. Faculty were also asked about the importance of instructional technology to their teaching and if they would continue to adopt new technology. The following factors influencing use of technology were ranked: improved student learning; advantage over traditional teaching; equipment availability; increased student interest; ease of use; compatibility with discipline; time  needed to learn; materials in discipline; compatibility with materials; training; administrative support; personal comfort; and colleague use. The data showed the faculty recognized common barriers to instructional technology as well as influences that helped them overcome the barriers. (Contains 28 references.) (MES)",

In three years, UCF has progressed from no coordinated distributed learning program to a highly-developed award-winning program consisting primarily of fully and partially World Wide Web-based courses. Characteristics of UCF's Web-based courses include: instructor-led, highly interactive courses; learner-centered, active learning; pedagogically sound instructional design; clear learning objectives and outcomes; and opportunity to build computer literacy. The significant  issues that have lead to UCF's planning and implementation of a successful distributed learning initiative are institutional strategic planning, organizational structure, technical infrastructure, faculty development for teaching online, leaner support, support for units, research and development activities, and impact evaluation. Research and development activities that provide data and support the UCF's distributed learning initiative include course development and Web service development (e.g., software engineering and Web production, instructional design, and administrative support) and distributed learning impact evaluation research.

The fiscal year 2000 educational and general budgets for institutions increased by 4.2%, or $44.2 million, from $1.05 billion to just under $1.1 billion. This increase was a result of: an increase of $12.6 million or 1.9% in state appropriations to institutions; a budgeted tuition and fee gross revenue increase of $25.3 million or 10%; and increases in non-fee revolving fund income of $6.3 million or 4.7%. The increased  funding will make possible: salary increases for both faculty and staff at most institutions; the addition of 156 new faculty positions at 19 institutions; the addition of 100 new staff positions systemwide; increased spending for library materials; and a 10.9% increase in operating budget funded scholarships. All institutions are in compliance with State Regents' caps on administrative costs. Use of carryover funds from the previous year decreased by 17.4%, from $24.7 million to $20.4 million.

Since that time staff have provided periodic progress reports on these original goals and their related indicators. This sixth progress report follows in that tradition. A review of the indicators suggests colleges are providing equitable access to college for students of color in general. The access ratio for all groups of color ranges from 1.12 to 1.61, substantially above parity at 1.00 for overall enrollment, including basic skills. The college-level access ratio is high for Asian/Pacific Islander, African American, and Native American but is slightly below parity for Latino/Hispanics.  Latino/Hispanic students' access, however, has improved significantly. The basic skills rate for students of color is below that of whites. The system is not having success in improving student progress in college-level classes for students of color or for white students. Of those students retained, rates for transfer and completion in high wage job preparatory programs have improved for students of color. The diversity of faculty, though much less than the diversity of the student population, continues to outpace the rate of growth of student diversity. (Author/VWC)",

Focuses on the initiative of providing improved transfer for associate degrees as transfer difficulties created by the complexity of the BC transfer environment increases. Asserts that new agreements for the transfer of completed associate degrees, as well as admission priority for students holding an associate degree would achieve this end. Recommends that an &quot;Associate Degree Transfer Policy&quot; could  guarantee a minimum of 60 transfer credits but still require students to complete all lower and upper division requirements for their baccalaureate degree. Under any new arrangement respecting transfer for the associate degree, institutions would maintain appropriate control over the academic requirements for all degrees, majors, and concentrations. Under ideal conditions potential transfer students would plan their selection of courses for the associate degree by including the requirements for majors within the electives. Students who failed to do so could be required to complete additional credits beyond the 60 specified in the associate degree. Priority admission over all other transfer institutions could be granted to any student who has completed an associate degree. (VWC)",

This survey has been conducted annually since 1990. Ten of the service areas listed on the QUEST Survey improved their ratings over the last survey. There were declines in the 40 other areas. Consistent with past survey findings, respondents gave their highest importance ratings to &quot;encouragement of excellence in teaching&quot; and &quot;high priority on student learning.&quot; On this year's QUEST Survey, there were six items and an overall rating on the President's Team and five items and an overall rating on the college's Board of Trustees. This marks the first time the board has been included on the survey. Overall, the item, &quot;shows  confidence in campus personnel&quot; received the highest importance rating for the President's team, and its performance rating was also the highest. For the Board of Trustees, &quot;makes appropriate decisions affecting college resources&quot; was the most important item, while &quot;is a visible presence on campus and in the community&quot; was the highest rated in performance. Again this year, the most important element in the college's employees' job satisfaction was &quot;having the resources available to carry out the job.&quot; In terms of actual satisfaction, the highest rated item was &quot;personal safety on campus,&quot; followed by &quot;resources available to carry out the job,&quot;&quot;opportunities for job-related training,&quot; and &quot;job security.&quot; Three items related to pay and promotion were the lowest rated.

        "description":"Asserts that educators who advocate lifelong learning too often support a narrow and arbitrary system of nomenclature, which implies that learning and thus education are terminal concepts. The need for administrative structure and socially recognized reward has plagued educators, and their clients, with learning near-sightedness. The question before the professional facilitator of lifelong learning should be: \"What must be done to modify existing systems or implement new infrastructure that can more appropriately respond to lifelong learning needs of all community members?\" Before a new structure can be designed, a change in thinking must come about. If we were to concentrate more on the skills desired by a lifelong learner and the relevance of the learning experience, such  practices as chronological segmentation, nomenclature, and stages could be dismissed. But in order to be responsive we must consider a different structure--a new model. Community colleges are by their very nature adult educators who are positioned to serve as educational brokers. To reach the status of a true broker of lifelong learning one needs to combine the elements of citizen participation, resource utilization, and organizational partnerships along with the concept of lifelong learning.

        "description":"This is a report on Washington State Board for Community and Technical Colleges' assistance of low-income adults under the state's welfare reform initiative, WorkFirst. Current and former welfare students attending community and technical colleges comprise 9% of all college student enrollments. Combining work and training leads to higher wages. WorkFirst Reinvestment Programs are aimed at quick-starting employment, providing access and support to training for low-income working adults, and increasing literacy skills. The report looks at lessons learned from WorkFirst Reinvestment Programs in the following areas: general, program re-design, tuition assistance, pre-employment training, workplace basics, families that work, and evening and weekend child care. Early outcomes in  programs that quick-started employment with custom training confirms that connecting training to job opportunities results in higher wages than job search alone, and is promising for other low-income students that colleges serve. Under WorkFirst, welfare and low-income workers with low basic skills are being served in new ways that streamline training by instructing basic skills in the context of a single parent's dual roles and responsibilities, as worker and head of family. The college system implemented tuition assistance for low-income working adults and is following their progress towards certificates and degrees. WorkFirst Reinvestment Programs have started to change the ways colleges provide training and services to welfare and other low-income working adults. (VWC)",

        "description":"The need for staffing adjunct community college faculty and the lack of specialized training for two-year college teachers led to the creation of The Faculty-in-Training Program. This program was established by Guilford Technical Community College (GTCC) in North Carolina in cooperation with two local university English departments at the University of North Carolina and at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical University. This pilot program employed teaching assistants at GTCC from the graduate programs at these universities, targeted toward those who might consider teaching careers at community colleges. The stakeholders in this program are: the English department, GTCC, the graduate teaching assistants, and the graduate schools. The paper outlines the advantages to each of  these stakeholder groups for participating in this program; recounts the initial phases of starting the program, getting GTCC approval and making university contacts; states that three main groups worked together to implement GTCC's program: the mentors, the program director, and the teaching assistants; describes each of these three roles and its duties; asserts that preliminary anecdotal and statistical evidence suggest that the pilot program has had a remarkably successful start; and concludes with a teaching associate's description of the process of discovering her teaching persona, classroom competence, and professional faculty role after her completion of the pilot program.

The @ONE project is funded by the Chancellor's office to enhance instruction and services through expanded uses of technology. Results suggest that faculty continue to have positive attitudes regarding the potential for technology to improve instruction and that they are interested in learning how to use technology to reach instructional goals that benefit students. Faculty use of technology is increasing in a number of areas, especially in the use of the Internet and email. Skills are improving, but data still indicate a need for ongoing training in uses of technology  that reflect best practice. Almost half of the responding faculty reported that their departments do not have an adequate budget to purchase needed software. The changing workload of faculty, new roles necessary to support technology mediated instruction, and sufficient infrastructure must be addressed before the California Community Colleges and their students will reap the benefits of technological advances. The survey results point to local training as being most desirable and effective. Strategies to reach and support part-time faculty must be a priority. There must be comprehensive, ongoing funding for technology in the colleges. Appendices include the survey instrument used in this study. (VWC)",

The Noel-Levitz Student Satisfaction Inventory, together with the faculty and student focus groups, provided valuable data to draw up strategies to improve retention and thus contribute to overall institutional effectiveness. The main source for the data is from The Community College of Baltimore County (MD). Three-year data (fall-to-fall and fall-to spring) were used for the trend analysis. The retention rate of students from fall-to-spring (semester) was generally higher than from fall-to-fall (annual). The semester retention rate for full-time students was significantly higher than for part-time students. Retention rates were  generally higher among females, whites, and students who had declared their majors or sought an AA-degree or certificate. The annual retention rate among full-time students was higher than part-time students. The highest retention rate was observed among students who were 60 and over. The focus group results supported several of the Noel-Levitz Survey findings. For example, the areas that supported the survey findings were financial aid, advising, registration process, student safety, parking, and career guidance. The focus group also identified areas that needed additional attention: support for evening students, availability of full-time faculty, class cancellations, and additional information on Learning First.

The guide is based on \"conversation starters\" which were created during the initial phase of a Family Involvement/Community Engagement Project conducted by the Laboratory at Brown University from September 1996 through June 1997. In each of the project's six schools, a team of school administrators, teachers, family advocates, families, and community representatives began conversations about school/family/community connections to support school reform from different points of view. Each school then developed its own action plan. The three conversation starters were: (1) Where is our school headed?; (2) How is our school involving families and the community?; and (3) How  can our school broaden its family and community support? Using these questions as a starting point, this activity guide discusses how to expand on the conversation. Suggestions are organized into the following areas: (1) \"Getting Started\"; (2) \"More than Just Talk\"; (3) \"Where Is Our School Headed? What Are Its Goals for Students?\"; (4) \"How Is Our School Involving Families and the Community? Why Is It Involving Them?\"; and (5) \"How Can Our School Broaden Its Community and Family Support?\" (EV)",

Students in participating schools have an opportunity to eat breakfast in their classroom each day at no charge, regardless of family income. The program, called Maryland Meals for Achievement (MMFA), has expanded to include 11 test schools and 11 control schools for the 1999-2000 school year. Researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School are evaluating the program's effectiveness in improving students' academic performance and other outcomes, such as attendance and behavior. Findings thus far include the following: (1) academic performance  improves; (2) school attendance improves; (3) student attention improves; (4) behavior problems decrease; (5) students feel better; (6) more students eat breakfast every day; (7) eating in the classroom versus the cafeteria has unique benefits; (8) many students may be undernourished; (9) parents, students, and staff like the program; and (10) program costs are lower than expected.

At grade 1, no significant differences between the groups were found at the beginning or end of the year in reading or math. Similarly, no differences were found in any of the above-mentioned rates. At grade 2, students in reduced-size classes evidenced greater performance in reading (text leveling) at the end of  the year; however, no pre-test was conducted on text leveling. In mathematics, the reduced-size class condition demonstrated higher performance at the end of the year. As with grade 1, there were no significant differences on other measures.

The students select picture books for themselves and for a group, handle books carefully, dictate stories about personal experiences, and describe characters in literature they have heard or viewed. The social studies standards emphasize citizenship education: following rules and respecting the rights of people. Students learn the concepts of self-control, fairness,  and leadership. They explore basic concepts of the individual. Mathematics standards emphasize how students acquire and use strategies to understand and act on mathematical problems. Students will be actively engaged in mathematics through instruction in patterns and relationships, and in seeking multiple solutions to problems. In both the mathematics and science standards, the larger context of understanding and application is stressed over concepts and procedures.

They will use pictures and symbols to convey thoughts, to keep learning logs and/or journals, and to engage in group writing projects. In the social studies standards,  instruction centers on the basic concept of the family. The students learn about working with others, sources of personal information about themselves and their families, rights and responsibilities in belonging to the family group, and major holidays. Kindergarten mathematics standards include counting, joining, and separating objects to develop a concept of number. The students count and compare numbers to 10; classify sets of objects by characteristics; and name various shapes. The kindergarten standards are conceptually oriented and actively involve children in doing mathematics. The science standards, too, place emphasis on using the senses to gather information on common materials, objects, and living things. The students measure, sort, classify, and communicate information about  the natural world, and learn about life processes and properties of familiar materials, such as magnets and water. (EV)",

        "description":"Early childhood institutions underwent a dramatic transformation in the twentieth century, with the perceptions of children not attending preschool reflecting shifts in political, educational, and social opinions regarding the best place for the rearing and education of young children. This lecture presents some historical &quot;maps&quot; of early childhood institutions with particular reference to New Zealand. The landscapes for the &quot;maps&quot; is multi-layered--a backdrop of the colonial values held by Europeans toward Maori people, the global connections of New Zealand, and the personal perspective of the author. The &quot;maps&quot; portray: (1) some views of Europeans toward the Maori; (2) constructions of childhood, constructed differently for the indigenous &quot;minority&quot; Maori child and the colonial&quot;majority&quot; Pakeha child; (3) political, pedagogical, and economic frames that have shaped the gaze of the state concerning early childhood institutions; (4) the interplay between dreams for social change by early childhood advocates, rationales for social order underlying political patronage, and occasional windows where change is possible; and (5) reflections on the contradictory dynamics of the politics of early childhood policy during the last decade. The paper concludes by asserting that unless early childhood advocates are active in the construction of the current &quot;map&quot; for early childhood, there is danger of early childhood becoming the site of experimentation with someone else's blueprint.

        "description":"This Spanish-language digest reviews research on the demographics and effects of video game playing, discusses game rating systems, and offers recommendations for parents. The digest begins by discussing research on the time children spend playing electronic games, which shows that younger children's game playing at home (90% of fourth-graders played at least 1 hour per week, according to 1 study) decreases in favor of game playing in arcades as children get older. Studies also consistently show that boys play more electronic games than girls, although girls perceived themselves to have peer approval for moderate amounts of game playing, and both boys and girls enjoy violent electronic games. The digest then discusses research on the effects of playing violent games. Studies tend  to show an increase in arousal and aggression in subjects who have played a violent versus a nonviolent game, although there may still be insufficient laboratory research to support strong causal statements about the effects of violent games on children's aggression. The digest describes research on other effects of electronic game playing, such as the link between heavy game playing or playing of violent games and self-concept. Following a discussion of two electronic game rating systems, devised by the Recreational Software Advisory Council and the Entertainment Software Rating Board, the digest offers parents recommendations for managing their children's game play. Recommendations include knowing the content and procedures of the games, paying attention to game ratings, establishing  explicit game-playing guidelines, and educating children about the difference between media and real-life violence.

        "description":"The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics recently published &quot;Principles and Standards for School Mathematics.&quot; For the first time, these new standards include pre-kindergarten standards, while outlining the mathematics that children should learn as they progress through school. The standards present a broad view of what mathematics is and can be for young children--a view that early childhood educators implementing developmentally appropriate practices can use. This digest discusses the latest mathematics standards for young children and how teachers can use developmentally appropriate practices to help children meet these standards. The digest points out that &quot;Principles and Standards for School Mathematics&quot; identifies both content and process standards. The content  standards are organized into several areas: (1) number and operations; (2) geometry; (3) measurement; (4) data analysis and probability; and (5) algebra. The process standards set out in &quot;Principles&quot; are congruent with developmentally appropriate practice and include the following: (1) problem solving; (2) reasoning and proof; (3) communication; (4) connections; and (5) representation. Teachers' questioning techniques--including those intended to help children understand concepts, hypothesize, and generate interesting questions--can help children appreciate the mathematics that surrounds them. The digest cautions that in our eagerness to help children meet the standards, we must take care not to use instructional methods that give the appearance of high math achievement but that, in fact,  interfere with real growth in understanding. The digest concludes by noting that the most effective way to meet standards is to work toward them by beginning wherever the child is--any other strategy simply wastes the child's time and prevents the development of the essential foundational understandings and skills needed for future success.

        "description":"Whether we use technology with young children--and if so, how--are critical issues facing early childhood educators and parents. This Spanish-language digest points out that many researchers do not recommend that children under 3 years old use computers. The digest also notes that many educators use computers with young children in ways that are developmentally inappropriate. However, developmentally appropriate ways to use computers with 3- and 4-year-olds are different from the ways we use computers in kindergarten and the primary grades. Research has shown that the cognitive and social benefits of providing computers to young children vary depending upon the kind of computer experiences offered. The digest suggests, as a first step to integrating computers in classrooms,  organizing a study group of all the individuals who have expressed interest in children using computers, then summarizing the benefits of using computers with young children and discussing goals for the year, including the cost of computers and teacher training. The digest identifies four critical components of teacher training: practical experience, workshops, models and mentors, and supervisory follow-up. (LPP)",

        "description":"Even Start is a federally funded program addressing the literacy needs of children and parents by offering parenting education, early childhood education, parent and child together time, and adult education. Noting that recent research on brain development and learning prompts a reexamination of beliefs and practices related to child rearing, teaching, and learning, this article provides information on brain development research and explores the implications for Even Start programs. The article discusses how brain development occurs through an interplay between nature and nurture, and notes the importance of critical periods for particular types of learning. The article maintains that negative experiences and the absence of appropriate stimulation are more likely to have serious and sustained effects during infancy than at later ages. The article further notes that how children are cared for has a decisive, long-lasting impact on their development, ability to learn, and capacity to regulate their own emotions. The following implications for Even Start programs are identified: (1) use parenting education as the vehicle for strengthening parent-child attachment; (2) use parenting education as the vehicle for developing children's literacy skills; and (3) provide opportunities for staff training and development in order to provide and maintain high-quality services. The article concludes by noting that Even Start practitioners have a unique opportunity to have a positive effect on improving the literacy, lives, and futures of many families. (KB)",

The paper begins with reminders about the development of self-control as a crucial aspect of peacefulness, the role of the toddler's developing autonomy, and the development of a sense of fairness in prekindergarten children. The paper notes the importance of positive adult role models who have a daily quiet time, engage in meditation or prayer, and are mindful of their vocal inflection and body language. Suggestions for fostering peaceful environments are given, including using visual reminders, having orderly homes and classrooms, providing aesthetic experiences that promote peace, telling stories about problem solving, and limiting and monitoring  television viewing. Inappropriate strategies for dealing with conflict are delineated, including the avoidance of threats, physical reactions, name calling, bringing up the past, and inattentive listening. Appropriate strategies are described, such as identifying the real problems, and demonstrating mutual respect for everyone's feelings. Also noted are procedures to help adults keep perspective as they help children work through steps of conflict resolution. The paper concludes by asserting that peace starts with positive interactions at home, in the community, and at school, and that each individual has the responsibility to respond, rather than react, to conflict.

        "author":["Snyder, Howard N."],
        "description":"Until recently, law enforcement and policymakers had few hard data on the child victims of sexual abuse, offenders, and other characteristics of these crimes on which to base a response. The National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), capturing a wide range of information on each sexual assault incident reported to law enforcement, can provide such information. Two research bases were extracted from 1991 through 1996 NIBRS master files, one summarizing information for the 60,991 victims of sexual assault, and the second compiling information for the 57,762 victim-identified offenders. The findings indicated that 67 percent of sexual assaults are against juvenile victims. Juvenile victims of sexual assault were more likely to be male (18 percent) than were adult victims (4  percent). Juvenile victims were more likely to be victimized with others (20 percent) than were adults (4 percent). Nearly 5 of every 6 sexual assaults of young juveniles occurred in a residence, whereas crimes against older juveniles and adults were more likely to occur elsewhere. Adults were the offenders in 60 percent of sexual assaults of youth under age 12. Rarely were the offenders strangers to the victims. Sexual assaults of children under 6 years were the least likely of all such crimes to result in arrest or be otherwise cleared. (The report concludes with a list of NIBRS definitions of forcible sex offenses. An appendix discusses difficulties in data analysis when the victim's perception of the offender's age may be reported as a point estimate or as a range.) (KB)",

Data were collected by means of Fall and Spring parent interviews, teacher ratings of children's social skills and problem behaviors, and administration of the Woodcock Johnson Math and Letter-Word ID subscales. The findings indicated that in the Fall, parents who were most involved with their children in activities at home and in the community were more likely to include mothers with higher levels of education. Larger families  tended to have less involvement in Head Start than smaller families. The level of Fall home activities was highly significantly related to Spring home activities. Parents' participation in Head Start activities over the course of the year was a significant predictor of home activities with the child in the Spring. There were no significant family demographic or activity predictors of the pre-math outcome. Family size and income were significant predictors of the literacy outcome. A family's involvement in activities with their child at home and in the community was significantly positively related to Letter-Word ID. Parent involvement in Head Start activities did not contribute to the cognitive development outcomes. Parents who reported more Head Start involvement in activities that  included their child had children whom teachers rated more highly on social skills. (KB)",

Data were collected through observations, interviews, and surveys. Findings indicated that both the interested public and the Smart Start board members agreed that having parents involved in decisions about how Smart Start money was to be spent was important, but was not always easy to implement. Three equally important factors were found to affect the level and quality of meaningful parent involvement in board activities and decision making: (1) logistics, including arranging child care and transportation; (2) structure, including group size, lack of orientation prior to meetings, number of parents, and the decision-making process used; and (3) climate, including  feeling intimidated, not knowing others, not feeling useful, and the vocabulary used. Citizens thought that parents were qualified to be included in the decision-making process for how to allocate money in the early childhood program budget, but did not believe that parents currently have much influence. Local board members agreed that parent involvement is important, but pointed out that recruiting and retaining parents to regularly attend board meetings was difficult because of the many barriers to participation and because of difficulty in defining the parents' role. Three partnerships identified by executive directors as successfully involving parents in boards provided information on how to involve parents more effectively. (KB)",

        "description":"In preparation for reauthorization of Even Start and other Federal education programs, these hearings transcripts recount testimony before the U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce concerning the Even Start and family literacy programs. Testimony was presented by: (1) the president of the National Center for Family Literacy, giving an overview of family literacy concepts and outlining the components of a quality family literacy program; (2) the director of the National Institute for Literacy, discussing the importance of evaluations of the Even Start program and the use of instructional programs based on scientific research; (3) a state manager for the Even Start program, discussing the importance of flexible Federal legislation to allow states to accomplish their  family literacy goals; and (4) other local literacy program administrators. The transcripts' nine appendices contain written testimony. The testimony indicated that family literacy programs may help undereducated parents gain the skills they need to become self-sufficient and to help their children through school; the positive impact of such programs on families suggests that they can be an important strategy for student success. Recommendations for evaluation of Even Start programs included examination of the adult education component and better application of research findings on learning to read to the intergenerational approach. Other issues discussed include the level of the federal funding match for Even Start following the initial 8 years, ways to improve attendance and retention  rates, ways to strengthen workplace literacy programs, the role of faith-based organizations in Even Start, and Native American involvement in the program.

        "description":"In recent years, several states have offered financial incentives to encourage child care centers and homes to become accredited by a reputable national organization to improve child care quality. This report examines whether it is good policy to offer higher reimbursement rates to accredited child care facilities and assesses the relative merits of alternative public policies that seek to improve U.S. child care. The report presents findings from an NAEYC study assessing the effects of differential reimbursement on center accreditation application rates. The study found that in a few small states, differential reimbursement boosted application rates modestly, with more substantial increases in three larger states. States with differential reimbursement policies differ in how  much more they are willing to pay for accreditation, with a range of 5 to 20 percent more. The average reimbursement rate difference in states with a positive impact of differential reimbursement was 15.8 percent. The report suggests that states allow more than one accrediting organization to participate in the differential reimbursement process and describes situations in which differential reimbursement is not likely to improve quality. Other creative procedures to improve quality are also noted, including different types of monetary incentives for accreditation, technical assistance to guide staff through the accreditation process, or requirements for accreditation. The report concludes by asserting that differential reimbursement should be considered as only one method to improve  child care quality and that accreditation information should be shared with parents. The report's appendix delineates the current reimbursement rates for the 18 states with accreditation-related differential reimbursements. (Contains 16 references.) (KB)",

        "description":"The repertory grid is a technique used in psychological and behavioral studies to elicit individuals' personal constructs. This pilot study examined the feasibility of using this technique with young children in early childhood education settings with regard to visual art education, based on the view that listening to, and appreciating children's opinions and criteria about their own work and that of others is essential to understanding why children's work is the way it is. Repertory Grid offers a more structural basis for conversation and feedback in art education than does an open interview. Participating in the pilot study were two 5-year-olds. One feedback conversation was held with each child separately, as well as one unusable conversation with both children together, to  elicit their constructs. During the conversations, 5 art works (elements) were selected from about 10 the child had made at home or at art school within the preceding 6 months. Constructs (product quality or action) were elicited from the child and were used to compose a grid in which all elements were allotted to constructs, using graded scales. Findings of the study indicated that the time needed for intensive conversation with young children is at most 20 minutes, breaks are needed to support and maintain motivation, the role of children's linguistic ability is crucial, and extra incentives may be needed to maintain interest.

This booklet provides creative ideas for ways to incorporate &quot;Arthur&quot; books and television episodes into children's activities or events held at television stations, libraries, community organizations, museums, or schools. The booklet includes episode descriptions from the program's first and second seasons on PBS, a list of &quot;Arthur&quot; books, and suggestions for having an &quot;Arthur Day,&quot; holding an Arthur contest, and creating an Arthur club. The guide also presents suggestions regarding location, volunteers,  partnerships, and promotion. Also included is an &quot;Arthur&quot; coloring sheet and mask, information on Arthur resources, the Arthur style and trademark, use of the Arthur costume or inflatable for events, and Arthur-related merchandise.

        "description":"While recent research in cognitive development suggests that the period from birth to age 3 provides a unique opportunity for interventions to change the life-course of children, there is great disagreement regarding the best means of allocating public funds toward early childhood intervention. Further, there is little research into the long-term effects of early education programs for disadvantaged children. This report summarizes the remarks of three nationally recognized scholars discussing these and other topics at a Congressional Research Briefing &quot;Early Childhood Intervention Programs: What Are the Costs and Benefits?&quot; Jeanne Brooks-Gunn's remarks explain the structure of early childhood programs and the nature of their short-term impacts on child development, and provide  an assessment of early childhood at the optimal point of intervention. Janet Currie's remarks focus on the long-term impacts of early interventions, such as academic attainments as well as program costs and benefits. Douglas Besharov's remarks examine the research literature and offer policy alternatives to Head Start programs. (KB)",

The result of the committee's review, this book synthesizes the literature, elaborates on a number of core concepts of development, and offers recommendations for policy and practice. The committee's conclusions and recommendations are grounded in four overarching themes: (1) all children are born wired for feelings and ready to learn; (2) early environments matter, and nurturing relationships are essential; (3) society is changing, and the needs of young children are not  being addressed; and (4) interactions among early childhood science, policy, and practice are problematic and demand dramatic rethinking. Following an executive summary, the book's chapters are as follows: (1) &quot;Introduction&quot;; (2) &quot;Rethinking Nature and Nurture&quot;; (3) &quot;The Challenge of Studying Culture&quot;; (4) &quot;Making Causal Connections&quot;; (5) &quot;Acquiring Self-Regulation&quot;; (6) &quot;Communicating and Learning&quot;; (7) &quot;Making Friends and Getting Along with Peers&quot;; (8) &quot;The Developing Brain&quot;; (9) &quot;Nurturing Relationships&quot;; (10) &quot;Family Resources&quot;; (11) &quot;Growing Up in Child Care&quot;; (12) &quot;Neighborhood and Community&quot;; (13) &quot;Promoting Healthy Development through Intervention&quot;; and (14) &quot;Conclusions and Recommendations.&quot; The book's four appendices include related reports from the National Academies, and  discussion of technologies for studying the developing human brain.

The statistical portrait is based on indicators of children's well-being in five broad areas: (1) healthy babies, including enrollment in the TennCare insurance program, prenatal care, infant mortality and child deaths, and immunizations; (2) healthy children, including teen deaths, substance abuse, and sexually transmitted diseases; (3) healthy minds, including mental health, education, high school dropout rates, and child care and preschool education; (4) healthy families, including population demographics, unemployment, single-parent families, and income and poverty; and (5) healthy communities, including domestic violence, child abuse, juvenile justice, child welfare, and school  safety. Following an executive summary highlighting major findings, the report provides findings, by county, for each of the indicators. Among the findings are the following: (1) nearly half of TennCare participants are under age 20; (2) African-American babies died nearly two and a half times more often than white babies; (3) in the 15-19 age group, white teens were 3 times more likely than African American teens to die in an automobile accident, whereas African American teens were 16 times more likely than white teens to die due to homicide; (4) the number of regulated child care agencies in Tennessee has increased; (5) high school dropout rates have decreased; (6) Tennessee ranked 41st among states in median income; (7) food stamp participation has decreased since 1994; (8) child abuse  declined slightly between 1997 and 1998; and (9) between 1994-95 and 1998-99 the number of children committed to state custody declined by nearly one third.

Many students of the targeted third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade classrooms lacked a well-defined sense of classroom community as well as the ability to resolve conflicts peaceably. Research indicated that specific skills needed to be taught. For this reason, a program was developed which was supported by the administration and implemented during a 5-month time span beginning in September. The implemented program included instructing children in three main categories: building a classroom community, conflict resolution skills, and peer mediation. This was accomplished through the use of activities that helped create a sense of community, personal responsibility, and the ability to  solve conflicts peacefully. While evaluation surveys showed an increase in discipline notices, detentions, and suspensions, this does not reflect the success of the program. Subjective observations and anecdotal comments by students and parents provided a different perspective. Positive feelings among teachers, students, parents, and administration were expressed through surveys and verbal comments. The overall impact upon school and individual classrooms was noted with a recommendation for expanded implementation.

Without proper guidance, these children may become aggressive and disruptive, and are at risk for low self- esteem, poor mental health, dropping out of school, low achievement, poor employment history, and many other difficulties. This action research project implemented and evaluated a program to teach social skills to improve the capacity of primary age students to cooperatively work, learn, and play both inside and outside a school setting. Participants were students in two kindergarten classrooms, one second grade class and one third grade class. The 12-week intervention consisted of teaching and reinforcing 4  targeted social skills--forming groups quietly, listening to the speaker, using low voices, and thinking for oneself. Researchers introduced each lesson by modeling the pro- social behavior followed by an interactive activity in which students practiced the skill. During the final 6 weeks, researchers observed, and reviewed the desired social skills as necessary. Findings of the post-observation checklist indicated an improvement in all four social skill areas. The most considerable difference was observed in students' ability to form groups quietly. It was anticipated that as a result of these interventions, students would gain a sense of belonging and self-worth. (Eight appendices include teacher survey form and findings, observation checklists, and outlines of the four social skills  lessons.) (HTH)",

Participants were students in one kindergarten class, one second-grade class, one high ability fourth-grade class and one high ability fifth-grade class in a Midwest suburban school.

Goal-setting and self-evaluation techniques were implemented to improve self-efficacy in the students. Specific interventions included: (1) authentic evaluation (teacher observation checklists); (2) student self-evaluation;  (3) student initiated academic goal-setting, and (4) student self- regulation of goal achievement. Specific interventions were implemented over a 12-week period. Improvement was measured by a series of student surveys and teacher observation checklists. In kindergarten and second grade, findings of the surveys and checklists indicated substantial improvement in the focus areas of persistence, problem solving, motivation, and accuracy. In fourth and fifth grades, findings of student surveys remained consistent, while the teacher observation checklists showed some improvement in the focus areas.

        "description":"Understanding the condition of children as they enter school can provide clues to help parents and teachers understand children's performance later in their school career. This information can also provide teachers with essential guidance for individualizing the curriculum to help children learn more effectively. Finally, assessment of the condition of children could be an important part of accountability measurement. This study examined what states are doing with regard to defining and assessing the condition of children as they enter school, often referred to as readiness for school. Early childhood state representatives in each of the 50 states were contacted and interviewed regarding their state's policies on children's readiness for kindergarten. Findings indicated that as  of January 2000: (1) age was the criterion most often used to determine eligibility for kindergarten; (2) no state had an official statewide definition of school readiness; (3) several states were studying the issue of school readiness; and (4) local school districts were often making decisions about how children should be assessed and how data on children should be used.

        "description":"Introduction of the National Literacy Strategy (NLS) into all English schools means that even teachers in small schools with mixed-age classes undertake a large amount of whole-class literacy teaching. The NLS promotes the use of specific teaching strategies during a carefully structured hour-long literacy session. Also, the framework of objectives for particular grades means that any whole-class work undertaken with a mixed-age class is, according to this framework, being delivered at a level inappropriate to some students. Since small elementary schools (having 100 or fewer students) are still a significant percentage of all schools in England and Wales, a study was conducted to determine how small schools are coping with the literacy hour. Twenty classrooms in small schools  were observed over an 8-month period, and about 400 students were given standardized reading and writing tests at the beginning and end of the period. The teachers did not find the NLS as hard to implement as they had expected, although more difficulties were encountered in classes with more age groups. However, student progress on standardized tests did not differ by the number of age groups in the class, class size, or age position in the mixed-age class. Overall, the students made progress in literacy during the year; more progress was made in reading than writing; and classes with lower scores at the beginning of the year made the most progress. Teaching strategies used in the more successful classrooms are described, and specific suggestions are offered for implementing NLS in  mixed-age classes. (SV)",

        "author":["Appleton, Ken"],
        "description":"It is not uncommon for beginning teachers in Queensland (Australia) to be assigned their first teaching placement in a rural area. Many of these teachers stay there for the minimum time that they must, then seek to relocate to a coastal city. The literature and interviews with beginning rural teachers suggest that those who view the experience positively have their roots in the community, or a similar one, and those with negative views experience a multifaceted sense of isolation-- physical, interpersonal, cultural, intellectual, and personal. These considerations are bound together in notions of identity and community. Identity is a social phenomenon bound up in the people and community with whom a person feels comfortable; but it also tends to be associated with the physical  place occupied by the community. Applying this to beginning teachers, several aspects of identity emerge: personal and social identity, focusing particularly upon the immediate family group and the place where one grew up; professional identity, focusing on the preservice community, university, and current school placement; and desired future social and professional identity. If the teaching situation provides a mismatch with an aspect of the teacher's identity, then a sense of isolation is felt. Although isolation may be real in a geographic sense, identity mismatch amplifies perceived isolation and the urge to move to a place that more closely matches the teacher's identity. (TD)",

        "author":["Grenfell, Mike"],
        "description":"This paper describes the experiences of non-Indigenous preservice teachers during a 5-week rural cross-cultural practicum in Northern Territory (Australia) Aboriginal schools. The staff at the Education Resource Centre that serves and provides visiting teachers to Yirrkala Homeland Schools expressed a desire to become more fully involved in the preparation of non-Indigenous preservice teachers. This fit well with the efforts of Northern Territory University to extend the school-based teacher education movement to rural schools. Because of the language barrier and Yolngu parents' insistence that their children be taught only by Aboriginal teachers, the preservice teachers had only limited opportunities for face-to-face teaching. Their teaching responsibilities were redefined in  terms of joint development of appropriate curriculum materials and interaction with visiting and Aboriginal teachers in a workshop situation where teaching and learning activities were trialed or modeled using negotiation and collaboration. The experiences of the non-Indigenous teacher education students are viewed as a series of border crossings facilitated by resource center staff, negotiating entry with the Indigenous people and seeking the advice of local elders. Excerpts from student teachers' journals and interviews trace the development of cultural hybridization working across a number of binary distinctions, and provide evidence of the influence of Aboriginal worldviews and cosmologies on preservice teachers' social attitudes and pedagogical beliefs.

Information was obtained from interviews with 4,199 workers in 85 counties between October 1, 1996 and September 30, 1998. Chapters 1-3 provide information about the farmworkers themselves, including demographic characteristics, family composition, national origin, education, literacy, and language proficiency. Chapters 4 and 5 describe the labor force participation of U.S. crop workers and outline the characteristics of farm jobs held by workers in the survey. Chapter 6 contains information on farmworkers' income, assets, and use of social services. The report finds that farmworker wages had stagnated; annual earnings remained below the  poverty level; farmworkers experienced chronic underemployment; and the farm workforce increasingly consisted of young, single males who were recent immigrants. Five out of six farmworkers spoke Spanish, farmworkers typically had completed 6 years of education, and just one-tenth of foreign-born farmworkers spoke or read English fluently. The findings indicate a national oversupply of farm labor. A study of the demand for farm labor and how it would change as the supply changed would complement this data and help point the way to an agricultural labor market with stable employment; higher wages; and a legal, domestic workforce. An appendix describes statistical conventions used in this report. (Contains 28 figures and 7 data tables.) (TD)",

To qualify for inclusion in the directory, each program had to offer basic, functional, or advanced literacy training; offer literacy training in English, French, or an Aboriginal language; be &quot;Aboriginal controlled&quot;; and attract learners who are &quot;return students.&quot; The program profiles are arranged by province and include contact information, host organization, communities served, program mission and objectives, program features, and unusual features or concerns. Some Quebec program descriptions are presented in French. Programs are hosted primarily by First Nation Band Councils and Aboriginal community centers. The programs in the  directory have met and overcome a number of challenges: the isolation and onerous responsibilities of literacy practitioners, inadequate financial resources, the need to provide a safe and welcoming environment, the need to develop a curriculum that is both culturally relevant and relevant to adults' lives, transportation and daycare obstacles, learners' personal problems that decrease motivation, and inadequate access to technology and technical assistance. Successful programs share several critical features: a safe and welcoming environment, supportive community leadership, competent program staff, community support resources, adequate human and financial resources, relevant personalized programming, and appropriate curriculum. Information is presented on funding and support available  from the National Literacy Secretariat, and an agenda for a national Aboriginal literacy conference is suggested.

This principle allows one to produce equations with a variable isolated on one side and its value(s) on the other. It also underlies problem-solving in situations where equations are not explicitly used, but the problem calls for recognizing that two quantities are equal in value and using that information to derive conclusions about values of unknown quantities. The present paper focuses on how third-grade children recognize and use this logical principle in solving problems. It also looks at issues children face as they try to represent unknowns through written notation and use their written symbols to draw inferences about unknown values. The results showed that  children comfortably recognized that equal additive operations upon equal quantities produce equal results (Study 1 ). Further, they easily produced written representations of known (numerically quantified or measured) quantities. However, the children showed considerable hesitation about producing written representations for unknown quantities (Study 2). Their hesitation seems to stem from the challenge of finding a symbol to represent a quantity without constraining or making incorrect presumptions about values it may stand for. (Author)",

        "description":"This paper describes a hypermedia resource, called MendelWeb that integrates elementary biology, discrete mathematics, and the history of science. MendelWeb is constructed from Gregor Menders 1865 paper, \"Experiments in Plant Hybridization\". An English translation of Mendel's paper, which is considered to mark the birth of classical and evolutionary genetics, is presented as an active document, with links to traditional reference material (e.g. glossaries, biographies, and the original German text) as well as images, tutorials, active commentaries, related Web sites, and animations. Users can choose to view any of several versions of the Mendel paper, each featuring different degrees of activity and annotation, and MendelWeb is designed to be accessible and useful to those  running basic text browsers like Lynx, as well as full-featured browsers like Mosaic. MendelWeb, which is currently under construction at Brown University, is proposed not as an on-line textbook, but as a resource for teachers and students inside and outside traditional school environments. The links integrate elementary mathematics (i.e. probability and statistics), classical genetics, European history, and the history of early modern biology, in ways unavailable to traditional textbooks and even CD-ROM resources. MendelWeb will be valuable for teachers and students at the secondary and undergraduate levels, along with people of all ages pursuing independent studies. Finally, MendelWeb includes a series of project links, to encourage the construction of a larger web, tracing the history  of genetics through the 19th, 20th, and into the 21st, centuries. MendelWeb can be accessed at http://netspace.org/. (Author/NB)",

The Secondary Teacher Education Program (STEP) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison will soon employ a similar model in its program. Work and learning within STEP evolves around instructional design teams comprising pre-service teachers and various advisors. Because much of this work is project-based rather than curriculum driven, traditional assessment is not appropriate. Our approach involves taking advantage of the online environment's ability to collect data on collaborative process. To help determine standards of evidence appropriate for judging groups as knowledge-construction entities, we articulated a theoretical framework based on four  accepted views of social knowledge construction. Assessment was conceptualized as abductive inference, case identification given particular theories and relevant evidence pertaining to them. The theories predict indicators that can be represented as nodes linked by subjective probabilities within a Bayesian network. Observable features of online interactions provide input to the Net. Outputs are probability distributions indicating the degree to which a group meets normative standards described by theory. The network can produce general assessment and diagnostic profiles for groups and subgroups within large communities. (Author/SAH)",

This paper describes a study in which classroom instruction in one high school class was focused on four specific model-assessment criteria: two involving fit between data and model, and two involving conceptual consistency, or fit within the model itself or between it and other models of scientific knowledge. Individual students' use of those assessment criteria during two round of model-revising problem solving was monitored  and analyzed. All students were able to assess models based on empirical fit, but despite explicit instruction on their use, students did not consistently apply the conceptual assessment criteria to their models. This paper discusses the implications of these results on the use of modeling as an approach to teach students about the structure of scientific knowledge and the nature of science as a modeling activity.

Findings indicate that students' conceptions of models changed during the nine-week course.

The GEIS Project was designed to understand how girls who are poor, minority or both, engage in science. The two teachers who form the focus for this study are these girls' 7th and 8th grade teachers. Data for this interpretive inquiry were gathered as field notes, and in structured interviews. The two teachers, taken together, illustrate responsive teaching for minority girls. Although the two teachers are very different in their approach to teaching science, both take every opportunity to provide their students with what they perceive students need in order to be successful. The teaching of one teacher exemplifies the use of subject matter rich content in making  science interesting and relevant to the girls. The second teacher in this study provides an illustration of a highly personal teaching style that is effective in establishing the kind of teacher-student relationships that appear to help these girls think of themselves as girls who are good at science.

The goal was to see how students negotiate, what norms affect students during negotiation, and what characteristics influence student negotiation. The study's participants were non-science majors engaged in cooperative learning groups during a 10 week summer session in Argentina. The course was a general education science course taken by students from a local university in its international program. The students were placed randomly in groups of four and videotaped as they attempted to reach a group understanding for a discrepant event. In addition to the videotaping, classroom artifacts were examined using an ethnographic approach. The preliminary results indicate that, as students negotiate  with each other, prior experience plays a vital role in the construction of knowledge. Also, as students negotiate for understanding, they are affected by the status given certain members of the group by the group. (Contains 28 references.) (Author/YDS)",

Federal and state mandates require a restructuring of graduate education in order to focus on professionalism in teaching. To validate this top-down approach, mathematics and science teachers were asked to tell about their professional development needs. The study consists of two parts. The first part examined 467 teachers' anonymous responses to a paper and pencil survey. The emphasis in Part One was to gather information about the teachers' needs with regard to the curriculum aspects of graduate study. Researchers interviewed teachers individually in Part Two of the study to determine the pedagogical issues associated with university  instruction. Considering that learning is a process of making meaning, teachers recognize the importance of understanding how students learn. It is from these and other contemporary perspectives that the study of teaching and learning emerges as a key element of graduate education for science and mathematics teachers. (ASK)",

One of the most exciting educational implications is the leverage that one may expect by enhancing learning at the cognitive and metacognitive levels. Despite the relatively rich history in both cognition and metacognition, no consensus has emerged as to the nature of higher-level knowledge. The present study aimed to know more about: (1) the nature of metacognition, and to characterize facets of higher-level metacognitive thought; (2) the process by which individuals change their metacognitive capacities with experience; and (3) the role of pedagogical practices in facilitating changes in metacognition. Six cohorts of  elementary students (grades 1-6 participated in this naturalistic study across three academic years. Analysis of the data supports the following claims. First, metacognition is within the capabilities of young (school age) children. Second, children's metacognitive ability is multifaceted in nature, it can be probed and teased apart. Third, changes in metacognitive sophistication can be gained by actively engaging in the process. Fourth, changes in metacognitive ability and conceptual understanding may be more closely linked to the individual student's epistemological stance. (Contains 102 references.) (Author)",

My central question is: what do students' and teachers' voices tell us about breaking the pedagogic contract through the use of creative/imaginative writing in science classrooms? This paper draws only on the analyzed interviews of five teachers and twelve students from their schools. It will show that it takes considerable strategic effort on the part of teachers to establish a new pedagogic contract. These teachers addressed resistance by being explicit about purposes, classroom processes and assessment practices. The voices of these students illustrate that the efforts of their teachers have been instrumental in  re-framing the boundaries of the pedagogic contract: students will accept a shift in pedagogy if they can see a pay-off for themselves in terms of their learning outcomes and/or their enjoyment of the learning experience.

First, teachers perceived curriculum primarily as content, but also as pedagogy. They stressed not only what should be taught but how content should be manipulated in science. Second, teachers described the process of curriculum development as emergent, and never complete. Third, teachers conceptualized the success of the project not only in terms of a written document, but in terms of the personal and  staff development inherent in the collaborative, reflective nature of the process as they created and experienced it.

        "author":["Flick, Lawrence B."],
        "description":"This paper is a part of a research program whose purpose it is to design instruction for scaffolding classroom inquiry in middle school classrooms. Scaffolding is a dynamic process, reflecting teacher adjustments based on student responses. Even though a computer, textbook, or laboratory materials may serve as proxy for a \"teacher\", arguably the most important source of scaffolding in a classroom is the flesh and blood teacher. The teacher decides, consciously or unconsciously, how and when to use a computer, textbook, or laboratory materials. The actions of the teacher are also the primary mediator of the scaffolding effects of other classroom materials. The purpose of inquiry-based instruction is to prompt focused effort on a specific problem. The effort includes recall and  application of relevant knowledge and implementation of procedures for generating, analyzing, and interpreting data. Mental effort for inquiry requires evaluation of the fit among a problem statement, recalled knowledge, and evidence either empirical or theoretical. This type of thinking requires self-monitoring of one's understanding of the problem and processes undertaking to solve it. Middle level students are just beginning to show the capabilities for the kinds of thought necessary for scientific inquiry. However, most of the evidence for these thinking skills is clinically based (Keating, 1990). Classroom-based reasoning situations do not afford the time, focus, and cues for employing critical thinking. Cognitive scaffolding is necessary to support student thinking necessary for  benefiting from inquiry-based instruction. Cognitive scaffolding has been defined as what a teacher does when working with a student \"to solve a problem, carry out a task, or achieve a goal which would be beyond his unassisted efforts: (Wood, Bruner, & Ross, 1976, p.90). As a psychological construct, it refers to a cognitive orientation in the teacher to select and structure tasks, communicate purpose, and hold expectations with the intention of guiding student work at the limits of their independent capabilities. Scaffolding also refers to an affective orientation in the teacher that is sensitive to variations in student cognitive and affective capabilities that results in adjusting elements of the task or context that promotes continued student effort. For scaffolding to work, however,  there must be a complementary cognitive and affective orientation in the student. The student must be willing to apply existing knowledge and make active use of the teacher or other resources to leverage that knowledge toward a learning goal. Student affect must be willing to accept less than immediate gratification and persevere in the task. (Contains 17 references.) (Author/YDS)",

Teacher education programs are having difficulties helping preservice teachers develop the necessary skills required for the implementation of the contemporary vision of science instruction. Student teaching experience maintains the most important part of the teachers' preparation programs, although the student teachers are criticized for a lack of strong theoretical and conceptual framework. The understanding of preservice teachers' beliefs is an essential element in their education because of their effects on the prospective teacher's perception of classroom practice. This research investigates these questions: (1) What are the conceptions of teaching science held by  participants?; (2) How do these conceptions change as participants progress through pre-student teaching and student teaching?; (3) What is the role of pre-student teaching and student teaching in the construction of these conceptions from the perspective of the participants?; and (4) In what ways did the pre-student teaching and student teaching experiences constrain or support the development of conceptual change pedagogy among participants?

Two goals of the project were to: (a) design an innovative university and school-based program that explicitly considered &quot;learning to teach science&quot; as a process of conceptual change; and (b) examine the ways in which teacher beliefs and conceptions about learning and teaching science changed during the first level course in science pedagogy. The ways in which the prospective  science teachers came to make sense of teaching science for understanding and identify particular course events that stimulated this sense-making are examined.

        "description":"This research explores the structure of possible science education reform that can be compatible with structural change in high schools. Financial pressures, increased or decreased enrollment, state mandated changes, block scheduling, and assignments of students to age-appropriate grades are all examples of structural changes. Block scheduling is currently the most popular structuring effort, and the most common form of block scheduling allows four 90-minute classes per day. Need, clarity, complexity, and quality of the program are some of the factors that affect the success of the implemented programs. This paper reports the results of a study that investigates the role of structural changes and Block-8 Schedule on conceptual changes in science education. (Contains 15  references.) (YDS)",

        "description":"The era of economic dominance supported by the existence of a large and inexpensive labor pool, and expanding domestic market, and/or exploitation of natural resources is over in the United States. It's time to work smarter, not just work harder. Thus, the economic vitality of any region in a modern economy is dependent on the ability of its institutions to harness innovation and knowledge in order to create wealth for the population of that region. Colleges and universities, while they are one of the major repositories of intellectual capital, have traditionally stayed at \"arms length\" from the commercial activities of the companies that hire their graduates. It is probably appropriate that there be significant differences in the operating premises and mission philosophies of  the two types of organizations. However, corporations and colleges share a mutual interest in the economy. If the future success of the economy is based upon innovation and knowledge, it seems an opportune time for these two types of organizations to become colleagues in an economic partnership that brings together the resources and needs of each for the betterment of both. The general mechanism of the economic partnership between Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology and the corporate sector in Indiana is through Rose-Hulman's Technology and Entrepreneurial Development Program (TED). Business, industry, and government benefit from the creativity, innovation, and technical competence offered by the college community. Faculty and students benefit from the opportunity to work within real  world constraints on customer-driven problems. (Author)",

This is why our civilization is being often labeled as the &quot;civilization of picture&quot;. The contemporary psycho-physiological researches, along with the Dale's cone of human perception, also confirm an incomparably higher level of effectiveness with the visual perception. The actual way of university teaching, however, hardly reflects these facts. This is why it often becomes boring, unattractive and ineffective, as far as the students are concerned. On the other hand, one should not overestimate the enhanced of the visual perception in the teaching process, because it also carries bottlenecks and limitation. Its overdosing could even  bring negative effects. The author, after having been for 15 years a manager at the audio-visual university center, will present his life-long experience in application of the audio-visual forms of teaching at the technical universities, with all the prospects and limitations, pluses and minuses thereof. He will also deal with the economical side of the problem and with the programmed teaching. He outlines the principles of a rational and effective use of the didactic techniques in the university teaching process. (Author)",

Also, aspects related to aptitude and attitudes can be easily trained and discussed in this discipline. An institutional regulation for final grade of disciplines at Metallurgical and Materials Engineering Department (PMT) takes in account three tests and a seminar or experimental work. This institutional aspect was adapted in 1997 to approximately forty different kinds of evaluation including: group dynamics, video oriented activities, music oriented activities, experimental work and so on. This was a first trial to apply continuous  evaluation at this discipline. The first two classes were very important to motivate students to participate of all proposed activities. An Aesop fable and requirements to be a good performance professional were discussed during these classes. Also, discipline program was presented and discussed at the beginning of the discipline. The introduction of these activities showed very good results. All the time students were predisposed to do activities and reports, when requested. Frequency in classes were more than 90%, indicating there were encouraged by new methodology. (Author)",

Promoting an environmental ethic in this location is a challenging opportunity for educators. This paper shows that natural places in schoolgrounds can provide the venue for exciting and ongoing teaching and learning opportunities in this outdoor classroom. This paper first presents how stories and a spiritual connection to the land can enhance an environmental ethic. An assessment of the ecoliteracy and Earth Education programs is outlined. This is followed by an introduction to the Australian Timelines project and the Globe Program which are initiatives which promote the regular observation and monitoring of natural events to explore concepts of ecology. The paper then  introduces the story &quot;My Patch&quot; as a referent for teaching and learning about the natural environment. Developed by the author, with a class of 6 year old children, the story provides an integrated learning focus characteristic of a holistic view of education. The story describes the experience of a child who adopted a piece of the earth in the schoolground. The importance of narrative as a way of promoting a sensitive relationship with the earth is presented. The final section of the paper discusses the relevance of &quot;My Patch&quot; in supporting teaching and learning and in promoting an environmental ethic. (Contains 19 references.) (Author/SAH)",

        "description":"This paper presents the experiment being conducted in the Electric Circuits II course (ELE1103) at PUC-Rio's Electrical Engineering Department since March 1997. This experiment was held in both the fall and the spring semesters of 1997. The basis for the experiment was concurrent teaching methodology, to which the principles of entrepreneurship development were added. Concurrent teaching methodology includes hands on activities, and this experiment served as a test lab to improve it. Entrepreneurship development is one of the topics suggested by the National Science Foundation (NSF-USA) and by the REENGE Program (CAPES/CNPq/FINEP - Brazil). This topic has been included in the activities of the Scientific and Technological Center (CTC/PUC-Rio). This work presents the results of  the experiment and some of the ideas behind it. It is original because it strongly relied on the use of hands on practice after its fundamentals and its consequences were understood. It is a success story because the experiment's objectives were reached. The course in which the experiment was conducted includes a traditional teaching/learning activity. There is a syllabus with a specific topics to be presented in lectures, plus weekly lab sessions. This characteristic of the experiment seems to point to a possible extension to other conventional engineering courses. The paper presents an analysis of the specific characteristics of the rites of passage from the lower to the upper division of electrical Engineering Students at PUC-Rio. The contents of the courses in this transition, as well  as the study habits of the students, are discussed. Also included is a brief diagnosis of the situation previous to the experiment, along with remarks and complaints from the instructors of the courses that followed. The major points of the experiment methodology may be summarized as: (1) Relate to the students in a mature manner. The rules of the game were previously stated by the instructors and were followed throughout the course; (2) Stimulate student involvement in the activities by showing a deep involvement on the part of the teachers and instructors; (3) Relate to the students on a very specific and individual basis; (4) Develop a new method of relating concept to experiment by stimulating students to build the concepts (those strongly related to physical situations) as they  experiment in the lab; (5) Propose real world problems; (6) Suggest industrial applications and professional quality; (7) Specify the formal leadership for each project team; (8) Request minimum standards for the presentation of projects, for example, for the oral presentation students were expected to use more formal language, dress less causally and include PowerPoint type slide shows, (9) Have teams compete with one another, for example, students were graded according to the performance of each team vis-a-vis all other teams, and (10) Evaluate the results with the use of external referees, some of them from companies active in the market. In the work, the details of the experiment will be discussed. Some generalizations will be suggested. A final evaluation is presented, including  comments from students who took the courses.

Ethics are a kind of community instinct in the making.&quot; Fifty years after Leopold penned those words, the human component of natural resource science is so new and intricate that the path of social expediency is indeed not discernible. One definable ethic is the mode of guidance for effectively meeting the social dimensions of natural resource decision-making of the future. By expanding the philosophy of Leopold's land ethic, the universal principles of being fair, open, and honest are what underlie the apparent success or failure of current public/natural resource interactions. Drawing on  extensive public process experience, it is suggested that if natural resource professionals as a community embrace the fair, open, and honest philosophy as the cornerstone of public process, then Leopold's mode of guidance will have been defined for the coming century.

The 48 algebra teachers who participated in the study were from Allen, Putnam, and Van Wert counties in northwest Ohio. The participants completed a survey which included both background questions and four-point Likert-scale statements concerning graphing calculator use and views of learning algebra. When calculator use was examined in regard to the teachers' views of learning algebra and also to the teachers' background characteristics, workshop attendance was found to be an important factor in determining how the teachers use calculators. The  results also showed that a majority of the algebra teachers who use calculators in these three counties are currently using the Texas Instruments TI-83/TI-83 Plus calculator and that they are using them at least several times per week for in-class activities, homework, quizzes, and tests. The teachers' views of learning algebra were not found to be a significant factor in calculator use. (Contains 49 references.) (Author)",

An intervention strategy was designed for a sixth grade class located in a diverse suburban community in northern Illinois. The intervention targeted the mathematics curriculum and was designed to incorporate the teaching of critical thinking skills. Students were administered a pretest to determine baseline data. The intervention included the daily use of a variety of thinking skill enhancers and guided assessment of problem-solving strategies for a twenty-week period. Results indicated success on many levels. Students displayed increased self-esteem and confidence in their  abilities to problem-solve. Self-reflection of their work was also observed. Students were able to verbalize their thought processes in analyzing problems. As an indicator of success, however, it was hoped that there would have been a higher number of students displaying an increase in posttest results. Nevertheless, with over fifty percent of the students involved in the intervention showing increased scores, the time and energy expended in this project were affirmed. (Contains 13 references.)

It states that given that SEP's goal of influencing career development is a long-term one, it is necessary that the evaluation of such a project be designed as a longitudinal study. Moreover, in order to attribute effects to the intervention, the study must include a control group of students who do not attend the program.

Through the use of cooperative learning, students practiced and developed social skills needed to successfully accomplish given tasks and projects. Cooperative learning encourages group interaction with assigned roles, with each member sharing responsibility for the group and the work produced. A second grade class of twenty-five Black and Hispanic students worked in a cooperative learning environment for math. Each group completed reflections on how they worked together as a team and what they could do to improve. Groups took part in  evaluating their work both collectively and individually. Results indicated that the use of cooperative learning did generate more interest in math and made it more enjoyable for both students and teacher. Students improved academically, socially, and in self-esteem. Having assigned roles caused students to have a sense of responsibility toward the team and the completed work. Plus-Minus-Interesting (PMI) reflections proved to be very helpful and insightful for the teacher and brought ownership to the students. Noise level and monitoring conversation topics proved to be challenges when using cooperative learning. These improved when each team was assigned a \"monitor\" job to one of its members. This classroom will continue to make cooperative learning an important part of its teaching and  learning. (Author)",

The first part of this paper answers how broad the scope should be in teaching mathematics. The standards to take into consideration when broadening the scope of the mathematics curriculum are listed. Techniques of the assessment may be used to appraise the quality of scope in mathematics for students and are presented for discussion. The second part of the paper focuses on the sequence of the mathematics curriculum. Methods of teaching mathematics to emphasize a psychological curriculum are included. Finally, the role of inservice education for mathematics teachers in the scope and sequence of mathematics  curriculum are discussed. (ASK)",

        "description":"This learning module aims to engage students in problem solving, critical thinking, scientific inquiry, and cooperative learning. The module is appropriate for use in any introductory or intermediate undergraduate course that focuses on human-environment relationships. The module states that human health is a product of complex interactions among population, environment, technology, and culture, all of which are affected by global change. It explains that, for example, changes in climate or land use/land cover can affect the reproductive cycles of arthropods that transmit disease, the availability of water for hygiene and sanitation, and/or the concentration of chemical pollutants in the air, water, and soil. It also states that infectious diseases, which cause more than half the  mortalities in tropical developing countries and are resurgent in developed ones, are also potentially affected by global environmental changes. According to the module, changes associated with urbanization, globalization, and population growth and mobility encourage disease diffusion and a globalization of health risks. The module introduces students to these issues and illustrates the complex relationships among human health and global change. The module contains 5 tables, 6 figures, a list of acronyms, a guide, a summary, an overview, a glossary, references for all units, supporting materials, and appendixes with additional sources.

The guide suggests that the videos could be used in the English/language arts classroom, or as part of an interdisciplinary curriculum they could help sustain either a semester-long inquiry into issues of the arts and intellectual freedom or a chronological or thematic study of the arts in the United States. It explains that since all the videos touch on similar issues and questions, the themes become increasingly complex and interesting as they are considered in relation to different works of art. The  guide contains an explanatory section and additional sections on exploring the series' themes and on teaching \"Huckleberry Finn\" in context. It examines each video separately, with activities and questions: \"About the Film\" offers a film summary and a brief list of key terms, topics, and people; \"Literature Links\" offers ideas for using the films in conjunction with books; \"Viewpoints\" contains quotes, article excerpts, and other primary and secondary sources ideal for student discussion and activities.

The subject matter standards are the main focus of the booklet because they are the primary areas of expertise and responsibility of NCSS and its members in the national education professional community.

This guide has been designed to help educators and families in Massachusetts link character development and civic responsibility with the school curriculum. The guide's first section, excerpted from &quot;Building Character in Schools&quot; (Kevin Ryan; Karen Bohlin), presents an introduction to principles of character education. The second section presents selected learning standards from the Massachusetts &quot;Curriculum Frameworks&quot; that reflect these principles.

This collection contains units of study that were written to exemplify some of the many ways that these themes might be taught in preK-12 Massachusetts classrooms. Using the standards of the Massachusetts Curriculum Frameworks as their core, these units explore the ethical dimensions of literary and artistic works, as well as incidents from history and contemporary life. According to the collection, each work is important in its own right, and each offers students, teachers, and parents a reason to talk about the expression of ideas, the dynamics of conflict and cooperation, and humanity's search for understanding of the meaning and purpose of life.  Although the units are presented as separate entities in the collection, they would be most effective when used as part of a coordinated school program that involves parents and the community, and which is organized around the exploration of important human themes and character traits. The collection contains sample units for the elementary level, for the middle school level, and for the high school level. Each unit includes information on the standards it addresses, on teaching the unit, on extension, on assessment, on materials and resources needed, and on additional resources. (BT)",

Four elements of social studies education are necessary to help develop such citizens: knowledge, skills, values, and participation. Both the formal and the informal curriculum should be based on a reasoned commitment to a core of democratic values, ideas, and beliefs. As important as what the students learn is the way in which the student learns. The resource materials that comprise this guide are gathered together to help educators build an environment where: all teachers are informed and committed to improving education in the social sciences; all teachers are clear about the target social science standards, benchmarks, and eligible content;  standards, curriculum, and assessment are closely aligned; and students are engaged in active learning with teaching that builds upon past experiences and previous knowledge. The guide organizes the content standards in social science in five strands: history (including U.S. history and world history); geography; civics; economics; and social science analysis. It outlines content standards using a chart-style format, and then discusses the following curriculum and instruction: Benchmark 1: Primary (K-3); Benchmark 2: Elementary (4-5); Benchmark 3: Middle School (6-8); CIM Benchmark: High School (9-10); All Grade Levels; Sheltered Instruction; Web: Editorial Cartoons; and Internet Helps Meet Social Studies Benchmarks.

The purpose of these standards is to provide a framework from which teachers in North Dakota can design their visual arts curriculum. The expectations for the knowledge and skills that students should acquire are defined in the document using several levels of specificity. Standards are applied to four visual arts disciplines: production, aesthetics, art history, and art criticism. Each standard is supported by benchmarks, specific knowledge, and sample activities for grades K-4, 5-8, and 9-12. The document identifies the following standards in the visual arts: (1) Visual Art Media, Techniques, and Processes; (2) Structure and Function; (3) Subject  Matter, Themes, Symbols, and Ideas in Visual Art; (4) Visual Art History and Culture; (5) Merits of Works of Visual Art; and (6) Connections.

        "description":"Jurgen Habermas' concepts of the Theory of Human Interests, although a descriptive interpretation of history, fails to offer hope of freedom for the human race. This occurs because the components' technical interest, practical interest, and emancipatory interest are inherently conflictual. Habermas' use of Communicative Action Theory to harmonize the components also fails because of its heavy reliance upon rational thought and the requirement for yielding of personal gain in the name of humanity. The missing element in both theories appears as the ability, more than the desirability, of individuals, families, clans, and nations to experience and offer forgiveness. Forgiveness as an elemental form of human discourse represents the best of the species in terms of self-renewal and  as such becomes the enabler of release from the baser components of human interaction. Insights gathered from the study of religion, sociology, and psychotherapy all form intricate and necessary understandings in creating a model for developing people who can forgive. Inclusion of forgiveness within the educational curriculum should be a part of the underlying structure of any activities related to character or values development. (Contains 22 references.)

Character education can be the tool for that necessary teaching if consistent with Biblical teaching. There is great demand for the teaching of morality in all schools today, yet is the intention in Christian schools really to teach character? This paper reviews the background and history of both character education and Christian education. It will present practice of the Christian school community in the Seattle area and give implications of a plan for a Bible-based, developmental, character education program for Christian schools from preschool through high school.

        "author":["Shapiro, David A."],
        "description":"Character education's single-minded focus on virtues and moral exemplars is apt to leave young people wondering what an individual does to be honest or courageous or generous or determined. Kohlberg's well-known levels of moral development do not involve the application of universal principles until the most mature stages. Some discussion of moral theory, including an exploration on moral principles, could augment character education efforts. This paper discusses three interactive learning models an educator uses to help develop the moral reasoning skills of elementary and middle school students. The paper explains that the educator concentrates on three different interactive exercises: (1) a Prisoner's Dilemma-type game to teach the value of cooperation; (2) a character modeling  game that explores the meaning of fairness; and (3) a scenario exploration exercise using different moral theories to help students see how theoretical moral principles can be applied to figure out the right thing to do. Each exercise is described in detail. The paper concludes that these games and exercises enable students to generate the principles by themselves, from the inside-out, and in so doing, they achieve a familiarity and dexterity with them that otherwise would be unattainable.

Key political, religious, and psychological differences were found in the Soviet and U.S. youth organizations. Somewhat surprising were the many similarities that were also found.

        "description":"The \"Focus\" series, part of the National Council on Economic Education's (NCEE) EconomicsAmerica program, uses economics to enhance learning in subjects such as history, geography, civics, and personal finance, as well as economics. Activities are interactive, reflecting the belief that students learn best through active, highly personalized experiences with economics. The lessons are correlated explicitly to NCEE's \"Voluntary National Content Standards in Economics\" and \"A Framework for Teaching Basic Economic Concepts.\" This lesson guide helps to reinforce the case for, as well as redefine the approach to teaching about different types of economic systems, in light of the breakup of the former Soviet Union and market reforms now underway in many nations that were, until  recently, the most important examples of centrally planned economies. As demonstrated in the lessons contained in this volume, comparing the institutional arrangements that form the foundation of different nations' economic systems reveals that a wide spectrum still exists, ranging from largely individualistic and market-oriented approaches to a considerable degree of governmental intervention in the overall economy. This guide contains an introductory essay, \"A Comparative Analysis of Economic Systems,\" as well as 12 lessons that feature a wide range of activities, handouts, and discussion guides for classroom use.

        "description":"The objective of this research project is to observe some effects music has on the elementary classroom. This study was conducted with the third grade students throughout the first semester of the 1999-2000 school year. Music is a language with powerful appeal to children of all ages. Love of music may be an excellent strategy to assist and motivate children to learn. It is also important to note that children retain 24 percent of what they hear, 40 percent of what they see, and 70 percent of what they learn through multisensory experiences. The instructor explored strategies in which music might enhance the classroom learning environment. Some strategies that were implemented were the use of rhythm spelling and using song and movements to help remember key concepts. Background  music during instruction was employed. The instructor implemented music to change the students' state of mind. Finally, motivation was explored through music in the classroom. Results suggested that the students enjoyed the varied uses of music in the classroom. Motivating music, the clapping rhythm, and Rhythm Spelling were cited as particularly useful and appreciated by students. The use of positive morning music was found to be not helpful in improving the classroom environment. (Author/BB)",

        "description":"Japanese education, including preservice teacher education, is incorporating instructional technology as an effective, systematic way to enhance planning, teaching, and learning. Japanese researchers developed a framework for using instructional technology to develop lesson plans for autonomous learning. Preservice teachers in Japan tend to hold rigid images of teaching from their own schooling experiences, and in the beginning stages of instructional design, then tend to refer to such images to generate lesson plans. New types of software, such as PowerPoint, provide ways for preservice teachers to express ideas in a flexible manner and revise them with ease. Repeated revisions enable them to refine their ideas and make them relevant to instructional events observed during  teaching. The design procedure proposed here consists of four components: images, concepts related to each other by graphic representation, models, and propositions (ICMP). These components form the sequential steps in the ICMP method of instructional design and analysis. This paper describes how the framework was used in a preservice course on instructional technology. The instructor used PowerPoint for lesson planning and presentation, though students did not use any information technology. (SM)",

        "description":"This paper explores the university supervisor's role in the Professional Development School (PDS) context, examining the influence of the PDS context on one student teacher supervisor's practice at Penn State University and the surrounding school district. The primary vehicle around which the PDS was structured was a 1-year internship for senior undergraduates who spent that time in an elementary school. Data came from the supervisor's daily journal, field notes, observations, and conference notes. He found that several factors appeared to be quite different in the PDS versus traditional context, including: readiness building; relationships with mentors, interns, and children; stages of development in reflective supervision over time; his knowledge of and focus on individual  children; his encouragement of interns to progress at an individually appropriate pace; and the role of goal setting and evaluation. Being able to spend significant time over 1 year with interns and mentors significantly altered their relationships, allowing him to become a co-teacher and colleague as well as a supervisor. He was able to focus the supervisory process on individual children as well as children as a whole. He believes that his effectiveness as a supervisor increased in the PDS context.

The project was designed to build a knowledge base of teacher learning and professional development processes and to define when, where, and how participants would intervene in these processes to refine the knowledge. Researchers examined how the constructive-collaborative intervention, which drew upon reflection of teachers' practice could help improve pedagogical actions in order to overcome school, teacher, and student failure. Data from descriptive and analytical studies, follow-up studies, ethnographic studies,  case studies, observation, diary entries, interviews, and document analysis indicated it was impossible to divide practice and conceptions into reflective and nonreflective groupings. Different levels and types of reflection were evident. Teachers' degree of intensity in participation increased when discussion related to the daily practice, problems, and challenges they faced in the classroom. Teachers considered their practice their only realm of competence. Personal theories developed by teachers matched most formal theoretical knowledge. Teaching and learning experiences were important strategies in professional learning. Teachers' learning processes were more practical than theoretical oriented. (Contains 43 references.) (SM)",

Using phenomenological analysis, the researcher interviewed male and female beginning teachers in public and private schools. Respondents identified good and bad mentors. Their significant statements were organized into clusters of common themes, and from these clusters, exhaustive descriptions of the phenomenon were produced. Male teachers used direct metaphors to explain their expectations of what mentors should be, while female teachers' metaphors were implied rather than explicit. Though males' and females' comments reflected similarities in their expectations of mentors and mentor-mentee relationships, some gender differences  emerged. Both groups believed mentors should be emotionally available and experienced teachers. Males felt mentors should be friends and confidantes and enjoy mentoring. Females felt mentors should coach or give advice. Males' metaphors revealed a mentor-mentee relationship that was similar to the relationship between therapists and clients or parents and children. Females perceived the relationship as similar to the practical relationship between a coach and athlete or advisor and advisee. Three appendixes include: tables of significant statements; tables of clusters of common themes; and tables of textual, structural, and exhaustive descriptions. (Contains 12 references.) (SM)",

Classroom assessment can help instructors become more sensitive to individual students, create more awareness of where understanding is less clear, keep students more engaged and challenged, and model practices helpful to students' own teaching practice. Steps in this process include: developing questions one wants to ask about one's own teaching; selecting or developing classroom assessment techniques that best address those questions; administering the assessment tasks or strategies; interpreting the data; and using those data to plan the next teaching/learning experience. This paper  discusses the importance of a course in authentic early childhood education observation and assessment techniques, which should involve modeling of appropriate classroom assessment and the process of utilizing information gained to best meet students' instructional needs. It describes how one college professor experimented with various classroom assessment techniques in order to develop and maintain a high quality learning experience in her classroom. She used classroom assessments to examine the extent to which graduate students met course objectives and to identify elements of the teaching/learning process that best meet students' instructional needs.

About 6 in 10 respondents were extremely or very well-prepared to teach in Kentucky schools. Those prepared in Kentucky institutions felt better prepared for Kentucky's schools than those prepared elsewhere. There was wide variation in preparedness for new teacher standards and preparedness for the seven attributes of Kentucky's  primary program. Less than half of new 5th-12th grade teachers felt extremely well-prepared to implement or participate in key instructional practices initiated by KERA. All respondents felt much less prepared to implement or participate in eight specific programs and practices initiated by Kentucky's school reform law than to implement traditional teaching skills of planning, implementing, and assessing instruction. Three-quarters of new teachers believed their preparation program positively influenced them concerning KERA. Respondents rated the Kentucky Teacher Internship Program highly.

After presenting two teachers' stories of being mentored, the paper describes mentoring relationships, then highlights the stages of mentoring: invitation stage, when beginning teachers are introduced to veteran teachers; sparkle stage, when mentors and proteges try to please each other; knowing stage, when mentors and proteges begin to learn about one another; action stage, when work gets done; emancipation stage, which is the beginning of letting go; and transformation stage, when mentors and proteges redefine their relationship. The paper examines benefits of mentoring, which include feelings  of rejuvenation for mentors and exposure to experts' thoughts and ideas for proteges. Pitfalls of mentoring include mutual dependence that can be hard to break and an expectation by mentors that their proteges become virtual reproductions of them. Twelve qualities of good mentors include: having sincere interest in their proteges as human beings; being other-centered; believing in inclusivity; and being dynamic. Ten qualities of good proteges include: considering hope and optimism; being open to continuous learning; being able to let go; and valuing humor. (SM)",

Each team works with limited numbers of students. Teams of teachers collaborate in and across those groups. Students also work in a variety of groups. The school has an ideological and structural commitment to collaboration, and schedules and curricula foster collaboration. Teachers collaborate by meeting formally and informally. Whole school planning  time is scheduled monthly. Using observations and individual and group interviews with teachers, paraprofessionals, and administrators, this study documented the process of informal and formal collaboration and respondents' opinions about their collaboration. Overall, teachers were extremely busy, working hard to achieve positive results. Their feverish pace appeared to be fueled by a tremendous commitment to doing right by their students. Many felt the pace was almost too difficult. There was a sense that teachers at different career stages contributed to and gained from collaboration differently.

        "description":"This study investigated the situations of at-risk students considered for becoming principals, examining whether it was worth the risk of admitting them into principal preparation programs. Students had undergraduate grade point averages (UGPAs) of at least 2.85 over the last 2 years of the undergraduate program. If they did not meet GPA standards, they could be admitted on probation. Students had to take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) and have acceptable letters of recommendation in order to be admitted to the Masters Degree program. Researchers classified students into categories by UGPA and examined their records to determine who completed the program and who did not. When students completed the probationary program with at least a B average, took the GRE, and completed  the Masters Degree, their academic records were examined to discern predictors of graduate school success. Of the 42 students for whom data were complete, 28 completed the degree and 14 did not. The most significant predictor of graduate student success was the variable in which the UGPA was multiplied by the scaled GRE verbal score. This predictive model was significant for both probationary and nonprobationary students. The undergraduate major emerged as a predictor of success. (Contains 43 references.) (SM)",

        "description":"Principals, aspiring principals, and superintendents completed surveys investigating the state of the principalship in Indiana. Respondents rank-ordered selected skills and personal traits necessary to succeed as school principals. Perceived barriers for principal candidates were compared by group. A total of 581 principals, 55 aspiring principals, and 221 superintendents participated. Principals and aspiring principals considered honesty and leadership very important personality traits. They also believed that communication skills and instructional improvement were the most important factors in training principals, and they considered job stress, too much time required, and insufficient compensation the most important barriers. Superintendents and principals differed in how they  rated the impact of barriers. Superintendents believed that the number one barrier to someone entering the principalship was too few experienced teachers interested in becoming assistant principals or principals. Job satisfaction among principals was high. A majority of principals did not plan to remain in the principalship beyond 10 years, though almost half intended to remain in their current positions until retirement. Average experience plus age indicated that a high percentage of principals were eligible for retirement. Three-quarters of aspiring principals thought their principalship preparation program had prepared them to succeed as principals. (Contains 25 references.) (SM)",

        "description":"Preparing teachers to incorporate technology into teaching is a requirement in teacher education. Using a course Web site as an instructional method expands students' understanding of technology applications. One aspect of a course Web site particularly suited to facilitating and improving learning is a discussion area (bulletin board) where students post comments related to course content and process. Electronic bulletin boards offer students such opportunities as: responding after a self-determined wait time; responding thoughtfully and without interruption; reading peer contributions and reflecting before responding; and dialoguing directly with peers. Instructors benefit from opportunities to: foster student dialogue; observe and analyze content from student discussions;  assess students' thought processes and comprehension; and elicit feedback. Written scripts of Web site discussions can serve as tools to enhance instructors' understanding of each student's perspective. An appendix presents a sample bulletin board discussion conducted as part of an educational psychology course at Wright State University, Ohio. The comments reveal a pervasive student belief that teaching is an innate gift predicated upon certain personality traits rather than theories and skills one can learn to become a teacher. Motivating the students to use the Web site was challenging, though setting up the Web site was relatively easy. (SM)",

During one-on-one semi-structured interviews, the majority of the 15 preservice teachers in this study described teacher leaders as being both advocates for students and agents for positive change. Approximately half of the participants shared traditional views of the role of principal (i.e., hierarchical rule-maker and enforcer). The other half believed that it was important for the principal and the teacher to share leadership responsibilities. Although the  participants articulated the difficulty in fulfilling the role of teacher leader early in their careers, they believed they would eventually serve as change agents for school reform.

Popular sports begin in school and promote health and wellbeing. The German Handicapped Sports Association promotes sports for people with disabilities. Top athletes are role models for young people in general and young athletes in particular. There is government support for top athletes. The sporting world has to work with the problem of drugs in athletics (doping to boost performance). Sponsorship is becoming increasingly important as a new form of  cooperation between the sport and business sectors. The mass media has a tremendous influence on German athletics, both positive and negative. About one-third of European Union citizens are members of sports associations. The European Sports Forum was established in 1991 to create a forum for discussion and information exchange. Germany's involvement in the Olympics has been very politicized over the years for many reasons, and competitive sport has rarely been free from political pressure. (SM)",

Interviews involved superintendents' office representatives, union presidents, school board members, peer evaluators, and evaluated teachers. Group interviews were conducted with teachers. Results indicated that teacher peer review programs offered unions an avenue for successfully reconciling the competing criteria for legitimacy, though implementation of peer  review programs did not guarantee successful reconciliation. While there were strong supporters of peer review in each district, strong critics were not as evenly distributed. The strongest opposition to peer review within teachers unions occurred at state and national levels. All four programs contributed to the betterment of overall teacher quality, though these contributions were not sufficient to meet the professional criterion for quality.

It highlights a collaborative research relationship that the researcher had with an experienced high school English teacher, Anna. Using life history, ethnographic, and narrative approaches, the researcher explored the history and evolution of Anna's beliefs about literacy and how those beliefs were related to her teaching practices throughout her career. Anna's story was situated within the larger context of a self-study. The researcher conducted 10 formal interviews with Anna; held dozens of informal  conversations with her over 5 years; made over 50 visits to her classroom; spoke with people familiar with her about her teaching practices and thinking about literacy; and examined copies of professional documents. The researcher highlighted: what was relevant, true, necessary and ethical in his account of Anna; the value of friendship; problems with informed consent; the importance of doing no harm; the benefits of anonymity; and sharing the risk.

This teacher log was developed for use in the Study of Instructional Improvement, a longitudinal study on school improvement in high poverty areas. The researchers wanted to further develop the potential of teacher logs by experimenting with Web-based technology and computer branching. The 1998 teacher log study tested the feasibility of using a Web based instrument to collect data on instruction. Seven elementary teachers used the log to report on 29 mathematics and reading lessons. Researchers observed classroom instruction, completed log reports, and wrote detailed narrative descriptions for 24 lessons. All teachers were able to use the log to report on  instruction. Data were successfully entered through a Web interface into a database and subsequently used to conduct provisional analyses of both instruction and instrument reliability and validity. The researchers conclude that a Web-based instrument can be used successfully to capture important information about teaching, some of which has not been available before (lesson duration, student attendance for each lesson, and instructional groupings or formats for each lesson). An appendix offers teacher log pilot help pages. (SM)",

The Framework for Healthy Living Education supports and reinforces the goals and objectives of its three major components: health education, physical education, and alcohol and other drugs. When the concepts of these areas are integrated, the health and well-being of students can be significantly enhanced. This paper describes characteristics of effective programs (e.g., based on skill development, involves students actively in learning, and culturally sensitive); discusses the most important health behaviors to target (e.g., insufficient exercise, attempted suicide, and involvement in violence); presents Healthy Living Education  curriculum topics (e.g., stress management, substance abuse, and personal fitness); and notes healthful living education skills (e.g., self-esteem building, behavior self-management, and communication). After discussing benefits of the Healthful Living Education program, the paper presents the curriculum for grades K-12. Each section offers a list of objectives related to preparatory, stress management, protecting self/others, relationships, nutrition/weight management, substance abuse, personal fitness skills, recreational dance skills, game and sport skills, and developmental gymnastic skills.

The study occurred over three-quarters of one academic year, with the survey instrument administered to all student teachers at one small, private college during student teaching orientation. Students were placed in a variety of student teaching settings, mainly in suburban schools. During the final 2 weeks of student teaching, all preservice teachers completed the instrument again. A total of 100 usable forms were obtained over the three quarters. Data analysis indicated that the group as a whole showed a statistically significant gain in efficacy as a result of student teaching, though there were differences between elementary and secondary  preservice teachers. There were no statistically significant changes by gender in scores between pretest and posttest. The results suggest that preservice teachers' efficacy prior to student teaching is a reasonable predictor of efficacy after student teaching ends. The survey is appended. (Contains 10 references.)

Support programs can help schools and districts improve teacher retention rates by enhancing new teacher satisfaction. Support for beginning teachers can include personal and emotional support; task- or problem-focused support; and critical reflection on teaching experience. Low-intensity support strategies include providing orientation for new teachers, matching beginning and veteran teachers, adjusting working conditions, and promoting collegial collaboration. High-intensity support strategies include selecting and training effective support providers, providing release time, using mini-courses to address common challenges, and  examining the evidence. Additional strategies from abroad include networking new teachers and using group observation and advice. Institutional policies and practices that strengthen beginning teacher support efforts include early identification of beginning teachers by the personnel office, realistic expectations for beginners, cooperative agreements with unions, coordination of efforts, and release time. Inevitable challenges for support programs include choosing and preparing support providers, providing time for support activities, managing the relationship between beginning teacher support and beginning teacher evaluation, and getting resources to struggling teachers.

There is no one best way to construct a support program, though all programs must address two fundamental needs: helping candidates understand and manage the assessment process and helping them become better at analyzing student work. To help candidates manage the assessment process, support programs commonly work with them to: clarify the commitment, manage expectations, generate administrative support, offer structure, enhance candidate communication skills, and prepare for the assessment center experience. Helping candidates become more analytical about their own teaching involves setting the stage for  focused examination, facilitating discussions, grouping by certificate area, individualizing support, and identifying appropriate support.

        "description":"This study attempted to (1) expand the dichotomous classification scheme typically used by educators and researchers to describe teaching incentives and (2) offer administrators and teachers an alternative framework within which to develop incentive systems. Elementary, middle, and high school teachers in Ohio rated 10 commonly instituted teaching incentives for teaching performance with respect to level of motivation offered by each. Incentives included: a one-time monetary award; being selected as the district's teacher of the year; receiving funds to attend an instructional workshop; having students thank them for helping them understand a difficult concept; participating in teacher projects; getting early retirement/contract buy-out; observing vast improvement in student  achievement levels since the beginning of the year; being awarded a plaque by students; and being permitted to purchase additional classroom equipment and supplies. A factor analytic approach determined the resulting factor structure underlying teachers' ratings. This resulted in a four-factor model, which the paper discusses as an alternative to the dichotomous classification scheme. The conceptual labels attached to the four categories of teaching incentives are student-centered rewards, professional development incentives, school district recognition awards, and financial compensation.

        "description":"This paper reports the results and educational implications of an experimental, comparative study evaluating the gains in overall writing quality in two groups of college freshmen composition students. The experimental group of 45 students learned to compose their first four of eight essays on the computer, while their professor intervened with feedback during their writing processes. The control group of 43 students did not receive this instructional treatment, as their instructor gave them feedback only after grading each of their eight handwritten products. The researchers hypothesized that feedback from the professor during the planning and composing processes, especially on the computer, was statistically more effective on students' writing quality than the other  instructor's graded feedback on students' handwritten products. This study used a quantitative, pretest/post-test experimental design, with statistical analysis (paired T-tests). According to the results, the students' gains in overall writing quality, between pretest and post-test essays, were statistically significant for both comparison groups of college freshmen writers. However, statistically, there was a highly significant difference between the two groups in the students' post-test outcomes. The experimental group had significantly higher post-test scores and showed more significant gains in writing quality than the control group. In addition, students in the experimental group learned long-term skills in word processing for successful communication on any writing assignment. This  study also suggests numerous variables or features in teaching writing for further research, helping educators realize that remaining &quot;up close and personal&quot; facilitates their students' planning, composing, and revising, especially on the computer, to produce much more effective college writers, as well as more successful graduates and employees.

        "description":"In the Province of Quebec, and in particular on the island of Montreal, large communities of the French-speaking Quebecois majority and the English-speaking Quebecker minority have historically co-inhabited peacefully. There is, nonetheless, an ebb and flow in the conflict between the two languages. In recent years, the Government of Quebec has legislated mandatory use of French to promote Quebecois identity. To the English-speaking community, mandatory French has meant at times banning the English language. The reporting of language legislation of successive Quebec governments and the public reaction is known as the language portfolio. The study identified important differences in the treatment of the language portfolio between two prominent daily newspapers in Quebec: one  French-language, the other English. To explore the differences, the same three stories were chosen from each. Each article was subjected to a content analysis to quantify the portion of fact and opinion. Then the articles were analyzed to determine how ideas were treated. This was accomplished by, most importantly, considering the journalistic approach in both French and English. At the same time, common rhetorical features shared in the discourse of the two languages were categorized and their contents contrasted for the intended impact on the reader. Among these rhetorical features were openings and closures, quotations, vocabulary, and dramatic devices, including hyperbole and irony. While front page stories in both newspapers were essentially factual, there were varying amounts of  opinion in the English editorials (40-60%) and French editorials (50-60%). Analyzing the journalistic approach and rhetorical features of the two languages revealed important differences in impact. Whereas the English newspaper generally conveyed a message of &quot;holding our own,&quot; the French newspaper conveyed a message of frustration that the majority view could not be respected.

        "description":"This paper examines the effects of site-based budgeting in education. It describes and presents a school-based budgetary decision-making model that was designed originally to shift the balance of power from the central office to the building level. The model has been refined and successfully utilized in one school district for 20 years, and its use was credited with bringing control and decision-making closer to the child and classroom, thus making the individual schools within the district more responsive to the children's and the community's needs. The report offers suggestions for practitioners and policymakers who might be considering the reallocation of power and resources to the local schools. It explores the history of central-office budgetary control in the district and  outlines how the reallocation of authority required the development of trust within the district. The reorganization also established decision-making parameters, allowed sufficient time for the school community to implement the plan, instituted an on-going staff-development program, provided technical support, and maintained accountability. The paper makes some suggestions for establishing a decentralization model, which include: plan carefully, expect resistance, be prepared to deal with negative staff members, establish clear lines of communication with administrators, and establish realistic expectations.

        "author":["Anderson, Lesley"],
        "description":"This paper reports on empirical research carried out during a two-year period in which the British government introduced a new framework for the reorganization of schools. The research assessed the views of the governors and managers of grant-maintained (GM) schools with regard to their interpretations about the future governance of their schools. The article traces the move to self-governance in the 1980s and the creation of the GM schools. GM status gave schools the opportunity to govern and manage themselves; they differed from other publicly-funded schools in that they were incorporated institutions directly funded by central government and had no legal relationships with a local education authority. The paper reviews the research on the GM schools and details the research  carried out for this report. The data for the study were generated through a pilot phase and a main survey. The findings indicate some reluctance on the part of GM headteachers and chairs of governors to accept the changes in the structure and powers of the governing bodies of their schools. These leaders reported that, under the arrangements for GM schools, they had more freedom and flexibility to recruit governors who brought specific skills and expertise to the job.

It explains how state officials in the 1960s finally realized that the education of the citizenry was essential to the state's economic development. Initial efforts in school reform focused on the curriculum, but it soon become clear that simply writing new curriculum standards would have only minimal effects on what students actually learned. Attention then shifted to teachers, and it was decided that reform should be based on students' demonstrated knowledge. The report discusses the introduction of the end-of-grade (EOG) tests and the determination that students would be judged on a standard score that would determine the degree to which a school had met, failed to meet, or exceeded the  expected growth for the students in that school. Schools were then assigned to four categories: meets expected growth, low-performing school, nonrecognition school, and meets exemplary growth. The article then explores the various problems this method engendered, such as concerns that the statistical complexity of the program was exacerbated by a lack of explanatory materials for the public and for teachers, and teachers' and schools' belief that truncating the curriculum was a reasonable strategy for meeting expectations.

It portrays a dire situation in which projected budget gaps will be approximately $2.8 billion in 2000-01 and $4.6 billion in 2001-02. The budget does feature planned, year-end fund balances, but the level of nonrecurring resources also increased. It describes how most of the budget's spending increases are driven by current law and the legislative rejection of proposed cuts, rather than by program expansions. The text focuses on how education, local governments, and health and social services fared in the budget. It details how a 7.8 percent state-aid increase is provided for the 1999-00 school year, bringing total  aid to more than $12.6 billion. However, this increase is diminished by the budget's failure to advance the equity of the aid distribution and by the lateness of the budget. Local governments received a small, year- to-year increase in revenue sharing aid, and Medicaid received no new cuts. A multiyear tax cut was enacted, but it is claimed that under other measures the budget would have constituted a tax increase. Finally, a description of a five-year capital plan is offered. (RJM)",

The paper describes the state of gender equity in the United States and the ongoing discrimination that still exists. It discusses the positive effects wrought by Title X. It discusses the connection between self-image and the availability of, or lack of, gender-specific role models in the schools, where the teaching staff is predominantly female and the administration is predominantly male. Studies have shown that females typically have lower self-esteem than boys as a result of subtle cultural  messages. Those women who do enter educational administration are typically better educated than their male counterparts, with women administrators being almost twice as likely as male administrators to have earned a doctorate. The article discusses the barriers women face in their efforts to move into educational administration and explores how a female's socialization to work differs from that of a man.

It also discusses the New Interstate School Leaders Licensure Consortium (ISLLC) standards. To assess the extent to which the program achieved its goals, 27 aspiring leaders, all of whom are black, completed a newly developed Aspiring Leaders Development Questionnaire (ALDQ) and also answered open-ended questions. The ALDQ's 42 questions and items assessed students' perceptions of the different aspects of the Aspiring Leaders Development Program (ALDP), as well as their leadership motivation. The results show that the participants' leadership competence, autonomy, relatedness, and motivation were all positively correlated with  each other. The strongest predictors of educational leadership motivation were social- relatedness, leadership competence, and autonomy, respectively. ALDP supported students' competence, autonomy, relatedness, leadership motivation, and knowledge of ISLLC standards. This strengthens the theory that social contexts that accompany a leader's leadership competence, autonomy, and relatedness will activate the leader's intrinsic leadership motivation. Communication and financial support services were the identified weakness. Findings are discussed in terms of their implications for improving the ALDP and the program's ability to prepare aspiring educational leaders for licensure.

It shows that to create a safe school environment, preventive measures for children's behavior and emotional problems must be in place. It advocates positive behavior management, social- skills instruction, academic enrichment, parent partnerships, and school/community-agency linkages. Although such practices cannot prevent all inappropriate behaviors from occurring, they can help create a school environment that promotes positive behavior. The information in the guide is based on the work of researchers at 6 universities who spent the last 6 years implementing school-based prevention practices. Their  focus was on students with--and at risk of developing--emotional and behavioral disorders. Examples of prevention strategies from each of these projects are included throughout the document. Although research-based strategies varied across the districts represented in the guide, one finding remained constant. That is, administrators were key players in making prevention work. They provided an environment that fostered positive behavior and made available specialized support and services that interrupt cycles of negative behavior. Contact information for each project is found at the end of the guide. (Contains 20 references.) (RJM)",

It provides a brief background for each area and addresses some commonly recognized issues, such as access to schooling and dropping out. The article discusses educational policies and examines some less-commonly recognized issues in higher education, literacy, and the gendered nature of the teaching force. It describes how education is a social equalizer, and it provides an overview of the state response to education. In contrasting Latin America and Africa, it shows how economic constraints, social exclusion, and the need to respond to global forces have shaped each area. It states that the longer history of nations in Latin America, as compared to Africa, has resulted in higher  levels of educational attainment but has not resulted in a society more conscious of social and gender equity. Although education is perceived as important for employment, it is differentially possessed by the poor and the non-poor. Educational problems regarding gender exist in both regions, and access is far from sufficient to provide a transformative education. Although basic education is promoted for girls, social mobility in Latin America today is associated with a completed secondary and higher education. (Contains 11 references.) (RJM)",

        "description":"This essay examines poverty in Latin America and its effect on education. It focuses on sexual bias and emphasizes that poverty is inherent in the social and economic structure of the region. The text examines how states in Latin America view the role of education, and it describes the growing chasm between the poor and the gentrified in various countries. It explores the key features of poverty and examines the relationship between poverty and schooling, poor families and schooling, teachers and poor children, and poverty and women, especially the myriad ways that poverty and stereotypes restrict opportunities open to women. The essay discusses the role of governmental policies in poverty and how gender in public policy is becoming an increasingly accepted configuration. The  difficulties in enacting educational policies due to entrenched sex stereotypes and the resultant political action fomented by civil society are both described. The essay concludes that poverty is endemic in Latin America and affects a large segment of the population. Furthermore, gender bias in schooling slows any progress that women can make in realizing their full potential. (Contains 30 references.) (RJM)",

It examines the actions and feelings of the person in the assistant principal position, the way that person saw and managed the job, and how that person affects, and is affected by, the job. Operating as a \"participant as observer,\" the assistant principal kept a comprehensive diary of her activities during her first year on the job. She teamed with an outside observer, and the two met weekly to discuss diary entries and to probe her interpretations of events. The essay discusses the background of the assistant principal, who is an African-American, and the context of her hiring. It also offers a detailed picture of the assistant principal's professional and private lives, offering examples of how she handles  herself in the public and private spheres. Following an overview of the themes that dominate the work of the assistant principal, the results of the study are presented. The findings suggest that although the principal sets the assistant principal's agenda, the implication that the assistant principal has little opportunity to exercise control over the position may be inaccurate.

        "description":"This paper discusses the debate on paradigms in educational administration and how this debate cannot be separated from the debate on the nature of the school. It asks questions about the extent to which recent challenges to traditional paradigms succeeded in changing the debate on the school as an organization. It supports arguments that the most serious challenge to any traditional science of education is to produce useful generalizations that explain particular social and organizational phenomena. It also claims that theorists in the field of educational administration always possess an underlying philosophy of the school as an organization. The essay offers an overview of various conceptions of the school community as gemeinschaft (community) and gesellschaft (society),  emphasizing the theories of T.B. Greenfield, D.J. Willower, and C.W. Evers and G. Lakomski. The text focuses on the theory-ladeness of observations and societal and cultural influences on schooling. Overviews of organizational studies and the legal and ethical dimensions of the debate are also presented. The paper concludes that schools may be seen as an organizational and societal relationship because they rely on norms, purposes, values, professional socialization, collegiality, and natural independence and because the process of achieving the objectives of education guides schools' regulative activities.

It opens with the statement that solutions start with family, community, faith, and a culture that reinforces the lessons of right and wrong. It advocates connecting every child with a caring adult, creating gang-free communities, keeping guns away from kids, holding parents accountable for raising their children, helping kids who need it most, and providing a safe school for every child. Among the recommendations found in the report were to establish a statewide gang initiative in the Colorado Attorney General's Office; raise the age from 18 to 21 for purchasing firearms at gun shows; require safe storage of  firearms in the home; provide more early identification and better referral to intervention services for high-risk children; speed up termination of parental rights in cases of severe abuse, neglect, or abandonment; promote responsible fatherhood; increase government/faith-based partnerships; increase government/business partnerships targeting kids who would benefit the most; change confidentiality laws to allow schools and law-enforcement agencies to share information; and enforce state laws regarding school codes of conduct and zero tolerance of inappropriate behavior.

It discusses research on the relationship between time and learning, explores the limitations of existing research, and defines the terms used in research, such as allocated time, engaged time, and academic-learning time. It offers the basic findings of these studies, including the conclusion that there is little or no relationship between allocated time and student achievement, that there is some relationship between engaged time and achievement, and that there is a larger relationship between academic-learning time and achievement. The  text encourages educators to focus on the time that matters; research indicates that there is no consistent relationship between the amount of time allocated for instruction and the amount of time students spend engaged in learning activities. The document examines the costs of adding time and some of the key factors in maximizing existing time, including classroom management, the appropriateness of instruction and curriculum, and student motivation.

Although researchers have accused each other of specious findings, some generally consistent results have arisen: families that are served by vouchers are generally low income, parents were more satisfied with private schools than with prior public schools, the education levels of parents of enrolled voucher students were higher than those of students in the public schools generally, voucher students were more likely to live in single-parent families, students of certain racial and ethnic backgrounds made up a greater portion of voucher recipients than their numbers in the school populations would predict, and mobility  rates and attrition rates were essentially the same for voucher recipients and public school students. Inconsistent findings were also evident, including the effects of vouchers on student achievement, as well as the degree of parental involvement. The report recommends that more attention be devoted to other choice alternatives, costs, program design, and the education gap. Synopses of alternatives for providing school choice, such as charter schools, open enrollment, homeschooling, magnet schools, and private vouchers, are presented. Contains 10 references. (RJM)",

(2) Does participation in, and the implementation of, Accountability Dialogues result in authentic accountability and improved student performance? (3) What strategies are most effective to assist schools and districts in conducting Accountability Dialogues? and (4) How does one \"scale up\" the preparation of schools and districts to become authentically accountable?

It identifies key challenges in district-school relationships and outlines some ways in which districts and charters can work with each other more effectively. It is hoped that the examples provided by a large urban district have relevance for other developing charter schools and the districts that sponsor them. The text discusses the parameters of the district/charter-school relationship, detailing the types of charter schools that various states allow. The document describes the challenges  in the district-school relationship, such as finding the balance between autonomy and accountability and administering, supporting, and communicating with charter schools. It explains how districts can work better with charter schools and how they can plan for the different needs of conversions and start-ups, and explores charter-school sponsorship as well as the need to set clear expectations for charter approval and renewal. The importance of establishing a liaison between school and district and encouraging and supporting interaction between charter and other schools is likewise presented. (Contains 11 references.)

The article reviews the related literature, including values theory, work values measurement, work values in education administration, selection research in education administration, and principal job attributes, and then describes the mechanism of the study on which the report is based. The study participants (N=169) were experienced teachers enrolled in graduate-education courses at a large research university in Kentucky. The study examined the effects of two between-groups factors (teacher school level and teacher  dominant work value) and two within-groups factors (principal dominant work value and principal job attributes). The study participants rated each principal candidate--each rating served as a dependent variable. Findings show that teachers preferred candidates with whom they shared a dominant work value. Elementary and middle-school teachers preferred candidates oriented toward instructional leadership, whereas high school teachers preferred candidates oriented toward management. The findings suggest that teachers on school councils may need training support when called upon to participate in administrative decisions. (Contains 31 references.) (RJM)",

It extends empirical research about work values by examining the influence of values, operationalized as four work values (achievement, concern for others, fairness, honesty) germane to the school work environment. The document reviews related literature, including values theory, work values in education, and experimental designs for teacher-selection research. The report is based on a study of 115 principals that employed a mixed between-within design approach. The between-group independent variables included the four work values, four principal-candidate work-value interactions, and six principal  characteristics such as age and gender. The dependent variable was \"principal rating\" of a teacher candidate. The Comparative Emphasis Scale measured the dominant work values of the school principals and the between-within factorial design. A stepwise multiple regression was used to regress principal ratings of a teacher candidate on principal and teacher dominant work values and on principal/teacher work-value interactions. The four work-value interactions and teacher work-value achievement accounted for a significant amount of variance in principal ratings of teachers, suggesting that principal work values influence teacher-selection decisions.

The article models the decision to retain a child as a parental decision in which a parent holds a child back because the benefit of retention is higher expected earnings. The costs of retention include deferred entry into the job market and other nonpecuniary considerations. The paper contains an empirical section that uses the High School and Beyond (HSB) data set to examine the effects of retention on the probability of dropping out of high school and on labor market earnings several years after the student has entered the workforce. Information on respondents to the 1980 sophomore cohort of the HSB data set was used. The samples for  white males and white females were four to five times as large as their black counterparts. The results show significant differences between males and females who are white and males and females who are black. For all demographic groups, the effect of grade retention on dropping out of high school and on labor-market earnings suggests a negative and statistically significant relationship between repeating a grade and the outcomes.

The booklet outlines the seminar process in which \"nonexperts\" come together to discuss problems and formulate solutions. The first day was devoted to introductions in which each participant made a brief statement about the topic. During the opening session several issues were identified that would be discussed during the seminar: (1) violence, especially in schools,  often involves boys attacking girls, both verbally and physically; (2) boys are raised to be physically strong and to deny their emotional side; (3) the stereotypes about boys are inculcated through sports, media, and gender inequality; (4) boys from one-parent families often have no adult male model; and (5) boys who are \"different\" are often objects of ridicule. Day two of the seminar featured presentations, reflections, and the formulation of programs. An overview of the four pilot programs that arose from the seminar are presented.

It provides an indepth examination of school-based management (SBM) with the aim of revealing why this type of reform seems to have had so little payoff for students. It addresses several key questions: What are the objectives of SBM, and are these objectives consistent with an expectation of increased student performance? What is the theoretical basis for SBM and does that theory link SBM to student performance? How fully have SBM programs been implemented? and How can SBM be modified to increase its likelihood of positively influencing student achievement? The report is presented in four chapters. Chapter 1 is devoted to definitions, objectives, and theory underlying SBM, whereas chapter 2  focuses on SBM as it is currently practiced in school districts across America, with an emphasis on the limits of its design and implementation. Chapter 3 presents a proposed model of school-based improvement (SBI), and chapter 4 provides guidance to school boards seeking to implement this new approach. The SBI model, which builds upon existing theory, is offered as an alternative to SBM. Its ultimate objective is to improve school performance and to raise student achievement through a district-wide effort. (Contains 168 references.) (RJM)",

Because much of the law applicable to child abuse is controlled by state codes, administrative regulations, or decisions by state courts, the analysis presented in each chapter is general rather than specific in nature and should not be construed as legal advice. Eight appendices provide various sample policies and legal references. (RJM)",

        "description":"This guide describes the school administrator's managerial role. It is designed to help readers gain additional insights into this role by explaining how to conduct a self-review of the strengths and weaknesses of educational-management-related policies and procedures in school districts. It begins with a discussion of a school administrators' multiple roles. Chapter 1 distinguishes between the equally important leadership and managerial roles of the educational administrator, whereas the remaining chapters focus on the managerial role and related tasks, which are often overlooked in educational administration education and literature. Chapter 2 describes the management model upon which the Effective School District Management Review Instrument (ESDMRI) is based, with special  emphasis on managerial roles as they have been traditionally defined and the various forms of management scanning conducted by school managers. Chapter 3 discusses the process of self-review and provides a variety of methods using the ESDMRI. The next chapter provides a guide to the instrument, along with references to related materials for each item of the ESDMRI. The final chapter details the continuous process of management scanning, review, and change, and its importance to effective school district management. A copy of the ESDMRI appears in the appendix.

        "description":"This template is part of a series that recommends best practices and highlights problems that arise when policy deviates from these best practices. The booklet defines and outlines the critical components of a successful academic standards system using examples of good and bad standards to illustrate key points. The template addresses such questions as: What are the ingredients for rigorous academic standards? How do we measure compliance with standards? and How do performance standards differ from academic content standards? It offers analyses, discussion, and recommendations in four areas: tests aligned to the standards; categorization of student achievement through performance standards; implementation and accountability systems to guarantee that the standards become a reality  in the classroom; and communications strategies to disseminate information about the standards to parents, teachers, and local school officials. The template is divided into four sections: (1) academic content standards; (2) the assessment system; (3) performance standards; and (4) implementation/accountability strategies. The object of the template is to offer policymakers practical advice and recommendations for constructing and implementing the best standards possible. It outlines the components of good academic content standards, such as rigor, intelligibility, and balance, and it reminds policymakers to consider such issues as depth versus breadth, time and cost of scoring, and standardization.

An analysis by the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC) notes the effectiveness of the Act, failure of the federal government to meet promised levels of federal fiscal support, and CEC's recommendation that the training, research, and development functions of Part D programs be funded at six percent of the overall annual appropriation for IDEA. Introductory tables and graphs summarize data on FY (fiscal year) appropriations for federal programs for the education of exceptional children and the number of children served under IDEA by disability during 1997-1998.  Twenty-three brief vignettes illustrate the success of these programs in the lives of parents, teachers, and others. The major portion of the report analyzes individual IDEA programs with information on appropriations, authorizing provision, purpose, who receives funding, kinds of activities supported, recent funding history, funding considerations, and CEC recommendations. Programs covered include State and Local Grant Program, Preschool Grants, Early Intervention Program, and Support Programs (State Program Improvement Grants, administrative provisions, research and innovation, personnel preparation, studies and evaluations, technical assistance and information dissemination, technology development and media).

Chapter 2 reviews several program models that implement psychoeducational theory, including developmental therapy teaching programs, the positive education program, life space crisis intervention, strength-based reclaiming strategies, and the clear thinking curriculum. The final chapter looks ahead to psychoeducation in the next  century and urges the following fundamental standards for a new psychoeducation, including: expanded scope, unified theory, established missions, identified assets, audits of past experience, enhanced interventions, skilled adults, and examined outcomes.

        "description":"In this paper, an overview of children's psychological processes is presented within the context of adoption, foster care, or other type of placement which requires the child to develop the coping skills necessary to continue toward optimal growth psychologically, cognitively, and socially. Findings from a research review indicate that children raised in loving, caring, secure, consistent, and stable environments have a greater probability of developing socially, psychologically, physically, emotionally, and morally. Further, when alternative placements are necessary, if the child is placed in an appropriate setting the probability of the child achieving optimal growth through the developmental stages is greatly increased, provided that there is a sense of permanency. The  probability of optimal growth is contingent on the willingness of the new primary caregivers to provide a safe and loving environment. Children faced with an uncertainty in their placements, whether long-term foster care or questionable placement with a biological parent that is subject to change, were found to have an increased probability of social maladjustment over their adopted counterparts. Regardless of the placement decision, the report finds that the earlier a permanent placement is determined, the better the chances for the child's adjustment. (Contains 33 references.) (CR)",

        "description":"The number of languages spoken throughout the world is estimated to be 6,000. Although a small number of languages serve as important link languages or languages of wider communication around the world, these are very often spoken as second, third, fourth, or later-acquired languages. Fewer than 25% of the world's approximately 200 countries recognize two or more official languages, with a mere handful recognizing more than two. Despite these conservative government policies, available data indicate that there are many more bilingual or multilingual individuals in the world than there are monolingual. In addition, there are many more children throughout the world who have been and continue to be educated through a second or a later-acquired language, at least for some portion of  their formal education, than there are children educated exclusively via the first language. In many parts of the world, bilingualism or multilingualism and innovative approaches to education that involve the use of two or more languages constitute the normal everyday experience. Results from published, longitudinal, and critical research undertaken in varied settings throughout the world indicate that the development of multiple language proficiency is possible and is viewed as desirable by educators, policymakers, and parents in many countries. This digest discusses the use of multiple languages in education, research on the use of first and second languages in education, common threads of successful programs, cross-cutting themes, key issues warranting further attention, and questions  to ask regarding multilingual education in one's community.

        "description":"A study investigated the involvement strategies present in the textual conversations of four graduate students enrolled in a fully online graduate course in language education. The students interacted through an asynchronous interactive computer conferencing system that allowed communication from two continents. Two 2-week ongoing discussions were analyzed, including one on historical and theoretical perspectives on language for specific purposes and on technology in the language classroom. The three interpersonal involvement strategies examined in the computer-meditated communications were imagery, repetition, and dialogue. Each incidence in a category was analyzed by function, and its structural and interactive characteristics were measured against one theory. Distribution in  the conversations by participant and over time was noted as well. Results indicate that, from the beginning of their online textual interactions, the students used personal involvement strategies develop a social context of rapport and intimacy that facilitated their ability to convey to academic meanings. This suggests that they worked cooperatively to create a learning, supportive community and to facilitate the joint negotiation of academic meaning. (Contains 22 references.) (MSE)",

Subjects were 59 high school Honors Spanish 4 students with varying levels of academic ability, motivation, and proficiency, and included both non-native and English-dominant Spanish speakers. The foreign language program dropout rate reflected the low priority given to foreign language study. Analysis of probable causes and solutions suggested that treatment involving positive attitudes, cooperative learning, and use of multiple intelligence pedagogy would improve performance. Real-life application and self-evaluation helped to improve individual student's motivation. Results tended to support current research. Most of the  subjects demonstrated significant growth in both oral and written proficiency in the target language. Their organizational skills and acceptance of personal responsibility improved. However, students with excessive absences from school did not benefit from the intervention. Posttest and attitudinal surveys revealed greater confidence and interest in developing foreign language proficiency. The instructional rubrics used were useful, but it was found that their design needed to be refined. The only aspect negative was that students tended to depend on class time to finish projects.

        "description":"A study demonstrated that court interpreter failure to preserve pragmatic features in the interpreted version of courtroom testimony can potentially distort both the lawyer's question and the witness' response. Pragmatic features are defined as those aspects of an utterance that signal how the speaker intends the message to be taken. While some of the alterations made in translation are relatively trivial, others are serious and may critically influence the jury's assessment of whether the defendant is guilty or innocent. Data were drawn from court colloquies involving English-speaking attorneys and Spanish-speaking witnesses, using audio and videotapes from four trials. Focus of the analysis is on alterations to pragmatic markers, words or phrases that modify the basic message  or signal a separate one. Results indicate that addition of pragmatic markers and features to witness answers can make the witness appear less confident of the testimony. When the witness is the defendant, the situation is potentially more critical. In contrast, deleting these same features from a witness response removes disfluencies, making the witness or defendant appear more confident, and he/she may be potentially perceived more favorably by the jury.

The students' exposure to real-world English listening situations had been limited, and the majority were focusing more on grammar in their preparation for university entrance examinations. Initially, instruction took a bottom-up approach, beginning with phoneme-level pronunciation practice without analysis of the communicative value of intonation choices. Later in the course, pronunciation instruction was top-down, focusing on production in minimal contexts, questions, and syllables. A decision was made to concentrate on yes-no and wh- questions in listening  instruction, teaching students how to diacritically mark intonation in these contexts. Over a period of several weeks, it was found that the students had significant difficulty in distinguishing between grammatical and discourse considerations in their listening. It is suggested that the theoretical constructs of key and termination be used as starting points for moving beyond grammatical boundaries in classroom listening instruction.

The instructor is a native Russian speaker, and the class consisted of nine undergraduate students. A review of literature on teasing reveals its dual nature for conveying both a literal message of insult and a &quot;metamessage&quot; of playfulness. It was found that in this classroom context, teasing was used as a strategy for error correction, but only for pragmatic errors, not grammar or pronunciation. Six segments in which the teacher teases one or more students in order to make a pragmatic point are examined, and a structure is identified in the sequences: a problem (an utterance whose pragmatic form or message content is problematic);  corrective teacher feedback; the target response to the feedback; audience response; and follow-up. It is concluded that, as playful enactments of serious activities, the teasing sequences described here offer an ideal space for language socialization. Through participation in them, students are engaged in naturalistic interactions in the target language that require them to attend not only to grammatical form, but also to the social and affective dimensions of language.

Results reveal a gap in attitudes between the two subject groups, consistent with historical research into the role of testing in Japanese education and non-Japanese educators' perceptions of that role. It is argued that this gap can be bridged partially through an intercultural approach that seeks first to identify and then respond to socio-historical facets of students' approaches to the mastery of language learning. Using this approach, the teacher can create pedagogical  strategies that draw on the intrinsic strengths of students' learning attitudes, styles, and approaches. The questionnaires are appended.

        "description":"Critics of bilingual education have cited the high Hispanic dropout rate as evidence against bilingual education. Since most bilingual education programs are Spanish-English, it is concluded that bilingual education must be responsible. Research shows some factors predicting dropout rates, including low English language ability, poverty, length of residence in the United States, the print environment, and family factors. The important finding from the research is that when these factors are controlled statistically, the dropout rate among Hispanics is similar to that of other groups. There is no evidence that bilingual education results in higher dropout rates. Because bilingual education programs produce better academic English, bilingual education is a positive influence. Good  programs have this effect because they supply subject matter knowledge in the students' primary language, which makes the English the students hear and read more comprehensible. They also provide a rapid route to literacy. Another part of the solution is simple and inexpensive: an improved print environment in school, both in the primary language and in English, through better school and classroom libraries and encouragement of free reading through readalouds, sustained silent reading, and quality literature programs.

        "description":"A theory is advanced for constructing an English dictionary for learners of English as a second or foreign language primarily for business purposes. The approach attempts to incorporate as much of the natural context of this language use as possible. While the general cognitive frame for the dictionary would be business, it would represent various sub-fields by using examples from them. Concordances that associated terms with experiential contexts would be used. Selection of headwords is to be based on word frequency, collocation, and co-text and to include multi-word units as entries. Inclusion of contextual information in the entry is considered crucial. Emphasis would be on the grammar of phrases rather than sentence-level grammar, and phonetic information is not to be  included because it is so variable in world Englishes. Details of corpora, collocation (downward and upward), use of concordance, and use of the dictionary are discussed, with examples offered. Additional collocation data are appended.

        "description":"Programs designed to improve the language proficiency of limited-English-proficient (LEP) students have had mixed results. Much confusion has arisen from variable approaches to what can be expected of the programs. Recently, \"expected gain\" has become an important concept in documenting the educational development of LEP students, requiring analysis of the relationship between quality of instruction and measurable student outcomes. Key factors in this concept include: assessment outcomes; the setting of reasonable individual expectations and sensitivity to growth; and the effectiveness of instructional practices and programs. Psychological and pedagogical implications follow from each of these factors. A discussion of \"expected gain\" looks at research on the relationship between  LEP student gains in language proficiency and probability of academic success in mainstream programs, the importance of how and when the student enters the program, and the role of appropriate measurement in assessing both expected and actual gain. Additional considerations include quality of instruction, differences inherent in elementary and secondary school levels, and variations in student population. Contains 18 references. (MSE)",

Although the responsibility for improved schooling must be shared among administrators, teachers, parents, and students, school reform efforts place a tremendous weight on teachers, especially those who have received no preparation for teaching English language learners. Clearly, professional development plays a role in equipping schools to meet the challenges facing these teachers. This digest focuses on professional development for teachers in culturally diverse schools. It summarizes what is known about effective professional development and the conditions that allow it to  succeed. It provides three examples of professional development that are grounded in the academic achievement of English language learners as a fundamental ingredient to overall school success.

The approach was intended to promote student reflection, help make explicit the class' content, and provide feedback to the teacher on the effectiveness of the instruction. In contrast to journal writing, the logs were limited one inch of space on a calendar-maker computer program. A large majority of students responded favorably to the task, although some were reluctant or confused. The researcher-teacher discusses the technique: (1) by comparing it with the use of portfolios; (2) exploring its use as a form of collaborative assessment with the teacher; (3) as a form of risk-taking in the classroom; and  (4) to modify daily lessons as needed.

The approach is intended to reduce the teacher-controlled nature of interactions and promote active language use. Two verbal-interactive academic activities found to be especially effective in developing an environment for collaborative talk are described. The first is the use of classroom interaction methods involving ELL students in interaction not just as respondents but as active participants in the negotiation of meaning. Several ways of organizing verbal interaction are discussed and compared. The second  method is the use of storytelling activities in which ELLs can take advantage of their own experiences and cultural traditions to develop \"oracy\" and literacy concepts and skills across the curriculum. Techniques the teacher can use to support ELLs' oral language development and link storytelling with other skill areas are offered.

The decision to increase Cantonese use is controversial. Four studies of this situation are reported. The first, a study of 56 secondary schools, found Chinese-medium classes less passive. The second, a survey of 189 Chinese-medium schools, found most principals and slightly fewer teachers believed native-language teaching facilitated higher-level learning. The third study, of grade 7 students in 12 secondary schools found the Chinese-medium students felt their English had improved more than did the English-medium students. The fourth  study, consisting of in-depth interviews with students, found Chinese-medium students to be more comfortable in class. Further examination of the studies, not yet available in full, and further research on native language-medium instruction in this and other contexts are recommended. Contains 11 references. (MSE)",

Subjects were 233 grade 10 students. The 15 categories were presented to the students in four tasks: one eliciting metalinguistic knowledge; one eliciting descriptive metalinguistic knowledge; and two demanding formal and communicative use, respectively. The responses were sorted according to whether the first or second task was accomplished better, and analyzed for patterns in the third and fourth tasks. Results indicate  a considerable awareness of both exemplary and descriptive metalinguistic knowledge, with somewhat more exemplary knowledge. The &quot;exemplary knowledge&quot; group was significantly more successful at using the categories both formally and situationally than the descriptive group. However, both were more successful at formal than communicative use of the categories. It is suggested that metalinguistic knowledge enhances language learning.

A subset of 33 programs was selected for in-depth analysis of features other than demographics. The 97 proposals, distributed among 21 states, served 53,535 students, 36,283 of whom were limited-English-proficient, from 78 language groups and at all grade levels. California received over half the funded projects. School districts were the main beneficiaries of funding, with a few in consortia with  universities and community organizations. However, the majority planned to provide non-instructional services to students through collaborations with local businesses, community-based organizations, and higher education institutions. Evaluation designs proposed evaluating various program aspects and using instruments for formative and summative evaluation. Alternative assessment methods were often proposed to assess students' needs and progress. Proposal limitations were in varying definitions of terms. Recommendations for improving proposal policy and practice are offered. (MSE)",

        "description":"This digest describes a research and development program being carried out in transitional bilingual education programs at five elementary schools in the Los Angeles area. Researchers have been collaborating with teachers and project advisors to develop, implement, and describe instructional strategies that improve the chances of students in these programs making a successful transition to mainstream English instruction. As part of the transition program, 12 specific language arts components that fall under three categories--literature studies, skill building, and other supporting components--have been identified for instruction. Across all phases of the program, in both Spanish and English language arts, students study literature. Discussions, writing projects, social studies  content, and supplementary readings are all based on the literary selection being studied. The experience-text-relationship approach was adapted as the framework for the literature units. In this approach, the teacher helps students study the story in relation to their own experiences and to a central theme by means of ongoing discussions (instructional conversations), writing activities (literature logs and culminating writing projects), and reading. A study was conducted to establish the independent and combined effects of the use of literature logs and instructional conversations on transition and non-transition students' story comprehension and theme understanding. Results suggest that for English language learners, teachers should use both instructional conversations and literature  logs, because the combined effect is stronger than the effect of using either component individually. For fluent English proficient students, both are not needed. Teachers could use one or the other, although instructional conversation would be the more efficient choice. (Contains 4 references.)

        "description":"Second language (L2) computer-adaptive testing (CAT) is a technologically advanced method of assessment in which the computer selects and presents test items to examinees according to the estimated level of the examinee's language ability. The basic notion of an adaptive test is to mimic automatically what a wise examiner would normally do. Specifically, if an examiner asked a question that turned out to be too difficult for the examinee, the next question asked would be considerably easier. This approach stems from the realization that little is learned about an individual's ability if the questions posed are far too difficult or far too easy for that person. This digest discusses the following issues related to computer adaptive testing: (1) advantages of using  computer-adaptive testing in second language assessment; (2) roots and challenges of computer-adaptive testing; (3) issues involving the basic principles of assessment in computer-adaptive testing; (4) CAT and the basic principles of test reliability; (5) CAT and the basic principles of test validity; and (6) CAT item pools for measuring the identified ability of the examinee population.

        "description":"Listening and speaking, the most used language skills in the classroom, are critical for functioning in an English language context, and are logical starting points for language instruction for low-literacy learners. Speaking is an interactive process of constructing meaning that involves producing, receiving, and processing information. A speaker's skills and habits affect the success of any exchange. Speakers must be able to anticipate and produce expected patterns of specific discourse situations, manage discrete elements such as turn-taking and providing feedback, choose correct vocabulary, use appropriate facial expressions and body language, produce the phonological patterns of the language, use grammar accurately, assess the audience, apply strategies to enhance  comprehensibility, and attend to the success of the interaction and adjust components as needed. Speech lessons can follow the usual pattern of preparation, presentation, practice, evaluation, and extension. A sample lesson on choosing topics for small talk illustrates this sequence. In-class speaking tasks fall into six categories: imitative; intensive; responsive; transactional; interpersonal; and extensive. Speaking assessment may take varied forms. They should reflect instruction and be incorporated from the beginning of instruction. Criteria should be clearly defined and understandable. Contains 10 references.

Some are able to focus on their new life; others experience significant psychological, emotional, and physical adjustment problems. English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) teachers can develop helpful and supportive relationships with refugees struggling to cope with daily life, but can also be ready targets for displaced anger, disappointment, and frustration. ESL teachers may be called on to referee conflicts. ESL teachers may also feel ineffectual in the face of students' lack of progress or seeming disinterest, and feel powerless to effect change. Teachers may be able to refer students having more  difficulties than expected to resettlement mental health services. If the community has not addressed the concerns of refugee mental health, it may be time to initiate the discussion. Working with refugee groups can be both highly rewarding and highly stressful. It is important to monitor ESL teachers' stress levels and emotional responses, be familiar with the ways they cope. Teachers should take the time to do a personal inventory and care for themselves, which is also good role modeling for students. (Adjunct ERIC Clearinghouse on Literacy Education) (MSE)",

Autobiographical narratives were coded for time period (e.g., middle school), theme (e.g., achievement), context (e.g., academics, sports), and the presence of goal-directed content (e.g., presence of need, assistance and hindrance, emotions, goals). Current student motivation and engagement in learning were assessed using a generalized version of the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire. Among the general trends reported by the study were the following: (1) students recalled more affiliative/noncurricular than academic/achievement episodes; (2) the least positive (most negative) content emerged when students  described affiliative/noncurricular memories; (3) there were less than half as many middle school than either elementary or high school memories; and (4) students who were more anxious, less confident, and who used lower-level rehearsal strategies in college tended to recall more noncurricular and nonachieving episodes. Discussion focused on reasons for the low recall of episodes during middle school and the possible moderating effect of memories on current motivational tendencies and student engagement in learning.

The report focuses on changes in the policy or compensation levels from 1997-98 to 1998-99 and addresses each of the institutions separately. For community colleges the report shows trend and range data for chancellors of multicollege districts, college presidents in multicollege districts, and superintendents/presidents in single college districts. It notes increasing disparities among community colleges because each of the 71 community colleges is responsible for setting the compensation of its own executives. For the California State  University the report also provides trend data and comparisons with similar institutions nationally. It notes progress towards implementing a coherent executive compensation policy and a continuing lag in salaries at the presidential level when compared to similar institutions nationwide. For the University of California the report notes the policy of setting the average compensation at the mean of national comparators, while being flexible in the actual levels paid to each chancellor. The report notes continuing progress in simplifying executive compensation policies and in offering equity in benefits. (DB)",

The second section identifies organizational strategies for developing academic support programs; for effectively serving the students in the program; for involving the community; and for sustaining the partnerships. The third section offers recommendations for policymakers based on the principles and practices presented. An appendix describes 16 of the partnerships developed under the program. (DB)",

        "description":"This study examines the relationship between distance education and institutional reward structures. The study sought to develop a scale to assess beliefs of college faculty about rewards and incentives in distance education, based on the hypothesis that faculty perceptions cluster around three factors: locus of motivation, institutional values and commitment, and return on investment. The measure, which was pilot tested with 33 faculty members, consists of 38 items and uses Likert response ranking. Results corroborate previous findings that faculty are highly motivated to participate in distance education by intrinsic rewards, although respondents also felt that faculty participated in distance education to earn more money. Results suggest that the department chairperson plays a  pivotal role in faculty rewards for distance education, but that distance education provides a questionable return on investment, especially with respect to tenure and promotion. Seven data tables summarize results of the scale items. (Contains 14 references.) (DB)",

        "description":"This paper examines the issue of collaborative authorship in academia by specifically addressing fairness and equity in name ordering and by reexamining the present conventions used to designate credit. It offers scholars a framework for thinking about collaboration, negotiating the authorship terms of the working relationship, and assigning appropriate credit for work accomplished. After a discussion of the benefits and problems of collaboration, the paper suggests seven parameters for any collaboration. It then goes on to reject two common strategies currently used to denote joint authorship, alternate naming and alphabetical order, proposing three alternatives: displaying the names in a linear graphic form; displaying names in a circle, with both names beginning on the left at  the equator, then one circling to the right along the top of the circle and the other circling along the bottom; and using an equal sign between names. This last suggestion is seen to be technically simple enough to be implemented both in publications and citations. (Contains 23 references). (DB)",

Text, graphs, and figures focus on: (1) the impact of criminal justice policies on the University of the District of Columbia (UDC)--the only publicly funded institute of higher education in the District of Columbia; (2) the consequences of the District's criminal justice policies, noting that there are more District residents in prison than there are in publicly funded college classrooms; (3) the negative effects of the District's imprisonment policies on African American communities; (4) the tremendous increase in corrections funding (312 percent) compared to funding for UDC (82 percent) over the last two decades;  (5) the long-term consequences of choosing prisons over education; and (6) the need to change priorities. Among six recommendations are the following: abandon the federal sentencing guidelines and leave the &quot;mixed&quot; sentencing system in place; adopt a moratorium on new prison construction and cut the nonviolent prisoner population in half over the next five years; initiate community corrections initiatives; and invest in the future of children, families, and communities.

        "description":"This study compares the changes in funding of universities and prisons in Maryland during the 1990s. Data from the Department of Public Safety, Division of Corrections, and the Maryland Higher Education Commission were analyzed for trends in correctional and college populations. The study notes that funding for Maryland's prisons increased by 50 percent while funding for the state's universities declined by 5 percent during the same period; this trend was not dictated by demand: 52 percent of the increase in the inmate population was accounted for by nonviolent offenders, and the state crime rate dropped 6.8 percent between 1993 and 1996. Policy decisions have also resulted in a disparate racial impact, with more African Americans added to the state's prisons than to public  colleges; tuition and fees have risen over 100 percent over this period. The report urges the state to enact a Community Corrections Act to counter the present bloated state prison system and the lack of local treatment and punishment options. It suggests that many current inmates can be paroled or put into alternative programs, with the saved money used to fully fund the Educational Excellence Award program, the state's scholarship program for low and moderate income students.

A five-stage grassroots action plan is proposed, which includes: (1) community role and coalition building--the need for nursing schools to join in a broad coalition of groups with shared objectives; (2)  introduction/re-introduction--the importance of meeting personally with representatives and/or senators; (3) developing a relationship with elected officials, with an emphasis on framing nursing issues in terms of the member's key concerns; (4) maintaining the relationship through frequent substantive contacts; and (5) mutuality--the importance of providing public support for a supportive legislator. Also included are guidelines for lobbying and political action committees. Contact information for Congressional members and an after-action report form are appended. (DB)",

A survey was developed based on themes identified during structured focus groups with undergraduate psychology seniors and interviews with departmental professors. Surveys were completed by 153 alumni, 87 undergraduates, and 8 full-time professors within the department. Analysis indicated a strong consensus among alumni and current undergraduates that the quality of teaching was very strong in this department. Respondents perceived faculty as enthusiastic about psychology, talented in presenting information, current in the topics they taught, and appropriately challenging to  students. Both alumni and students were less satisfied with the effectiveness of advising about careers and graduate education, opportunities to gain experience in applied settings, and opportunities to engage in research. Further analysis identified a discrepancy between what students expected of faculty and what faculty believed their jobs to be. Faculty saw their advising roles as providing information, whereas students wanted faculty advisors to provide broader support for students' career exploration activities. Specific recommendations regarding departmental communication, faculty involvement, student awareness, and student involvement are provided. Attached tables detail survey responses.

It begins by examining the debate over the type of change needed in higher education from the radical change suggested by some as necessary for survival to concepts of continual improvement urged by others. A definition of transformational change is offered which differentiates it from other types of institutional change. This definition focuses on changes in institutional culture, the deep and pervasive nature of transformational change, its intentional nature, and its development over time. The paper then examines the experiences of 26 colleges and universities in the American Council on Education (ACE) Project on Leadership and Institutional Transformation by speculating on whether transformation is  likely to occur, and by framing relevant questions. It finds that only a few institutions are planning change agendas that exemplify the definition of transformational change, and that, on most campuses, neither leaders nor constituents see a current need for deep or pervasive change. Institutions' change initiatives center on the following ongoing issues: putting learning first, connecting institutions to their communities, and making higher education more cost effective and affordable. A brief description of the ACE project and a list of participating institutions are attached. (Contains 10 references.) (DB)",

Insights were drawn from three sources: biannual campus visits and monthly phone calls with campus leaders; reflections by institutional leaders in a series of reports and at four project meetings; and presentations and publications of institutional leaders. Nine successful intentional strategies for change are identified and paired with examples of missteps. Among these strategies are the following: (1) leaders must make a clear and compelling case to key stakeholders about why things must be done differently; (2)  change leaders must craft an agenda that both makes sense and focuses on improvement without assigning blame; and (3) collaborative leadership identifies and empowers talent across campus and at various levels. The paper also identifies key environmental and contextual factors (and pitfalls), such as the need for a climate of good will, favorable external environments, and leadership persistence. The paper concludes that the actions of successful change leaders are characteristically intentional, reflective, and show an ability to profit from experience.

The paper concludes that the clear trends to strengthen the empowerment of highly qualified  women in the fields of research, training, advocacy, and networking should constitute the foundations of UNESCO's Global Strategy for Women, Higher Education, and Development, with the aim of enhancing the participation of women in the decision-making process.

The study reviewed 108 faculty recruitment advertisements placed by educational administration departments in \"The Chronicle of Higher Education,\" using 22 criteria identified by the literature as effective recruitment advertising for the analytic framework. Results indicate that many departments lack competence in managing the recruitment task. The advertisements are critiqued in terms of advertisement management (46 percent advertised in February or later--after the midpoint in faculty recruitment season); headline content (34 advertisements were line advertisements which lacked a headline); applicant information requested (frequently not  adequate for verifying and evaluating applicant qualifications); and job-related information (many institutions failed to include organizational information).

The study compares the GEI index with time-to-degree, the most widely used related measure, and finds that the latter does not measure student efficiency in degree pursuit regardless of enrolled time, nor does it reflect the current reality that only a minority (25 percent at Washington State University) of students graduate in four years. By contrast, the GEI which uses a formula that accounts for credits earned toward a degree compared to credits required for a particular degree, is a better measure of efficiency because it does not focus on elapsed or enrolled time but on  actual credits earned. Limitations to the GEI are also noted, such as its retrospective character, its inability to consider effectiveness as well as efficiency, its vulnerability to manipulation, and its limitations when applied to transfer students' efficiency. The paper concludes that one cannot measure efficiency with a time-to-degree tool, or measure the value of extra credits earned with an efficiency index, and suggests that institutions use both measures to evaluate the institution's success in graduating students.

The study used an e-mail survey which asked about personal background, entry/structure of degree, university/other support, supervision of program, the process, and overall effects. Individual chapters of the report discuss the overall design of the investigation, the participants and their backgrounds, entering a doctoral program, completing the doctorate, formal and informal aspects of the process, overall effects of the doctoral experience, and learning from and improving the doctoral experience. Factors identified as hindering doctorate completion included financial difficulties, family lifestyle  problems, cultural difficulties and isolation, and problems dealing with university administration. Suggestions for improving doctoral programs and the doctoral experience address the importance of a pro-active, sympathetic approach to student recruitment; induction into the academic community and the relevant discipline; meeting the needs of a diverse student population; better linking of students and faculty members; preparation and support for supervisors; clarification of roles and expectations; power relationships and politics; flexible pathways; feedback and validation; and maintaining relationships beyond completion.

It is intended to provide higher education administrators with a detailed statistical profile of the facilities on their own campuses and to allow for comparative assessment and facilities planning. The study includes data for 112 institutions, including all 16 public senior institutions which comprise the University of North Carolina, 38 private nonprofit colleges and universities, and the 58 public two-year community colleges, but does not include proprietary institutions. The report is divided into four sections. Section 1, on the utilization of instructional space, provides ratios, percentages, and indices which relate the amount of  instructional activity at an institution to various categories of campus space. Section 2, on interior space characteristics, statistically describes campus space by its uses and the programs to which it is assigned, such as the sizes and capacities of classrooms and class laboratories. Section 3 is on building characteristics and focuses on such data elements as building age, condition, and replacement cost. The final section describes the amount and type of campus space which is accessible to persons who are confined to wheelchairs. (DB)",

Part 1 of this report presents the results of surveys of 15 New York law schools, 158 law firms, 28 public sector organizations, and 13 providers of continuing legal education. For law schools, the report reviews instruction in lawyering skills and professional values, and offers examples of approaches presently in use at each of the State's law schools. For law firms, the report covers skills that first-year associates bring with them, the existence of formal training programs at the law firms, training after the first year, and whether the firm  has a professional development coordinator. Part 2 evaluates the state's current continuum of legal education. Findings are reported concerning the need for expansion of skills and values instruction, constraints on skills and values instruction, under-utilized resources, procedures for admission to the Bar, and training and professional development after admission to the Bar. Finally, Part 3 presents recommendations for further action concerning each of the above areas. (Contains 27 references.) (DB)",

By applying the concept of due process within the context of higher education, they can meet legal challenges of contract and constitutional law and the pedagogical demand for justice. To guide their efforts, decision makers can consult a body of case law that has evolved over half a century. The Constitution requires that federal and state governments provide citizens with substantive fairness and certain procedures or &quot;process&quot; before depriving them of life, liberty, or property interests. Courts have intentionally retained flexibility in interpreting these requirements in higher education, and no exact formula exists. The courts have granted tremendous  deference to the decisions of administrators and professors. Both public and private schools are legally obligated to fairly and reasonably carry out the requirements of their written and implied contracts with students and faculty, which may parallel the requirements of constitutional due process. A university should promote system-wide respect for these principles by ensuring all official inquiries are predictable and dignified, all stakeholders have proper notice and meaningful opportunity to respond and present evidence, and decisions are made by unbiased officials.

Three new realities provide a powerful rationale for major new investment in agriculture: dramatic changes in health care incentives; agriculture in an increasingly interconnected world economy; and the environmental benefits of agriculture. New initiatives are needed to secure the funding necessary to capture attention and build the necessary support base for public policy to invest in strong, scientific research and its vital partners in agricultural research: cooperative extension and education. These concepts must then be shared  with stakeholders and others so that their responses and ideas can be incorporated where possible. Reactions should be sought from national science leaders and multiple agencies. Identification of specific goals, research and education programs, collaborators, timelines, and outcomes constitutes the next step. A coordinating entity based in Washington, DC, must promote the initiative daily. NASULGC, its president, and the board on agriculture are recommended to head this effort.

The liberal arts program emphasizes theory, application, and service. Schools offering the program are part of an international organization that aims to meet the educational needs of geographically mobile students. Over 800 schools in 100 countries are authorized to offer the program; about 37 percent are in the United States. Since 1997 California has had a 17 percent  increase in schools offering the program. Students must be highly motivated and have strong academic skills to participate. The curriculum is divided into higher-level and standard-level courses in six core academic areas: the student's primary language and literature; a foreign language; individuals and societies; experimental sciences; mathematics; and arts and electives. Standardized exams are criterion-referenced. Participating schools face significant costs and require commitments of time and resources from families.

Because full-time college faculty avoid teaching developmental English courses, less-qualified part-time faculty are often hired to teach such courses, where both DS and ESL students are grouped as \"remedial\" students in the same section. Despite the fact that there are some similarities between the two student groups, they are not the same: ESL students are in the early stages of English language acquisition and may be considered beginners at English writing. This is not the case with DS students.  Thus, there are inherent biases when the groups are homogenized groups in the classroom, and inherent challenges for writing teachers. (MSE)",

The report begins with background information on education in South Africa, focusing on these topics: the effects of separate school systems and Bantu education; the need for academic literacy; the relationship between education, economics, and morale in education; and tertiary academic institutions. Academic literacy and instructional development are then defined, and South African approaches to them, including current research, are examined. Examples of six types of  initiatives at a number of South African institutions are then described. Five approaches to academic literacy at the University of Saskatchewan and one Australian example are offered for comparison. Conclusions are drawn about the South African experience, and suggestions for improving academic literacy programs and administration are made. (Contains 41 references.) (MSE)",

The resulting plan provides for rational workforce planning based on a differentiated set of nursing personnel and differentiated practice expectations for a changing health care environment. A number of conclusions and recommendations are reported, including: development of five to ten models of differentiated education/practice demonstration projects across the country; development of a core of leaders for differentiated  education/practice projects; continued development of value-neutral language to describe differentiated nursing practice and education; and a plan for disseminating information about the initiative.

The two elements are presented here. Introductory sections discuss the societal role of master's education and the diversity and range of master's education in nursing. Subsequent sections offer a basic curriculum model for master's nursing education and outline graduate core curriculum content and an advanced-practice nursing core curriculum.  The role of clinical experiences in these models is addressed in a separate section.

Using 125 &quot;lessons&quot; based on support service theories, philosophies, and practices at George Mason University (Virginia), which collectively are termed &quot;blended management,&quot; the book attempts to demystify outsourcing, help institutions cultivate a &quot;culture of change,&quot; and show how George Mason staff and its outsourcing partners have improved services at the university. In Part 1, three chapters cover such topics as embracing change, how to develop requests for performance, assessing the proposals received, and signing the contract. Part 2 offers a five-step approach to blended management,  including: (1) identifying the potential universe of service; (2) determining the rationale for services; (3) evaluating performance of services; (4) identifying effective leaders and determining best practices; and (5) making the decision to restructure, discontinue services, outsource, or stay with current operations. In Part 3 a final chapter defines the key components of a successful outsourcing partnership, including regular communication, joint responsibility for both the process and the result, and an understanding that the organizational objectives of the partners are not the same.

Comparisons were made between schools which had major problems and those that had minor problems. Three problem-oriented strategies were offered for stronger enforcement of the minimum age drinking law, including: (1) identifying on-campus locations where underage drinking was occurring and taking meaningful  disciplinary action against those serving alcohol to minors; (2) establishing a policy of zero tolerance for the fake IDs students were using to purchase alcohol; and (3) taking firm disciplinary steps, including probation, fines, community service, suspension, and/or expulsion, against students who drive or commit other infractions while under the influence.

Chapter 1 presents the certification requirements that higher education institutions must meet under the regulations and notes the consequences of failure to comply; it also provides information on meeting legal requirements not covered in the Part 86 regulations. Chapter 2 outlines the required content of the written policy (standards of conduct, legal sanctions, health risks, drug and alcohol programs, disciplinary sanctions) and offers several formats that  can be used to present the required information. Chapter 3 suggests low-cost methods for distributing policies to students and employees; and chapter 4 discusses the preparation and content of biennial reviews, providing some recent examples. Seven appendixes provide information on the Center for Alcohol and Other Drug Prevention; a compliance checklist; a table listing federal penalties for illegal trafficking and possession of controlled substances; a table listing health risks associated with use of illicit drugs and alcohol; copies of university policy statements on drugs and alcohol; and a table listing effects of drug dependency.

The paper offers a model of quality education that is based on lasting principles of excellence, dignity, and connectedness, with excellence conceived of as surpassing one's personal best, dignity being achieved by choosing actions and participating in activities that contribute to self-esteem and self-respect, and connectedness meaning drawing people together rather than separating, segregating, or discriminating against them, and including others in decision making.  A quality education requires a supportive environment, which is defined as an organization that reaches toward the future and has leaders who possess the skills for building a community of learners. Such a supportive environment can be conceptualized as having four cornerstones that represent fundamental human needs: to live, to love, to learn, to leave a legacy. Other sections of the paper discuss related literature and research, the fit of the model, and implications for the profession. (Contains 22 references.) (CH)",

        "description":"This paper examines some of the major problems and barriers faced by Hispanic/Latino youth who, despite high college enrollment rates, do not complete the four-year degree. An examination of five entering classes of Illinois college students found that only 30.2 percent of Hispanic students had completed their degrees at the end of four years, 33.8 percent were still enrolled in college, and 36 percent had dropped out. Factors identified as leading to lack of persistence included the overall cost of earning a degree, lack of academic preparation for college in junior and senior high school, poor articulation between community colleges and four-year institutions, limited access to resources, and family pressures. Several strategies are suggested for improving timely degree  completion, including pre-college initiatives such as providing multicultural training for teaching faculty and support staff to dispel stereotypes, introducing concepts of academic achievement and excellence in elementary schools, emphasizing the concept of career opportunities available through post-secondary training, and involving members of the Hispanic community in school parent-teacher organizations. Post-secondary strategies suggested include developing bilingual brochures for high school counselors, parents, and advisors, providing information about fast-track programs, building schedules around student needs, initiating summer scholarship opportunities, and reevaluating general education requirements in colleges.

        "description":"This digest reviews the literature examining ways in which the academic world is shifting toward more entrepreneurial approaches for running an institution and examines some programs that have been developed both at the community college and the senior college level. Reasons cited for the shift toward entrepreneurial ways of operating include cuts in traditional sources of funding, government intervention in higher education, and the escalating costs of teaching and research. Also noted are some of the risks posed for colleges and universities when participating in entrepreneurial activities, including business risk, management risk, and image risks. The paper notes that community colleges, because of their traditional role in job training, have been successful in obtaining money  from both government and industry to prepare workers for jobs. In contrast, universities and four-year colleges have tended to focus on generating revenue through research collaborations with private industry and the government, such as partnerships with licensing and patenting offices, small business development centers, research and technology centers, and business incubators. The paper concludes that entrepreneurial ventures performed in keeping with academic values can be worthwhile for institutions, students, and the public. (Contains 14 references.) (JM)",

        "description":"This digest reviews entrepreneurship activities among university and community college faculty and administrators, citing a number of studies that examine corporate-university linkages. These studies note that some faculty act as consultants to organizations, thus providing an avenue for personal interaction between industry and academe, or engage in research that leads to commercialization of a product, which in turn results in formal research arrangements between the industrial partner and faculty members. Many patents held by business corporations, for example, are the result of work performed in university laboratories. Community colleges also participate in entrepreneurial activities by teaching students who may eventually create their own businesses.  The major difference  between academic researchers and industrial entrepreneurs relates to differences in values. While academic work is done within a relatively narrow disciplinary focus, entrepreneurial activities involve linkages between resources and opportunities and require technical, managerial, and interpersonal competencies. Such value differences keep many faculty from participating in entrepreneurial activities, even though these activities may benefit their institutions and society at large. (Contains 8 references.)

Several examples of technology transfer are cited, including initiatives at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology such as the university's Leaders in Manufacturing program and its Industrial Liaison Program, with a membership that includes more than 300 companies. Another partnership cited involves the Washington University Medical School (Missouri) and the Monsanto Company, which seeks new discoveries relating to the health field. Critics of technology transfer claim that the practice  goes against the four norms characteristic of the practice of science cited by Robert Merton: namely, universalism (shared scientific ideas), communism (collective ownership of knowledge), disinterestedness in personal gain, and organized skepticism (independent validation), and suggests that successful practice of technology transfer must take these values into account, as well as the ethical issues and financial and research gains.

The main reason cited for the involvement of higher education institutions in commercial endeavors is decreasing financing for higher education, but the report notes Derek Bok's caution that efforts to turn university activities into revenue may change the institution's image and force it to sacrifice its most essential academic values. The report notes two studies of Australian universities where the success of the entrepreneurial arrangement led to status bifurcation within academic units. Also noted is a study conducted  of a Canadian project to accelerate college entrepreneurship which resulted in the ideas of competition becoming more firmly embedded in the thinking of Canadian governmental and educational leaders. Other studies note the need for a balance between business demands and academic values and the concern that university-corporate ties may diminish the objectivity of university research. In summarizing a study of European entrepreneurial universities, the report notes that while entrepreneurial activity can increase institutional autonomy, diversify income, and reduce dependence on government, it may also lead to fragmentation of academic goals and institutional purpose.

However, common administrative processes such as planning, morale, and administrative climate are not mentioned. More recent themes include outsourcing, privatization, mergers, reengineering, collaboration, technology, and equity. Only a few applications of management or administrative theories to the administration of higher education institutions were noted in the literature for 1996: these included chaos theory, reengineering, and total quality management (TQM). Restructuring to meet administrative challenges is a major theme  and is often discussed with TQM and reengineering. One way that campuses are restructuring is by privatizing or outsourcing certain functions. Collaborations with industries, alumni, and other institutions are also discussed. A major international concern is the issue of accountability, and higher education institutions worldwide are struggling to redefine how they contribute to national goals. Another major theme in the literature is concern about the growing number of legal mandates for equity. Another issue discussed is the way technology can address administrative problems. Overall much of the literature on college administration tends to be opinion pieces or unscientific case studies. (Contains 36 references.) (JM)",

One reason seems to be the emphasis on instruction; another is that information on curricular movements are often addressed in the literature on instructional change. Trends in 1996 in the literature on curriculum include themes of diversity, democracy or citizenship, environmentalism, and international studies. A major trend in the literature is the addition of interdisciplinary curricula, although it tends to be subsumed under the theme of instructional change. Diversity is described in the literature most often as an issue for practitioners; one of the most comprehensive resources documents the impact of multiculturalism  on higher education during the l980s and 1990s. However, research is needed to document the impact of multicultural curricula on student outcomes. Another important theme added to the literature in 1996 is curricula focused on the development of civic responsibility; and environmental education, which virtually disappeared in the 1980s and early 1990s, is once again in the literature. The number of documents on international education is small if measured by the importance of the issue as manifested by mission statements, presidential speeches, and the press.

The Carnegie Foundation, the American Association for Higher Education, and the Council for the Advancement and Support of Education, have addressed the topic of identifying and rewarding exemplary teaching. Experimental pedagogies are represented in the literature as techniques faculty should use, but empirical research about their benefits is minimal. Other areas reveal an overlap between research and practice; major themes include college faculty workload and productivity; assessment; restructuring and the accompanying reduction of  faculty; tenure; faculty role or identity; and diversity. Key issues in the research are those related to public perception of higher education and the cost of higher education, with issues relating to student outcomes and learning receiving less attention. Assessment is a prevalent issue, although a gap is apparent between administrator and faculty views of and beliefs about assessment. Another gap is found in the literature on restructuring. The literature on tenure remains historical or theoretical, with little empirical research; literature on the changing role of faculty follows the attention given to workload, assessment, restructuring, and tenure. Related to public accountability is research on diversity-related issues. (Contains 27 references.) (JM)",

Six major themes in the literature in l996 include the reduced federal role and increased state role in funding; managing costs, including deferred maintenance and capital spending in times of shrinking resources; concern about rising tuition and its impact on access; concern about changes in funding, e.g. business/private sources and the reduction in state funding and the resulting impact on institutional mission; the management of endowments; and international comparisons of institutions of higher learning. The literature reflects the shift from federal to state responsibility for allocating educational resources, as well as the shift from funding formulas to accountability and productivity. A number of articles  from the public and business sectors call for reducing costs and controlling expenses, but there is virtually no literature from the higher education sector on this issue. A major study on trends in higher education finance presents data from an ongoing study of tuition discounting at 270 independent colleges and universities. Other studies review mission versus sponsor issues, management of endowments, and how higher education is financed internationally. Issues not addressed in the literature include the increasing importance of fund-raising as state funding shrinks; strategic planning in a time of shrinking resources; debt financing; and creative budget strategies.

Additionally the literature on graduate and professional education also focuses on the overproduction of graduates; admissions criteria; experientially based pedagogy; faculty empowerment; equity; attrition and financial aid; and responsiveness to the profession and the public. While much literature is devoted to the growing demand for graduate education, some articles are concerned with overproduction of graduate students.  Also being explored are admission criteria and the changing characteristics of students; problem-based and experiential learning, including literature on teams, cases, and simulations; and faculty empowerment and the importance of mentoring new faculty and finding ways to make adjunct faculty feel included. Equity is a common theme in the literature, with discussions ranging from increasing the number of students in graduate school to increasing funding to support minority students. Also addressed is attrition in graduate and professional schools, especially of underrepresented groups, and the rise of indebtedness among graduate students. (Contains 52 references.) (JM)",

        "description":"Higher education's relationship with and contribution to the public good emerged as a trend in the higher education literature in 1996. Three major themes are represented: the role of higher education, public relations, and collaboration. The literature and research continue to illustrate the valuable role of higher education in the important processes that underlie our culture and society. Most often discussed in the literature is economic development; political and social development have a significantly lesser role. Helpful additions to the literature are contextual studies that examine the impact of higher education on specific communities. A report developed for the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association examines the role of higher education in the development  of the workforce, focusing on such issues as employers', learners', and the public's expectations. Public relations, an increasingly problematic issue, is not well represented in the literature. This area needs more research to understand how public perception affects higher education institutions, what shapes public opinion, and how it can be changed. Collaboration was also a major theme in the literature, with discussions about collaborations with industry, with K-12 educators, and within the institution. (Contains 13 references.) (JM)",

        "description":"The literature on college instruction reached a peak in 1996, one reason being that this topic relates to the larger discussion about the changing role of higher education and to faculty members' changing priorities. Trends identified include the integration of technology into instruction; an emphasis on interdisciplinary teaching and learning; active learning; and the outcomes and \"quality\" of learning. Underlying these themes is an emphasis on learning rather than on teaching. Several studies examine how the use of technology is changing the learning process, the structure of knowledge, and the nature of instruction. A limited number of articles focus on interdisciplinary programs and instruction, with the discussion usually related to technological instruction. However, one  study describes an interdisciplinary program for freshmen that focuses on development of critical thinking, nonverbal communication, writing, and speaking. Many authors describe techniques for engaging students through active learning, but no consensus is seen in the literature on outcomes and quality assessment. Several studies address the issue of balancing research, teaching, and service, and studies on setting standards for exemplary teaching seem to illustrate agreement on the relative merits of good teaching. There is minimal research on how different pedagogical styles can create more inviting learning environments for different racial or gender groups. (Contains 46 references.) (JM)",

Two sources, however, regularly discuss legal issues: the Journal of College and University Law and the Chronicle of Higher Education. Three main themes emerge in the literature on legal issues: (1) rethinking and refining of traditional policies; (2) the rise in campus issues; and (3) technology. The little research in the higher education journals or at conferences that relates to issues of academic freedom, faculty collective bargaining, and tenure tends to define these issues philosophically rather than from a legal perspective. Literature on copyrights, patents, and research involving human subjects is minimal. New literature, mostly opinion pieces, continues to be written  about ambiguous issues that emerge in cases involving affirmative action, sexual harassment, discipline, due process, discrimination, and athletics, but research is needed on the erosion of immunities and tort caps traditionally relied upon by college and university administrators for protection against lawsuits. A new legal issue coming to the fore includes planning for changes in technology and the legal ramifications of computerizing college campuses. Other areas where more analysis and literature are needed include ethics and professional practices. (Contains 7 references.) (JM)",

Themes embedded within these areas include issues of public trust and accountability and accommodation of new environments and new students. An overview by Morsy and Altbach, \"Higher Education in International Perspective: Critical Issues,\" provides insights for those trying to understand current policy issues at the macro level. The  literature on governance, which tends to overlap the literature on policy, contains three common themes: the activism of boards and trustees, restructuring, and participatory governance. Lacking in the literature is research on quality in higher education, diversity as it relates to governance, and the impact of state policy on governance. (Contains 48 references.) (JM)",

Much of the literature on faculty development complements that on changing faculty roles. A growing trend in the literature focuses on the ways in which colleges and universities shape fields of practice. More research is needed, however, on how successful these efforts are in modifying fields of practice and on the most useful strategies. Much of the research on mentoring focuses on initiating mentoring programs for new faculty, although some also  addresses mentoring among administrators. Research continues to show positive relationships between mentoring and professional outcomes, but more research is needed on how mentoring can be used to initiate change. Several professional groups in higher education are currently developing and revising standards related to professional development programs. The College and University Personnel Association (CUPA) Journal continues to be one of the best sources for literature on professional and staff development. (Contains 14 references.) (JM)",

Another frequent issue is the technique of evaluation. Many examples of research on evaluation are from international settings, where accountability and evaluation appear to be integrated into institutional systems. Student learning and satisfaction with services tend to be the focus of evaluation and assessment. An exception to the trend away from systemic evaluation is a paper by Aquirre and Hawkins, \"Why Reinvent the Wheel? Let's Adapt Our Institutional Assessment Model,\" which describes an integrated assessment and strategic planning process designed to comply with accountability requirements at a community  college in New Mexico. Most evaluation studies occur as students leave school or after they have graduated, and it would be helpful to have more evaluations while students were still in school. Some articles suggest ways to improve the process of evaluation. One area where research on evaluation is prevalent is research on new or nontraditional academic experiences, such as first-year seminars or bridge programs, experiential learning, and distance education. Some evaluation focuses specifically on faculty members, exploring the quality of teaching and research. Research on staff members' impact on student learning or experience is minimal.

The second most frequently cited theme is discipline; articles focus on cheating,  alcoholism, abuse in college athletics, and violations of campus code. The prevalence of literature on diversity could reflect student body diversification or a greater acceptance among researchers and practitioners of the importance of diversity; literature in this area abounds with ideas for both practice and research.

The demonstrated ability of paired courses to enhance student retention and performance levels has contributed to their growth on campuses across the country. However the development of paired courses presents instructors with unique obstacles in organization and presentation. This paper examines issues related to a paired course developed in English composition and general sociology grounded in Erving Goffman's frame analytic approach. The courses consisted of three sections of English composition linked to one general sociology course. Eight instructors were involved in developing the paired courses. The mechanism used to implement this approach was a student journal, which  served to establish a mutual focus for students and instructors. The journal format consisted of four entries per week, and students were required to take any concept or idea presented in the sociology course and relate it to an experience outside the classroom. The study found that the journal, used as a framing device, connected aspects of the paired courses into one assignment that was relevant to all participants, and also enhanced student understanding of the material.

For purposes of the study, alcohol use was defined by average number of drinks a week and frequency of binge drinking; social responsibility was defined by employment, marriage, living with children, living with parents, and hours of volunteer service. A total of 2,223 students at a midsize southern commuter university was surveyed over a 3-year period using a benchmark survey instrument developed for college students. After statistically controlling for the influence of age, gender, and ethnicity, more than 10 percent of the variance of both binge drinking and number of drinks per week was explained by the social responsibility construct. Students with high scores  for social responsibility scored low for both binge drinking and number of drinks per week. Interestingly, students living with their parents were found to be more likely to binge drink. Implications of these results are discussed. (JM)",

This study, conducted at Manhattan College (New York), focuses on exploring student perceptions about appropriate drinking behavior. Information was collected from a sample population (n=361) that included freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors. Students completed questionnaires that examined their personal attitudes towards alcohol, as well as their perceptions about campus norms towards alcohol. Freshmen were instructed to answer based on their perceptions of what they expected would happen in college and their actual use in high school. The study confirmed the hypothesis that freshmen's perceptions of their  drinking behavior are strongly related to how much they actually drink; their view of campus norms for alcohol use is moderate and changes over time as they progress through school to senior year. The study also confirmed gender differences in attitudes toward drinking. A stronger indicator of alcohol abuse than the campus norm measure was students' personal attitudes and their perceptions of what their friends do. As a result of this study, Manhattan College has received a grant to influence misperceptions of appropriate drinking behavior among incoming freshmen students. (JM)",

It argues that the discipline-generic model of comprehension supporting content-general reading tests is challenged by conclusions emerging from studies of schema theory, construction-integration theory, domain-knowledge theory, and expert-novice studies. This paper reviews how each orientation questions the efficacy of the discipline-generic model and proposes that content-specific tests, which measure the reader's ability to comprehend text in particular subject areas, rather than content-general reading tests, should be used in developmental placement. It suggests that content-specific reading assessment can focus on comprehension at the broad domain level (such  as literature, science, or social studies), at the narrow domain or discipline level (such as geology or ancient history), or at the topical level (tectonic plates, Punic Wars), and use a wide array of testing options, including fixed-response, constructed-response, or performance items.

In Illinois, as in other states, Hispanic representation in higher education continues to lag, and Latinos are less likely than other minorities to attend or graduate from college. Northeastern Illinois University addressed this issue, as well as its commitment towards community development, by creating a graduate program with the aim of responding to leadership needs and administrative goals of Chicago's Latino teachers. While Latino graduate enrollment has increased slightly, Hispanics are still underrepresented among students who complete education at the graduate level. Subsequently, the university created an outreach program to serve the Latino  community which surrounds the university campus. This program, now the Educational Resource Center, continues to grow and is attracting and recruiting neighborhood youth and non-traditional students for admission to classes at this site. Since academic year 1997-98 the Center has focused on a graduate education program for Latino teachers. (JM)",

        "description":"Formal and informal assessment of interdisciplinary courses in learning communities indicate that communicating across disciplines is a problem that can diminish the effectiveness of these courses. A new discipline called the Science of Creative Intelligence (SCI) has been used for 27 years at Maharishi University of Management (Iowa) to facilitate cross-disciplinary communication. This paper describes two primary components of SCI: a laboratory or experiential approach based on student and faculty practice of the transcendental meditation program; and a theoretical approach in which faculty refer in all courses to a set of universal principles of natural law that can be located in all disciplines. These principles, derived from analyses of experiences during the transcendental  meditation technique, are stated in common language and provide students with a unified and coherent view of the relationship between all disciplines. In addition, the document includes a review of the field theory of consciousness presented in SCI, and offers empirical research documenting the success of its laboratory approach in developing the broader comprehension and wisdom that is a goal of interdisciplinary studies programs.

This paper addresses a competing concept--the need for evaluating the contribution each instructor makes to the maintenance and improvement of all instructional programs in the department--holding that both individual and team contributions need to be considered if campus teaching is to be adequately evaluated. Common problems with campus instruction that call for collective attention of faculty include teachers with poor communication skills; little organized assistance for individuals; weak articulation between adjacent and subsequent courses; and course difficulty set to screen candidates for advanced work rather than to teach each student as  much as possible. A case study illustrates the lack of feedback for instructors about their teaching skills, even when they actively seek it. The paper notes, however, the possible loss of classroom autonomy that is inherent in increasing the ethic of a community of practice that directs more evaluation of campus teaching toward collaborative problem-solving.

Beginning as early as kindergarten and throughout high school, encouraging students to enter college and receive a baccalaureate degree gives high risk students the much needed support and extra attention they need. Many high risk students need this help to attend and graduate from college. Using early intervention strategies eliminates the boundaries between schools and colleges, discourages student dropout, and gives students hope to pursue entrance into college. Active participation by school counselors, teachers, school and college administrators, college student support staff,  and faculty generates involvement between schools and colleges and also eases the transition from one institution to another.

First, a comparison is made of the graduate programs of each institution between the 1990-91 and 1996-97 scholastic years, noting additions and changes in graduate degree offerings. Second, the Association of Library and Information Science Education (ALISE) specialization codes of the faculty for each of the six institutions are recorded. Totals for these codes depict the schools with faculty  strengths in information science and/or technical specialties and compare each institution between 1990-91 and 1996-97. Third, the subject areas of the dissertations of full-time faculty of the six schools are examined. Using Dissertation Abstracts International subject descriptor codes and sorting by primary subject fields and subsequently by year, a comparison depicts the number of library science degrees, information science degrees, and other subject areas, and when each was obtained. A breakdown illustrates the time frame of the major subjects areas represented. Information science and/or more technically-oriented subject areas are shown to be on the increase. (MES)",

Terms in each title are tested with term(s) in the first element of every Library of Congress subject heading. Three hypotheses are tested: (1) sciences and technology subject areas have the highest match rate; (2) match rate in the social sciences is much lower than that of sciences and technology subject areas; and (3) title keyword is an effective alternative to subject headings in sciences and technology subject areas. Among the 10 Dewey divisions, the  500 division, natural sciences and mathematics, has the highest subject heading exact match, a rate of 56.2% in this study. The 800 division, disciplines in literature and rhetoric, accounts for the lowest percentage of subject exact match, 19.04%. (Author/MES)",

Worthington Public Library (Ohio) has a well-established collection of collective biographies ranging in years from 1958-98. As this library is a well-funded, medium-sized library, it is an excellent microcosm for study. A database of the juvenile collective biographies has been completed. In this database, 130 sources published from 1977-97 were recorded and subjects listed. A total of 3,048 subject entries were entered concerning the 130 sources. A subject entry may be an individual or a subject area connected with an individual. Eighty of the sources  fall into the time frame of this study; fourteen of these were published from 1977-87, and sixty-six were published from 1988-97. Charts have been created presenting information for both decades represented. The charts reveal information about the sources with regard to occupation, race, nationality, and the sex of individuals portrayed in the biographical sources. This study reveals the similarities and differences between the two decades with regard to these demographic classifications. A list of the collective biographies used for the study is appended.

The results of the study concluded that, although the BBYA list showed diversity from different points of view, it did have some shortcomings. The works of minority authors, although represented on the list, appeared in numbers less than one would expect based upon their presence in the U.S. population overall. The same held true for the numbers of minority protagonists appearing in fictional works. Diversity in terms of content was also lacking to some extent. For  both nonfiction and fiction books, the BBYA list contained a large number of certain types of genres and subject matter, while other kinds of form and content were few in number. Despite its shortcomings, YALSA's BBYA list does provide an exceptional source that librarians and teachers can use to select and recommend appropriate materials for their young adult patrons and students. Appendices include the YALSA BBYA policies and procedures, coding sheets used in this research, and data analysis tables. Contains 21 references. (Author/MES)",

Data obtained from nine respondents, representing 36% of those surveyed, provided information regarding improvements or implementations made in the time since the report was delivered.

Results were mixed,  with a few areas showing distinct improvement, such as collection quality and quantity, measures being developed to assure availability and access to materials, relationships with state library administrative agencies, and recruitment of Native Americans for employment. An area showing overwhelming lack of response for improvement or implementation was in participation in a federal government study of Native American libraries to identify model programs. Further research, in the form of more detailed interviews or focus groups, is required to fully measure the impact of the &quot;Pathways to Excellence&quot; report on the tribal community college libraries.

        "description":"Professional fundraising has given rise to a new information specialist profession. This career path, which has been known as prospect research or advancement research, should be more accurately characterized as information resources management for advancement. With primary emphasis on value-added information processes that involve analysis and synthesis of a wide variety of data, advancement researchers must function as information resources managers for the fundraising and advancement efforts of nonprofit institutions. This paper describes the current status of the profession through a review of its professional literature and an analysis of the results of a number of membership surveys conducted between 1988 and 1998 by the Association of Professional Researchers for  Advancement (APRA). This analysis seeks to provide the profession with a knowledge base upon which to chart its future. Individuals with graduate degrees in library and information science represent a relatively small minority of the membership. They need to assume a leadership role within the organization and to draw on the literature and professional status of the special library and information science fields to assist the membership of the APRA in gaining professional recognition and parity within the several fund raising careers. Copies of some of the APRA surveys are appended. Bibliographies of related journal articles and Internet sites are included. (Contains 96 references.) (Author/MES)",

        "description":"For many years, librarians have been bothered by negative portrayals of librarians in the media. Unattractive, non-professional old maids have been the dominant images of librarians in the movies. In 1989, the American Library Association issued a campaign designed to promote a more accurate, positive image of the librarian in an attempt to change the existing negative stereotype. This study sought to determine whether librarians in the movies are now positive images. Thirty examples of library images in movies released from 1989 through 1999 were reviewed, and certain physical and professional characteristics were analyzed. Results show that librarians on the whole are portrayed mostly positively in recent movies. Both physical and professional characteristics are portrayed  mostly positively, but filmmakers do need to keep widening the gap between librarians with positive physical characteristics and librarians with negative physical characteristics. Public librarians are portrayed the most and have positive images a vast majority of the time. Negative characteristics that are definitely gone are wearing hair in a bun and shushing patrons. Librarians in major roles are portrayed even more positively than other movie librarians, especially regarding physical characteristics. A copy of the data collection sheet and list of movies reviewed are appended. (Contains 14 references.) (Author/MES)",

        "description":"Public libraries serve patrons who have a wide range of demographic characteristics. Boards of Trustees of public libraries play an important role in maintaining and planning libraries that serve the needs of the community. The demographic characteristics of the board are one factor that can help represent the diversity of the patron community. Library literature and past research suggest that public library boards should have members with a broad spectrum of demographic characteristics. Two studies, done in 1970 and 1998, provide comparative demographic information about public library trustees. This preliminary study of Ohio public libraries gathered and analyzed demographic information about trustees and public library communities. Gender, race, age, income and education data  were generated through surveys distributed to public library board members. Trustees were chosen from Ohio public libraries that were ranked by size and stratified by the number of full-time employees (FTE). Data analysis compared demographic data of trustees and public library communities, and analyzed Category I (libraries with over 100 FTE), Category II (libraries with 20-100 FTE), and total survey results. Good representation on Ohio boards was noted in the areas of gender and race. Age, income, and education data revealed patterns of over- and under-representation. A copy of the questionnaire is appended. (Contains 18 references.) (Author/MES)",

A content analysis was used to examine 70 articles relating to selection responsibility. The articles cover the period 1950 to 1998, with a wide range of categories used to analyze the selection information. The result is a characterization of the factors that make up the discussion. Factors were grouped in six categories--primary responsibility, type of library, type of academic library, organization of library, country, and publication date. These are the key issues in the selection of library materials. It was found that 38 (54.3%) of the articles mentioned librarians as being primarily  responsible for selecting library materials. The chi square analysis revealed a relationship of primary responsibility by country.

The percentage of books 10 years old or older was calculated. Science and technology were chosen due to the rapid amount of change in these areas. Three broad Dewey categories in the 300s, 500s, 600s, and the following three narrower areas were investigated: astronomy, space, and the solar system; general biology and ecology; and human anatomy, physiology, and hygiene. The mean age of books ranged from 13.5 years to 34.9 years; the median age ranged from 10 to 32 years old. The percentage of books 10 years old or older at each of the individual middle schools ranged from 45.8% to 87%. The findings reveal  that the middle school library collections surveyed need new and updated materials. The outdated collections are unable to support curricular goals or student needs.

        "description":"This study tests for correlation between two journal ranking methods--citation rankings and expert opinion surveys. Political science professors from four major universities were asked to rank a list of the 20 most highly cited political science journals. Citation data were taken from the &quot;Social Sciences Citation Index Journal Citation Reports&quot; from 1992-96. In addition, each professor was asked to identify his or her area of specialization. A Pearson's correlation coefficient and a Spearman's rank order correlation coefficient were calculated from the survey data. In addition, the standard deviation for the average ranking of each journal was calculated to show the level of agreement among survey respondents. Each calculation was repeated within each area of specialization. The  resulting data did not indicate a statistically significant degree of correlation between citation counts and expert opinion surveys. However, there was some indication that a significant level of agreement did exist within each area of specialization. The results suggest that further research is necessary to determine how much effect specializations have on subjective journal rankings. Appendices include a list of the 20 most frequently cited political science journals, the survey form, data on average rank assigned by survey respondents, and a list of write-in journals.

        "author":["Clark, Craig"],
        "description":"Super bookstores have entered into many communities across the United States, and they have caused library professionals to defend and debate the similarities and differences between the bookstores and libraries. Most of the literature on the topic consists of editorial or opinion articles focusing on the differences in services provided by the two institutions. This paper approaches the issue of library and bookstore competition by developing themes of behavior regarding subjects' actions in the coffee shop area of a super bookstore. Because of the strong opinions that exist regarding comparisons of super bookstores and libraries, this research employed grounded theory, a qualitative approach, to investigate the research question. Unobtrusive observation was used to gather data  for 30 individuals using the coffee shop. The observations were broken down into small parts called concepts, which were compared and grouped into categories. The categories were then compiled into a coding sheet so that each observation could be examined according to the categories developed from the initial observations. This process, defined as open coding, allowed themes of behavior to emerge from the data. Five themes of behavior were developed and named by the researcher: (1) the pit stop; (2) the super coffee shop; (3) bookstore enhancement; (4) the study hall; and (5) information gathering. Appendices include the floor plan of a superbookstore and coding categories. (Contains 11 references.) (Author/MES)",

It was hypothesized that prospect researchers do not utilize the library, even when the same services or information may be found for free at the library. A questionnaire was developed to ascertain methods of obtaining information for prospect research. The first part of the survey explored library usage by asking how often members visited libraries, types of libraries visited, and what factors influenced their decision to choose a library over other methods of obtaining information. The second part of the survey consisted of a list of specific resources commonly used in prospect research. Respondents were  asked where they were most likely to access those sources. The last part of the survey listed common research functions performed by prospect researchers, and respondents were asked which type of resource was most useful when performing those functions. Analysis of the information-seeking functions commonly performed by prospect researchers shows that the majority of information needs may be met with the combined use of sources available in-house (print, online services, and Internet) without having to utilize the library. Data shows that prospect researchers rarely consult with librarians. A copy of the questionnaire is appended. (Contains 13 references and 20 notes.) (Author/MES)",

A comparison is made between male and female characters in each subgenre. Characteristics examined include personal traits and occupations and the roles played by female characters. Male characters were most often noted as having occupations. When occupations were specified for women, they were almost always positions that had inherently less political and/or magical power than men, regardless of subgenre. Women acting independently were found most often in alternate  world/history fantasy, while the majority of females in both of the other two subgenres are defined by their relationship to male characters.

This study suggests that the public libraries of Ohio are at different stages in the process of creating effective Web sites with well-selected, organized, and presented links, but clearly are working toward the goal of providing enhanced access to Internet resources. Of the 113 Web sites analyzed, 109 had at least one link to an Internet resource created outside of the library's Web site. Nearly 47% organized links topically, into ready reference areas. The organization and scope of the  ready reference areas varied widely. The number of links provided in the ready reference areas ranged from 1 to 1,718, with nearly 40% providing fewer than 25 links. Approximately 50% of ready reference areas were organized using a broad categorization scheme, with the remaining 50% listing links without using categories or categorizing randomly without any attempt at exhaustiveness.

The student population represented traditional freshmen and adult students looking for personal or career development. The response rate (94.7%) was excellent, with 31 classes participating. The survey instrument identified student status information, library usage patterns, and career information sources. A library was used at least once during the month by 199 (74.3%) of the respondents. Cuyahoga Community College libraries were used by 107 of these respondents. Usage patterns revealed that 34.7% of the respondents who reported using a library at least once during the month used more than one type of library,  and 5% of these respondents reported using more than two types of libraries. This information suggests that public library usage complements usage of campus libraries. Public library usage patterns were consistent with the geographic area where each campus is located, resulting in high usage counts for Cleveland Public Library and Cuyahoga County Public Library. Newspapers and college resources were the most frequently used career information sources. Research data from this study supports the conclusion that Cuyahoga Community College provides student access to career information through general studies classes, counseling offices, and campus libraries.

        "description":"In the 1970s and early 1980s, a few library researchers and scholars made a case for the importance of public libraries' acquisition of popular music, particularly rock music sound recordings. Their arguments were based on the anticipated historical and cultural importance of obtaining and maintaining a collection of these materials. Little new research in this direction has been performed since then. The question arose as to what, if anything, has changed since this time. This question was answered by examining the compact disc holdings of the Cleveland Public Library, a major research-oriented facility. This examination was accomplished using three discographies of essential rock music titles, as well as recent &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 Album charts. The results indicated a strong  orientation toward the acquisition of recent releases, with the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts showing the largest percentages of holdings for the system. Meanwhile, the holdings vis-a-vis the essential discographies ran directly opposite the &quot;Billboard&quot; holdings. This implies a program of short-term patron satisfaction by providing current &quot;hits,&quot; while disregarding the long-term benefits of a collection based on demonstrated artistic relevance. The discographies of essential rock music are appended. (Contains 28 references.) (Author/MES)",

The research conducted thus far has primarily addressed the growing body of electronic journals and related issues of accessibility and retrieval. Preservation issues have also been discussed. What have not been examined are citations to documents available on the Internet that are increasingly being referenced in the research literature. How stable are electronic resources over time? What percentage of errors occurs in  electronic references? What types of references (i.e., HTTP, FTP, Gopher, Listservs) are most stable over time? What types of errors exist in citations? Do the number of errors for a given type increase over time? In this study, all citations to electronic resources for 10 library and information science journals for 1994-98 were examined.

        "description":"Eleven artists and sixteen art historians teaching in five liberal arts colleges and three universities were interviewed to discover their information needs and the resources they use, not only for their own work, but for teaching purposes. The participants almost all subscribe to art journals, and many read newspapers. They visit libraries frequently, usually more than one library, and, unlike previous reports, a majority are willing to ask the librarian for help. Also, in marked contrast to previous reports in the literature, a large percentage of both art historians and artists are using computers. All 27 use slides extensively in the classroom, supplemented in most cases by textbooks, but also by journal articles and other readings on reserve in the library. Some take  students to visit museums and galleries locally, and a few take students to nearby cities or even Europe. Approximately 50% of both groups of participants use the computer for teaching purposes. Some recommendations are made for ways in which academic librarians might use the information gleaned in this study to better serve their arts faculty. A copy of the interview questionnaire is appended. (Contains 28 references.) (Author/MES)",

        "description":"This study surveys previous research about systems librarians and performs a systematic examination of position requirements through analysis of position announcements, responsibilities, required skills, job titles, degree requirements, personality qualifications, and salaries. The educational needs and emergent curriculum appropriate for educating systems librarians are also surveyed. It was found that there has been a significant change over the last decade in the role, definition, and qualifications of a systems librarian. Systems librarian was the most frequently used job title, and systems librarians still should have good oral/written communications and training skills. The concept that a systems librarian should be first a librarian and second a MIS (Master of Information  Science) professional, however, is no longer supported by the job ad descriptions. Library employers are seeking applicants who hold a MLS (Master of Library Science) or MLIS (Master of Library and Information Science), but they want those applicants to possess high-tech qualifications and skills that more typically belong to MIS professionals. This study also found that to meet this change, different approaches are being implemented to educate systems librarians both within and outside of library school departments through integration of information technology and information science curriculum enhancements, information science program additions, and departmental merging with other information science departments. Appendices contain a job title listing for different cities and Internet,  LISTSERV and World Wide Web resources for job ads. Contains 17 references. (Author/MES)",

In addition, the policy has promoted cooperation between institutions, most of which have progressed beyond questions of policy compliance to practices that facilitate equitable admission and ensure that transfer students will complete their baccalaureate degree. This document presents articles on topics that are designed to increase the understanding of how credits transfer, how transfer guides can be used to facilitate transfer, and how articulation agreements are developed. Articles include: (1) When is a Credit not a Credit? (2) Transfer Guides--Road Maps for Transfer Planning; (3) Guidelines for Developing Articulation  Agreements between Community Colleges and Four-Year Institutions; (4) High School--Community College--Four-Year College Examples of Articulated Programs through Tech Prep; and (5) Opportunities for Advanced Standing for High School Students.

        "description":"This paper is a summary of the history, organization, programs, students and facilities of Rio Salado Community College (RSCC), an institution in the Maricopa Community College District (MCCCD), Arizona. RSCC was founded in 1978 as a college with no central campus designed to cater to adult students. Today, the college is comprised of seven geographically dispersed, relatively autonomous sub-units. Facilities utilized by the college include central administrative offices and a small traditional campus, as well as extensive use of high schools, office spaces, military installations, and other temporary facilities. Nearly all faculty members are part-time, and courses and programs are offered in a variety of settings. RSCC enrolls approximately 40,000 students per year.  Ninety-three percent of these students are working adults. Much of the curriculum is centered upon professional training for adults and development of marketable job skills, rather than preparation of students for four-year institutions. This study focuses upon three of the seven administrative units within the college: the Area North, Area East, and the College and Adult Literacy (CALS) unit. For each unit, program offerings, staffing levels and facilities are discussed. Further analysis of RSCC's organization reveals strengths and weaknesses of the &quot;colleges without walls&quot; philosophy upon which the college was founded. Contains 32 references and 2 figures.

These revenue comparisons are benchmarked across 5 fiscal years, against community colleges in 10 other large states (10LS), and for different sources of revenue. The definitions and measures--of both revenue and full-time equivalent (FTE) students--are the most comparable and valid available. This report finds that the revenue per student gap has increased slightly from 1993-94 to 1997-98, largely because while revenues have increased, California FTE are up and those in the 10LS are down slightly. During the same period, the gap in state and local tax revenue per student has declined  from $585 per FTE to $248 per FTE because of California's improved public revenue stream. California's current tuition and fee revenues per FTE lag behind those of the 10LS even more than in 1993-94 because the $50 per credit baccalaureate surcharge was eliminated in 1996 and enrollment fee maintained at $13 while colleges in the 10LS increased tuition and fees at 4% to 5% annually. While California community colleges have improved their level of federal revenues, they still lag behind those of colleges in the 10LS. (VWC)",

The appointed task force was to address the needed telecommunications connectivity between community college districts, and among community college districts, the universities, and K-12. The ALS Business Plan focuses on the use of Interactive Instructional Television (IITV) as an instructional method. Over the next few years, ALS expects other modes of learning to become available, and the Business Plan includes funds for content development in these other modes of instruction. ALS proposes to extend the benefits of distance learning statewide and create market-based incentives for the  development of entirely new instructional content. It also should encourage the development of computer-based instruction (CBI) and Internet courses. The ALS plan envisions developing two &quot;markets&quot;: a telecommunications network and instructional content. The system would ultimately have a four- to five-person staff, and the plan includes programs for faculty development, assessment of instructional material effectiveness, and development of content otherwise thought uneconomic by districts. Included in this article is a table of ALS's financial plan and a chart of the number of annual headcount students served through ALS courses. (VWC)",

        "description":"This report summarizes the most recent (December 1998) long-range statewide forecast of fall enrollment and average annual weekly student contact hours (WSCH) in California Community Colleges. The annual fall survey of college registrars shows that fall 1998 enrollment is up 1.8 percent over fall 1997. The office forecasting model projects an increase of 2.9 percent in fall 1999 enrollment statewide to 1,517,087, which would exceed the colleges' peak recorded in 1991. Further increases are forecast through the year 2005, pushing fall enrollments up by a total of 281,000 students, an increase of nearly 20 percent over this fall. The method used in this report is an econometric regression model to forecast fall enrollment. The structure and function of the model are explained in  the attached Appendices A and B. Assumptions that drive future values for the model's five independent variables are student prices, financing, budget outlays, unemployment, and adult population. Recent increases in average student academic load -- largely the result of increasing high school graduate enrollment -- are projected to continue into 1999-2000, followed by use of a three-year moving average throughout the balance of the forecast period. These values are then used to derive total future WSCH. (VWC)",

The state auditor found that the Chancellor's Office did not comply with procedures for awarding grants and did not adequately oversee the colleges' compliance with grant requirements. In 1992-93, there was no evidence of a competitive basis to award 33 of 55 grants reviewed, despite procedures calling for competitive awards. The Office did not ensure that community colleges submitted required financial reports, and the colleges did not always spend funds in accordance with grant  requirements. Additionally, the Chancellor's Office and the Department of Education circumvented state controls by using fiscal agents to obtain contractor services and submitted erroneous and misleading information to the Department of General services as support for contract approval requests. This audit recommends that the Chancellor's Office comply with the policy of competitive grant processes, monitor and review grant expenditures at the colleges, discontinue use of fiscal agents, and ensure contracts have been approved and amounts paid to contractors is appropriate. The audit also recommends that the Chancellor's Office reimburse the state for the amount of unnecessary costs incurred as a result of inadequate management. (RDG)",

The first report presents findings from the literature search evaluation. An extensive search revealed few published documents on financial aid from a service perspective. Common important aspects were positive and polite staff, informed administrators and staff, and student and parent feedback. The second report presents statements from MCC alumni and previous MCC studies about financial aid services. Findings suggest that, compared with national norms, fewer students receive aid and students give FAO services lower ratings. The third report presents  findings of comparison data from other colleges. Compared with other schools, MCC has a low number of financial aid applicants and low proportions of students receiving aid. MCC institutional grant allocation is small, but MCC falls mid-range in total financial aid disbursed. The fourth report presents findings from the survey of financial aid applicants for 1994-1995. The survey was distributed to 1,500 of 6,000 students who applied for financial aid. Responses (53% response rate) indicate information provided to students is not always adequate, and students were less satisfied with phone services. The fifth report presents findings from the survey of MCC administrators and supervisory-technical personnel designated &quot;managers&quot; by the Office of the President. Of the 96 managers surveyed,  54 returned responses. Reponses indicate that most managers are not up-to-date on financial aid. Each report contains references. (RDG)",

STCC groups attrition into three categories: (1) positive attrition, due to graduation, completion or transfer; (2) neutral attrition, due to non-institutional conflicts; and (3) negative attrition, due to academic underachievement. Based on the 1994 first-time student cohort, STCC's persisting or graduating rate was 40 percent. The Office of Institutional Research and Effectiveness found 50 variables that were significantly related to retention, but few relationships are strong enough alone to predict student persistence. At STCC, college grade point average is the single best predictor of retention (r=.477). Employment alone was found to be only weakly related to student attendance behavior. Some important findings include: (1) both receiving financial aid and attending developmental studies are positively related to persistence; (2) personalized contact is important in student persistence; (3) part-time students (53% of the total) are at high risk for attrition; (4) placing students on academic probation has a negative impact on retention; and (5) nearly all graduates included in this study did not have any breaks in semester enrollment prior to graduation. Recommendations are provided for each of these five findings. (RDG)",

        "description":"This brief handbook provides a set of exercises that instructors can use if they decide to incorporate cultural diversity topics into a macroeconomics principles course. It is hoped that this guidebook will: (1) help instructors grapple with any curriculum changes in macroeconomics that require a cultural diversity segment; and (2) sensitize instructors to the role that culture plays in economic behavior. The exercises attempt to: (1) make students aware of the importance of culture and its impact on economic theory and policy; and (2) make students conscious of the fact that individual economic behavior can widely differ because of cultural influences that stem from race, ethnic, religious, age, and gender origins. These 28 exercises each cover a topic that is normally found in  a macroeconomics principles course, such as exchange systems, gross domestic product, and monetary and fiscal policy. In most cases, some background material is provided for each subject, along with group exercises and essays that can be used to stimulate discussion or to be used as part of assignments or exams. Some sample evaluation instruments are also enclosed along with the syllabus used for the course and a bibliography is included that focuses on economic anthropology and economic sociology reference works.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to develop a descriptive profile of completer and non-completer reverse transfer students in Kentucky. Three major questions were investigated: (1) What are the characteristics of reverse transfer students? (2) What are the reasons and goals that motivate reverse transfers to enroll at community colleges? and (3) How do completer and non-completer students differ? The 882 (63.5% response rate) participants in this survey were drawn from a random sample of 4,863 reverse transfer students at Kentucky's 14 community colleges. The sample consisted of 734 non-completers (no baccalaureate degree) and 148 completers (earned baccalaureate degree), with a total average age of 30.7. White students were more likely than African-Americans, and married students  were more likely than single students, to have earned a baccalaureate degree. Compared with completers, non-completers were younger, had fewer dependent children, enrolled for and completed more credit hours, and earned lower GPAs. Over 31% of non-completers were enrolled in pre-transfer or general studies programs, compared with 4.8% of completers. Future degree aspirations were higher among non-completers. Completers were more interested in obtaining job training while non-completers were more interested in transfer and general academic skills. Overall, reverse transfers tend to have above-average academic achievement and aspirations. Implications for research and administrative practice are discussed. Contains 26 references and 5 tables.

        "description":"This report provides a profile of Diablo Valley College (DVC) in California as a transfer institution. According to the California Postsecondary Education Commission (CPEC), DVC has been among California's top three transfer institutions for the past 4 years. The college sends more than 2,000 students a year to baccalaureate programs, and after transfer, DVC students generally do as well or slightly better than students who begin their academic careers at four-year institutions. In 1995-96, almost 40% of DVC's 436 transfers to the University of California system were minority students, and 31% of transfers to the California State University system were minorities. Reasons for DVC's success include: (1) the quality of the college's faculty; (2) strong articulation agreements with  universities; (3) research on the effectiveness of the transfer programs, in which barriers to student transfer are identified and alleviated; and (4) the college's reputation, which draws serious students and encourages the partnership of four-year institutions. This document describes a number of practices in higher education institutions that lessen transfer effectiveness, and suggests ways to make them more efficient, such as developing a common course numbering system. The author states that most schools aren't as effective with transfer students as DVC, and recommends that the current system be less complicated and more attentive and encouraging to students.

The FRCs were based on the premise that many childhood and adolescent problems can be prevented by strengthening effective family management practices and establishing a continuum of child care and support services linked to public schools or located in public school buildings. This report details the evaluation of the 18 school-based/linked FRCs, describing their structure and contexts, examining evidence of service use, and presenting information on the effects of the FRCs on families and schools. Chapter 1 presents the service delivery model, describes the core services, and describes the evaluation plan.  Chapters 2 through 5 summarize findings related to the following areas: (1) structure of core services, service delivery, financial supports, and staffing characteristics; (2) processes used to deliver services in a school-based/linked setting, including collaborative arrangements; (3) use of FRC services; (4) impacts of FRCs on families and children; and (5) impact of FRCs on schools. Chapter 6 discusses the patterns observed that reflect the implementation of the FRC service delivery model and implications for delivering comprehensive integrated services to families. This chapter also presents recommendations for sustaining the school-based/linked delivery model of the FRCs at meaningful levels. Chapter 7 presents profiles of the 18 FRCs, including their setting, service delivery  arrangements, primary collaborative arrangements, and the school relationship. Nine appendices include a description of the Evaluation Support System and data collection instruments. (KB)",

Participating were three kindergarten students at a rural Alaskan elementary school, selected because they experienced considerable social failure from the first day of kindergarten. The students participated individually in after-school playgroups where they played one-on-one with one teacher for an hour each week. After a few weeks, selected peers were brought into the groups to act as models. Each teacher maintained a journal noting incidents of social disturbances and conflicts, contacts made with parents and the school administration, and the  student's use of socially appropriate interaction. Some playgroup sessions were videotaped to assist in identifying and analyzing problems and successes of students in interacting with others. A pre- and post-intervention sociogram was administered privately and individually to each student in the kindergarten classrooms to see how frequently targeted children were selected as playmates and to see where they each fit socially in the classroom. The three teachers met at least three times weekly to discuss problems and solutions. Data indicated that during the weeks that the play groups were held, the targeted children showed more successful entry into play in the classroom and greater willingness to join the group or participate in problem-solving with others. However, antisocial behavior  continued to be displayed, although it was less frequent and less severe. (Sociogram information is appended. Contains 26 references.) (KB)",

This study investigated family relationships and their link to the several domains of self-concept. Participating were 77 adolescents between 13 and 18 years of age. The majority were white (85 percent) and from middle- to upper-class backgrounds. Subjects completed the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale; the social support factor of the Network of Relationships Inventory regarding their mother, father, and sibling; and the mother and father affection and control subscales of the Sibling Inventory of Differential Experience. Included for  this study were the following Piers-Harris scores: general self-concept, behavior, intellectual and school status, physical appearance and attributes, anxiety, popularity, and happiness and satisfaction. The findings indicated that adolescents who perceived that there was no parental favoritism for affection had higher general, behavior, and happiness and satisfaction self-concepts than adolescents who perceived that they were unfavored. Adolescents who perceived no parental favoritism for affection had higher physical appearance and attributes and popularity self-concepts than adolescents who perceived that they were favored. Females had higher behavior self-concepts and lower anxiety self-concepts than males. The higher the anxiety self-concept score, the lower the number of anxious  behaviors. Adolescents perceiving good parental social support had higher general, physical appearance and attributes, anxiety, and popularity self-concepts than adolescents perceiving poor social support.

This document is comprised of the June 1998 report of a Maine task force to study strategies to support parents as children's first teachers and the January 1999 progress report. The task force identified three keys to achieving the mission that all Maine children reach their highest potential through lifelong learning: (1) home visiting services for all new parents; (2) parenting education and support for parents as children's first teachers; and (3) community-based family support services, including quality and enriched child care. The 1998 report delineates characteristics of  effective home visiting programs, recommends the development of a core curriculum for current and future parents and caregivers, and identifies ways to improve current community-based services in Maine. The report's six appendices include a list of task force members, a description of expected outcomes of enhanced services, and a description of the Born to Read pilot projects. The 1999 progress report, which is appended, presents information on progress toward a fiscal plan for expanding existing state-funded child and family support initiatives, developing the core curriculum, implementing an elementary and secondary education level course of study in parenting education, and extending the life of the task force. This report concludes with a proposed fiscal plan for providing statewide  home visiting services, training for providers and parents, and use of the core curriculum. (KB)",

        "description":"The quality of the parent-parent relationship is considered as an important factor for managing stressful family crises. The assumption in this study is that specific patterns of parent-parent communication make it easier or more difficult to adjust to changes in the family that are required when the first child enters early adolescence. In a longitudinal study, 42 two-parent families were investigated at home over 3.5 years. Adolescents rated two aspects of their parent-child relationships and two self-related topics. During the first, fourth, sixth, and eighth waves, discussions of everyday issues in three dyads of the same family (mother-father, mother-child, and father-child) were videotaped and coded subsequently with regard to formal, verbal, and non-verbal aspects. In  order to differentiate patterns of parent-parent interaction, two aspects of mothers' communication behavior were selected. The first indicates verbal assertion (statements), and the second indicates emotional alarm (high tension). A cluster analysis yielded three groups with divergent communication behaviors that can be described as blocked, expressive, and balanced. Overall, findings suggest that different communication patterns in the parental couple are linked to divergent changes in the observed parent-child communications as well as to adolescents' representations of themselves and their relationships to their parents.

Chapter 1 provides an extended discussion of the background and techniques of economic analysis used to make judgments about the economic benefits and costs of child care. Chapter 2 reviews evidence concerning the developmental and educational impacts of child care on young children. Chapter 3 presents and analyzes evidence concerning the economic impacts of child care on mothers' participation in the labor force in particular, and on family life in general. Chapter 4 considers the economy-wide employment effects and the macroeconomic effects of potential child care programs. Chapter 5 calculates, using a variety of  approximation techniques, the value of the benefits and the costs of a program of high quality child care for all preschoolers. Chapter 6 presents the conclusions, which note that the incremental benefits of the identified changes to child care arrangements in Canada amount to approximately two dollars for every dollar of cost to the public purse. The report argues that society has the responsibility to care for preschool and  school-age children, and to provide parental leave from work.

While the Grade 1 study was limited to teachers' perceptions of student performance, this follow-up focused on factors most related to actual end-of-year student status. The purposes of the follow-up study were to examine judgments of surveyed Grade 1 teachers regarding their students' promotion status in light of the students' actual promotion, placement, or retention and to explore relationships among system resources (contexts), student and school characteristics (inputs), and school and classroom practices (processes) that are associated with promotion to Grade 2. Some highlights from the findings are: (1) nearly all  students were promoted to, or placed in, Grade 2, a higher percentage than projected by Grade 1 teachers; (2) teachers' assessments of students' readiness and instructional levels were strongly related to students' promotion; (3) students judged to have mastered at least half of the essential Grade 1 elements were much more likely to be promoted than students who had mastered fewer than half of the elements; (4) student attendance was positively related to promotion; (5) students' self-help skills were positively related to promotion; (6) students judged at or above grade level in oral reading proficiency, reading comprehension, and mathematics were more likely to be promoted than students performing below grade level; and (7) relationships between promotion and teachers' use of several  instructional techniques yielded conflicting results.

        "description":"A collaborative approach to program evaluation combined with the use of a variety of evaluation methods using currently available technology can yield valuable information about the effectiveness of family literacy programs. Such an approach was used for McCosh Even Start, a federally-funded family literacy program located at McCosh School in an inner city Chicago neighborhood, a partnership between Northeastern Illinois University and the Chicago Public Schools. The program is comprised of an adult literacy component and a parent-child component. The adult literacy component includes computer instruction, photography and video classes, a parent club for literacy career development skills, and parent field trips. The parent-child component includes home visiting, an after-school  family literacy program, parent-child field trips, computer classes, and the use of videotaping and photography to document learning. Computers, video technology, and photography were used as literacy development tools, but also to document the literacy progress of parents and children. Evaluation used to show literacy improvement included video documentation, interviews, parent interest questionnaires, observations, book logs, photo collections with personalized captions, portfolios, information reading inventories, and parent self-evaluations. Based on evaluation findings, it was concluded that the evolving, continuous feedback model of evaluation made it possible to use a wide range of evaluation strategies to obtain an authentic picture of the program's strengths and weaknesses and  made it possible to make changes as a result of all participants' feedback, and to approach target goals.

        "description":"This report details a 5-year study comparing family literacy practices of families from preschool to Grade 3 with recommendations from the position statement of the National Association for the Education of Young Children and the International Reading Association (NAEYC-IRA). Participating were African- and European-American families of children attending Baltimore public schools. At the end of 5 years, the sample totaled about 54 families. Data were collected through yearly parent interviews regarding literacy-related beliefs and practices, periodic observations of parent-child literacy interactions, a week-long parent diary detailing their child's everyday experiences, and yearly testing of children on literacy tasks. Recommendations for parental practices and emerging literacy  include: (1) engage in shared book reading; (2) provide frequent and varied oral language experiences; (3) encourage self-initiated print interactions; (4) visit the library regularly; (5) demonstrate the value of literacy in everyday life; (6) promote reading motivation; (7) foster pride and self- efficacy in reading; and (8) communicate with teachers and be involved in school. The report concludes that there is evidence that parents from diverse sociocultural backgrounds do follow the NAEYC-IRA guidelines. However, the report also notes that the guidelines do not give advice for what parents ought not do, for example, using drill and practice to develop reading abilities. Appendices include 9 tables that detail family practices recommended in the NAEYC/IRA Position Statement. (Contains  14 references.) (KB)",

        "description":"The findings of differential maternal treatment of siblings in current research are often confounded by the fact that at the time of assessment the two siblings were of different ages. This prospective study examined concordance of siblings' attachment quality to their shared mother. Participating were 106 families and their 12 to 15 month olds. The target toddlers were assessed in the strange situation with mothers and were classified for attachment pattern. Subsequently, 40 younger siblings were born and 36 were assessed in the same strange situation with their mothers when they were 12 to 18 month-olds. Nineteen siblings were less than 3 years apart and 17 were more than 3 years apart. Thirty-four mothers completed the Toddler Temperament Scale at the time of attachment  assessment for both children. Temperament ratings were grouped into three types: easy, intermediate, and difficult. The study found the following distribution of attachment patterns for the whole sample: 48 percent secure, 19 percent insecure-avoidant, 11 percent insecure-ambivalent, and 22 percent disorganized. Although the secure pattern was observed much more frequently among the younger than the older siblings (75 percent versus 42 percent), the distribution of the four groups of attachment classes of the younger siblings was not significantly different. No significant concordance was found for attachment pattern of the siblings. Distribution of temperament types for the whole sample was 18 percent easy, 54 percent intermediate, and 24 percent difficult. No significant concordance was  found between the three temperament classes. Attachment patterns were not systematically related to types of temperament. (KB)",

        "description":"This training guide is designed to enable parents and early childhood staff and managers to support and facilitate infant and toddler transitions through responsive relationships that are secure and consistent. The guide defines transitions during the first 3 years of life from developmental and relational perspectives that include changes that occur as a result of rapid developmental growth, multiple daily transitions in routines and care, and transitions from home into and out of Early Head Start and other early care settings. The guide is divided into two sections: Skill Based Training and Informational Resources. The Skill-Based Training section includes three training modules. Module one, &quot;Infant Transitions,&quot; addresses the importance of responsive relationships as the  foundation for supporting transitions and the healthy development of infants and their families. Module two, &quot;Toddler Transitions,&quot; addresses the need for continuity in relationships that provide a secure base for exploration and consistency in routines to support continued development and ease transitions during the toddler years. Module three, &quot;Transitions beyond Toddlerhood,&quot; focuses on the Head Start Program Performance Standard requirement that programs and families plan for the transition and appropriate placement of a child 6 months before his or her third birthday. The Information Resources section contains documents that can enhance the understanding of key concepts discussed in this guide, including digests, program profiles, hands-on tools, and other resources.

This report provides information on the number of children receiving subsidies through the CCDF in fiscal year (FY) 1998 and on the number of children eligible for assistance, by state. The report describes the CCDF and other federal programs providing funding for child care assistance. The report notes that in FY 1998 states spent $3.5 billion in federal mandatory and discretionary funds and $1.6 billion of state funds on child care assistance. Regular child care arrangements are often too expensive for working poor families if they lack access to subsidies. Increased funding for child care subsidies increases employment rates and earnings for  low- and moderate-income parents. State-wide child care quality initiatives have resulted in improved program quality and enhanced child development. An average of 1.5 million children each month received Child Care and Development Fund subsidies in FY 1998. Approximately 9.9 million children are estimated to be eligible for subsidies under state-set limits. The report concludes that there is a large unmet need for child care assistance throughout the country. (KB)",

        "author":["Raden, Anthony"],
        "description":"In 1995, Georgia became the first U.S. state to provide universal prekindergarten to 4 year olds. Although the lottery-funded program has received more attention from policymakers than any other program, there has been no systematic effort to chronicle the program's evolution or to draw lessons from its experience. This report illustrates the complex and often unpredictable processes involved in translating ideas into public policy and identifies lessons relevant to other state early education initiatives. Following an executive summary and chronology of program development, the report covers the following topics: (1) Lieutenant Governor Zell Miller's plan to fund a prekindergarten program for low-income 4 year olds with lottery funds; (2) designing and implementing the  prekindergarten initiative; (3) resolving tensions with Head Start programs and integrating for-profit child care providers; (4) expanding the program to cover all 4 year olds; (5) political controversies and the creation of an Office of School Readiness; (6) shifts in the program; (7) program evaluation results; and (8) the program's future. Lessons for other states are discussed in the following areas: (1) tradeoffs in offering prekindergarten services to all families; (2) state lotteries as a funding mechanism; (3) the need for powerful, consistent leadership; (4) understanding and protecting the fragile ecology of early childhood programs; (5) challenges in integrating private providers; (6) the complexity of dynamics among federal, state, and local government; (7) the need for  constant attention to program quality; and (8) challenges in creating a prekindergarten infrastructure. The report's three appendices include information on approved prekindergarten curriculum models and funding levels. (Contains 68 references.) (KB)",

        "description":"The field of early childhood education has long been marked by intense controversy concerning appropriate curriculum and teaching methods and goals. This paper explores some implications of the traditional dichotomies of the field and suggests that while there are many reasons to resist the side that advocates formal academic instruction, it does not necessarily follow that what is offered to children in non-academic programs sufficiently addresses their intellectual development. In particular, it is asserted that common confusion between academic and intellectual goals often leads to the neglect of the basic intellectual dispositions of young children, all of which must be strengthened and supported in the early years. An example of a project conducted with young children that  addresses all the major goals of early education is appended. (Contains 33 references.) (Author/KB)",

The problem of failure to display prosocial behavior was documented among five students in each grade level, by means of classroom teachers' observations, checklists of prosocial behavior, and student interviews regarding problematic peer-related situations. The intervention consisted of selecting children's literature that addressed the needs of targeted students, reading the literature several times each week, and using follow-up activities to reinforce peer-related concepts. The effects of the intervention  were assessed by means of pre-post observations of children's interactions and interviews with selected children regarding problematic peer-related situations. Post-intervention data indicated an increase in prosocial behaviors among the targeted students. The children developed problem-solving skills to assist in social interactions.

The targeted population consisted of students in two inner-city elementary schools located in Indiana. In a traditionally book-oriented classroom, instruction is typically geared toward the verbal/linguistic and logical/mathematical intelligences. An analysis of the literature led to the understanding that each student has the capabilities to activate all eight identified intelligences, but that these intelligences may be developed to different degrees within each individual. Each student's dominant intelligence was identified. Thematic lessons that strengthened the multiple intelligences of all of the involved students were constructed. The plan of action was to  construct planning webs and monthly themes that incorporated a plethora of multiple intelligence products. Lesson plans were developed utilizing a variety of planning tools. In addition, informal journals were kept to highlight progress, successes, and trends. The effects of multiple intelligence instruction were documented through observations, product choices, student reaction, and survey checklists. Observations and checklists reaffirmed expectations that how one is taught, what strategies are utilized, and in what manner information is presented can and do affect student learning. They further demonstrated that students' strengths and weaknesses can be affected by a teacher's method of instruction.

Participating were students in an eighth grade social studies class and third through seventh grade learning disabilities classes in a rural school setting. The need for increased parental involvement and student interest was documented by means of parent and student surveys and by observing parent attendance at school functions. The one-semester intervention was developed based on a review of literature and an analysis of the problem setting and was comprised of an increase in home-school activities such as an open house, parent-teacher conferences, photo album night, special friend day, and monthly newsletters  and activity packets, as well as an increase in parental contact at the school through the use of an informative bulletin board. Post-intervention data indicated that parental involvement as assessed by parental attendance at school functions continued to be a problem. Nevertheless, because of the planned activities, parents had an opportunity to be involved at school. There were positive comments from students and parents about the activities and negative comments about the purpose of the activities.

The final sample consisted of 463 mothers with their 3 to 7 year-olds from 11 preschools, in Taiwan. Mothers completed a Chinese translation of the Parenting Behavior Questionnaire that assessed their parenting practices. Findings indicated that the subscales of the Authoritative scale were positively related to each other. Subscales of the Authoritarian scale were also positively related to each other. The Authoritarian and Authoritative total scores were negatively related to each other. The majority of the mothers (over 65 percent) could be classified as authoritative. None of the mothers in this sample were classified as authoritarian. Four  parenting patterns were identified for the sample: (1) high authoritative, low authoritarian (65 percent of mothers); (2) high authoritative, medium authoritarian (12 percent); (3) medium authoritative, low authoritarian (15 percent); and (4) medium authoritative, medium authoritarian (7 percent). Contrary to the impression from many previous cross-cultural studies presenting Chinese parents as controlling and authoritarian, the findings of this study showed that the authoritative pattern was predominant among participants.

This study identified areas of support required by teachers to provide a smooth introduction of the computer into the early childhood education classroom. Participating were 192 female and 4 male early childhood educators from 3 middle-sized Canadian cities. Subjects completed questionnaires assessing basic knowledge, attitudes toward computers, and information that teachers would like to have regarding computers. The findings indicated that preschool teachers support the use of computers in the ECE environment, but require information that is reliable, systematic, and informed. Findings were used  to provide suggestions about the content of training workshops for early childhood educators. (Includes questionnaire used for the study. (KB)",

This publication was developed to assist management and educators in New Zealand early childhood services to implement the 1996 revised Statement of Desirable Objectives and Practices, which convey the government's expectations for the standard of education and care that early childhood services provide. The introduction describes the New Zealand context for early childhood education and explains the relationship of the DOPs to practice within &quot;kohanga reo&quot; and to &quot;Te Korowai,&quot; the  charter between Te Kohanga Reo National Trust Board and the Ministry of Education. This section is presented in both English and Maori. Each DOP is then examined in detail, beginning with the guiding principles and following the order in which the DOPs are given in their three main divisions: (1) Learning and Development; (2) Communication and Consultation; and (3) Operation and Administration. The document ends with a list of legislation relevant to early childhood services and a glossary of terms. For each DOP or subsection, the following information is provided: (1) a DOP statement; (2) implications for management and educators, and examples of high-quality practice; (3) understandings, values, beliefs, and practices significant to Maori; (4) illustration of good practice; (5)  indicators that a service is meeting DOP requirements; (6) reflective questions for practitioners to consider their practice; and (7) a recommended reading list.

        "description":"In the 1996 and 1997 Massachusetts legislative sessions, several of Boston's key business leaders became active child advocates in alliance with more traditional advocates and other civic leaders, convincing public policymakers to create and fund several initiatives benefiting children. This working paper presents reflections on successful legislative advocacy for children and describes the advocacy strategy development and implementation. Section 1 of the paper presents reflections in the following areas: (1) why business leaders make a positive difference in child advocacy; (2) what convinces business leaders to become legislative child advocates; (3) recruiting business leaders to be &quot;messengers&quot; for children; (4) where advocates can find business leaders; (5) how advocates  can work effectively with business leaders; (6) what strategies work best for advocates in such an alliance; and (7) the number of business leaders needed and the necessary conditions for sustaining involvement. Section 2, presented as a case study, describes the United Way's role in developing a strategy for enrolling business leaders as advocates for the &quot;Success By 6&quot; initiative to support preventive approaches to improve the lives of young children and their families. Other areas discussed include developing a role for business leaders, deciding what issues to support, training business leaders for legislative advocacy, and examining business leaders' actions as advocates. Included throughout this section are quotations from interviews with 27 business leaders and others involved with  the initiative, descriptions of key findings on effective child advocacy, the &quot;Success By 6&quot; public awareness campaign, and descriptions of state legislation.

        "description":"When their children begin school, parents already have in place ideas and practices that have an impact upon their interpretation and incorporation of school culture. This paper uses Bakhtin's concepts of addressivity, answerability, and ethical activity to analyze key thinking related to home-school relations and to illustrate how parents of kindergartners and first graders from one elementary school frame their parental role in their discussions of expectations for their child, themselves, and their child's teacher. Data were collected by means of parental interviews as part of a larger ethnographic study on community beliefs about school readiness. The findings suggested that although parents' orientations were shaped by cultural meanings related to social class and gender,  they were distinctly personal. Parents relied on their own experiences as students, professional experiences as educators, experiences with their other children and the school culture, and understanding of their individual children to frame expectations and gauge their child's progress. Cultural practices had a strong set of social networks used to help parents understand their role, provide resources for action, and set frameworks for action. Opportunities for parental congregation and information sharing were provided at the bus stop, through volunteering to gain information on their child's daily routine and to gain a voice with their child's teacher, and through developing a personal relationship with the teacher and maintaining a position of equality with staff without overstepping  boundaries.

        "description":"Considering the mother-child relationship as the first in which culturally-related interdependence or independence is learned, this study examined whether the interdependency hypothesis holds for the mother-child relationship in Indonesia. The study focused on the quality of the mother-child relationship, children's daily social interactions, and contextual characteristics of the children's immediate environment to determine if Indonesian children learn to act and respond in an interdependent way toward others. Participating were 80 Sudanese-Indonesian mother-child dyads from low and lower-middle socio-economic status families. The average age of the children was about 38 months. For purposes of cross-cultural comparison, Indonesian data were available for 76 mother-child dyads,  41 infants and toddlers and 35 three to six year olds. Slightly more than half of the dyads lived in nuclear families, while the others lived in extended families. Data were collected through participant observation, ethnographic interviews, videotaped structured play sessions, and the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment. Cross-cultural comparison of findings showed that the quality of maternal support was comparable to Dutch and Surinam-Dutch mothers' support but not comparable to the support provided by Japanese mothers. Indonesian mothers behaved more respectfully than emotionally supportive toward their children's autonomy, particularly for 3 to 6 year-olds. The 3  to 6 year-olds had more opportunities for independent experiences than younger children. Daily social  routines were not related to the quality of mothers' interactive behavior. Mothers with higher educational levels spent more time with their children than did mothers with less education. (Contains 17 references.) (KB)",

        "description":"Values education has recently been high on the political agenda in many countries, including the Netherlands. Using a theoretical framework based on traditions in several academic areas, this study examined attitudes of Dutch parents, teachers, and secondary school students regarding moral education goals and the division of moral tasks between parents and teachers. Using the Delphi Method, data were collected by means of questionnaires, group interviews, and panel discussions. Completing the mail questionnaire were 571 adolescents, ages 14 to 17 years, 180 parents, and 86 teachers from 8 secondary schools. Group interviews took place at participant schools with panel discussions conducted at three selected schools. A factor analysis of questionnaire responses revealed four  factors explaining 43 percent of the variance: strategic action in the moral domain, social sensitivity, conformity, and emotional development. Questionnaire findings indicated that all groups attached great importance to moral development, with conformity considered slightly less important than other areas. Among students, girls viewed strategic action, social sensitivity, and emotional development as being more important than did boys. Vocational education students/parents viewed conformity as more important than did general secondary education students/parents. Parents' religious background and education were related to views of conformity. Students of non-Dutch origin viewed conformity as more important than students of Dutch origin. Group interviews indicated that students emphasized  formulating their own opinion, parents emphasized the relationship between strategic action and conformity, and teachers emphasized an openness to criticism. All groups indicated that they would like greater attention paid to moral development goals at school. (Contains 46 references.) (KB)",

        "description":"The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act and Illegal Immigration Reform and Responsibility Act of 1996 revised laws governing privacy and confidentiality of information that government agencies collect from immigrants during the benefits application process. Noting that these changes evoked confusion and anxiety in the immigrant community and deterred many families from seeking benefits, this issue brief helps child advocates understand changes in confidentiality, reporting, and verification requirements in order to help state decision makers create policies that maximize access to benefit and provide outreach to immigrant communities. Following an introduction outlining the critical role that child advocates can play in ensuring that state leaders  understand the parameters of the law, the brief details the four-step process to verify an applicant's immigration status: (1) determine if the program provides a federal public benefit; (2) determine whether the applicant is eligible for benefits under the programs' general eligibility requirements; (3) verify the applicant's status as a citizen, noncitizen national, or a qualified alien; and (4) verify eligibility based on requirements of the Welfare Act. The brief also details requirements for reporting to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, describes the model used by the Food Stamp Program, and discusses the confidentiality of information collected during eligibility determinations. Also noted is the application of requirements to nonprofit organizations. Finally, the brief  discusses possible roles of the child advocate. A call for action by child advocates and a resource and contact list conclude the brief. (Contains approximately 20 references.) (KB)",

This issue brief discusses the program and its importance as an approach to ameliorate the effects of welfare reform on struggling families. The brief describes the program and argues that it needs reforms in the welfare reform era. The brief details features of unemployment insurance programs that hurt low income families, including the dependence of eligibility on labor force attachment, involuntary job loss, and the unemployed person's availability for full time work. Also identified are opportunities and barriers to changing the program to better meet family needs and the use of  creative funding strategies in state programs. A table delineates the states providing unemployment insurance coverage for voluntary terminations caused by domestic circumstances and for dependent allowances. The brief concludes by noting that the need to move unemployment insurance to the child advocate's agenda is clear and that, through coalitions with organized labor and dialogue with business-related organizations, child advocates can urge state legislatures to make needed reforms to the unemployment insurance program.

Noting the importance of policymakers, advocates, service providers, and parents speaking out in support of children's need for the full range of necessary health care, this issue brief provides supporting information to use in encouraging states to offer comprehensive benefit packages. The brief focuses on the services considered to be &quot;additional&quot; or &quot;other&quot; in Title XXI: (1) mental health and substance abuse services; (2) ongoing therapies and rehabilitation; (3) dental care; (4) vision services; (5) hearing services; (6) family planning; and (7) home health care. Depending on the extent of the research  available on specific services, the following types of information are provided: (1) the short- and long-term effectiveness of services; (2) cost-benefit analyses of providing services; and (3) actuarial cost estimates of adding services to basic benefit packages. Also included in the brief is a delineation of the Title XXI coverage requirements for children's health insurance. The brief concludes by noting that it is critical that states designing separate children's health coverage go above and beyond the basic benefits that are required and that providing such coverage improves children's lives, avoids the needs for more costly interventions later, and is the right approach to ensure access to appropriate health care for the nation's children.

State innovations are presented in seven areas: (1) supporting children when federal benefits are unavailable; (2) ensuring that eligible children retain benefits; (3) supporting children as parents begin to work; (4) expanding alternative income supports; (5) supporting all low income children; (6) helping working families move up the career ladder;  and (7) monitoring the status of families.

Monitoring, defined as tracking a family's income, composition, and other social and economic indicators, is useful for illustrating trends and highlighting what is happening to children and families. The brief highlights issues that should be considered in developing a monitoring project: (1) envisioning the final product; (2) choosing a focus; (3) identifying and accessing the target population; (4) ensuring statistical validity; and (5)  identifying resources. Monitoring methodologies discussed in the brief are surveys, longitudinal tracking of families, focus groups, and the use of administrative data. Examples of various methodologies are highlighted in descriptions of individual state efforts. Also considered are issues related to selecting appropriate measures and maintaining credibility. Sample indicators are defined and operationalized. The brief also discusses the importance of communicating the project's results, including identifying target audiences, developing a message, connecting with the media, and disseminating the information.

In particular, parents' behaviors supporting peer activities of their children, parental educational attitudes, and parents' own social relationships are expected to be relevant for children's social integration into a network of friends as well as for children's feelings of loneliness. Data were collected on 109 mother-child dyads and 98 father-child dyads in Berlin, Germany. The children attended second- to fifth-grade classrooms. Findings revealed influences of parents' social relationships on children's peer relationships. Unexpectedly, the higher parents assessed the quality of their marital relationship, the fewer friendships their children  reported, suggesting an orientation to the family that excludes others. The number of parents' leisure-time friendships was positively associated with the number of children's friendships. Additionally, the leeway that mothers granted to their children for organizing activities with friends, and parents' knowledge of children's friends were positively related to children's friendships. Mothers' authoritarian educational style predicted children's feelings of loneliness. A model was proposed that combines direct influences of parents' relationships on children's social integration as well as indirect influences that are mediated by parenting. (Author/KB)",

        "description":"The views of teachers and directors in four Christian preschools and four Buddhist preschools are examined in this qualitative study of early childhood education in Japan. In Christian preschools, the guiding principle was that each child was a precious gift of God. This belief resulted in a play-oriented curriculum that maximized the choices available to children. Teachers also attempted to encourage children's creativity and their ability to formulate thoughts and express them to others. A particular focus was helping children appreciate each other as individuals and learn to form relationships based upon that appreciation. In Buddhist preschools, the curriculum was designed to strengthen children's virtue, intellect, and physical well-being. Activities were teacher structured,  with an emphasis on attaining literacy and numeracy skills. Lessons were delivered in a whole group context, with an emphasis on absorbing content rather than encouraging personal exploration and expression. The clear implications of these different religious perspectives suggest that similar analyses would be useful if undertaken in the United States, where very little research has been conducted on church-based preschools.

Recently, both countries adopted national preschool plans for children ages 1 to 5 years old. When comparing the two plans, the first noticeable difference is that the Norwegian approach gives teachers a detailed framework for their work with suggestions on content, methods to be used, and expected outcomes. In contrast, the Swedish plan is goal directed with a short introduction on the perspectives and values of children's learning and development. It contains almost nothing about the methods to be used. This article compares the two national plans in terms of their evolution, purpose, and content. The article also discusses how  the plans reflect theories of learning and knowledge formation. (Contains 60 references.) (Author/LLP)",

These factors include both historical and contemporary American views of early learning as reflected by government funding, early learning and teacher education field practices, professionalization of early childhood teachers and improvement of education departments, and public policy as manifested by teacher certification and accountability. The article suggests that with the hindsight gained from historical knowledge and a clear understanding of the factors that contribute to school readiness, we are better equipped to make the  first goal of today's educational reform a reality--that all children in America start school ready to learn.

This study focused on expectations held by parents-to-be at the outset of the pregnancy regarding the potential effects that the baby's arrival would have on various aspects of their lives. One year later, data were obtained about the real changes experienced by the parents. Participating in the study were 95 families studied longitudinally from the beginning of the mother's pregnancy until their children were 10 to 12 months old. Subjects differed in parity, educational level, and maternal employment status. Fathers and mothers were interviewed separately regarding their social network and social  support, marital relationship, division of domestic labor, expected father involvement in childrearing, and resources for facing parenthood. At a follow-up visit to their homes, parents were interviewed regarding the same issues, and they also noted their level of satisfaction with parenthood. Findings indicated that the actual impact of the arrival of a baby was anticipated only in a very general, nonspecific way and that the expectations held during pregnancy corresponded poorly with the actual situation parents experienced a year and a half later.

        "description":"Public discussion of American education centers on crisis and decline. In response to these sentiments, citizens are fast abandoning all forms of local control over schools. Schools are controlled by increasingly distant experts. Some people think that this new direction is necessary because the schools have failed academically. On the contrary, schools have failed because they have already become too distant, unfamiliar, and unfamilial. The growth of home-schooling is due not to rigid ideologies or parental fears of academic failure, but rather to an increasing crisis of human relationships, a lack of trust among fellow citizens, and a lack of a sense of shared belonging to a common public culture. In large, distant schools, parents feel unwelcome, teachers have no time or  opportunity to know their students, and students become alienated. When schools are organized sensibly, as communities, children respond by showing their best qualities. Democracy rests on relationships, and people must have early experiences of community if they are to learn and understand the workings of democracy. (SV)",

As part of an on-line dialogue extending from November 1998 to March 1999, the symposium linked on-line participants to panelists and participants in Burlington, Vermont, and six interactive cable television sites. The keynote speech, \"Our Challenge: To Set the Highest Possible National Standard for Human Relationships\" (Deborah W. Meier), discussed the web of relationships that makes every community a rich learning laboratory and the need for schools to be part of that web. Three issues were addressed by panelists and participants. First, since many communities are weak and impoverished in both  economic and social terms, are they capable of being responsible for students' education? Second, standards carry the danger of being exploited for other purposes or used to establish \"official knowledge.\" Who should set standards, who is the \"community,\" and whose standards should prevail? Third, what kind of school funding policies support or undercut the potential of locally developed standards, and how does the state's \"machinery of education\" affect the strength of communities? Participants then offered advice and recommendations to communities, educators, legislators, and policymakers. Appendices include the keynote speech and the Rural Challenge's position paper on academic standards and community control. (SV)",

This paper reviews the literature on the epidemiology of AIDS/HIV infection among Latina women, children, and adolescents and discusses the needs of Latinas regarding AIDS prevention education. Approximately a half million U.S. cases of AIDS had been reported through October 1995, of which women accounted for 11 percent. Hispanics and African Americans represented 21 and 53 percent, respectively, of cases among women. Intravenous drug use by self or partner was a major risk factor, particularly in the Northeast. Children under age 13 were usually infected via maternal transmission, and Hispanic children accounted for a  third of pediatric cases. Inner-city adolescents were also at increased risk for HIV infection related to high-risk sexual behaviors and drug abuse. Other risk factors for Latinas are poverty, lack of access to health care, inadequate prenatal care, culturally prescribed gender roles and attitudes, and socioeconomic and political disempowerment. Educational interventions must address the needs of Latinas within cultural context. Cultural norms may dictate that a woman appear sexually naive, making it difficult for her to negotiate safe sex practices. Development of peer support groups may be the best approach. Recommendations are offered for working with the Hispanic community. (Contains 27 references.) (SV)",

A university environment should be culturally inclusive and should welcome and validate the values of all its members in promoting optimal growth and learning. Equally important are the commitment and efforts of individuals in and around the community to be active resources for Chicano students. Cultural ambiance and  community commitment are interdependent and interwoven such that cultural ambiance cannot truly exist without community commitment, and commitment must be demonstrated by actions that modify traditional university norms, values, and perceptions. Cultural ambiance occurs within four domains: general university environment, student learning environment, classroom and curriculum environment, and faculty environment. Each of these domains is briefly discussed to contextualize the experiences of Chicano students. The roles of faculty, family, and community leaders in creating and maintaining a university community are described. Recommendations are offered in each domain. (Contains 37 references.) (SV)",

        "description":"Little attention has been given to institutional violence exercised by schools as a major stressor leading to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and high dropout rates among Latino students. Institutional violence is defined as the norms, values, and structures of institutions that exclude and discriminate against individuals of disadvantaged and culturally different groups, making their needs invisible. This paper describes a research project, an intervention strategy, and an educational approach that focus on the role of institutional violence in Latino student attrition, ways that institutional violence can be diminished, and the role of university scholars in bridging theory and practice. Focus groups on perceptions of neighborhood and institutional violence were conducted  with secondary school students, dropouts, parents, and teachers in Southwestern Detroit, and student participants completed the Children's PTSD Inventory. The intervention, Youth Helping Youth, addressed both academic and affective needs of students through a tutoring program plus a psychologist-facilitated discussion group for high-risk middle school students in a predominantly Latino school. Tutors for the intervention were provided by a community service learning course at the University of Michigan; a second course focused on the politics of language and cultural identity among U.S. Latinos. Course assessment examined the development of cultural competence among participants. Recommendations are offered for teacher education related to cultural competence and the effects of  institutional violence. (Contains 75 references.) (SV)",

The interviews covered participants' demographic and sociocultural characteristics, perceptions of their role and efficacy, knowledge of school-related activities, educational expectations for their child, perceptions of school climate, education-related support from families and friends, barriers to parental involvement, and reported levels of involvement. Regardless of acculturation level, more-educated mothers were more likely to view their participation as &quot;part of their job.&quot; However, for mothers with a high school education or greater, less acculturated mothers had higher levels of  self-efficacy with regard to their involvement and had higher expectations for their children than did more acculturated mothers. There was no evidence that the mothers found the school climate to be hostile or unreceptive. However, compared to their counterparts, less acculturated mothers and less educated mothers reported more barriers to their involvement and greater support from their spouses. Regardless of acculturation or education, Latina mothers participated in parental involvement activities ranging from &quot;basic obligations&quot; to &quot;involvement in school governance,&quot; but more-educated mothers engaged in activities more frequently.

The paper also describes many specific strategies for use by colleges and universities to recruit, retain, and graduate Native American students. Three sections cover strategies to improve recruitment, strategies to improve retention, and model programs and best practices. Recruitment geared towards minorities is different from the recruitment of Anglo students. Strategies include tailoring the admissions process to fit the needs of Native American culture, addressing bias in admission standards, beginning recruitment early, making recruiters aware of minority issues, advertising culturally  appropriate programs and support services, and involving Native communities in recruitment efforts. While recruiting minority students can be a challenge, retaining them in school can be even more difficult for institutions. Students face four main potential barriers that affect retention: financial need, the environment of the institution, student characteristics, and academic support. Many specific examples of programs that can aid in the retention of minority students are described. The section on model programs and best practices suggests that rather than reinvent the wheel, models that have been used previously and have reported positive outcomes can be replicated. Programs that have been implemented in North Dakota, California, New York, Arizona, Florida, and Ohio are highlighted.  (Contains 34 references.) (CDS)",

As part of this program, the National Science Foundation created the Arctic System Science Program (ARCSS). This document describes the ARCSS Human Dimensions of the Arctic System (HARC) initiative to consider how humans interact with physical and biological environmental change in the Arctic. HARC cuts across traditional social, biological, and physical science disciplines; employs varied methodologies; collects data across a broad range of time and spatial scales; and involves local people and communities in research design and implementation. Five fundamental research questions address the impacts of  human activity on arctic and global systems; types and sources of global change in the Arctic; effects of global changes on human societies in the Arctic; alternative approaches to current and future problems; and effects of arctic changes on people living outside the region. Ethical research issues include informed consent by individuals and communities, community involvement in research, the use and distribution of traditional indigenous knowledge, and intellectual property rights. HARC includes funding and guidelines for linking research with science education in arctic community schools.

Every 6 years, the Board's chairman (a state governor) appoints a blue-ribbon commission to analyze the condition of the South, develop regional objectives, and recommend approaches to regional problems. This report of the 1998 commission begins with an overview of the ways in which regional cooperation is working for economic development, as well as areas of concern: pockets of poverty in rural counties and inner cities and the need to improve the knowledge and skills of the work force. The next four chapters outline four interrelated goals and the strategies to address them: (1) building vibrant, secure communities; (2) building healthy  environments for children (investing in early childhood education, comprehensive prenatal care, and high-quality child care); (3) building quality education and world-class work skills (combining high standards with strong incentives for experimentation and high-quality teaching, implementing a continuous improvement program for elementary and secondary education); and (4) building broader economic partnerships focused on infrastructure, university research, the needs of inner cities and rural areas, entrepreneurship, international markets, and tourism. For each goal, recommendations outline what regional, state, and community partnerships can do. (Contains commissioner biographies, a list of institutional members, and an index.) (SV)",

The girls lived in two West Virginia communities (one rural, one urban). Most of the girls were poor; six were African American. Descriptions of the girls' neighborhoods and local communities show how these contexts provided serious obstacles and challenges to the girls' aspirations and at the same time were sources of powerful support and encouragement. All of the girls aspired to higher education and professional careers and aimed to realize those goals by deferring marriage and family commitments. Turning directly to issues of gender identity and voice, girls' perceptions of gender bias in school and community are  examined, along with the extent to which the bias informed their developing sense of themselves. Both Black and White girls often spoke about their personal identities with confidence and did not hesitate to express frustration and indignation about gender unfairness in their families and schools. In contrast, some African American girls were unwilling to acknowledge or confront racial injustices. This inconsistency is discussed in terms of schools' intolerance of confrontation and adults' advice to pursue strategies of &quot;resistance for survival&quot; over &quot;resistance for liberation.&quot; Programs targeting underserved populations must anticipate how they will address justice issues, which inevitably will arise.

This policy brief provides a brief overview of charter school characteristics and legislation, and discusses the concerns of policymakers in four states: Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. Following a definition of charter schools, viewpoints for and against charter schools are examined. A profile of charter schools points out that most are small, are nongraded or nontraditional in grade configuration, and have student demographics similar to other public schools. Governance is determined by state legislation, and the extent of charter school autonomy varies widely. Issues that policymakers must address in  charter school legislation are listed. Results of research on charter school effectiveness have been mixed. The following concerns are specific to the four-state region: the rural nature of much of the region, which creates problems related to facilities and transportation; issues related to equity of school funding; and the above-average number of special education students in the region. The status of charter school legislation in each of the states is described.

        "description":"This essay explains two ways in which &quot;the rural&quot; serves as context. The common way interprets the rural lifeworld as an impediment to certain projects and goals, thus framing &quot;the rural&quot; as a subjugated and diminished reality. The other way is called &quot;the rural circumstance&quot; in order to situate the rural lifeworld as a center of attention, not as something to get rid of. This focus reverses the implied agency so that cultivation of the purposes and commitments of such a lifeworld becomes the object of care. The argument draws on the work of Raymond Williams and Jurgen Habermas. Habermas proposes that institutions of capital &quot;suck meaning&quot; from the lifeworld--actual life-spaces of people, rural and otherwise. For Williams, it is essential for those who care about rural places to  imagine decent rural futures for them, i.e., to reconstruct and fashion new &quot;rural&quot; meanings. These decent futures would diverge sharply from those imagined from the cosmopolitan perspectives that dominate global firms, universities, and agencies of national will. Such decent futures would reflect a sensibility of place and community, but also struggle for economic justice and the common good. This essay contrasts some educational purposes that come from rural lifeworlds with those that are purveyed in rural schools from the cosmopolitan center, and addresses the issue of what might be &quot;properly&quot; rural. The question, however, is slippery. To imagine &quot;rural&quot; rural futures, it is important to consider many competing answers to the question, &quot;What is properly rural?&quot; (Contains 16  references.) (Author/SV)",

Nationally, dropping out is related to poverty, lack of parental support, drug abuse, learning disabilities, and a history of poor school performance. Dropouts are most likely to be male, Hispanic, low-income, and from the South. Hiawatha had an annual enrollment of 150-200 students, of which 98 percent were White and 6 percent were low-income. Recent graduating classes contained 29-56 students. The 11 dropouts from the past 3 years expressed satisfaction with the school and attributed their inability to stay in school to their own personal situation or lack of effort. None had any  suggestions for change that would have kept them in school. Of the 11, 4 had earned or were working on a diploma or GED. All were working or were in the military. The relationship of educational attainment to income is briefly discussed, as well as the possible relationship between dropping out and increases in the minimum wage. Recent changes at Hiawatha that may work to prevent dropouts include adoption of the 8-block (A/B days) scheduling model, increased student support services, a remediation program for grades 7-12, and after-school tutoring services.

        "description":"This document provides information about schools in Mexico and suggests ways that U.S. schools can use this information to improve education for Mexican and Mexican American students. Chapter 1 describes the Mexican educational system as a vantage point for understanding the expectations of Mexican parents in the United States. This chapter covers the organization of the Mexican school system, recent changes in administrative functions from the federal government to the states, textbooks, curriculum in the primaria (grades 1-6) and secundaria (grades 7-9), enrollments, program options and educational practices in the secundaria, distance education in rural areas, the media superior level (grades 10-12), and private schools. Chapter 2 discusses problems and special strategies in  rural areas, bilingual education for indigenous peoples, adult education and literacy campaigns, and 1995 illiteracy rates by age groups for the general and indigenous populations. Chapter 3 examines the development of binational educational cooperation and describes various national and state projects such as teacher and faculty exchanges, provision of Mexican textbooks and adult education materials to U.S. programs, student exchanges, immigrant services, and bilingual teacher education. Chapter 4 focuses on strengths of Mexican students, culturally relevant teacher strategies, ways to promote parent involvement, and implications of characteristics of effective schools. Appendices list school strategies relevant to Hispanic students, organizations that focus on helping Mexican and  Mexican-American students, and Web sites on Mexico.

        "description":"Principals' support for various approaches to educational planning were examined in rural and suburban schools in Ohio and West Virginia. It was expected that rational approaches to planning would be more prevalent in suburban than rural schools and in a state with more tightly coupled bureaucratic control (West Virginia) than a less tightly coupled state (Ohio). An instrument was developed that reliably measured principals' endorsement of rational and strategic planning (&quot;new technicist planning&quot;) and somewhat less reliably measured their support for traditional-consensual planning, incremental planning, organized anarchy, and reactive planning. A mail survey, using the instrument, received responses from 207 West Virginia principals and 441 Ohio principals. Results show that  new technicist planning was favored by suburban principals and by West Virginia principals. The traditional-consensual approach was favored by principals in suburban West Virginia and rural Ohio. Only rural West Virginia principals showed somewhat strong support for organized anarchy. Overall, the findings suggest that the particulars of locale (state and locale as they encompass and differentiate prevailing conditions) rather than locale per se (or uniquely) account for differences in principals' approaches to planning.

At the end of these educational programs, conducted by a scientist and an environmental educator, the participants were invited to get involved in the resolution of an environmental problem: that of the lack of vegetation in the village or that of a damaged stream. Following the positive response of all four groups, researchers employed narrative inquiry and semi-structured interview techniques in order to identify the educational and sociocultural factors motivating the desire for action. Three judges analyzed the data using a priori categories, with openness towards emerging categories. The principal motivational  factors identified were the visual observation of the problem, the reception of information, the impression that the task could be accomplished, the sense of solidarity, and the expectation of personal rewards following the action.

By pointing the spotlight directly upon the &quot;differences&quot; between people and groups and how these are both something one has to deal with in some way or other and something that provides possibilities for fruitful, creative life chances, the debate is continually forced open about how to define the &quot;three Es&quot; of market principles in education--economy, efficiency, and effectiveness--as a basis for resistance.

        "description":"Biogeography examines questions of organism inventory and pattern, organisms' interactions with the environment, and the processes that create and change inventory, pattern, and interactions. This learning module uses time series maps and simple simulation models to illustrate how human actions alter biological productivity patterns at local and global scales. The module also demonstrates how human alterations of land cover change the dispersal processes that affect the distribution patterns and diversity of organisms. It aims to engage students actively in problem solving, challenge them to think critically, invite them to participate in the process of scientific inquiry, and involve them in cooperative learning. The module is appropriate for use in any introductory and  intermediate undergraduate course that focuses on human-environment relationships; it includes more student activities and more suggested readings than most instructors will have time to cover in their courses, so instructors will need to select those readings and activities best suited to the local teaching conditions. Each section of the module presents background information for the specific topic, the instructor's guide to activities, student worksheets, and answers to activities. A glossary of terms, supporting materials, and readings conclude the module. (Contains 17 references.) (BT)",

This paper gives examples of how to promote critical thinking in physical education classes, transforming them into a forum of critical reflection about corporeal culture. Even though the main goal of physical education classes is to promote physical development and to develop life-long habits of doing physical activities on a regular basis, these classes need to reflect on, and be critical of, aspects of the culture in general and of corporeal culture more specifically. The goal of this paper is to give some examples of how to do this in practice. Physical education classes can foster intellectual development and critical thinking as students learn to understand and use corporeal  movement as a form of language; as they study the history of certain forms of sports, martial arts, dance, and gymnastics; and as they participate in discussions about the political implications that might be involved in these practices.

The research provides examples of and evidence why the arts should be more widely recognized for their current and potential contributions to the improvement of U.S. education. The experiences offered to many young people outside of the school environment are often limited in their purpose and resulting impact. They provide recreation, but no sense of creation. They provide recess, but no sense of success. Successful arts learning outside of schools can enhance the sense of accomplishment and well being among young people. Realizing the full potential of learning in and through the arts for all U.S.  children requires heroic acts from all segments of society. Involvement with the arts must be a basic part of the learning experiences. Chapter titles in this report include: (1) \"Involvement in the Arts and Human Development: General Involvement and Intensive Involvement in Music and Theater Arts\" (James S. Catterall; Richard Chapleau; John Iwanaga); (2) \"Imaginative Actuality: Learning in the Arts during the Nonschool Hours\" (Shirley Brice Heath; Adelma Roach); (3) \"Learning in and Through the Arts: Curriculum Implications\" (Judith Burton; Robert Horowitz; Hal Abeles); (4) \"Chicago Arts Partnerships in Education: Summary Evaluation\" (James S.

The rate of Internet use in the classroom has risen dramatically. From 1994 through 1998, the percentage of public schools with Internet connections jumped from 35 percent to 89 percent. This Digest summarizes ways that classroom teachers can combine the Internet with other instructional resources and methods. Web sites and ERIC resources are cited that offer ways to explore the Internet and to incorporate it into the social studies curriculum. Web site topics of interest are Civil War photographs, the women's suffrage movement, early ranching in Nevada, Gross National Product per capita data, key economic ratios, and long-term trends for  nations. Information and web site examples are given for creating a &quot;portal&quot; site for a school's social studies department. A portal is a World Wide Web site designed to serve as a main &quot;point of entry&quot; to the Web. It features an extensive catalog of Web sites and other Internet resources, a search engine, or both. The Digest describes virtual field trips as another way of using the resources available on the World Wide Web. Web sites for the White House, exhibitions of African and pre-Columbian Native American art from the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Egyptian pyramids offer opportunities for creating virtual field trips. Web site addresses for samples of published student work and social studies lesson plans also are included. (LB)",

Each student participating in the assessment received two 25-minute sections of questions. Most civics questions measured both knowledge and intellectual skills. In addition, some questions measured participatory skills and/or civic dispositions. This packet presents sample questions and student responses from the 1998 civics assessment for grades 4, 8, and 12. Student performance on each question is associated with one of the three achievement levels: (1) basic; (2) proficient; or (3) advanced. In addition, each question is accompanied by a table that indicates, for multiple-choice questions, the percentage of students within each  achievement level who responded correctly, and, for constructed-response questions, the percentage of students within each achievement level whose responses were scored &quot;acceptable&quot; or better. The correct answer for each multiple-choice question is indicated. The topics covered in the highlights include: (1) &quot;NAEP in a Nutshell&quot;; (2) &quot;The NAEP 1998 Civics Assessment&quot;; (3) &quot;Grade 4 Sample Questions and Responses&quot;; (4) &quot;Grade 8 Sample Questions and Response&quot;; (5) &quot;Grade 12 Sample Questions and Responses&quot;; (6) &quot;Results and Responses for the Nation&quot;; (7) &quot;School and Home Factors Related to Civics&quot;; and (8) &quot;Other Publications and Related Materials.&quot; (LB)",

In 1993, the General Assembly of the IEA decided to carry out a two phase study of civic education. The goal of the two phase study was to identify and examine in a comparative framework the ways in which young people are prepared for their roles as citizens in democracies and societies aspiring to democracy. Both phases of the study were designed to provide information regarding 15 questions of interest to policymakers and educators. The three content domains covered in the study were: (1) democracy, democratic institutions, and citizenship; (2) national identity and international relations; and (3) social  cohesion and diversity (including an understanding of discrimination). Phase 1 of the study was more qualitative and used interviews with experts on civic education, analyzed curriculum frameworks, national standards, and textbooks, and gathered information from focus groups. Twelve common themes were identified including: (1) there is a common core of content topics across countries; and (2) social diversity is an area of concern in nearly all countries participating in the study. Phase 2 of the study will analyze test data from 120,000 students aged 14 and 17-18 from the participating countries. The test instrument includes items about democratic principles, citizenship, political engagement, fact based instruction, and classroom climates. Teacher and school questionnaires also are to  be administered. The release of the Phase 2 report will be in early 2001. (JH)",

Teachers can enhance children's historical understanding by using instructional strategies that place a particular event or time period within the context of a broader framework of time. The history fair, a seven-week unit created by a fifth-grade teacher to teach research skills, illustrates the connection between historical fiction and nonfiction and challenges  students to demonstrate their learning in a public forum as they become experts on topics that interest them.

Researchers administered a survey with open-ended questions to a sample of 54 teachers in a mideast Chinese urban school district. The study investigated their responses on issues related to the functions and benefits of having small classes for both teachers and students. Findings indicated that the Chinese urban teachers preferred teaching small classes, perceiving small class size as a beneficial factor not directly related to student achievement. They believed that small classes facilitated more individualized help from teachers, more student-teacher interactions, better classroom management, and a reduced teacher workload. They also believed in teachers encouraging and creating  competition among students, which they regarded as important for students in large classes to succeed. Some cultural differences were also found. (Contains 19 references.) (SM)",

One school was in a very poor, mountainous area, and the other school was in a very large city. Both used the national curriculum and the same set of teaching materials. Researchers used ethnographic methods to collect data. Over 4 weeks, they conducted formal and informal interviews with teachers and principals, chatted with students, observed lessons, collected in-house curriculum documents (e.g., lesson plans and work schemes), and attended staff meetings and subject panel meetings. Results indicated that teachers in both areas closely followed the requirements of the textbooks and suggestions of the teacher reference book. Teachers had a  strong influence on how the subject was planned and delivered. Their decisions were based on professional knowledge, educational beliefs, and the public examination. There were some marked differences between urban and rural schools in the way teachers adapted the curriculum and teaching materials. There were obvious differences in terms of school culture between the two areas. Teacher development was crucial to successful curriculum change. (Contains 11 references.) (SM)",

The study also investigated the impact of collaboration on activity completion rates and teacher performance measured by objective tests. The treatment was an interactive web-based course designed to enhance the collaborative teaching and learning communities of participating educators as they acquired Internet skills. Participants had access to chats and were members of two course-related mailing lists. They completed a pretest that assessed their Internet skills in the areas of searching and using e-mail. Following the pretest, they completed  tutorials specific to these skill areas; then they completed a posttest. The study used two instruments, the \"Stages of Concern Instrument: Attitudes Toward the Internet\" and a criterion-reference performance test. Researchers logged use of mailing lists and Internet chats to measure engagement in Internet-based communication as a collaborative tool. Data analysis indicated that attitudes toward collaboration did not affect test performance, though there was a relationship between attitudes toward collaboration and use of Internet-based communication.

The paper begins by outlining the commonly accepted four-part mission and the characteristics of PDSs; then it summarizes some of what is known about PDS achievements and effectiveness. The paper also examines what is not known about PDSs, including whether PDS work benefits children, whether PDSs increase teacher retention and/or performance, what it costs to operate a PDS, whether PDSs promote and advance equity for all learners, and whether PDSs enable the participation of students, families, and communities in decision making. Finally, the paper uses the discussion of what is known and not  known as a lens through which to examine the question of whether it is necessary to refocus, clarify, and possibly modify the destination of PDS work. In considering that question, the paper attempts to situate the question within the context of broad issues of purpose, responsibility, and accountability in PDS work. (Contains 37 references.)

The program benchmarks are a response to the national movement toward standards to ensure teacher effectiveness. They serve as checkpoints to assess students' progress toward developing teaching effectiveness. The paper briefly describes the Elementary Education Program, its benchmarks, and the mentoring process used in the pilot project. A formal evaluation design of the pilot project used a pretest-posttest nonequivalent control group design, which was supplemented by an informal evaluation process. Pre-program questionnaires were given to elementary education majors  who participated in the benchmarks and mentoring process and to control group students. The pre-program questionnaires showed no significant differences between the two groups. A summary of questionnaire and informal evaluation results are reported. Initial findings identify areas for program improvement and indicate that the mentoring process is valuable to students. From the findings, recommendations were made. (Contains 18 references.)

This report examines the problem using an algebraic model with no econometric analysis. It uses age-specific continuation rates of teachers from several different Schools and Staffing Surveys (SASS) of the National Center for Education Statistics to predict how many teachers will continue teaching from one year to another. The demand for teachers is taken as exogenous, and several scenarios are examined. The report assumes that the supply will meet the demand and that the age distribution of new teachers will be the same as the 1993-94 SASS distribution. Depending on the assumptions made,  projections for the number of newly hired public school teachers needed by 2008-09 ranges from 1.7 million to 2.7 million. Some of these newly hired teachers will be needed to replace those leaving the profession, and others will be needed as enrollments continue to increase.

In the third section, these issues (realities and myths) are examined in relation to the experience of reforming 17 teacher education institutions in Chile. The article finishes with reference to lessons  and open questions arising from this experience of change. (Contains 27 references.) (Author/SM)",

        "description":"Teacher training across the world has typically assumed a functionalist role in preparing individuals to stand in front of children in classrooms and impart acceptable knowledge. The limitations of this approach have led, in recent years, to the development of new kinds of teacher education which reorient the role of the teacher in powerful ways. This article introduces several transformative approaches to teacher education internationally. It also seeks to extend the notion of transformative teacher education. Building on the aspirations of the Culture of Peace Program initiated by UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization), the paper discusses how teacher education might make a more deliberate contribution to the development of a culture of  peace. The paper presents the characteristics of three innovative teacher education programs (in Bolivia, Namibia, and Egypt). Grounding the discussion in the movement from a mechanistic to a holistic world view, the paper uses insights from peace education, conflict transformation, and social capital theory to suggest potential ways in which teacher education might become a peace building enterprise.

It examined student teachers' beliefs when they first entered the program and noted characteristics of the beliefs. Ten student teachers from a 1-year PGDE (secondary) course and 10 student teachers from a 2-year TC program participated. Data were collected via semi-structured interviews regarding: important aspects of education, the teacher's role, the learner's role, learning difficulties of learners, how subject matter should be taught in schools, and important factors for successful teaching and learning. Student teachers have developed their beliefs in teaching and learning before entering  their initial teacher training program. The content of their beliefs was closely related to their past experiences. The content formed a network of belief systems of teaching and learning in different dimensions. Student teachers' beliefs seemed deeply rooted in their environment and culture. Their beliefs reflected two distinctive types of views on teaching and learning: ideal and reality. The two groups of student teachers differed in their beliefs about teaching and learning. TC students were not as confident as PGDE student teachers in subject matter knowledge. They were also younger and less experienced. (Contains 10 references.) (SM)",

Participants were 260 teachers and 40 principals from random samples of schools in each of three education districts in South Africa. Researchers administered a closed questionnaire that asked the teachers and principals to indicate their actual and desired participation in each of a list of management activities on a Likert-type scale. Some of the management activities included: creating the school budget, making a year-long plan of school activities, setting standards for teacher evaluation, orienting new students, setting conduct rules for teachers, recruiting new teachers, determining school goals and objectives, inducting new teachers, determining plans to meet school goals, guiding teachers who  shared a subject/department team, and setting standards for amount of written work and tasks. The response rate to the survey was 74.6 percent for teachers and 95 percent for principals. According to the results, teachers reported participation deprivation across the board in all management activities. Teachers had a high level of deprivation on most of the activities and a medium level of deprivation on only four of the items. (Contains 30 references.) (SM)",

Part 1 asked for personal information. Part 2 had eight sections that discussed: organizational strategies used in the classroom; frequency of using classroom organizational strategies in four core subjects; the basis of grouping for small group work; group size; how group tasks were organized; social skills of working in groups; factors that might influence respondents' decisions to use various classroom organizational strategies; and examples of successful and unsuccessful use of group work in teaching. Four respondents also completed interviews after completing the questionnaire. Students from the same  school responded in writing to a pair of cartoon pictures, discussing what they thought groups of children in pictures with and without teachers were saying. Results indicated that teachers' attitudes toward group work were generally positive. Relatively more teachers spent half of their teaching time in group work. Teachers had reservations about using group work because there were so many school restraints (e.g., class size and limited time). Not all teachers used heterogeneous grouping or taught group social skills. The childrens' drawings suggested that teachers being present did not affect the kinds of conversations children had. Children appeared to prefer group work. (Contains 58 references.) (SM)",

This family of models is characterized by point-asymmetric item characteristic curves (ICCs). This paper introduces the LPEF family, and discusses its usefulness in educational measurement and the implications of its use. Equations are given for the LPEF model. Two contrasting applications of the LPEF are discussed. One is an application in cognitive ability measurement for a situation in which the same task is assigned to two or more groups of individuals that differ in ability levels. With the LPEF, procedures of evaluation in each examination can be adjusted to suit each group. The other application is in personality or attitude measurement. Because models  in the LPEF family are three-parameter models, it is advisable to use a nonparametric method to estimate the ICCs and then parameterize each of the resulting ICCs. (SLD)",

Data from 455 freshmen were used in the analysis. Participants completed measures of student goals, facilitative skills, and learning and thinking styles. Pre-college and freshman achievement were determined, and academic motivation, locus of control, study skills, concentration, and self-efficacy were generated from the administered measures. Structural equation modeling procedures were used to identify theoretical relations and to test the plausibility of a causal framework. Results reveal a nonlinear relationship between psychological variables such as academic motivation, locus of control, and self-efficacy, and freshman  academic achievement. Being academically motivated, preferring internal attributions for academic outcomes, and having confidence in one's ability to do well in college do not directly result in good academic performance in the freshman year. Findings imply that other factors, such as adequate academic preparation, adjustment to instructional styles and the college environment, and the ability to prioritize study are necessary to help freshmen cope with academic challenges in the freshman year.

This important form of self-regulation was studied among college students to determine how it serves to sustain effort over time in the face of obstacles. The focus in this review was on the links between delay and students' motivational tendencies and the use of learning strategies that serve to facilitate self-regulation. ADOG is discussed in view of the macro-analytic model of W. Mischel's cognitive-affective personality system. It is suggested that future research on delay as a learning process should consider B. Zimmerman's micro-analytic model of  self-regulated learning cycle phases. The conceptual status and assessment of delay of gratification and implications for teaching and learning are discussed.

One of the leading critics is D. Phillips (1993, 1996), who stresses the importance of ascertaining the correct narrative or narratives and asserts that narrative needs to be &quot;epistemically respectable.&quot; Conflict arises from different views of the researcher's &quot;voice&quot; in narrative research and from differing conceptions of the &quot;truth.&quot; New narrative research can be said to share the epistemological presuppositions of postfoundationalism, and this  postfoundationalism can be distinguished from relativism or subjectivism. J. O'Dea (1994) has developed a notion of truth that can help narrative research gain epistemic respectability. Narrative researchers must render the realities of classroom practice faithfully and precisely.

It says that there is no position outside of our language (or our form of life) that allows us to check whether statements we make about reality are true or false. This is, however, not the same as relativism or subjectivism. The acknowledgment of the groundlessness of knowledge does not mean that anything goes or that there are no constraints on what can be said. A narrative account can be seen as an interpretation. The narrative is a construction, and more than one interpretation is possible. How then is the interpretation to be judged? Several authors have proposed possible criteria, but there are limits to the explication of the criteria for judging an  interpretation. Ultimately the interpretation must be accepted by a relevant community of researchers. The interpretation must offer sufficient indications that the researchers have done justice to the situation, and this rests on the knowledge of the community of researchers.

They store information as a collection of thematic layers or datasets that can be linked by geography, and they serve as tools to analyze and map data in support of the decision-making process. Used optimally, GIS allow the visualization and analysis of information in new ways. Two situations illustrate the use of GIS in Toronto. The first is using GIS as an effective communication tool in the development of school profiles that included community maps. The second example is the use of GIS to  identify high-performing and low-performing schools on an assessment. In the highly diverse Toronto school board area, GIS is a valuable tool to visualize and interpret data. (Contains 11 figures.) (SLD)",

        "description":"The effect of rapid feedback for a state writing assessment on subsequent writing performance was investigated. In addition, the agreement between teachers' scores for the state writing assessment and state department scores was analyzed. Eighth grade English teachers (n=8) were trained in analytic trait scoring of writing assessments. They then scored their own students' state writing assessments soon after administration of the assessment. Teachers also scored assessments for a partner teacher's class. Normally, scores would not be available to teachers for several weeks following the assessment. A parallel writing assessment was administered to the classes of the eight participating teachers and to eight control classes. Results show good agreement between the teachers' scores  and the scores assigned by the state department. There was fair agreement (76%) on the adequate-inadequate designation of student writing between the teachers and the state department. There was no difference between the writing performance for students of project teachers and students in the control classes. Teachers thought that the writing assessment was useful and that it would be more useful if results were received earlier in the school year. An appendix contains the teacher questionnaire.

Bloom and others, Eds., 1956). The new edition will be grounded in the collective wisdom of the original &quot;Handbook,&quot; but will incorporate contextual and conceptual changes that have taken place since its publication. Like the original, the new handbook will contain five chapters describing the background, structure, and implications of the revised taxonomy; but the second section, instead of containing sample objectives and test items, will contain vignettes illustrating applications of the revised taxonomy in schools. The new edition will make a distinction between  knowledge as the process of recall and knowledge as the content that is recalled, designating the first category of the cognitive process dimensions as &quot;remember.&quot; Cognitive processes will be conceptualized somewhat differently, with the acknowledgment of a broader range of contextual factors that influence learning and the use of cognitive processes. Three implications of the expected changes are noted. First is the importance of diversity in educational assessment. Another aspect is considering the relationships among tasks in designing assessment; and still another is the realization that the structure of the taxonomy is more likely to be evident in the scoring rubric than in the tasks themselves. The new &quot;Handbook&quot; is a work in progress, and the revised taxonomy has yet to be  completed. It is not yet known how learning, curriculum, instruction, and assessment will interface in the final version. (SLD)",

The paper then reviews research results regarding the technical quality and consequences of using this new form of assessment for large-scale accountability purposes and concludes with implications for future practice. The 1990s have witnessed an explosion of interest in performance assessment in the United States as a policy tool to support accountability and school improvement. In the unique environment of the United States, which values the efficiency and psychometric qualities of multiple-choice testing and fears the litigation that might accompany high-stakes assessments that do not meet  technical standards, states, school districts, and others have focused on technical efforts to bring alternative assessment to reality. With appropriate professional development and supportive local contexts, new assessment can support meaningful change and improvement of educational practices. (Contains 113 references.) (SLD)",

Classroom assessments are built on clear goals and criteria for quality work so that they can help teachers guide students. A parent should expect that classroom assessments will be clear and reflect what is important in the class. They should provide specific information about what students are learning, and they should use different assessment strategies. Teachers should provide specific and useful feedback, and assessments should focus on thinking and understanding as well as having  correct answers.

Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia will use The Praxis Series: Professional Assessments for Beginning Teachers developed by the Educational Testing Services for teacher licensure as of fall 1998. To help inform policy decisions about using Praxis results to evaluate teacher education programs, analyses of Praxis score data from the 1996-97 testing year were conducted. The report examines the possible effects of proposals to eliminate the eligibility for certain federal funding of institutions of teacher education that fail to meet a specified pass rate on state teacher licensing  examinations for their graduates. The report describes the Praxis I assessments of basic skills in reading, writing, and mathematics, and the nearly 140 Praxis II subject assessments offered in more than 50 content areas. It discusses issues related to state qualifying scores and variations among them and describes state and institutional pass rates, with particular attention to institutions with fewer than 10 students taking a test. Data are provided to illustrate the effects of the proposed pass rate requirements and the first attempted provision. The report concludes with some guidelines, concerns, and cautions that should be considered in the policy debates. It is recommended that policymakers exercise caution in requiring minimum pass rates for institutions. The guidelines for the  Praxis assessments point out that institutional efficacy is indicated by many factors, only one of which is the performance of graduates on licensing examinations. (SLD)",

In its second year of operation, 1999, the program was offered at six sites. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected at each of the sites, including the results of a developmental reading assessment. The S.O.A.R. program served 1,249 students, representing 52 AISD schools (31 Title I and 21 non-Title I) and 2 private schools. The students were of diverse ethnicity. During the program, 89% of students with valid pretest and posttest scores advanced  one or more reading levels, with the greatest mean gains at grade 2. Attending for at least 17 days appeared to have a positive effect on student gains. Teachers expressed strong support for the program's balanced literacy approach and indicated their willingness to use the strategies learned from the program when they returned to their regular classrooms.

Students at non-Title I schools and at district schools as a whole outperform students at Title I schools, but when the passing rates for disaggregated groups are examined, the scores for economically disadvantaged, Hispanic, and African American students in Title I elementary schools approach the scores for students in those groups in non-Title I schools. Nine of the AISD Title I schools were rated &quot;Low Performing&quot; by the Texas Education Agency in the 1998-99 school year (six for  academics and three secondary schools for dropout rates).

The naturalistic study of interaction in classrooms suggests the possibility of a mathematical argumentation to which students have access by the practice of discussions ruled by socio-mathematical norms that would emerge from the interactions between teacher and student. In such an approach, the construction of a mathematical rationality and argumentation are tightly connected. While there may be no such thing as &quot;mathematical argumentation,&quot; there is argumentation in mathematics.

The information, taken from the Common Core of Data (CCD) survey system, is presented in the body of the report, with supplementary detailed tables in Appendix A. The CCD contains data provided voluntarily each year by the education agencies of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Department of Defense Dependents Schools (overseas), and five outlying areas. During the 1995-96 school year, there were more than 16,000 local education agencies in these regions, and almost 15,000 were regular school districts directly responsible for free, public education. There  were about 45 million public school students in 1995-96. Of these, two-thirds were White, non-Hispanic; about one in six was Black; and about one in seven was Hispanic. The almost 2.6 million teachers in this school year accounted for more than half of the almost 5 million local education employees. Information is also provided about educational finance, including average expenditures. Four appendixes contain supplementary and detailed tables, information about the CCD, and a glossary.

It includes data from 246 public schools and 7 school districts for the 1996-97 school year. In 1996-97, enrollment growth, which had exceeded 1.5% for 5 years, declined sharply to 1%. Dropout rates for students in grades 9 through 12 averaged 5% per year. The number of students with special needs increased more rapidly than the population of students at large. In 1987-88, Hawaii ranked 48th among the states in pupil-to-teacher ratio, but by 1992-93, Hawaii had tied for 35th place. However, fiscal constraints beginning the following year halted progress on this educational indicator. Hawaii now ranks first among the states in tax  collections per capita, but is last in the percentage of state and local revenue allocated to public schools. Over 86% of Hawaii's schools have committed to the process of implementing school-based management, and 71% have already implemented school-based management.

The Master of Education program at Indiana Wesleyan University, Marion, Indiana was designed for teachers seeking an advanced degree with a focus on curriculum and instruction. Courses were offered to cohorts at off-campus locations around the state as daylong Saturday workshops. The primary instructional design was student-centered, using cooperative and interactive learning strategies for students in groups of two or three. Evidence was collected from 740 graduates of the program and 56 of their employers over a  2-year period. Fifty current participants were also interviewed in focus groups. Responses to the graduate and employer surveys indicated that cognitive growth did occur for graduates of the program. Students reported growth in their ability to demonstrate instructional effectiveness, manage classroom learning, and be a more reflective practitioner. Administrators reported employees' growth in their abilities to use varied resources, methods and technology, and teaching skills. Responses of both graduates and administrators support the conclusion that cooperative strategies in this program contributed to cognitive and affective growth. (Contains 28 references.) (SLD)",

This paper considers several aspects of the approach used in this class to teach interpretive research methods. These approaches include: (1) the introduction of five different research traditions recognized as qualitative; (2) the assignment of a class research project; and (3) the absence of either a disciplinary perspective or background readings to guide the research project. The paper is informed by observations in class, conversations with students and other instructors, and the review of student research papers. The implications for teaching qualitative methods are discussed. The study suggests that when a novice researcher proceeds without a grounding in a relevant  discipline or theoretical perspective, she may have difficulty bounding the case under study. In the absence of theory, novice researchers need to be able to rely on their personal response to their field experiences and on careful examination of those responses in order to focus their attention on arguments they care about.

In this study, additional tools were developed for making external comparisons with respect to achievement, and tools were added for assessing fiscal policy and efficiency. Data from school years 1993-94 through 1995-96 were used for 101 school districts and their schools in the western part of New York state. Two types of outcome measures were developed: average student achievement, measured by four factor scores at the district level and six average scores at the school level, and average school and district effect, estimated through a multiple regression procedure that removes the covariation of family and environmental characteristics from the student achievement  scores. School district efficiency was measured through a linear programming technique known as data envelopment analysis. Standard scores were developed and used to prepare benchmarking charts for analyzing student performance on 15 performance measures at the school level. As with most studies of relationships between student outcomes and expenditures, there was no statistically significant correlation between school district effect and expenditure. Adding school district effect and school district efficiency to the outcome usually considered in school comparisons, academic achievement, highlights the differences in challenges that school districts face, and shows that many districts, not normally recognized for their effectiveness, are making important contributions to the intellectual  development of their students. Three appendixes contain score charts. (Contains 7 tables, 41 figures, and 68 references.) (SLD)",

Of particular interest was the extent to which the noncognitive variables, over and above course work taken, grades earned, and high school attended, reduce racial/ethnic or gender differences in mean ACT scores. The sample for the study included 5,489 ACT-tested students from 106 high schools who completed a survey about their perceptions of themselves, their homes, and their school environment. Using stepwise multiple regression, from 34% to 59% of the variance in ACT scores could be explained by the high school academic variables (high school  grade average, core mathematics and science courses taken) and high school attended. Students' noncognitive characteristics (education-related factors, time spent on selected activities, background characteristics, and students' perceptions of themselves) explained about 15% additional variance in ACT scores, over and above grade average and course work taken. Race/ethnicity or gender explained only 1% to 2% of additional variance, over and above the other variables considered. Additional analyses revealed differences between African American and Caucasian American students in the types of variables most strongly related to their ACT scores. Two appendixes contain a survey of ACT-tested students and weighted descriptive statistics for all variables in the full models. (Contains 6 tables,  3 figures, and 17 references.) (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"In 1998, fourth graders participated in the mathematics component of the Washington Assessment of Student Learning for the second year. A study of the results was conducted to determine which districts and schools had more students meeting the state's mathematics standards and how improved achievement came about. Data was gathered through interviews of education leaders in 53 buildings and 20 school districts that showed significant gains in the percentage of fourth graders meeting or exceeding the mathematics standards. There was no single curriculum, test, strategy, or material that helped the successful schools and districts increase the number of students meeting the standards. The difference was made through the deliberate efforts of teachers and administrators to coordinate  and strengthen all the pieces of a comprehensive program. Insights from participants are summarized. Five appendixes contain supplemental data about the school and district programs. (SLD)",

        "description":"Latent growth modeling (LGM) has emerged as a flexible analytic technique for modeling change over time because it can describe individual variability in terms of initial status and in growth. LGM methodology can also provide a means for testing the contribution of other variables in order to explain variability in those initial levels and growth trajectories. This paper illustrates the use of LGM as an analytical tool in program evaluation. Specifically, a hypothetical evaluation of a high school drug use prevention program was used to demonstrate: (1) how LGM methodology can be used to assess the longitudinal impact of a prevention program by comparing the treatment to a control group in terms of individual variability in initial status and rate of change; and (2) how  predictors of initial status and growth selected on the basis of a particular program theory can be incorporated in the model to explain how the program produced an effect across time. Some advantages and limitations of using LGM in program evaluation are highlighted. (Contains 3 figures and 29 references.) (Author/SLD)",

The evaluation occurred with an after school program that provides services to Chinese immigrant youth and their families, along with a creative, nontraditional learner environment for children between the ages of 5 and 14. A nonparticipatory and nondemocratic organizational climate was evident early on and reflected throughout the evaluation process. Teachers were not included in evaluation planning, and there was an evident lack of communication between the director  and her staff. Staff meetings and staff journal writing increased the sense of participation, but the biggest success as transformative participatory evaluators was in working with the director to see the value of staff feedback.

Cluster evaluation is illustrated through the description of an initiative funded by the W. K. Kellogg Foundation called the Leadership for Institutional Change (LINC) program. LINC seeks to provide support and guidance for new leadership models in higher education among land grant universities. Cluster evaluators were identified rather early in the LINC process, but only after the extensive needs analysis had been conducted. The cluster evaluator did have some input into the process of initiative design. Experiences from the LINC initiative and other cluster evaluations have  resulted in a proposed cluster evaluation framework, which contains the following elements: (1) evaluate the planning context and client system; (2) assess the needs assessment; (3) evaluate and refine the program objectives; and (4) assess the proposed objectives and action plans.

With two predictors, this relationship becomes planar, and with three or more predictors, this relationship becomes hyper planar.

An analytical model is suggested that demonstrates the linear progress of evaluation and  performance data from program goals to specific activities, through performance measurement, to analysis and interpretation of the results and necessary corrective actions.

A participatory-research approach was selected for the evaluation and assessment of the PR-SSI in general and for the assessment of student academic achievement in particular. Triangulation of results has been a major element of the design from the beginning of the reform. Two different versions of the PR-SSI's model were developed. The evolution of the first and second versions show that considerable organizational learning  took place within the PR-SSI. The final model, which incorporates information from the Third International Mathematics and Science Study and the engagement of teachers and administrators, challenges traditional notions of participant involvement in evaluation because it requires direct contributions to use results to improve teaching and learning and the teamwork of evaluators and content specialists to lead the self-assessment process.

One advantage then is that the theories and processes of teaching and learning, inherent in participatory evaluation, are present in the training and everyday activities of the educator. However, the literature on participatory evaluation has neglected to take full advantage of this parallel (particularly when educators are the primary stakeholders). As evaluators working with educators, these researchers see it as part of their responsibility to ensure that this parallel is  highlighted and understood. By critically examining the theories and practices of participatory evaluation and constructivism, they attempt to demonstrate how these parallels can lead to increased understanding and utilization. In addition, examples are taken from actual evaluations to discuss methods and provide recommendations for taking advantage of these parallels to improve the theory and practice of participatory evaluation in general.

The computation of a total profile score for these items resulted in marked improvement of the profile's internal reliability (alpha=.89). Total scores were significantly different based on sex (p&lt;.01), age, and education level of these drivers (p&lt;.001). Total profile scores were significantly related to past accident and violation experience, with negative attitudes  increasing as the number of self-reported incidents decreased (p&lt;.001). Instructional and evaluation implications are discussed. (Contains 1 table and 12 references.) (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"This paper describes a tool-and-result methodological approach to the practice and evaluation of an urban community development and gardening project with homeless youth. Over 9 months, at least 40 homeless children and teenagers were involved in the program, and approximately 15 were core participants. The paper critically examines the role of evaluation and assessment with a transient population and discusses how these methods helped to transform leaving into an opportunity to celebrate Public history. As young people engaged in community development and gardening, the collective history was documented through photographs, video, writings, drawings, and interviews. In this context, the documentation of the collective history served both as an artifact to leave behind and  memorabilia to take forward. As youth and adults created the tools of the evaluation simultaneously with the project, the evaluation tools became part of the result. The paper addresses the conceptual and theoretical framework of tool-and-result methodology, its challenge to Western scientific frameworks, and its effectiveness for transforming environments of learning and development and empowering those who transform them.

FAST uses tested family therapy principles, delinquency and substance-abuse strategies, psychiatric techniques, family systems theory, and group dynamics to give parents and children an opportunity to spend time together as they participate in the community. Most communities identify children who exhibit multiple risk factors, but parents can refer themselves to FAST. FAST uses a nonexperimental pretest-posttest evaluation design that focuses on initial outcomes and protective factors developed during the eight weekly sessions. Collaborative teams in Canada gathered evaluation data for 27 FAST programs  from 15 elementary schools. The families of at least 212 children graduated from the program. Aggregate evaluation results indicate that these 27 FAST program cycles successfully achieved the immediate outcomes associated with the program. Parents and teachers reported statistically significant decreases in the child behavior problems, and families reported increased cohesion and maintained adaptability scores in the normal range. Qualitative responses on the program evaluation forms completed by family members indicated that program experiences were consistent with program goals. (SLD)",

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to derive optimal rules for sequential mastery tests. In a sequential mastery test, the decision is to classify a subject as a master or a nonmaster, or to continue sampling and administering another random test item. The framework of minimax sequential decision theory (minimum information approach) is used; that is, optimal rules are obtained by minimizing the maximum expected losses associated with all possible decision rules at each stage of sampling. The binomial model is assumed for the probability of a correct response given the true level of functioning, whereas threshold loss is adopted for the loss function involved. Monotonicity conditions are derived, that is, conditions sufficient for optimal rules to be in the form of sequential cutting  scores. The paper concludes with a simulation study in which the minimax sequential strategy is compared with other procedures that exist for similar classification decisions in the literature.

Several person-fit statistics for detecting nonfitting score patterns for paper-and-pencil tests have been proposed. In the context of computerized adaptive tests (CAT), the use of person-fit analysis has hardly been explored. In this study, new person-fit statistics are proposed, and critical values for these statistics are derived from existing statistical theory. Statistics are proposed that are sensitive to runs of correct or incorrect item scores and are based on all items administered in a CAT or based on subsets of items, using observed and expected item scores and using cumulative sum (CUSUM) procedures. The theoretical and empirical  distributions of the statistics are compared and detection rates are investigated. Results show that the nominal and empirical Type I error rates are comparable for CUSUM procedures when the number of items in each subset and the number of measurement points are not too small. Detection rates of CUSUM procedures were superior to other fit statistics. Applications of the statistics are discussed. (Contains 5 tables and 21 references.) (Author/SLD)",

Good research practice requires that both should be taken into consideration to make sound quantitative decisions. A Monte Carlo simulation experiment was conducted, and a three-factor crossed design, with 500 replications within each cell, was implemented in the simulation. The sampling variability of two popular effect sizes (\"d\" and \"R squared\") was empirically obtained under different data conditions. It is shown empirically that there is considerable variability of sample effect size measure, and the extent of sampling variability of effect size measures is strongly influenced by sample size. Although  that which is statistically significant may not be practically meaningful, that which appears to be a practically meaningful effect size could occur by chance (i.e., sampling error), thus not trustworthy. It is pointed out that statistical significance testing and effect size measurement serve different purposes, and the sole reliance on either may be misleading. Some practical guidelines are recommended for combining statistical significance testing and effect size measure for making decisions in quantitative analysis.

        "description":"This digest highlights some of the findings of the largest study of home schooling conducted to date (L. Rudner, 1999). For this study, 20,760 students in 11,930 families provided useable questionnaires and corresponding achievement test data. Home schooling parents had more formal education than parents in the general population, and many had been formally trained as teachers. The median income for home school families was significantly higher than that of all families with children in the United States. Almost 25% of home school students were enrolled one or more grades above their age-level peers in public and private schools. The achievement test scores of home school students were exceptionally high, with the median scores for every subtest at every grade well above those of  public and Catholic/private school students. Some limitations of the study are noted. Home school students and their families are not a cross-section of the U.S. population. The act of home schooling distinguishes this group in terms of exceptionally strong commitment to education and children. In addition, reported differences between groups do not control for background differences and cannot be attributed to the type of school a child attends. The study does not demonstrate that home schooling is superior to public or private schools, but it does show that a large group of parents choosing to make the commitment to home schooling have been able to provide a very successful academic environment.

In order to reach evaluative conclusions it is usually necessary to establish or identify factual promises and value premises. To obtain the required kind of overall evaluative conclusion, it is typically necessary to combine all the premises, of which there may be several hundred, through what is called the &quot;internal synthesis process.&quot; From psychology, evaluators frequently encounter premises about maturational rates, cognitive processes, or leadership research. Eight applied fields of evaluation are of particular importance. The &quot;Big Six&quot; are the fields of program, personnel, performance, policy, proposal, and product evaluation. The &quot;Super Two&quot; are  interdisciplinary evaluation, the evaluation of entities that are the currency of a discipline's economy, and meta-evaluation, the evaluation of evaluations themselves.

An evaluation of record-keeping software should start with a process to identify all of the individual needs the software produce must meet in order to be considered for purchase. The first step toward establishing an administrative computing system is forming a schoolwide committee that can provide input for developing school-specific evaluation criteria, solicit products from vendors, and examine those products. Once a committee has been established, the members should examine the administrative functions that need to be computerized. Needs analysis should examine the school's capacity to enable faculty and staff to make more productive use of their time and its capability to provide  accurate data on individual students that can be used to meet student needs. School officials need to play a vital role in deciding which administrative functions should be automated. The working committee should draft criteria to compare and evaluate each system under consideration. The committee may have to develop and use a quantitative measure on which to base a decision about the software. (SLD)",

Thus, test validity is a characteristic of a test when it is administered to a particular population. This article introduces the modern concepts of validity advanced by S. Messick (1989, 1996, 1996). Traditionally, the means of accumulating validity have been grouped into the categories of content-related, criterion-related, and construct-related evidence of validity. Messick considered the traditional concept of validity to be fragmented and incomplete because it fails to take into account evidence of the value implications of score meaning as a basis for action and the social consequences of score use. Messick identified six aspects of validity that are  general validity criteria or standards. These are: (1) content; (2) the substantive aspect; (3) structure; (4) generalizabilty; (5) external factors; and (6) consequential aspects of validity. Two major threats to validity that are worth noting are construct underrepresentation and construct-irrelevant variance. (SLD)",

Per pupil expenditures in the WCPPS were lowest among all comparison LEAs for every year in the 1990s. Student dropout rates in the WCPSS remained the lowest among comparison LEAS throughout the period studied. Student population growth in the WCPSS exceeded that of all comparison LEAs for every year in the 1990s.

This report defines that goal operationally and defines the terms used to describe it.

Student scores on the EOG tests are reported on scales that are divided into four levels. Students scoring at the first two levels probably lack basic skills, but those scoring in Levels III and IV probably have the skills needed for the next grade level, and are considered &quot;at or  above&quot; grade level. During the past 6 years, WCPSS has shown gradual improvement in the percentage of students at or above grade level. The percentage of students who were at or above grade level in reading improved from 71% in 1994 to 87% in 1999. In mathematics, the improvement was from 72% to 84%. The percentage of scores that were below grade level in 1998 varied greatly by subject, grade, and demographic group. Poverty was the single strongest predictor of low achievement. The school system's goal is close to being achieved with some groups of students, but the system still has a long way to go for others.

Since 1996-97, the WCPSS has contracted with a private firm to operate the Richard M. Milburn High School (RMHS), as an alternative learning center. This Executive Summary highlights the major conclusions of collected evaluations of the alternative program over the years. After the first year of the program, voluntary enrollment has been at capacity, indicating that the program is filling a need. The basic skills of many students in this program are well below grade level. Although affective and behavioral interventions can be woven into the core curricula, the emphasis must be on academics. Communications with the regular  schools have been shown to be of great importance, and evaluations have shown that students need assistance to make a successful return to the regular school. The RMHS program met four of five student outcome goals that were set for the 1997-98 year, with improvement conspicuous for the end-of-grade, end-of-course writing examinations. It is probable that two of the most important factors in the improvement were hiring a new principal and the improved stability in operations that came with the school's second year. (SLD)",

Schools meeting goals are given financial incentive awards that can be distributed as bonuses to the faculty. This report describes ABC results for the Wake County Public School System (WCPSS).

Sixty-five percent of the county's elementary schools exceeded the &quot;exemplary growth&quot;  mark, and none was low-performing. Ninety percent of the middle schools exceeded the exemplary gain mark, and, again, one was in the low-performing category. All of the high schools showed exemplary growth, and one was low-performing. In 1997-98 schools achieving exemplary growth received incentive bonuses equivalent to $1,500 per certified teacher and $500 per teacher assistant.

STC, or Career and Technology Education (CATE) students are grouped into categories according to level of participation as CATE Elective, CATE Coherent (completion of a coherent sequence of course work), and Tech Prep (completion of a coherent sequence of course work within a pathway with state approved articulation courses). This report documents and presents demographic and collective STC data for the 1998-99 school year. Between August 1998 and May 1999, 18,261 students were enrolled in CATE courses. Sixty-five percent of the AISD's high school students are enrolled in CATE  courses. In grades 11 and 12, students who participated in CATE have a higher reading and writing passing rate on the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills than non-CATE participants. Tech Prep students had the lowest dropout rate and the highest postsecondary enrollment rate of the AISD 1996-97 cohort. The course failure rate for students at three high schools who participated in the &quot;Connections&quot; course, a course for ninth graders coordinated by STC personnel, was lower than the failure rate for students who did not take &quot;Connections.&quot; Several recommendations are made to improve the evaluative process of the STC program. These include better data collection and quality assurance methods to ensure the accuracy of the data collected. (SLD)",

Instruction in the program is individualized and self-paced, but is aligned with the district's regular curriculum. The DELTA program served 1,711 students during the 1998-99 school year, representing a 5% increase over the preceding year. In 1998-99, 1,399 students took the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills test for the first time.

The initiative, funded by the National Science Foundation with AISD supplements, provides long-term, high-quality professional development to build the capacity of all AISD mathematics teachers. The professional development focuses on the standards for mathematics education set by the state and the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. A case study was conducted to examine in-depth factors that contribute to districtwide implementation of the AISD curriculum on individual  campuses through skills and knowledge that teachers gain in ACME professional development. Evaluators gathered information through multiple site visits to nine AISD campuses with interviews with principals and teachers and surveys completed by teachers. The case study showed that mathematics lessons of teachers at all the schools manifested a range in standards-based mathematics curriculum and instruction. Differences in implementation levels emerged by teacher, and not by school. In general, the study did not reveal differences between schools with whole-school and grade-by-grade implementation, although schools with whole-school implementation did receive more support from the AISD. Teachers who implemented the program most effectively believed in the philosophy of standards-based  mathematics education and were enthusiastic about the curriculum. Teachers who reported that they like the curriculum resources, were more likely to use them. Recommendations are made to improve the professional education offered under ACME. Appendixes contain principal and teacher interviews, the campus questionnaire, and a diagram of teacher collaboration at one school. (Contains 12 references.) (SLD)",

Two premises were tested: (1) flexible combination accounts for significant variation in cumulative grade-point average, high school rank, and cumulative Act Assessment scores; and (2) the importance of flexible combination ability to academic success varies as a function of the type of academic abilities being measured. Data from 99 undergraduates indicate that flexible combination ability predicts each of the criterion measures. In addition, data indicate that the relationships between cognitive flexibility and academic success vary as a function of academic subject areas. Flexible combination ability is more important to  achievement in mathematics and English than natural science or social science. Data from this study provide further evidence of the importance of flexible combination ability to academic success and point to the importance of including cognitive flexibility in models of intelligence.

The sample included 52 middle-level girls (grade 7), all of whom were participants in a project examining factors that support or inhibit rural and urban girls' participation in science, mathematics, and technology. Preliminary analyses of the academic achievement and grades of the participants identify pronounced school-level effects related to the variables that affected students' grades. A questionnaire was developed to determine teacher beliefs about grades. The questionnaire was administered to 52 teachers in the 3 schools attended by the participants. Results reveal that, at least among the schools studied, there are certain beliefs about grading that differ from  school to school. School-level scores on a scale named &quot;ethos of effort&quot; (one of three scales from the questionnaire) distinguished among teachers from the three schools. Results suggest that teachers in schools with a more custodial orientation may compound effort and achievement to a greater degree than teachers in schools with a more optimistic and humanistic orientation. Findings lend support to the contention that report card grades should be based on achievement only, since the incorporation of other factors, such as effort, confounds the meaning of grades. When grades are deflated by the inclusion of nonacademic measures, students may come to see themselves as less capable than they actually are. (Contains 1 table, 1 figure, and 43 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"This report focuses on the standards and test schools used to measure student and school performance in Texas. The primary method for evaluating the academic achievement of Texas public school students is a standardized test called the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS). A review of TAAS scores and their uses suggests that the TAAS test may be given too much weight in the Texas educational system for evaluating students and schools. The TAAS is used not only for student assessment and school evaluation, but is also used to decide if students are ready to graduate. Although an increasing number of students are passing the TAAS, there is still substantial need for improvement. Fair learning standards should be based on a realistic assessment of the skills and knowledge that  a student will need in college or the workplace. All children should have similar learning opportunities. High standards are the beginning, but students also need the belief that they have the ability to succeed. The Ysleta Independent School District, El Paso, Texas, demonstrates the success possible when the vision of the school district makes academic success nonnegotiable. Ysleta students are passing the TAAS at higher rates than in any other large urban district in the state. (Contains 2 figures, 4 tables, and 23 endnotes.) (SLD)",

Further, the relationship between the EM algorithm, marginal maximum likelihood estimation, and the Bock-Aitkin procedure is described for both the discrete and continuous cases. Some issues concerning the use of the Bock-Aitkin procedure and the EM algorithm are addressed. (Contains 31 references.) (SLD)",

Assessment is changing in Vermont in response to new legislative mandates that call for standards-based assessment designed to improve student learning. Parents are familiar with paper-and-pencil test, but they are less familiar with new types of performance based assessment, including portfolios, and new types of scoring, such as check lists and rubrics. In Vermont, all students will participate in the Vermont Comprehensive Assessment System, which will track trends across the state over time.

Forty-nine states are included; Oregon and the District of Columbia did not participate in the survey. States receive grades in whether: (1) they hold schools, principals, and teachers accountable for results; (2) they have empowered schools to make personnel decisions; (3) they have quality control systems to ensure that teachers know their subjects, but that do not involve needless regulation; and (4) they have opened the doors into teaching to talented candidates who have not attended schools of education. Grades are based on 29 indicators, each linked to a policy designed to boost the quality of the teaching force. Overall, the states earn a  grade of \"D+\" for their teacher quality policies, although Texas and Florida both receive \"A's.\" The report describes what these two states are doing to earn these grades.

It is a method for improving practice in which one collects data to diagnose problems, searches for solutions, takes action, and monitors how well it works. Action research is characterized by groups of colleagues working together for systematic inquiry. In effect, the research is defined by the practitioners and conducted by those who want to improve their own situation. There are three types of action research: (1) the scientific method of problem solving; (2) the practical-deliberative action research; and (3) critical-emancipatory action research. The key to selecting the type of action research depends on the purpose of the inquiry. The process of collaborative action  research begins with identifying the problem. This is followed by data collection planning and the actual collection of data. Data analysis follows, with the reporting and sharing of results with colleagues. The final step is working out a plan for action that incorporates what one learned from the inquiry. The strength of action research is that employees of a system work together to find their own solutions to problems so that they buy into the solution and feel ownership. (Contains 23 references.)

The USDA developed review instruments to evaluate the implementation of the HSMI nationwide. These instruments were used in Texas private schools and residential child care institutions (RCCIs). In 1997, 194 private schools and RCCIs were reviewed, and 28 were reviewed in 1998. The facilities reviewed in 1998 were selected based on their size and need for technical assistance. Most of the facilities had chosen the traditional menu planning option, with revised options much less often used. Neither the type of facility nor its location  affected how successful a facility was in implementing the HSMI policy. Most facilities did not have the hardware and software necessary to conduct nutrient analyses on site. Overall, the menu planning in these schools indicates a need for standardization. There were significant improvements in facility nutritional performance in 1998, but technical assistance was still needed overall. Recommendations are made for menu planning and serving, improved nutrition analyses, and additional nutrition education and training. Two appendixes contain instruments used to evaluate the HSMI in 1997 and 1998. (Contains 8 tables and 17 figures.) (SLD)",

Action evaluation is an integrated research and intervention methodology for helping to define, promote, and assess success in an endeavor, while using evaluation as a bridge between research and practice in ways that promote greater quality in both. The action evaluation process includes: (1) a baseline stage that incorporates a systematic process for cooperative goal setting, team-building and participatory decision making; (2) a formative stage in which participants refine their goals and begin working toward them; and (3) a summative stage in which participants take stock of their progress using their evolved goals to establish criteria for  retrospective assessment. How these stages evolved at the Dayton Mediation Center is described. The experiences of the Center show that action evaluation is more than an effective process of goal articulation and data gathering that systematizes actions normally done in the design and implementation of most conflict resolution and organizational development processes.

Field notes, video recordings, transcripts of classroom sessions, and teacher interviews were used to collect information about patterns of student and teacher participation during teacher-led and student-led literature classes. The teacher's role within the literature discussion groups was active, complex, and dynamic. The change from a teacher-led discussion format was not easily accomplished. Students tended to fall back into old patterns, but the teacher facilitated and supported their growth in problem solving, interactional competence, and  discussion content. The examination of several emergent themes from classroom discussions shows that the teacher used a variety of intervention techniques to scaffold students' development understandings of the discussion process. The teacher's support was required as students developed the \"how\" and \"what' of literature discussion groups. Appendixes contain transcription conventions and the transcript of a discussion.

A scannable questionnaire survey booklet was developed and scanned data were exported and analyzed. Based on an achieved sample of 280 (70% response rate), analyses involved the computation of descriptive statistics as well as the construction of several scale variables corresponding to perceived training program outcomes, evaluation processes, and uses. Reliability was examined, and program participant and line management stakeholder groups were compared. Other analyses examined the relationships between perceived training outcomes and preferences for evaluation processes and uses  by group. Three predictor variables (customer satisfaction, product development, and employee satisfaction) were constructed using the conceptual framework from a previous investigation. The criterion variables were labeled as evaluation purposes, process, and consequences. Stepwise multiple regression revealed highly significant relationships between predictors (training results) involving employees and customer satisfaction and the criterion variables (training evaluation). The overall results suggest that both managers and nonmanagers tended to view the results and evaluation of training as being closely connected with employee satisfaction. An expanded deployment of the survey is recommended beyond the case organization for future research. Four appendixes contain the survey cover  letter, the instrument, response demographics, factor analysis results, and the code and index structure for survey written comments.

This paper addresses this gap in the literature by reporting on a 2.5-year longitudinal single case study of practical participatory evaluation of a national, publicly funded training organization. Drawing on multiple sources of qualitative data, the study investigates the effects of an internal evaluator who was both employed by the organization and internal to the program being evaluated. Results show that the added dimensions of evaluator knowledge of both program and organizational content can have a powerful impact on developing the organization's capacity to inquire systematically and to learn.

The measures were an outcome measure (in this case, a test of economics knowledge), student evaluations of teaching (SET), and a weighted average of the two. For each performance measure, two alternative approaches to ranking were considered. One simply compared an instructor's score to those of other instructors. The other, a new method, compared an instructor's score to the one that could be expected for the teacher's class. The methodology was applied to rank 49 classes of principles of economic classes taught at comprehensive universities. Significant differences were found in instructor rankings between the three evaluation scores and also between rankings based on the suggested  methodology and the traditional approach comparing an instructor to others. The newly developed methodology can be adapted to any college or department. In a first step, the suggested ranking methodology could be implemented for teaching evaluations alone. In a second step, evaluators could develop knowledge-based outcome tests for each field and course. Then a teacher's overall assessment could be calculated as a weighted average of the two scores.

Some trainers, however, feel reluctant to use this Level 2 evaluation (D. Kirkpatrick, 1994) in their courses, and continue to rely on participants' self-assessment of their own knowledge, a more common, traditional approach, that has been used by the WBI. This study investigated whether participants' perceptions about what they have learned can be a valid proxy of what they have actually learned. In some cases self-assessment by participants was positively correlated with the amount of their actual learning. However, the correlation was too weak to enable researchers to rely on perceived self-reported data on learning  to measure actual learning. Breaking down the data by gender, region, education, or years of related experience showed that none of the groups studied were consistently able to validly assess how much they learned in a course.

        "description":"Expert systems are computer programs that are designed to advise or assist users by storing the knowledge of human experts and applying the computer's mathematical ability to search and sort this information. This study investigated the use of an expert system as a mindtool and whether or not creating a simple expert system would facilitate the formation of an accurate mental model of a system. The domain selected for the study was that of hydraulic brake drums. Participants were 33 adult males and females from a variety of professions located in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Results indicate that creating the expert system substantially increased participants' scores on all three measures of mental models. In addition, participants indicated that using the  expert system focused their attention on the topic and that it was fun to use. Network similarity scores increased significantly, with a large effect size, during the midtest to posttest period during which participants created the expert system. Scores on a test of troubleshooting increased significantly, but with only a medium effect size. Results of a prediction test also indicated that the use of an expert system facilitated the development of more expert-like knowledge structures. Expert systems appear to be versatile and powerful mindtools. (Contains 8 tables, 6 figures, and 59 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"The effects of questions of different cognitive levels were investigated in four undergraduate classes involving a total of 80 students. Previous research suggested that questions may distract students from a lecture, and that students felt more confident about responding accurately to low-order questions. These results do not support previous findings that students are more confident in responding to questions when lower-order questions are presented. Nor were students more attentive in the no-question situation. It was speculated that perhaps anxiety interfered with students' confidence to respond to higher-order questions and students' metacognitive and attending behaviors.

This study explored the experiences of the six students as related to the qualitative research course and the attitudes of these women about graduate scholarship and constructed a theoretical framework on female research mentoring. Data collection involved telephone interviews the semester following the course, e-mail interviews a year later, and a follow-up focus group session with 5 of the 6 graduate students 18 months after the class. The theoretical framework developed from the findings identified four constructs related to research by female graduate students. These included: (1)  overarching research barriers; (2) time management concerns; (3) perceived gender differences that influence research production; and (4) obstacles to research because of family commitments. The framework also identified the mentoring solutions for each of the constructs and the benefits of the qualitative research class as related to those solutions.

A nonrandom group of 13 teachers who had been trained in the new curriculum taught it to their students. The kindergarten was eliminated because norm-referenced tests were not given at that level, leaving 10 teachers and their classes. The control consisted of 24 teachers and classes using the curriculum already in place. Pretests and posttests using the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills were administered to students in both groups. There was a significant difference between  the experimental and control groups, with students in the experimental group scoring more highly than those in the control group.

Using a research protocol designed by W. Popham and the local study directors, individual test items from a nationally marketed standardized achievement test were rated by educators and parents to determine the degree to which raters felt that items reflect important content that is actually taught in schools and the degree to which raters felt that students' answers to the questions would be likely to be unduly influenced by confounded causality. Thirty reviewers served as item raters: 2 principals, 18 teachers, and 10 parents of elementary school students. On average, raters felt that the  content of test questions measured material that is important for students to know. However, for reading and language arts questions, between 20% to 40% of the items were viewed as suspect in terms of other criteria. Mathematics problem-solving and reasoning items were considered the least problematic. Educators and parents did not differ statistically on their ratings on most criteria, although about two-thirds of educators felt that tests should not be used to judge instructional quality, while only 40% of parents felt this way.

Student achievement data show that when mathematics performance assessment scores and  language performance scores are analyzed separately, the hypothesis that performance task instruction would increase scores was not supported. When total performance scores are analyzed, there is a significant improvement in scores for 1999 over those of 1998. Data do not show a relationship between performance assessment scores and core battery scores. Teachers indicated that performance-based instruction and assessment had improved their own performance and student performance overall.

This paper examines the electronic focus group data collection procedure. The electronic sessions were conducted in a decision-support center on campus with 13 networked computer workstations and 1 server. The software for the focus group sessions was Group Systems 2.0 by Ventana Corporation. At each session, the facilitator explained the technology and then engaged in a guided question-and-answer process using a predetermined focus group script. In the first phase, participants answered the questions individually, and in a second phase, they &quot;discussed&quot; the responses with each other  electronically. Researchers found that the electronic format improved the objectivity of each session, reduced the influence of a sensitive topic on participation, and enhanced the management of a discussion. The electronic format also improved the accuracy of the data by capturing every voice and comment in &quot;real time.&quot; The primary disadvantage was the reduced ability of the researcher to guide the discussion and request elaboration of any given topic. The researchers, however, believed that this disadvantage was more a consequence of their inexperience with the technology than a problem with the electronic format.

The Task Force has concluded that, if the number of top African American, Latino, and Native American students is to grow rapidly, promoting their achievement must become a priority at all levels of the educational system. Colleges and universities,  along with state education systems, should create information systems designed to monitor progress and help inform efforts to design more effective strategies. At the K-12 level, the Task Force recommends that local, state, and federal leaders place the goal of increasing the number of top minority students high on the school reform agenda. The Task Force also recommends increased access to high-quality preschool and parent education programs and improved supplemental programs targeting minority students.

Hirsch, 1987, 1996). Third-year results are presented in the areas of implementation and outcomes. Factors clearly affecting implementation of Core Knowledge included the following: (1) the availability and use of common planning time; (2) the care taken to induct new teachers into the Core curriculum; (3) level of success in negotiating Core/local curriculum conflicts; (4) finding ways to use Core Knowledge that are supportive of the state's student testing program; (5) sustaining Core as a priority in the face of competing educational reforms; and (6) continuing to acquire  adequate resources after each school's 2-year implementation grant expired. Achievement outcomes were measured through two tests: the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills Fourth Edition (CTBS/4), and the Maryland School Performance Assessment Program (MSPAP). The relationship between the tests and the Core Knowledge curriculum was not tight, and individual school's level of implementation and outcome measures all varied between years one and three. However, the majority of the Core Knowledge schools posted 3-year academic achievement gains in reading comprehension relative to their matched control peers as measured on the CTBS/4. In addition, during the 3-year period of this study, third-grade students in Core schools showed greater gains on the more performance-based MSPAP than did their  matched control schools or the mean of schools state-wide. Four appendixes contain two teacher surveys, information about Core teachers, and a discussion of mathematics subtests and results. (Contains 28 references.) (Author/SLD)",

Researchers collected data via interviews with principals, teachers, and students and observations of mathematics and science instruction, emphasizing: the MUSI's impact; whether teaching was standards-based; opportunities for teacher collaboration; and leadership for mathematics and science. Most elementary and middle school teachers felt the MUSI had a great impact, but high school teachers saw little use for it.  Teachers wanted more collaboration time, stronger leadership, and continuation of the MUSI. Movement toward becoming a community of learners was apparent in some schools. Principals recognized the need for multiple methods of teaching and for keeping teachers current regarding instructional materials. Principals also acknowledged the need for teacher collaboration but mentioned lack of time during school days. Leadership varied across schools. Students reported enjoying mathematics and science more and applying themselves more when challenged.

        "description":"This applied dissertation was designed to decrease confrontation among African American females at an alternative evening school for high school students who were at least 2 years behind grade level academically. The program involved developing a small group guidance curriculum, creating and videotaping role playing scenarios, arranging for mentoring of middle school students, developing profile sheets, and organizing teacher inservices to encourage and assist the over-aged high school students in using empowering communication in school on a regular basis. Data collection focused on incident referrals and discipline reports, teacher records and grade reports, conflict mediation logs, and data on dropout and attendance rates. Results indicated that confrontational behavior  decreased during the months of implementation. Participating in small group guidance sessions enhanced empowering communication and had a positive impact on school climate and academic instruction. The five appendixes contain: the phenomenal females group profile sheet; the small group guidance curriculum; the student anger scale; teacher inservices; and the teacher perception scale.

        "author":["Johnson, Roy"],
        "description":"The percentage of students of all races and ethnicities lost from public school enrollment has worsened in Texas in recent years. This paper presents major findings from a recent attrition study by the Intercultural Development Research Association (IDRA). It also restates recommendations from the IDRA policy brief, &quot;Missing Texas Youth --Dropout and Attrition Rates in Texas Public High Schools,&quot; and looks at dropout information from the Texas Education Agency (TEA), including the new 'leaver' record system. The attrition rate is 27 percent higher than it was in 1985-86, when it was 33 percent. Since 1985, more than 1.3 million students have been lost from Texas public schools due to attrition. Black, Hispanic, and male students were the most likely to be lost from public high  school enrollment. After discussing what the TEA report does and does not say about student attrition, the paper presents recommendations for improving state dropout accounting. Some of the recommendations include: revising the goal of the state dropout program; modifying state policy requirements; modifying the state education agency procedure for computing the actual state longitudinal dropout rate; requiring that a school district's longitudinal dropout rate be tied to the state's accountability system; and requiring that the state education agency collect and disseminate information on local districts' dropout prevention and recovery efforts.

The study involved a survey instrument that measured effective school practices of recognized schools. The survey focused on instructional environment, instructional processes, administration processes, and communication processes. Results indicate seven themes that capture the dynamics of the schools' excellence: high quality teaching, setting high expectations, monitoring standards, rewarding results, using resources that facilitate the teaching process, creating a cooperative  work environment, and having effective, frequent communication. What appears to set these schools apart are the commitment, creativity, persistence, and professionalism with which they have gone about the task of instructional implementation. One of the fundamental elements of this success is the collaborative culture that is dedicated to continuous improvement. The survey is appended. (SM)",

Data are in the form of tabular and graphical descriptions of the trends in teenage birth rates by age group, race, and Hispanic origin of the mother. The data for 1997 and earlier years are based on 100 percent of the birth certificates registered in all states and the District of Columbia. Data for 1998 are preliminary, based on a sample file of more than 99 percent of births for that year. According to the statistics, birth rates for teenagers age 15-19 years declined nationally between 1991 and 1998 for all age, race, and Hispanic origin populations, with the steepest declines recorded for  African American women. The teenage birth rate is close to a record low. Statistics show that most teenage births are to unmarried women. State-specific rates by age fell in all states, with most declines statistically significant. Overall declines ranged from 9 to 32 percent. (SM)",

The increasing student diversity means that the schools are multicultural, but the teacher staff is not. It has become imperative that teachers be educated to teach about diverse cultures. James Banks has developed a theory of five dimensions of multicultural education that allow teachers to engage in self-actualization while addressing curriculum issues. The five dimensions are: (1) content integration; (2) the knowledge construction process; (3) an equity pedagogy; (4) prejudice reduction; and (5) creating an empowering school culture and social structure. Developing a \"border pedagogy,\" as outlined by Barry Kanpol means that teachers will seek similarities  within differences to incorporate the \"other\" into social relations and to identify with those who have felt alienation and oppression. Self-reflection will enable teachers to develop this border pedagogy. (SLD)",

        "description":"Case studies of 19 U.S. companies involved in welfare-to-work programs found that political and economic factors have accelerated the rate at which employers are hiring welfare recipients. Although participation in welfare-to-work programs is dominated by larger firms in a few industries (such as service and retail sectors), there is potential for continued expansion of employer participation. The primary focus of employers to date has been on recruitment and hiring, but strategies are being developed to improve employee retention, an area in which employers are receiving support from public policy. Employers identify business benefits from their participation, including increased access to labor, increased loyalty among new hires, reduced recruitment and hiring costs, reduced  employee turnover, better quality new hires, and improved employee morale. Challenges to employers who want to expand their efforts include problems with obtaining suitable services from providers of welfare recipients and the complexity of working with those providers. Components of successful programs include high-level corporate commitment, local partnerships, and postplacement services. Public policy recommendations include the following: (1) changing policies and funding to balance &quot;work first&quot; and longer-term skill development strategies; (2) increasing public investment in supportive services and expanding income supplements for low-wage workers; and (3) providing public support to improve local service-providing organizations that serve as intermediaries between the welfare system  and employers.

        "description":"The effectiveness of biofeedback and relaxation training in reducing occupational stress was examined in a study of 50 individuals employed in various occupations in Iran. The study sample consisted of 15 workers (5 females, 10 males); 15 managers (5 females, 10 males); 9 guardians (3 females, 6 males); 5 dentists (2 females, 3 males); and 6 teachers (3 females, 3 males). All subjects were trained to control their occupational stress through relaxation and biofeedback techniques. Each of the 10 training sessions lasted 30 minutes. After the training sessions had been completed, the subjects were asked to continue training in their own work environment. All subjects were evaluated by the following methods before and after the training: clinical interviews; Minnesota Satisfaction  Questionnaire, short form; and C-TEMP and GSR (Galvanic Skin Response) biofeedback. A chi-square analysis of the interview, questionnaire, and biofeedback findings failed to establish any relationship between sex of subject and effectiveness of treatment. However, effectiveness of training was significantly related to occupation. Specifically, the biofeedback and relaxation training was more effective in reducing the occupational stress experienced by dentists, teachers, and managers than it was in reducing the occupational stress experienced by guardians and workers.

The Asia-Pacific regional conference focused on challenges of the 21st century, demands of the world of work, and changing patterns in the delivery of training programs. The European symposium covered five themes: vocational education and training (VET) and new technologies, environmental education and training, the changing role of the public and private sectors in VET, internationalization of economic activities and tourism, and noncommercial exchanges and vocational training. The conference held for policymakers and educators from the Arab states focused on the following: policies and strategies of TVE; quality, effectiveness, and  relevance of TVE; renovation of TVE processes and contents; and application of informatics, new technologies, and networking in TVE. The African regional conference culminated in the formation of the Nairobi Action Plan for Technical and Vocational Education. The technical meeting on TVE in Latin America and the Caribbean had the dual purpose of discussing the main trends and experiences in secondary education reform in the region and developing a regional vision of TVE.

        "description":"The purpose of this book is to provide the female inmate with a self-help guidebook that she can identify with and utilize in surviving the correctional experience. The publication contains 30 essays, poems, observations, diary excerpts, and drawings reflecting the life of female prison inmates at the Eddie Warrior Correctional Center in Oklahoma. Some of the essays are written by the supervisor of education at the center and other teachers, but most of the items are written by inmates and those who have been released recently. The essays focus on what female prisoners need to do to reclaim their lives outside the prison walls and how difficult that is to do, partially because the correctional system makes it harder than necessary for them to do so. Personal examples and  anecdotes fill the articles and provide insight into the daily lives and aspirations of female inmates. Chapters are: (1) \"Get a Life\" (H. C. Davis); (2) \"Fear\" (Barbara Saunders); (3) \"Anger\" (Dorita Pemberton); (4) \"Low Self-Esteem\" (Keeva Clayton); and \"The Powerless\" (Leslie Smith). Following the chapters are two case studies: \"Six Months in the Life of a Female Parolee\" (Leah Mueller); and \"Another Entry in the Journal of a Recovering Addict--May '96\" (Michelle Pierre).

The study sample consisted of those 4,899 male HS&amp;B sample members who were in grade 10 in 1980 and who participated in the fourth follow-up survey in 1992. The study replicated the basic findings of prior studies, which implicitly assumed that the GED's labor market value does not depend on the skills with which dropouts left school. The GED's effects on subsequent employment and earnings varied according to individuals' academic aptitude as measured by a standardized test administered  during the original study. Obtaining a GED was associated with higher earnings at age 27 for those male dropouts who had very weak cognitive skills in grade 10, but not for those who had stronger cognitive skills in grade 10. The GED was deemed a key step for further education and training. (The document contains 24 references and 35 endnotes. The procedures used to select the HS&amp;B sample and identify sample members' educational status are appended.) (MN)",

        "description":"Since vocational education and training (VET) have a very special focus on workforce development and economic growth, economic trends and political context are important. One cause of the perceived problem of insufficient growth in the national economy is VET provision quality and/or quantity. Relationship among governmental and government-related bodies and interaction with enterprises and private training providers creates overlap for the institutional and funding structure for the three types of VET: initial (IVT), continuing (CVT), and training for the unemployed (TfU). Sources and totals of VET funding have been fairly stable. The following three themes emerge regarding distribution mechanisms: separation of funders and providers; reliance on markets or quasi-market  mechanisms in the funding allocation systems; and output-related funding. Funding changes, particularly those involving competition between IVT providers, have increased cost efficiency. Funding systems that empower the IVT customer have not had notable success. CVT continues to dominate VET expenditure; private or enterprise funding predominates. TfU is in a state of flux as New Deal initiatives take over. New Deal involves local partnerships challenging the primacy of the employer-led Training and Enterprise Councils in the role of training. The continual changes in VET, with new programs, organizational arrangements, and funding systems, demonstrate a vibrant, if somewhat uncoordinated, sector.

Four sections in Part 1 present a series of answers to four frequently asked questions about training packages posed by practitioners in consultations and forums during the first half of 1998. Question 1 asks &quot;Where did we come from, and where are we are going?&quot; The answer addresses the training reform and the implications for language, literacy, and numeracy provision in industry. Question 2 asks &quot;What are the changes that the Training Package model brings for the language, literacy, and numeracy field?&quot; This section discusses opportunities for contextualized literacy;  incorporation of language, literacy, and numeracy competencies into industry competency standards; and standards as the new basis for assessment--a comparison between the old and new systems. Question 3 asks, &quot;What are the roles of the future language, literacy, and numeracy practitioner in industry?&quot; Question 4 asks and answers the question, &quot;What is in a training package?&quot; This section describes the endorsed part of the package, which includes the National Competency Standards, assessment guidelines, and qualifications; and the nonendorsed components, which are the learning strategy, assessment resources, and professional development materials. Part 2 provides accompanying activities to assist the reader to work through issues raised. A final section contains 4 contacts and 31  references. (YLB)",

        "description":"In recent years, increasing numbers of nontraditional students have begun pursuing bachelor's and master's degrees in human resources development, technology education, and vocational-technical education in the Department of Industrial Technology Education (ITE) at Indiana State University. In 1998, the ITE department expanded the options available to these students by offering courses through the Indiana Higher Education Telecommunication System (IHETS), which is a state-funded consortium of eight college and university campuses that was initiated in 1967. Students now have the option of taking courses through one of four delivery formats: traditional on-campus delivery; IHETS satellite transmission to 325 sites; videotape; and the Internet. The transition to instruction through  multiple delivery systems has given rise to several issues and concerns including the following: (1) in most cases, students and faculty have no eye-to-eye contact; (2) assessment of students at various &quot;distances&quot; can be problematic; and (3) teaching courses through multiple delivery formats requires high levels of expertise on the part of faculty. Solutions developed to address these issues/concerns have included the following: (1) enabling off-campus students to communicate with faculty via e-mail, telephone, and satellite transmission; (2) arranging for proctored examinations at remote sites; and (3) offering faculty training sessions on creating Web pages and Internet courses.

        "description":"Work undertaken to improve the effectiveness of the United Kingdom's schools and further education (FE) sectors was identified and assessed in a study entailing four data collection methods: literature review; questionnaire administered to all FE college principals in England and Wales; expert seminar and face-to-face interviews with high-level representatives of all major agencies responsible for the schools, higher education (HE), and FE sectors; and focus group and telephone interviews with quality managers in a sample of colleges. Although the questionnaire elicited a response rate of only 18%, the respondents were representative of the FE sector as a whole. Among the main obstacles to improving sector effectiveness identified by the principals were the following: lack of  finance and funding; lack of management systems and training for middle managers; and need for lecturing staff to adopt new teaching methods. Confusion over the terms &quot;effectiveness&quot; and &quot;improvement&quot; was discovered. It was concluded that systematic quantitative and qualitative research based on a theoretical framework clarifying its relationship to Further Education Funding Council policy and practice is critical to future work to improve the schools, FE, and HE sectors.

        "description":"An inventory of business-linked charter schools operating in the United States was developed. The data collection methods used to develop the inventory were as follows: soliciting nominations from key contacts in each state having charter school legislation; comparing the nominations with lists of charter schools from selected state education department Web sites; identifying additional schools through personal contacts at a 1997 national charter schools conference; and searching the school profile database. A total of 77 business-linked charter schools were identified, and profiling of each school was initiated. To date, 59 summary profiles have been developed. The inventory established the existence of four broad types of career orientation at various business-linked charter  schools: career preparation; career focus; career informed; and noncareer partnership. Six recurring themes identified during the inventory were explored in depth: (1) stages of school development and their implications for cross-fertilization; (2) adapting to the environment; (3) career path identification and choice; (4) customized design options; (5) variability of organizational structures; and (6) impact of state legislation on business-linked charter schools.

Section 1 is an overview of employer-linked charter schools' key elements and unique features. Topics examined include the following: vision of charter school founders, learning in context, meeting workforce development needs, charters' relationship to traditional school systems, curriculum innovation, raising standards, assessment of student achievement, flexibility of staffing, and role models and mentoring. Section 2 is a discussion of the study methodology that includes the following: case study selection criteria; characteristics of the case study sites; the research questions;  and site summaries. The case study sites, which had enrollments ranging from 60 to 2,480, included a program that helped students identify areas of vocational interest and explore related career options and programs targeted toward specific groups (for example, out-of-school urban youths) or students with specific career interests (for example, students interested in careers in manufacturing, the performing arts, and health careers). Appendixes, constituting approximately two-thirds of the document, contain the case studies, which describe the following elements for each school: defining purpose, learning standard, curriculum, worksite learning, governance, and career purpose.

The paper begins by explaining how the following business changes have promoted development of employer-linked charter schools: technology; globalization; escalating customer expectations; view of people as a strategic element; and extended enterprise. Discussed next are the promise of employer-linked charter schools and the natural affinity between employers and charters. Examples are then presented that illustrate the following key elements of employer-linked charter schools at work: founders' vision; learning in context and in  the world; meeting workforce development needs; charters' relationship to traditional school systems; unique features of employer-linked charter schools; curriculum innovation; raising standards; assessment of student achievement; flexibility in staffing; and role models and mentoring. The paper's conclusion emphasizes the following findings regarding employer-linked charter schools: they provide compelling evidence of what charters can accomplish; they can increase the level of ownership by the business community; their relationship with public education can take many forms; they serve diverse as well as disadvantaged student populations; and they are an experiment in progress.

        "author":["Cyr, Angela V."],
        "description":"In the early 1960s, European adult educators developed a new theoretical model of adult learning called &quot;andragogy.&quot; In 1968, Malcolm Knowles introduced the concept of andragogy into U.S. adult education literature and identified four primary assumptions about adult learners: adults become increasingly independent and self-directing; they accumulate experience that becomes a resource for learning; they orient their formal and informal learning around their social and work roles; and they orient their learning toward performance rather than subject. From the early 1970s through the late 1980s, Knowles and other experts in the field of adult education initiated and advanced assumptions, theories, principles, and practices related specifically to characteristics of adult learners  and advanced the theory that andragogical theories and principles were applicable to learners of all ages, depending on individual learners' developmental levels and learning situations. Although many authors published in the 1990s support these earlier works, other authors have expressed concerns about the direction of the fields of adult education and learning theory, including language particular to the field, the lack of an acceptable general theory of adult learning, and the need for additional research to validate prior positions and expand knowledge about certain aspects of andragogy.

        "description":"Deborah Tannen's framework for interpersonal communication between males and females (published in 1990) was used to explore how male and female distance education students meet their primary needs through communication. The study population consisted of the 19 female and 6 male students enrolled in a 13-week computer conferencing course at the University of Calgary. An analysis of students' patterns of communication in the course's Weekly Topics sessions revealed that the men initially used four strategies to meet their primary status needs: reporting, differentiating themselves from others, separating (establishing their independence from others), and vertical aligning. By week 13, however, the men were using only two strategies: reporting and separating. The females used seven  main strategies at the beginning of the course: establishing a sense of connection, interpersonal closeness, symmetry, acceptance, and horizontal alignment; making suggestions; and sharing. By the end of the course, however, they were using two additional strategies: establishing a sense of interdependence and a sense of intimacy. The women adapted to the course environment well, whereas the men were not as able to meet their primary status needs at the end of the course as they had been at the beginning.

        "description":"Integrating technology into the Adult Basic Literacy Education (ABLE) classroom can be very helpful to students and teachers, but it requires a shift in the teacher's role. The idea of \"delivering\" instruction--teacher-centered classes or tutor-directed lessons--should be replaced with student-centered, self-paced learning. Although the first lessons need to be teacher centered as basic instruction is given, online tutorials can be used to help students acquire the basic skills needed to use technology. Following the acquisition of basic skills, teachers can construct activities and suggest learning games that reinforce classroom learning and aid in the acquisition of real-life skills with immediate rewards. Once students have mastered these skills, they may start to acquire  additional skills on their own through the Internet, focusing on the things they need to know. In addition, technology can be used in the instructional setting to develop critical thinking, problem-solving, communication, and collaboration skills. Ideas for using technology in the classroom include the following: asking students to create original sentences incorporating vocabulary words by using a word-processing program; using an encyclopedia on CD-ROM to learn more about a person featured in a story the students have read; arranging e-mail pen pal correspondence with an ABLE program in another area; having the class publish a program newsletter; using interactive Internet Web sites to help students analyze their diet; and asking students to use a word processing program to write  journal entries.

        "description":"A curriculum evaluation approach has been proposed that can enhance educators' understanding of how curriculum designed to effect social and vocational change in market economy cultures interacts with students, schools, and society. This method combines elements of a social evaluation approach fashioned by M.W. Apple and L.E. Beyer (1985) with a critical ethnography model developed by P.F. Carspecken (1995). It includes five levels or basic categories of inquiry. Stage 1 analyzes the social, historical, and ideological context into which the program is introduced and how that context is currently influencing school reform. It reveals the ideological connections between dominant social forces and school reform and identifies and critiques the various assumptions underpinning  vocational and social preparedness programs. Stage 2 identifies informal components of employability skills curriculum to consider their potential impact on students and society. Stage 3 requires a conceptual analysis of the employability skills discourse contained in the formal curriculum of programs, such as the Career and Personal Planning curriculum. Stage 4 uses an ethnographic collection of data to acquire knowledge of the dynamic interaction between curricula and classroom culture. Stage 5 analyzes findings from the previous four stages through a critical conceptual framework founded on principles of social justice and equality. (Contains 23 references.) (YLB)",

        "description":"Early in the 20th century, vocational education was a concern of educators in the United States as schools struggled to meet labor force needs during the shift from an agrarian to an industrial economic base. A 1914 Congress-authorized commission studied whether federal aid to vocational education was warranted. Charles Prosser, a student of social efficiency advocate David Snedden and principal author of the commission report, viewed separately administered and narrowly focused vocational training as the best way to assist nonacademic students in securing employment after school completion. The Smith-Hughes Act of 1917 specified noncompulsory programs and established a precedent of federal-state financing for vocational education. Snedden accepted social stratification as  inevitable and believed most students derived little benefit from traditionally organized academic studies. John Dewey, the most vocal opponent of Snedden's social efficiency framework, believed vocational education should be part of a comprehensive curriculum to help students develop expanded occupational options. The Vocational Education Act of 1963 expanded the scope and influence of job training in schools. The contrasting views of Snedden and Dewey revealed dialectically opposed positions on desired program format and on individual existential capacity and the moral responsibility of education in a democratic society. A morally appropriate model for vocational education would be the comprehensive democratic approach advocated by Dewey rather than separately administered, narrowly  conceived skills-based programs.

        "description":"The career preparedness component of British Columbia's Career and Personal Planning (CAPP) curriculum commits two fundamental category mistakes in its classification of employability skills, both with potentially serious consequences for education. The first type of category mistake is incorrectly conflating distinct categories of concepts under the general rubric of generic skills and, thereby, disregarding the contextual understanding, background knowledge, and epistemic attitudes required to achieve certain desired cognitive competencies. Concepts describing mental process such as understanding, problem solving, and critical thinking are applied in the same logical fashion as those denoting physical operations. Their evaluation in the prescribed fashion presents  insurmountable difficulties for teachers since mental process concepts are inseparable from the context in which they are used. CAPP makes available no pedagogical approaches that include a context for and adequate background knowledge of the problem to be solved; adequate content knowledge of the subject being communicated and the context in which the communicative act occurs; or facts relevant to the matter being critiqued. The second type of category mistake committed by CAPP is including values and attitudes under the rubric of generic employability skills and, in so doing, obscuring important ethical distinctions between the contentious area of values education and basic skills instruction.

The targeted students were the eighth graders in a suburban middle school in a growing metropolitan area. The problem of female students' falling self-esteem, loss of confidence, rigid adherence to gender stereotypes, and reduced interest in challenging classes was documented through research on the national level and at the research site through surveys, behavior checklists, and reflections. Analysis of data showed that students lacked interest in the class because they felt it was not relevant, they did not feel they were fairly treated in the class, and they adhered to gender stereotypes. A review of course content showed out-of-date  materials, sexist attitudes, and a lack of emphasis on relevance to students. A review of solution strategies suggested through research as well as an analysis of the problem setting resulted in the selection of the following interventions: gender equity education for the instructor, implementation of a gender-equitable pedagogy, and instructional strategies to increase confidence, skill, and relevance in the subject area. Post-intervention data indicated an increase in student engagement and a decrease in student off-task behaviors. Students' comfort levels increased during the class and students found relevance during the intervention.

At the junior and senior high school levels, IA is considered a subordinate subject, and students must elect IA or home economics. In accordance with Taiwan's new national curriculum standards, which will take effect in 1998, IA will be replaced by courses titled Living Technology (LT). At both the junior and senior high school levels, the new LT courses will emphasize the study of technology to equip youth with the living skills needed in a technological society. At present, male students take two periods of IA weekly. To reflect the value of gender equity education, all students (male and female) will be  required to take both the LT and home economics courses. The present number of hours required in IA will be cut in half to accommodate the increased number of students taking the LT course. Compared with IA, LT will be more systematic and interdisciplinary and place more emphasis on higher-order thinking skills (design and problem solving processes).

However, another school of thought stresses the social construction of knowledge and the social context of learning. Some writers challenge the exclusive emphasis on the autonomous self when discussing SDL and call for wider recognition of the interdependent and collaborative aspects of SDL. Several researchers have identified promotion of emancipatory learning and social action as a goal of SDL. However, serious obstacles to realization of SDL's emancipatory potential exist. Included among them are organizational cultures that limit learner control over the environment and the often-limited access of marginalized or  low-income groups to the Internet. The speed of information proliferation and the complexities of new social networks and workplace transformation will make SDL abilities imperative. It is possible that upcoming generations, especially those for whom the Web is becoming a natural habitat, are adapting to change by developing an SDL orientation. Whether SDL is individual or collective, emancipatory or oppressive, inevitable or not, the biggest misconception may be in trying to capture the essence of SDL in a single definition.

STWOA called for development of three main components in a school-to-work (STW) system: school-based learning, work-based learning, and connecting activities. Because of STW's emphasis on careers, many have erroneously assumed that STW is just about &quot;getting jobs for kids&quot; and have criticized STW because it fosters business involvement in education. However, national evaluation of STW has shown that college-bound and non-college-bound are about equally involved in the experiences  promoted by STWOA. Evidence also shows that STW programs linked closely with business have positive results. Although supporters of the STW approach view it as a way to reorganize education, this idea has not had wide appeal. At the micro level, STW has served young people as an avenue to an education that is connected to a career. At the macro level, however, STWOA-funded efforts have served as the basis for some school restructuring efforts but have failed to make broad inroads into the educational and reform movement.

        "description":"Although corporate spending on partnerships with education has more than doubled in the past 20 years, many in educational circles are questioning whether corporate contributions benefit student knowledge and learning development as well as corporations' bottom lines. Three examples of corporate giving that can be viewed from dual perspectives are information technology training programs, product distribution bonuses, and company-developed curricula. By linking school to work, business/industry partnerships have played a key role in keeping vocational education current with the skill demands of a changing workplace in order to attract students and prepare them for meaningful and relevant employment. Corporate support of education becomes most attractive to both schools and  corporations when the goals of both partners are considered. Business/industry partnerships with education must be consensus driven. Because negotiating partnerships can be difficult, a neutral third party may be helpful in facilitating communication between education and corporate communities. Business/industry partnerships cannot be exclusive of worker representation. Educators must understand that dollars contributed to educational institutions must reap rewards for the contributing business; however, business/industry must cease to view their financial contributions from a profit motive perspective and instead consider contributions to be investments in the future work force.

Networking with colleagues and participating in listservs such as CAREERTECH, which is maintained by the National Dissemination Center for Career and Technical Education, are two excellent ways to find and obtain recommendations for materials. Another great source of information for  vocational-technical educators is the World Wide Web, which includes websites of many commercial and nonprofit publishers and the Vocational Education Resources site. (A 32-item annotated bibliography constituting approximately 75% of this document lists the following: addresses of 9 commercial publishers and subjects covered by their publications; 5 curriculum labs; 3 curriculum consortia; 4 curriculum developers; 6 state/regional resource centers; 4 miscellaneous sources of vocational education materials; and 2 related resources.)

        "description":"A two-round Delphi study was conducted to identify the characteristics of viable and sustainable employees in northeastern Tennessee in 2015. The Delphi panel selected for the study consisted of 25 experts who represented a cross-section of the businesses and communities in the 10-county area of northeastern Tennessee served by Walters State Community College. The five characteristics receiving the highest rankings were as follows: strong work ethic, positive attitude, willingness to learn, and dependable/adaptable work personality. The characteristics receiving the lowest rankings were the following: ability to use statistical process control, oral presentation skills, and math skills. Establishing cultures where workers are valued, establishing on-the-job and in-house training  programs, and instituting participatory management strategies were deemed the important initiatives of successful companies in 2015. Initiatives considered less important to companies included replacing equipment, working with teachers to provide job shadowing experiences, and increasing the number of available internships. Initiatives increasing reading, math, and writing proficiency and initiatives facilitating collaborative curriculum development by industry and education were considered the most important initiatives required of public education.

The profiles focused on the following: students' and parents' characteristics and reasons for selecting a charter school; and available facilities, support staff, and support networks. In addition, each school's superintendent/head administrator described her school's STW component, its replication potential, and barriers to implementation of STW. The following were among the many similarities between charter schools and the STW concept identified: (1) both were rooted in current public sentiment; (2) both addressed the concern of how to make communities more responsible for preparing  children for the future; and (3) both operated on the belief that curricula should link learning to the world beyond the classroom and allow students to explore ideas based on their own interests. At all three charter schools, STW systems were aiding in the observation and documentation of students' progress through partnerships with local businesses and organizations. (The report contains 10 references. Appended are transcripts of interviews with each school's superintendent/head administrator and statistical graphs on the three schools.) (MN)",

        "description":"More than 100 years have passed since the death of Uno Cygnaeus (1810-1888), the father of Finnish folk schools and pioneer of educational arts and crafts. His accomplishments include design and organization of the folk school system, initiation of high class teacher training, and emphasis on the importance of women's education. Although his academic discipline was theology, the basis for his educational theory shows the influence of classic authorities on education and international studies. The contents and aims of his teaching must be understood as reflections of the time rather than as eternal truths. Research in teacher training has a good start in Finland. Historically, the Teacher Education Department of the University of Jyvaskyla has had a central role in development of  teacher education in Finland. The training sets used by all teacher training colleges and schools since 1912 have been abandoned with the introduction of the comprehensive school system in the 1970s. Over the years, the facilities, materials, tools, instruments, and machines available to teaching handicrafts have improved. Basic courses in technical handicrafts offered by Finnish teacher education institutions teach wood, metal, and plastic products. The latest trend in handicrafts teaching as part of general education is technology education. One objective is to help the pupil gain competencies needed in coping with everyday life, job assignments, and hobbies and to guide him or her towards post-compulsory education.

        "description":"A national survey of adult basic education (ABE) teachers examined practitioners' perceptions of, and experiences with, health issues and topics in ABE classes. Of the 1,621 surveys mailed out, 636 (39%) were returned. Of the respondents, 41% taught in rural settings, 35% taught in urban settings, and 23% taught in suburban settings. Most (93%) of the teachers considered the adult learning setting an appropriate setting to teach and learn about health. Nutrition was the most common health topic to have been discussed in ABE classes. Those teachers who had included health units in their ABE classes viewed health lessons as enhancing skills in the areas of dialogue and discussion, vocabulary building, reading, language development, and critical thinking. Overall, those adult  educators who had taught health gave health high ratings as a content area supporting curriculum goals. Although teachers' definitions of health literacy tended to focus on health information, the idea of functional health literacy appeared to be gaining greater attention. It was concluded that health educators must collaborate with adult educators to enlarge the concept of functional health literacy and include more emphasis on skills to promote medical communication, access to health services, and patient advocacy.

Teaching ideas include such suggestions as asking students to write down powerful sentences, to jot notes in their journals about specified units, and to place a sticky note on pages where they find something interesting and every chapter or two doing a Think-Pair-Share. A few chapter-specific suggestions are made for chapters 1, 5 (a sketch to stretch activity), 7 (an Agree? Disagree? Why? activity), and a culminating activity. The next section discusses the field testing of these teaching ideas in two widely diverse learning situations--an urban family literacy program and a tutoring program  in a corrections facility--in which both teachers reported enthusiastic student response despite initial resistance. Teacher changes are then described. The final section presents some readers' responses. (YLB)",

        "description":"This report studies how public community colleges in different states are approaching and fitting into the one-stop career center system (OSCCS). The comparison study analyzes state and federal legislation to determine the following: OSCCS development; how OSCCs are involving public community and technical colleges; the different roles these colleges can assume within the OSCCS; and the pros and cons of OSCCS for these colleges. Chapter 1 addresses what is wrong with the work force development system. It covers the work force development system bureaucracy and creation of an integrated delivery system. Chapter 2 paints an historical picture of the work force development system in the United States. Chapter 3 covers the composition of the OSCCS. Chapter 4 depicts the history of  public community and technical colleges and their role as work force development entities. It also compares the services of public community and technical colleges with what is required to function as a U.S. Department of Labor-approved OSCCS. Chapter 5 presents case studies of four states: Iowa, North Carolina, Oregon, and Texas, analyzing the role of public community colleges within the OSCCS in each state. Chapter 6 concludes the report and lists the following recommendations: pass federal block grant legislation; allow a sliding scale for services; market the OSCCS; link the one-stop, school-to-work, and skill standards development initiatives; and make community colleges the preferred provider of training services for the OSCCS.

        "description":"This manual explains what graduated driver licensing (GDL) is and why the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration believes it is so important for every jurisdiction to take steps towards its implementation. Section I introduces the need by defining the teen driving problem: inexperience, risk-taking behavior and immaturity, and greater risk exposure. Section II compares the traditional licensing process with the GDL process, which includes three stages: learner's permit, intermediate license (or provisional license or junior license), and full license (or unrestricted license). For each stage, minimum eligibility requirements, core components, and recommended components are outlined. Section III explains how GDL has been shown to be effective by expanding the learning  process, reducing risk exposure, improving driving proficiency, and enhancing motivation for safe driving. Examples of how the community can promote GDL and questions and answers on GDL are provided. Section IV presents research results from three states (Maryland, California, and Oregon) that have evaluated the effect of their GDL on teen crashes and traffic convictions. Experiences in New Zealand and Ontario, Canada, are also reported. Section V focuses on support for GDL from the public at large, teen drivers, and parents. Section VI makes the argument for states' adoption of GDL. Appendixes include a model law; characteristics of selected U.S. licensing laws; teen crash statistics; federal, regional, state, and private sector organization resources; and 11 resources. A brochure with  questions and answers on GDL is provided. (YLB)",

        "description":"Workplace and educational changes related to gender in Louisiana in 1996-97 suggest some progress but a continued need to reduce wide gender gaps in some occupational areas. Workplace data show a closing gender gap, but changes are occurring at different rates for different areas. Women's share of the total labor force continues to rise; wage differences by gender continue; women-owned businesses increase; and secretaries and cashiers are still predominantly female. Both secondary and postsecondary systems have increased enrollment. Slightly more females are enrolled in vocational programs, but males are about five out of six students enrolled in programs not traditional for their gender. The largest number of nontraditional enrollees are males in secondary business and home  economics programs. Slow, steady progress continues in female participation in industry programs, the area of greatest gender disparity. Agencies with projects continue to use diverse recruitment, retention, and placement strategies for increased participation of nontraditional students. The state has awarded 108 grants to educational agencies for implementation of projects for sex equity and single parents, displaced homemakers, and single pregnant women. Of project students with known outcomes, 33.5 percent are still enrolled in their vocational programs and making satisfactory progress, and 26.8 percent have completed their vocational programs and been employed in standard or above-standard positions.

It foresees constant development in the size of the labor force up to 2010, followed by a shortage of labor across the labor market from 2010-2020, and a drop in the labor force almost to the present level by 2040. It recommends more flexible work instruments, globally oriented flexibility, and provision of services for working women. &quot;Organization of Work: Supreme Authority Rests with the Team&quot; (Christoph Stehr) focuses on the &quot;Oticon  system,&quot; named for a Danish hearing aid manufacturer. It discusses the manufacturer's innovative management style that proves business objectives can be achieved by &quot;soft&quot; changes, e.g. in the way work is organized. It describes the open-plan office that provides for no fixed workplace (no desk) and self-organized work. &quot;Working Hours: Change Begins in the Mind&quot; (Ruth Lemmer) addresses flexibility in the workplace. It discusses the Augel model of a construction firm where all workers receive a fixed monthly salary: they stipulate the number of hours they wish to be paid for each month, with extra hours booked into an account. Common models of flexible working hours are described: flexitime, part-time work, job sharing, and time accounts to save time for a sabbatical or early retirement.  (YLB)",

It provides insights that can help parents develop in their children the will and skills to resist the lure of cigarettes, alcohol, and drugs. One thousand boys and 1,000 girls age 12-17, and 1,000 parents (536 mothers and 464 fathers) were surveyed. The two most striking conclusions found were: many dads are AWOL in the battle against substance abuse and this greatly increases the risk that their children will smoke, drink, and use illegal drugs; and Parent Power (parental influence) has tremendous untapped potential to help children resist substance abuse. Drug use in schools was also examined. Some positive results were found. The percentages of teens  citing drugs as their biggest problem, teens reporting that the drug situation in school is getting worse, and teens who have never had a serious conversation with their parents about the risk of using illegal drugs have decreased. The percentages of teens who do not expect to use drugs in the future and teens who attend a drug-free school have increased.

These comparisons yielded significant changes on thirteen of the twenty dimensions, including general affect, positive affect, negative affect, anger, depression, coping via escape methods, level of functioning, mental coping methods, mental health, psychosis, seek professional help, spouse perception, and stress perception. Results show the greatest amount of improvement on the scales that measure emotional dimensions (affect, negative and positive affect, anger, and depression). Since most of the clients had presented complaints of depression and  stress-related emotional problems, it appears that therapy over the course of six weeks had its greatest effect on the kinds of problems these clients were experiencing. In addition, clients showed improvement in the use of mental methods of coping with stress and tended not to escape as much as a means of coping. Their level of daily functioning improved slightly and they reported fewer symptoms of mental health distress, personal stress, and psychotic symptoms. There was a slight improvement in perception of their spouses. At the end of therapy, they were more likely to seek professional help. No changes were observed on the seven psycho-social dimensions.

The program begins with a brief videotape of three students (representing international students, sexual minorities, and students of color) discussing what they need from faculty and staff. Participants are then introduced to various advocacy issues, such as confidentiality concerns and walking the fine line between supporting and pushing students to take action. With increased empathy and diversity awareness as primary goals, the next sections of the program combine exercises, readings, discussion, and  information to address these issues. The final part of the program requires participants to discuss several questions that highlight diversity issues at their particular institution. After discussing issues, each small group presents their best solution for addressing a concern at the institution. To close the program, participants delineate some personal commitment to improve campus climate with respect to diversity and are awarded their Safe Harbor certificates. (Contains 15 references.)

Also explored are ways in which ethical issues encountered during research activities can be handled. This paper examines the idea that squandering scientific opportunities in poorly designed and weakly analyzed research makes for bad ethics because scientific data are expensive in terms of time, effort, money, and other resources.

The work of projects in Kentucky, Maine, Minnesota, New Mexico, and South Carolina and the centers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and the University of Maryland at Baltimore are outlined. Outlined are complimentary activities of the projects and national centers. For example, the University of Maryland center has created a major annual national conference dedicated to advancing school mental health. The center at UCLA collaborated with other  organizations on regional and national invitational meetings designed to advance strategic objectives. Other complementary activities are seen with needs assessment and resource mapping. The Baltimore center focuses on clarifying the mental health needs of students and maps the services schools provide for meeting needs. The center at UCLA focuses on clarifying policy considerations that have resulted in fragmented and marginalized approaches to mental health in schools. The document concludes with a discussion of ways to enhance the continuing development of initiatives to foster widespread adoption in of mental health programs in schools.

It analyzes 30 interviews of girls, 15-18 years old, who are juniors in suburban and urban high schools. The key finding was identified as the dilemma of desire. Girls responded to the dilemma in three ways: simply not feeling the desire, resisting their own desire, or making a claim to their own desire. No pattern was found of race, ethnicity, or social location in each of these resolutions voiced by the girls. A narrative of one female's sexual encounters and a description of her sexuality is included.. Sexual desire, like all other forms of desire, can be empowering, instrumental in girls' confidence in themselves, essential to their agency, a compass for making decisions about  relationships and sexuality, and a road to knowledge about self and relationships. We have to make it possible for girls to get beyond \"it just happened\" by fighting for girls' right to feel and act upon their own sexual feelings without having to be encumbered by the dilemma of desire.

Participants were culturally diverse middle school students from low to middle class families. Interviews were conducted to determine reasons for missing school. Responses included illness, lack of motivation mostly from academic failure, lack of connectedness to school, and waking up late. An intervention program included the following components: (a) bi-weekly group meetings during homeroom; (b) student contract daily attendance sheets; (c) discussion sessions regarding issues of non-school attendance and goal setting for academic achievement; and (d) on-going contact with parent and community liaison personnel. Success measures were reported by comparing  baseline attendance data across 10 weeks of program implementation. An increase in motivation to attend school was determined by administing a post questionnaire. Data analysis revealed that use of peer group sessions resulting in reduction of excused absences for all students involved. Parents' participation in reporting their child's absense was reported as being responsive and supportive. (Contains 24 references and five appendixes.) (Author/JDM)",

        "description":"The partnership described focuses on a severe problem with environmental pollution at Akwesasne, the Mohawk reservation situated along the St. Lawrence River, at the juncture of New York, Quebec, and Ontario. Industries are located along the river and its tributaries and in past years have discharged PCBs (and other toxins) into the waterways in and near the reservation. The community residents are very concerned about the effects of the toxic intrusion into their previously harmonious relationship with the natural environment. Community members worry that Akwesasne children may have been exposed in utero from accumulated maternal PCBs, from being breast fed, or from their own diet or contact with the water or adjacent air. The study described concerns the effects of PCBs on the  physical, sexual, cognitive, and social development of adolescents at Akwesasne. The research questions address the relationship between the adolescents' exposure to PCBs (assessed by diet history), body burden of particular congeners (types) of PCBs (assessed by blood analysis), and their physical, sexual, cognitive, and social/behavioral functioning. The collaborative process between the community members and the researchers is detailed, focusing on the three principles of respect, equity, and empowerment. (Contains 13 references.) (GCP)",

It details many of the serendipitous events that led him from a child of poverty to a life rich in academic achievements and social rewards. This interview details many of his contributions to the counseling and educational literature, as well as his early life influences, including that of Carl Rogers. Dr. Patterson's views on person-centered counseling and psychotherapy, based on Rogers' philosophy, are still widely debated. This chronicle of the life experiences of C.H. Patterson provides a context for understanding his support of the person-centered approach, as well as an insight into his significant life  events. (JDM)",

        "description":"This article explains that the phenomenological approach in counseling began as a movement to counterbalance the influence of psychoanalysis in psychotherapy and counseling. Phenomenology is defined as the study of the world as we immediately experience it, pre-reflectively rather than as we conceptualize, categorize, or reflect on it. Through dialogue, we grasp the essence or common meaning of co-constructed lived experience. The counselor's understanding of the client is a shared experience brought about through such dialogue. Counseling approaches as they relate to phenomenology are discussed, including transpersonal, person-centered, and existential counseling. The article concludes that phenomenology differs from both positivism and post-modernism because it emphasizes the  subjective meaning of each individual and the essence of human lived experience. Recommendations are provided for counselors, including being cautiously aware of their influence on the interaction between client/participant and himself/herself. Also included is a discussion of the similarities between the counselor and researcher approach to phenomenology in focusing on the here and now meaningful experiences of participants.

        "description":"This paper explores the complexities in transitioning from the role of a counselor to that of a counselor educator, integrating a review of the literature on counselor pedagogy with personal experience. The role of the counselor, the teacher, and the parallels and disjunctions between those roles as well as possible ways to bridge them are among the topics examined. The paper discusses the apparent dearth of discussion and debate in the literature concerning the process of counselor education and supervision and the demands of the counselor educator role. In an effort to explore these concerns, the paper first traces the counselor role and its implications, focusing primarily on attributes of counselors. The role of the teacher is similarly explored for comparison with that of  the counselor. Supervision is suggested as a potential conceptual bridge between counseling and teaching since it is as close to either role and shares much in common with both. Supervisors do engage in raising awareness, helping supervisees to examine aspects of themselves that may be stimulated by the process, as well as general self-exploration about professional development, ethical issues, or even personal issues. The paper concludes with a discussion on the process of becoming a counselor educator, subsequent learning experiences, and a beneficial model for the educating of counselors.

An overview of Gestalt techniques is provided, concentrating on the two category divisions of experiments and exercises. This paper focuses on clinical rather than non-clinical settings, in which there is a responsibility to engage in ethically sound strategies with clients. The discussion continues with an overview of the importance of ethical guidelines for licensed practitioners and the relative merits of credentialling, training, and expertise when preparing to engage in such techniques as those associated with Gestalt theory. Examples of  experiments are provided which help illustrate the dilemma of the ethical issues involved in the implementing of Gestalt techniques. The paper concludes with a discussion of concerns expressed by experts, including inappropriate use of Gestalt techniques and inappropriate selection of clients, misuse and abuse of techniques, and the professional's personal sense of ethical behavior.

Participant interviews consisted of the completion of several instruments including a personality inventory, a measure of agentic versus communal values, an instrument that examines masculine and feminine approaches to spirituality and work, and a spirituality inventory. The women in this study are unique in having been selected for a highly competitive program and for selecting a non-traditional career. Results show that the dye was cast in childhood, as participants were involved in non-traditional play. They report that they are not religious, but eight reported communicating with something that transcends them and  influences their lives. They by and large come from Middle America and are middle to lower income. They completed traditional female type chores as children, and most are married and have children of their own. Birth order seems to have nothing to do with who they have become. Participants are equally family and work oriented, and are women who want to provide, as well as nurture. They get job satisfaction from competence, intellectual stimulation, empowerment, and success, and these are far more important to them than traditional executive power. For the most part, they are open, team players. (Contains 1 figure, 4 tables, and 13 references.) (MKA)",

        "description":"This paper explores the concept that the experience of growth may be structurally similar to the emotional experience of religion and hope. It develops this view by focusing on two studies that involve a series of coping and outcome variables, together with analysis of Park, Cohen, and Murch's (1997) instrument on stress related to personal growth. One study involved parents who lost a child of their own due to an accident or incurable illness, and the second, involved a questionnaire study with spinal cord injured persons. The findings strongly support the view that non-normative life-events may lead to a more coherent worldview, a view that might be more tolerant, more human, and more open to new thoughts. Evidence was found linking the experience of personal growth with  involvement in social activity and it also found positive relationships with the variables of distress. It concludes that persons whose lives seem to be meaningful might have a good capacity to link together even detrimental events and still hold a strong sense of coherence. (Contains 16 references.)

        "description":"This article discusses three issues concerning the field of psychology: modern psychology and its definition of mental health; Japanese ideology and its definition of mental health; and applicability of Western methods of psychotherapy to other cultures. There are at least two different definitions of good mental health and most psychotherapies in use today have developed in response to a need to promote healthy adjustment. There are at least two main problems with the definition of good mental health in modern psychology. First, the definition diminishes the value of human relationships, and second, it is not healthy for everyone in the world to follow a pre-determined ideology housed within a specific culture. The Japanese definition of mental health also has its unique  problems, and some traditions within the Japanese culture have a tremendous impact on an individual's mental health. In summary, every definition of mental health has its own particular strengths and weaknesses, just as each society has its own strengths and weaknesses. If psychology is going to move towards a more international approach, the most important thing may be to acknowledge the validity of each definition and each value system. (Contains 21 references.)

        "description":"Client-centered, psychoanalytic, and release and structure play therapy approaches have diverse philosophical viewpoints about the therapist's role, goals of therapy, and use of structuring in play therapy. While each approach aims to help children cope with emotional difficulties, the methods employed and the play therapy process differ substantially across each of the theories. The client-centered method emphasizes the facilitative role of the therapist including the qualities of genuineness, unconditional positive regard, and empathic understanding. This approach's primary goal is self-directed growth and change in the child. In child-centered play theory, structuring is considered an important process early in play therapy. In psychoanalytic play therapy the therapist  encourages the development of a transference relationship where the child projects early experiences, feelings, and thoughts onto the psychoanalyst. The main objective of this play therapy method is to promote communication of wishes and fantasies so that children develop a tolerance of their feelings and can function fully at their level of cognitive development. The emphasis of therapeutic structure in psychoanalytic play therapy is upon consistency in the play setting. In release/structured play therapy the therapist assumes an active role in planning the play therapy process. In release therapy the therapist provides security, support, and materials needed to recreate a traumatic event so that the child may assimilate the negative thoughts and feelings associated with a trauma. As its  name implies, structured play therapy emphasizes the creation of a structured environment for working through the child's problems. (Contains 11 references.) (Author/MKA)",

To ensure that graduate students are gaining the skills necessary to function effectively in the current healthcare environment, training programs may need to modify their curricula. Recently, the American Psychological Association assembled a task force to outline managed care-related educational guidelines for graduate programs. This investigation explores Training Directors' (TDs) views on the importance of specific task force guidelines and relative coverage of the skills in their doctoral training programs. Results indicate that TDs rate the perceived importance of the task force recommended skills as greater than the extent to which these skills are currently being covered in training  programs. Additionally, the study examines how this relationship is mediated by faculty attributes, student career objectives, and program characteristics. Although there are some correlations between demographic factors and the coverage and/or importance of the task force skills, none of them seemed to consistently predict the coverage and/or importance of the skills. Suggestions are made for integrating managed care-related skills into training programs. (Contains 13 references.) (Author)",

The dual career family currently represents the most common married unit. Because both work and family stress impact psychological well-being variables such as depression and self-esteem, family and work can not be understood as two separate and distinct domains. Rather, they must be considered interactionally and interdependently. The impact of dual career lifestyle encompasses all family members. Family therapy, with its emphasis on family interactions and interconnectedness, provides a clinical framework for addressing the issues inherent in dual career lifestyles. This review of the literature covers topics including the impact of dual-career lifestyle on family  relationships, issues for women in dual career families, issues for men in dual career families, and the impact on children. Implications for family therapy are also discussed. The literature suggests that family therapists have three fundamental responsibilities for counseling dual career families. Family therapists assist families in negotiating roles, values, and traditions; advocate for family support in the work environment; and, consult organizations about system dysfunctions. Themes in family counseling relating to dual career families include boundaries between self and others, expectations about roles and responsibilities, shared decision making, support, and marital intimacy.

Yet, school, rehabilitation, and mental health counselor education programs do not require expertise in this area as a prerequisite to receiving a degree. This digest focuses on identification of counseling outcome research implications for counseling individuals with substance abuse problems and highlights the following conclusions regarding counseling individuals with substance abuse problems: (1) All counselors will counsel individuals with presenting or related problems of substance abuse; (2) Counselors counsel and  empower individuals with substance abuse problems versus treating the substance abuse problem; (3) Counselors must be able to establish the same open, collaborative, and therapeutic relationship in counseling individuals with substance abuse problems as they do with other client populations; (4) Counselors must focus the counseling relationship on addressing the client's presenting problems directly and identifying client need for change (5) Counselors must know community resources and procedures for referral to be able to insure access to effective and appropriate support services for clients.

These less sensational but equally harmful violent behaviors warrant appropriate response. This digest describes the importance of assessment and diagnosis with potentially violent and violent students. Students with the potential for violence usually present a number of common risk factors. These risks are: violent drawings or writings, threats of violence towards others; past violent behaviors or aggressive history; animal torturing; recent relationship break; isolation; teased or perceptions of being teased, harassed, or &quot;picked on;&quot;  inappropriate use or access to firearms; substance abuse; familial stressors; noted by peers as being &quot;different;&quot; and low school interest. The 13 risk factors will not identify every violent students, but they can be readily used by school counselors and other mental health professionals as an aid in assessing students at risk of violence.

        "description":"The school reform movement has been a major societal and political agenda item for nearly two decades. As a result of the pressure stemming from the movement to make schools more effective, many changes have occurred. The most obvious of these changes is an increased emphasis on assessment. Furthermore, school counselors, like teachers and administrators, are now expected to play an important role in the school reform movement. This digest is designed to outline a number of strategies and techniques that school counselors can use to meet the challenge of improving student achievement. One strategy that is highlighted is that of improving school climate. School counselors can improve the climate of their schools by advocating for policies that promote rather than detract from the  personal and educational development of students. Counselors are also encouraged to draw from a vast array of interventions that will help students increase their academic achievement. These interventions include behavioral contracts, study skills groups, time management training, classroom guidance units aimed at improving test taking skills, and achievement motivation groups. The final technique advocated is that of involving parents through parent consultation and parent education classes. (Contains five references.) (GCP)",

Antecedent conditions and functional communication were addressed in the behavior plan using a schedule board based on the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS). After implementation of the PECS intervention, disruptive and aggressive behavior decreased dramatically with a concurrent increase in cooperative behavior. Appropriate behavior during transition times was maintained throughout the remainder of the school year. The case study provided illustrates the usefulness of a functional picture communication board and daily schedule for a young child with pervasive  developmental disorder.

        "description":"This paper describes the experiences of a psychologist and social worker trainer from 1992-1995 as she traveled throughout Post-Peristroika Russia and Eastern Europe working with families. The author describes how being in another country caused her to adjust her notions of what is &quot;normal,&quot; and she discusses how culture contributes to who we are. The paper briefly discusses the work of Virginia Satir, the mother of family systems theory, in this part of the world during the 1980's. The following impressions of the atmosphere were observed by the author: As Eastern European countries and Russia undergo dramatic political, economic, and social shifts, every aspect of family and personal life is affected. Today, reports indicate high levels of crime and violence among youth. There  are great stresses for families because of limited family resources. There are more concerns about acting out behaviors among teens. Some of the programs which are said to have served young people well, such as Pioneer camps in the summer are now gone. Parents, especially because of their memories of Pioneer Camp, express their disappointment in this change. As these roles and family functions change the multi-generation family may be at risk but attentive parenting continues to remain strong. Social work, believed unnecessary in the former Communist republic, is now an emerging profession in these countries. The author discusses her part in helping to advance this profession during her travels. (MKA)",

        "description":"Neither public nor private agencies address the extensive religious involvement that children and youth receive in child care facilities and foster home placement situations. In a five-state mid-west study (N=252), this paper examines religious practices in foster homes. The study identifies a strong Christian-based affiliation of foster homes. The findings illustrate the daily, weekly, and monthly religious rituals practiced in foster homes including grace at meals, bedtime prayers, church-going, and religious social groups activities. These activities complement the process of moral development in children through religious involvement. The pervasiveness of religious practices and beliefs as reported suggests that even when both parents of these out-of-home children do not  stipulate a preference for a specific religiously-affiliated foster home, the experience of the foster child will probably include practices and education in a specific religious persuasion. Though foster parents generally state that they allow the child to choose to be involved in the religious activities of the home, anecdotal evidence exists to suggest that while some children gain a great deal from involvement in the religious practices of the foster home, other foster children have experienced both confusion and rejection due to the demands by foster parents to be involved in religious activities. Child-serving agencies and government social services should take heed that foster parents are of the opinion that the issues of religion and religious involvement of foster children is not  adequately addressed by agencies at orientation and placement. In this study, only two states had any training in this area. (Contains 6 tables and 15 references). (Author/MKA)",

Rationalized by the Nazi's leadership as a method to achieve a &quot;pure&quot; and &quot;perfect&quot; race, the uncovering of the Holocaust to those outside German-occupied areas came as a shock at the end of World War II. Teaching about the Holocaust in schools of social work provides educators and students with a contemporary situation where students can examine issues of social morality, consequences of war, and other types of sanctioned social violence. Students can examine global issues of social justice, ethic (nationalistic) hatred cycles, and religious tolerance. From research, social workers and psychotherapists can also learn  about the psychosocial effects of severe trauma experienced by survivors of the Holocaust and the impacts to second and third generation children of survivors and children of perpetrators.

        "description":"This presentation outlines the implications of psychiatric disability recovery for mental health systems and programs. Schizophrenia and other serious psychiatric disabilities have been viewed as irreversible illnesses with increasing disability over time. Mental health program planning, policies, and practices have been developed and implemented to support this uncompromisingly negative view of the predicted outcome for people with psychiatric disability. Current research studies report that one-half to two-thirds of people with serious mental illness significantly recover over time. Because of this new and hopeful possibility of recovering, a shift in how systems, programs, and people assist people is required. The first recommendation made is that recovering and the values  that support recovering must be strongly affirmed and explicitly identified in the mission statement of the system or program. Additionally, goals and services that support recovering should be identified and affirmed in the mission statement. Along with this, the principles that support the values, goals, and services should be identified and affirmed, as well as cautions in implementing recovering models. Finally, the provision of education and the support of qualitative and quantitative research efforts are essential in assisting people to deal with the barriers and to build in the facilitators.

        "description":"This paper focuses on two aspects inherent in working with families--fantasies and realities. A brief discussion of family life in the United States at the end of the 20th century is included at the outset with the intention of identifying who families are before making a diagnosis or intervention. The author encourages counselors to recognize the fantasies they hold about working with families, and to be wise enough to give them up in order to make a positive difference in the lives of clients. Seven deadly fantasies are presented as well as the seven realities that are at the opposite end of these fantasies. It is emphasized that in family work, it is essential to realize in a continuous way that family counseling deals with families who may be resistant to change and that some  families have a limited ability to receive help. It is also important to keep in mind that family counseling differs from other ways of counseling and that working with families is sometimes difficult. Therefore, it is suggested that counselors be aware of the non-events of family life as well as the developmental and situational factors that are a part of all families. Finally, counselors need to be mindful that families come in many forms, are interesting in and of themselves, and that in order to be effective as counselors, must know a range of theories and techniques.

The five case studies that form this symposium examine the ways in which children's experiences at school are directly related to their parents' knowledge of school structure and bureaucracy; self- confidence in making demands of the school; educational background and ability to assist in homework and other school projects; and the time, energy, and money resources to provide resources ranging from school supplies to tutoring to extra-curricular activities. Furthermore, they document the relationship between student school success, on the one hand, and on the other hand, the ability of parents to wield their resources in supervising and monitoring  their children, providing emotional, intellectual and financial support to them, and interceding on their behalf when necessary. The theoretical model underlying the research in the symposium is included. The model reflects earlier work and indicates that parental action is strongly determinative of school success and that family resources constrain the actions that families can take. The symposium case studies illustrate how the model works to create school success or failure. (Contains 16 references and 5 case studies.) (GCP)",

        "description":"Oppression of African American people includes racism, sexism, and classism. Oppression is understood as a process that infuses prejudice with power. This power is then used to limit or hinder access to societal rights from those identified as lacking power. Advocacy is a process that defuses prejudice and attempts to redefine power by redistribution, thus allowing for greater access for all. The goals are the betterment of the whole. This paper discusses slavery in the United States, the history of race oppression for African Americans, and the residual effects of oppression and explains that it is very important for advocates for African American people to have a good understanding of these issues. Eighteen suggestions to be used by teachers, educators, counselors, and  politicians as advocacy strategies to assist African Americans are provided.

        "description":"Linguicism was first defined as &quot;linguistically related racism&quot; in the early 1990s and only since 1992 have the courts begun to realize the legitimacy of discrimination based upon accent. Professional counselors have experienced the pain and oppression of linguicism in their own lives and in the lives of their family members, students, colleagues, and clients. In this paper ideas, guidelines, and resources for advocating against linguicism are presented. In terms of advocacy, linguicism is defined as prejudice multiplied by power used by members of dominant language groups against non-dominant language groups. Although found worldwide, this paper focuses on linguicism in the United States. This paper presents numerous examples of linguicism experienced by the authors personally  and examples encountered by counselors within their professional interactions. It is suggested that in order to operationalize multicultural competencies for counselors, those in the profession need to affirm languages and bilingualism, to question and challenge dominant culture/languages, and to consider how these variables may affect nondominant language client-colleagues. Standard English Privilege, unearned privileges that are conferred on members of the dominant language culture, is discussed. Ways in which counselors who have Standard English Privilege can be allies to persons oppressed by linguicism are examined.

        "description":"Helping professionals need to be more informed and more active advocates for proactive counseling strategies with Native American Indian and Alaska Native peoples. The paper discusses the major advocacy needs of these populations. The negative impact of historical and contemporary discriminatory policies and practices on Native peoples has devastated their standard of living and created major cultural conflicts. These influences have combined with substandard housing, malnutrition, inadequate health care, shortened life expectancy, and high suicide rates to limit opportunities for educational attainment by a population classified as the &quot;poorest of the poor&quot; in the United States. To further complicate matters, many Native individuals believe that they have no choice or control in  their lives. However, these problems are not insurmountable nor are Native individuals only victims and incapable of improving their lives. In reality, thousands of Native people have overcome their personal plights. The increase in the number and strength of advocacy efforts must be affected. This paper discusses the following issues: advocacy strategies to assist Native American and Alaska Natives; advocacy for expanding the political agenda; professional training programs; recruitment and training of native students; training of non-native students; advocacy for implications for practice; general issues and concerns; Native women's issues; the older Native individual with disabilities; implications for research; research relative to acculturation level; research relative to scientific  inquiry; and research relative to gender roles.

The same qualities must also be present when counselors use advocacy strategies. Successful advocacy, like successful counseling, requires rapport, unconditional positive regard, and equity, all of which are characteristic of the Latino cultural values and perspectives discussed in this paper.

In discussing the multiracial population it is first important to identify and define the groups that are under the heading of multiracial. The literature has included interracial couples, multiracial individuals, and families in which a cross-racial or transracial adoption or foster care arrangement has occurred. Definitions of these terms are provided. In working with the multiracial population, counselors are challenged to examine and address the deeply ingrained oppressive context by which society has viewed people of different ethnicities and cultures. Hence, advocacy with this population begins with honest exploration of the meaning society has attributed to the notion of race and the  open examination of what the notion has come to mean to individual counselors. Professionals in the counseling, human services, and educational fields are called upon to be multiculturally competent. This competency requires professionals to function as advocates and social change agents as they carry out traditional roles and responsibilities of their jobs.

It is not just the increasing numbers that make it important for counselors to serve as advocates for older adults. Ageism, societal marginalization, vulnerability, and elder abuse are growing problems for this population. There is evidence that advocacy works. Mandatory retirement has been eliminated, giving those who wish to work after 65 that opportunity. Social Security now pays benefits not only to wives and widows, but also to divorced women who were married for ten or more years. While factors point to the need for counselors to advocate for the needs of older adults and their families, caution is raised against treating older adults merely as people who need to be  served. Advocacy may mean helping older adults to advocate for themselves as well as intervening on their behalf. By definition, older adults are survivors, and as counselors and advocates it is important to help them identify and utilize the repertoire of coping skills they have developed over a lifetime. This paper discusses advocacy strategies including helping older adults to advocate for themselves; working with existing organizations; and advocating at the political level. A list of suggested resources provides contact information for professional associations as well as membership and advocacy organizations. Two suggested readings are also listed. (MKA)",

Definitions are offered for the following terms: sexual orientation, sexual preference, gender identity, heterosexism, and transgenderism. This paper offers that there are many ways for a professional counselor to be an advocate for LBGT individuals. One way for heterosexual and traditionally gendered persons to challenge heterosexism and transgenderism is to develop awareness and knowledge about the privileges that they enjoy as heterosexual and traditionally gendered people in society. A list is provided that identifies a portion of the privileges enjoyed by  heterosexual and traditionally gendered persons. It is also important for professional counselors interested in LBGT advocacy to have direct experiences with LBGT persons in a variety of professional and personal situations. This interaction provides a chance for heterosexual and traditionally gendered advocates to hone their awareness, knowledge, and skills so that LBGT persons do not always assume the lead in challenging heterosexism and transgenderism. LBGT individuals are oppressed in many ways. Because of the additive nature of multiple oppressions, people with additional nondominant cultural identities may be targets of multiple forms of persecution. Culturally competent advocates in counseling take all of a person's cultural identities into account when collaborating on advocacy  strategies. A list of advocacy strategies related to internalized and externalized oppression is also provided. A list if LBGT advocacy web sites is included as well. (Contains 12 references.) MKA)",

This paper examines gender advocacy, and the values assumptions undergirding it, largely in relation to equity and non-violence. Advocacy strategies and resources are presented throughout the paper. This paper also discusses the need for gender-based advocacy, barriers based on gender, and mixed signs of progress. A rationale for advocacy, the historical context of gender, a systems intervention strategy, gender advocacy across cultures, interventions for boys and men, gender-based advocacy strategies, continuing advocacy  for girls and women, new advocacy for boys and men, and strategies in counselor education are also examined. An ultimate ideal or goal for gender advocacy is to awaken &quot;critical consciousness&quot; of the importance and power of gender in one's life, of how it relates to and affects other identities, of how it interacts with the contextual and cultural issues, and how we can through advocacy transform the organizations, institutions, and communities which perpetuate violent and inequitable treatment of human beings.

In a national study of women who escaped from battering, participants rated the effectiveness of formal help sources from very effective to somewhat effective. Results from the study reveal that participants selected women's groups and battered women's shelters as more effective than counseling or social services. These results indicate that counselors have much work to do if they are to effectively serve clients and help end violence within society.

Background information on AIDS, from the first reported case in 1981 to current treatments, is provided. The use of revitalization counseling with AIDS patients, that is counseling that brings new life to an individual, is discussed. Counselors who work with AIDS patients are encouraged to use life-affirming, motivational methods that will help clients reach their goals, and therefore live longer. The lack of services available for AIDS patients, the stigmas placed by society on AIDS patients, and employment discrimination are some of the reasons why the need exists for advocacy. The author discusses how, through his own experiences as an  advocate, he has been able to educate others who have as a result of these encounters changed policies to be nondiscriminatory, learned more about law, and become more confident in his advocacy abilities. This paper suggests that through advocacy, counselors can aid their clients in becoming empowered to help themselves and others, and thus counselors enhance their own effectiveness as practitioners and human beings.

        "description":"Most counselors have had very little experience with indigenous methods of healing. Indigenous healing can be defined as helping beliefs and practices that originate over extended time within a culture that are not transported from other regions, and that are designed for treating the inhabitants of a given group. Most counselors would find great difficulty in working effectively with clients who use such methods. Yet, the increasing numbers of racial/ethnic minority groups in U.S. society have exposed helping professionals to a host of different belief systems. It is important for counselors to understand indigenous healing practices and their potential role as advocates. This paper discusses the case of a former Hmong soldier who was experiencing difficulty sleeping and  frequently had disturbing dreams. His resettlement worker enlisted the help of a highly respected shaman who through chanting and other rituals was able to put the man and his family at ease. This paper also discusses the role of advocates and becoming an advocate for indigenous healing. Mental health professionals must be willing and able to form partnerships with indigenous healers to develop community liaisons if they are to be effective advocates. (Contains 3 references.) (MKA)",

        "description":"Currently, women represent 30 percent of the drug-abusing population but are entering the prison system at a rate two times that of men. How can practitioners meet the pressing needs of offender women in treatment, prisons, and jails through the 1990s and the millennium? The correctional environment poses special advocacy challenges. The role of advocate can no longer be performed by any single entity. As advocates for quality service delivery, counselors and providers of care must collaborate with clients and others advocating for changes in public policy. Advocacy involves clients, their families, and the community. This paper discusses advocacy and empowerment as ways to improve an incarcerated woman's life. Eleven critical issues concerning advocating for change in public  policy are listed. Advocates are encouraged to inform the public and legislators about the problems related to addiction treatment for incarcerated women and about appropriate solutions. (Contains 3 references.)

Each year since 1975, about 17,000 seniors have participated in the survey, which is conducted in about 130 high schools nationwide. In addition, subsamples of seniors from previously participating classes receive follow-up questionnaires by mail each year. This analysis examines how work intensity (hours worked per week) is linked to indicators of psychosocial functioning and adjustment in a nationally representative sample of high school seniors from the classes of 1985-1989. Consistent with previous research, bivariate correlations were positive between work intensity and problem behaviors. However, once background and educational success indicators were  controlled, theses associations were diminished. The results indicate that work intensity does contribute directly and negatively to getting sufficient sleep, eating breakfast, exercising, and having a satisfactory amount of leisure time. These findings, together with the positive association between work intensity and frequency of dating, suggest that adolescents working long hours are adopting a &quot;harried young adult&quot; lifestyle. It briefly discusses conceptual and policy implications, including the likelihood that long hours of part-time work are as much a symptom as a cause of psychosocial difficulties.

The program is designed to: (1) monitor drug use and potential explanatory factors among American secondary school students, and other young adults; (2) distinguish which of three different kinds of change--maturational, historical, and/or cohort are occurring for various types of drug use; and (3) study causes, consequences, and maturational patterns associated with these different types of changes in drug use. Some 50,000 secondary school students in 435 schools are surveyed annually for the program. A follow-up survey of graduated classes yields a young adult sample of about 11,000 respondents in the age range of 19 to 32. The paper is divided into two parts. Part 1 contains the  theoretical background and conceptual framework, and Part 2 elaborates on the ten objectives, their rationale, and presents a synopsis of progress to date. Some objectives include monitoring drug use and potential explanations in grades 8, 10, 12, among young adults and with ages 34 and 40; distinguishing period, age, and cohort effects; explaining secular trends and cohort differences; assessing the consequences of drug use; studying frequent or heavy-users; studying various under-represented groups; and the methodological, policy and other contributions to the field.

Each year since 1975, about 17,000 seniors have participated in the survey, which is conducted in some 130 high schools nationwide. In addition, subsamples of seniors from previously participating classes receive follow-up questionnaires by mail each year. Information from the follow-up studies is examined in this monograph. The information concerns changes in drug use during the first 10 years after high school, and specifically focuses on the ways in which social roles and experiences in post-high school years relate to the use of cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine. Chapter one is an introduction, and chapter two provides a description of the sample in terms of roles  and experiences of each group at intervals post- high school. Chapters three, four, five, and six are devoted to types of drug use. Chapter seven summarizes the impacts of post-high school roles and experiences on drug use. Some general conclusions from the analyses include: (1) among full-time college students there is a larger than average increase in alcohol use; (2) being married is associated with reduction in use of alcohol; and (3) military service is associated with increased use of cigarettes and alcohol.

Monitoring the Future is designed to assess the changing lifestyles, values, and preferences of American youth on a continuing basis. Since the project started there has been a dramatic change in attitudes and behaviors that the project has been able to monitor, particularly concerning drug use. One important reason is that the basic study design described in the initial paper has remained constant in its fundamental characteristics and this consistency in survey methods is seen as a key condition for successfully measuring change. From the outset, the project was designed with  two interrelated components, an annual nationwide survey of high school seniors, and a periodic follow-up questionnaire mailed to subsamples of each class cohort. The project has monitored four kinds of trends: (1) changes common to all cohorts in a given historical period; (2) maturational changes or age effects which show up consistently in the longitudinal data; (3) changes from one graduating class to another; and (4) longitudinal changes reflecting the differential impacts of important post-high school environments and major role transitions.

The findings show that the military propensities of most young people are firmly formed by the end of high school, especially among men. Substantial majorities of these young men expecting &quot;definitely&quot; to serve actually do so, usually enlisting within the first year or two after graduation. Young women are less likely than young men to say they want to enter military service, less likely to expect to enter, and less likely to enlist. Higher proportions of Blacks enter the military than Whites or Hispanics. During the time covered by the study there were shifts in the proportions of high school seniors  expecting to enter military service, as well as in proportions planning for and entering college.

It examines these questions using cross-sectional and longitudinal panel survey data from large nationwide samples of high school seniors, many of whom were followed into young adulthood. Potential correlates of military propensity and predictors of enlistment are considered under three broad categories: family and demographic background; educational background and aspirations; and a wide range of values, attitudes, and behaviors. Generally, results show that for men high grades, college plans, and the college preparatory curriculum are negatively associated with propensity. The data also show lower than average  propensity among women with good grades and college plans. Results also show their views about the military in general, and particularly about employment conditions in the armed forces, are strongly associated with propensity and thus also with enlistment.

        "description":"Moving from high school into young adulthood is a critical developmental transition, a time of both continuity and discontinuity in health and well-being. How well one negotiates this transition, as evidenced by one's course of well-being and substance use, depends in part on historical cohort, gender, and life-path. Using U.S. national panel data from 17 consecutive cohorts from the Monitoring the Future study, this paper examines age-related change in well-being and substance use during the first four years following high school. It examines whether the changes varied as a function of cohort group, gender, and life-path group. Findings show that well-being and substance use increased during the transition to young adulthood. Although there were no overall differences in  well-being among the three cohort groups, findings show that the course of self-efficacy and fatalism during the transition differed somewhat among the cohorts. Men reported higher levels of well-being and substance use, except for cigarettes, than women. Overall differences in well-being and substance use were found across the life-paths. Limitations of the study and future directions for research are also discussed. (Contains 9 tables, 21 figures, and 68 references.) (MKA)",

        "description":"The data for this report were obtained from the Monitoring the Future study. Surveys from eighth, tenth, and twelfth grade respondents were used to examine adolescents' reasons for use, abstention, and quitting illicit drug use. Many reasons were found for drug use. Abstainers provided more reasons for their abstention than quitters gave for their quitting. The stages of drug involvement are explained and the connections between drug use and crime are discussed. A theory of drug epidemics is introduced. This theory proposes the following phases: the growth phase (awareness, access, motivation to use, reassurance about the safety of the drug, willingness to violate laws and predominant social norms); the maintenance phase; the growth phase; and the relapse phase. This report  concludes by offering that society's ability to control the relapse and to reduce the standing addict population will depend greatly on our understanding of the dynamic nature of the process, of the limitations of traditional supply reduction strategies, and on the importance of demand and demand reduction to the dynamics of such epidemics. Beliefs, attitudes, and norms regarding drugs are critical deterrents to use in the general population. For addicts, more substantial changes are clearly needed to change behavior, primarily in the form of effective treatment and rehabilitation. (Contains 2 tables, 8 figures, and 12 references.)

        "description":"This report discusses findings from the Monitoring the Future study in relation to adolescent cigarette preferences. Results show that in 1998, 19.1% of the eighth graders, 27.6% of the tenth graders, and 35.1% of the twelfth graders reported smoking within 30 days prior to the survey. By the time they finish high school, 65.2% of American young people say they usually smoke Marlboro. Newport and Camel accounted for most of the remainder. Those who have an established smoking habit are more likely to have a brand that they usually smoke. The proportion of adolescents who purchase their own cigarettes rises with age. There is no indication that the grade level at which a current smoker first began smoking cigarettes affects his or her current brand preferences. Marlboro appears to  be at least as popular among girls as among boys. Marlboro is the brand of preference for Whites (61% - 70%) and Hispanics (57% - 65%) while Newport is the brand of preference for African-Americans (71% - 82%). Marlboro is the leading brand in all four U.S. regions. Contains Appendix A: Text of Questions and Appendix B: Confidence Intervals and Selected Significance Tests for Three Cigarette Brands.

The symposium marked the centenary celebration in acknowledgement of Martin's pioneer efforts for women in the field of psychology. Psychophysics was concerned with the quantitative assessment of sense perceptions. Her dissertation work began by measuring different thresholds in weight perception to demonstrate that psychophysical measurements can be made to establish sensitivity to stimulus differences. In an attempt to determine differences to stimuli, Martin and her mentor, Georg Elias Muller, investigated factors that could affect the results of these measurements. Circumstances interfered with her completion of her work in psychophysics.  She went on to contribute other research to the field of psychology. (JDM)",

Moving students with disabilities into inclusive classrooms has meant that special educators have less control over managing the factors that foster student success. &quot;ClassMaps&quot; is a strategy for reinstating supportive elements into regular education classrooms that contain students with disabilities. It seeks to enhance academic and vocational success and reduce the need for pull-aside services for a large number of students with disabilities by raising the social and affective quality of the full-inclusion classrooms. It is a whole class mental health consultation model that makes the social and emotional elements of classrooms visible so that educators can  assess the impact of affective supports they provide. Early experiences with the &quot;ClassMaps&quot; model have provided promising evidence of the probes' utility and value. The evidence suggests that the consultation model is useful to teachers solving real problems of practice that occur within their schools. Results do show a need for revision of the Peer Relationship probe to insure broader dispersion of scores, enhanced representation of isolation as well as conflict issues, and enhanced reliability.

A questionnaire was completed by 231 students attending a college in the Midwest. A number of significant differences were found in the analysis. Subjects from intact families appear to hold more conservative attitudes concerning teenage sexuality and teenage pregnancy than those whose parents are divorced. Subjects from divorced homes viewed early sexual behavior and the consequences of teenage pregnancy less negatively. Studies have consistently shown that subjects from intact families were less comfortable turning to their parents for answers to questions about sex, believing that their parents would  disapprove if they knew that their teenager was sexually active.

        "description":"This study explores peer assessment and self-efficacy in a counseling practicum. Data was gathered on the perceptions of practicum students, in their second year of a master's program, with regard to the counseling competencies of their peers and themselves. Counselor self-efficacy was measured using the Counselor Self-Efficacy Rating Scale. Results indicate that the average competency rating for all students was in the above minimum competency range, with a mean score of 4.1 out of 5. The average self-efficacy rating for all students was 4.0 out of 5, indicating moderate agreement that they are confident in their counseling abilities and skills. Significant differences by gender were evident in both measures. Females viewed everyone as less competent, and indicated a lower  confidence (self-efficacy) in their counseling abilities and skills. It suggests that women have perceptions that a higher level of competency must be demonstrated to reach a particular category of competency and they are less confident than men are in their own skills. Videotaped interviews confirm the gender differences illustrated in the data regarding self-competencies. Peer assessment in counselor education is a necessary and powerful learning technique that counselor educators should consider. (Contains 27 references.) (JDM)",

These measures were administered to the same students one year later after they had been placed in three different ninth grade settings (high school, middle school, and ninth-grade only center). Results were analyzed by t-test and pre- and post-test mean difference effect sizes. High school, and to a lesser degree ninth-grade only placement, resulted in systematically higher levels of satisfaction than students who remained in a  middle school setting.

Sixteen female and 13 male students from a Southern research university participated by taking the Defining Issues Test. The paper reports that a significant difference in moral development was found between offenders and non-offenders. An analysis of responses appears to indicate the two groups of students are dealing with the same issues but from a very different cognitive perspective. The researchers find it likely that the nature and necessity of university policies are understood by students at a Conventional moral level, resulting in fewer policy violations. For students at a Pre-Conventional, egocentric moral level, it is reasonable  to assume that policies would be viewed as an unnecessary restriction on one's free will. Policies would be violated more frequently, resulting in more Pre-Conventional level students involved in disciplinary cases. The paper concludes that more research is needed in this area given the amount of time spent on discipline by student affairs professionals. (Contains 17 references.) (JDM)",

        "author":["Bohart, Arthur C."],
        "description":"There is relatively little theory on how psychotherapy clients self-heal since most theories of therapy stress the magic of the therapist's interventions. Of the theories that exist, this paper briefly discusses Carl Rogers' theory of self-actualization; and the dialectical theories of Greenberg and his colleagues, Jenkins, and Rychlak. Gendlin's theory is discussed in detail. It examines how we create new meaning, and in terms of psychotherapy, specifically how personality change can take place. Gendlin holds that as we encounter each new situation, there is an implicit potential for new development or &quot;the carrying forward&quot; of old concepts, rules, words, or ways of being. The theory proposes that the process of self-healing is a creative one of tuning into the implicit  experienced complexity of a problem, from which implications or new steps arise. This paper discusses Gendlin's theory in relation to personality change and implications for theory. The concept of self healing is examined and two counseling cases that utilize self-healing in different ways are discussed. The theoretical integration of self-healing is also discussed.

        "description":"The National Center for Educational Statistics 1998 Report stated that one in ten schools in their sample reported at least one violent crime over the past year. To promote school safety, educators have used traditional law enforcement methods that rely heavily on surveillance, penalties, and punishment. These methods applied to schools can be effective but they carry major negative side effects, including a large financial burden. This digest represents an alternative approach to creating and maintaining safe schools. The approach, known as Invitational Education, provides a framework for making schools more exciting, satisfying, and enriching. Invitational Education centers on four guiding principles of respect, trust, optimism, and intentionality. The Five P's of the concept,  people, places, policies, programs, and processes, provide the means to address the global nature and symbolic structure of schools. It expands the education process by applying steady and continuous pressure from a number of points. Rather than relying on one program, one policy, or one process, Invitational Learning addresses the total spirit within a school. It is concerned with more than grades, attendance, academic achievement, discipline, and test scores. It is concerned with the skills of becoming a decent and productive citizen in a democratic society. (JDM)",

        "description":"The increasing availability of inexpensive computer applications has become a major force in promoting the infusion of technology into the counseling field, yet the extent to which counselors and counselor educators use these resources is largely unknown. This Digest describes a survey to assess how competent counselor educators are in the technology skills they require their students to possess. The results of the Association for Counselor Education and Supervision (ACES) survey on technology competencies for counselor educators and students indicate that counselor educators and counseling students lack a uniform high level of technology competence. Given the likelihood that individuals interested in technology completed the survey, the results may overestimate the actual level  of competence among counselor educators and students. The paper suggests that research is needed to determine the relative importance of each of the technology competencies in the various settings in which counselors work. It states that it is also important to establish the extent to which the competencies are currently infused into counselor preparation programs, as well as determining strategies to promote technology training.

        "description":"This Digest states that the integration of research into counseling through an evidence-based approach actually brings the best elements of practice, clinical experience, and reliable treatment protocols together to serve the task of helping clients with the complex problems they bring to counseling. It gives several broad implications for the preparation of counselors and the practice of counseling. Research now points to a number of very stable trends that support the efficacy of some practices of counseling over others. These trends inform counseling practice and preparation, and form the basis of an evidence-based model of counseling. The trends can be categorized in two domains, those concerning the practice of counseling and those about the counselor. In determining the  factors needed for effective counseling, research points to a collaborative counseling relationship, the value of learning, and action through behavior change. The second domain of counseling research focusing on the counselor finds that a level of skillfulness, cognitive complexity, and ability to relate and relationally match with clients are important counselor contributions. It is essential for counselors to also have the knowledge and ability to assess the presenting problems of the client so that they can identify evidence-based protocols to apply these protocols in order to increase the likelihood that a successful intervention can occur.

        "description":"The revised approach to teaching and learning math in the United States emphasizes the mental processes involved in doing math and focuses partly on children's prior knowledge, out-of-school experiences, and informal mathematics knowledge. This engaging approach can function to encourage children to select one of the mathematical sciences as an occupation. This digest describes several conditions that are necessary before this can occur. Some factors that must be present include an increased focus on the paradigm of problem solving in math, as well as an effort to provide teachers with professional development concerning the goals of instruction and student learning. Those who have a stake in a child's development need to help reform the current state of low involvement in math  and science. School counselors are in the important position to help increase the number of students who select a mathematical science as a career option. Counselors can reduce biases by assisting in maintaining a balance between the mathematical preparation of all students instead of the trend towards encouraging only a select few to take higher-level mathematics courses. They can assist teachers to critically examine their relationships with students and help them provide opportunities for all students in their classes. They can facilitate the infusion of career exploration and knowledge of the mathematical sciences into all course content beginning in kindergarten. Beginning early in a student's academic life, the connection between what is being learned in school and future careers  and life roles should become an explicit part of everyday learning.

The study questioned whether higher levels of motivation lead to better student performance. College students were surveyed using the Intrinsic Goal Orientation and Extrinsic Goal Orientation scales of the Motivation Strategies for Learning Questions (MSLQ). Results indicate that students with a medium level of extrinsic motivation are more likely to perform well (in terms of their course grades) than students with either lower or higher levels of extrinsic motivation. Students who combined high intrinsic motivation with medium extrinsic motivation achieve particularly well.

This paper describes a program designed for improving these students' responsibility for their learning and behavior. Analysis of probable cause data revealed that students were not prepared for class, did not complete homework assignments, did not accept responsibility for their own behavior, and did not take responsibility for the classroom environment. Current reviews of the literature show that solutions to increasing student responsibility involve creating a positive, caring classroom environment and engaging student  learning by establishing meaningful instructional strategies. The goal of modifying the classroom setting was accomplished by creating classroom rules as a group, assigning weekly job responsibilities, and modifying the classroom decor. Changes to the learning environment were made through the use of cooperative learning, multiple intelligence activities, journals, offering choices, connecting with literature themes, and whole class discussions. Analysis of each intervention found that all helped increase students' responsibility for their learning and behavior. Teachers reported enjoying the positive changes in students' attitudes and felt closer to them as a result. Appendices contain research data. (Contains 46 references, 22 appendixes, and 21 tables.)

The targeted population consisted of 3rd, 4th, 9th, and 10th grade students attending schools in the Midwest. Analysis of probable cause data reveals that parental involvement can be insufficient and misdirected. Homework can lack relevance to content material, skills, and students' lives. Students may lack organizational skills and homework strategies to complete homework assignments. Data also indicates that poor student attendance can influence homework completion. A review of solution strategies resulted in the selection of two major categories of intervention: direct instruction of organizational and homework strategies, and the development and implementation of  individualized student homework contracts to increase student motivation to complete homework assignments. A comparison of the results of the pre-and post-intervention surveys was mixed. Post-intervention data at the high school sites showed that the homework completion rate did not change significantly. Although the results at the high school were not dramatic, the interventions for some individual students were extremely effective. All sites believed that the most successful and influential parts of the intervention for students was to stress the teaching of homework and organizational skills coupled with increasing parental involvement.

The Social Competence Promotion Program for Young Adolescents: Social Problem-Solving Module (Weissberg, Caplan, Bennetto, & Jackson, 1990) was selected based on the match between the needs assessment data and research literature on the program. Factors considered in helping implement the program included support from the administration, teacher buy-in, training, program  initiation with students, support to the teachers, and parental involvement. Mid-year data showed positive changes in problem-solving knowledge of complex items.

In addition to examining the role of self-evaluation when a student takes on and exercises control over an activity in the classroom, this paper takes into account homework assignments and the role of parents. Subjects (N=45) were in 6th-8th grade. They were distributed almost equally according to gender, grade level, and ability level. Twenty-nine parents completed a questionnaire about their child's homework assignment. The activity in class and the homework assignment consisted of a real-life mathematics task. The students compared products in two stores to choose the best bargains for a pre-determined checklist of school supplies. The mathematics  involved arithmetic operations, percentages, and problem solving. Findings show that results obtained by grade 6 students were significantly higher than those of grade 7 and grade 8 students. This finding might indicate that the task was easier for grade 6 students. No differences were found between boys and girls regarding success at the task completed in class or at home. Gifted students performed better and had a higher level of agreement with their parent concerning the homework. Results highlight the complexity of the interaction between metacognition and motivational self-regulated variables. The importance of further research in this area is discussed.

The zone may be fulfilled in student self-selection of reading materials through selection of sequential library books and student-teacher reading conferences evaluating the student's progress. With  relation to the Language Experience Approach (LEA), the zone of proximal development may be applied through the following steps: involving objects in the reading process, talking about them, writing down the discussion, and reading what has been written down.

        "description":"Hearing poetry read aloud should help pupils to achieve feelings of being relaxed and reenergized. Poetry might help pupils to achieve vital objectives in reading. Phonics instruction could become an inherent part of the reading of poems. For example, a student teacher and a cooperating teacher introduced pupils to a unit on &quot;Poetry with Rhyme&quot; which involved the teaching team reading personally composed couplets to pupils. Pupils were asked to choose two words which rhyme; peer writing was then emphasized with each set of two writers writing a couplet. Pupils again selected the two rhyming words to add to those contained in the couplet. Learners then brainstormed additional rhyming words having more than a single letter for an onset. There was much enthusiasm in brainstorming  sessions to obtain rhyming words. Learners seemingly were able to use the onset/rime approach to determine unknown words in reading as well as to use a variety of words to show clarity and diversity of words in written discourse. Triplets and quatrains were also written in this manner. Finally the teaching team led the class in writing a limerick, after they first prepared by reading two Edward Lear limericks and discovered the ingredients by observing the written form on the screen. Poetry writing can be an enjoyable way to learn what is useful in word recognition. (NKA)",

Although whole language proponents may not have clearly put forth an epistemology upon which their views of reading acquisition and the reading process are based, still a careful comparison of the tenets of postmodernism with the positions commonly identified with the whole language movement finds much similarity between the two. In this paper, these similarities are explored. It is suggested that the disagreement between whole language proponents and those supporting more traditional methodologies is mainly due to the differences between the scientific method and the postmodern philosophy adopted as the basis of  whole language.

Balanced literacy programs utilize both explicit skill instruction and authentic text. A study documented and discovered the enacted practices of an exemplary first grade teacher (with 24 students) using a &quot;balanced literacy program.&quot; The guiding questions for the study were: What components constitute the balanced literacy program in this classroom? What model has been adopted by the school district and is mandated through the curriculum? Is this the model the teacher articulates and enacts? If there are differences between the espoused model and the enacted model, what are they and why are they present? What does the teacher's daily and  weekly literacy practice look like? An interpretive approach was used to gather an array of data. A thorough description of the classroom environment was documented through fieldnotes, photos, and mapping. An interview protocol was used to record the perceptions and beliefs of the teacher during audiotaped interviews. Data analysis, on-going throughout the study, suggests that the teacher enacts a more complex and rich model than the Four Blocks model that is mandated by the school district. The Complex Model has additional components the teacher believes are essential to the literacy development of all early readers/writers, such as daily read aloud, shared book/poetry experiences, repeated readings, modeled/interactive writing, rich oral discourse experiences, and a home reading and  writing program.

The targeted population consisted of second and third grade students from three separate communities located in suburbs of a major metropolitan area. The need for fluency improvement is documented through teacher observations, reading fluency assessments, standardized reading test results, and a reading attitude survey of the students themselves. Analysis of probable cause data revealed that fluency is not taught as a component of reading programs. With most reading instruction focusing on comprehension and vocabulary, the oral fluency piece does not develop enough for students to view themselves as readers. This may negatively impact student attitude toward reading. Analysis of instructional strategies revealed less  emphasis on fluency practice, thus creating a pattern of poor fluency contributing to students' poor self-identification as readers. A review of solution strategies suggested in literature on the topic combined with an analysis of students' needs resulted in the selection of four intervention strategies: fluency modeling, paired reading, repeated reading, and dramatization. These four strategies provided a very balanced approach to address the issue of fluency. The intervention strategies contributed to substantial gains in students' reading fluency. The students' attitude toward reading improved and they became much more enthusiastic about reading aloud. (Contains 25 references, and 6 tables and 3 figures of data.

The targeted population consisted of elementary and middle school students in a growing urban community in northern Illinois. The lack of reading strategies was documented by data describing the reading behaviors and achievement of the population. Analysis of probable cause data revealed that students lacked specific strategies for comprehension of written text. Faculty reported student weakness in reading or listening comprehension in subject areas across the curriculum. Reviews of curricula content and instructional strategies revealed a lack of student instruction in strategies for self-monitoring of reading comprehension. A review of solution strategies suggested  by knowledgeable others, combined with an analysis of the problem setting resulted in the selection of one major intervention: reciprocal teaching strategies to improve reading comprehension developed by Annemarie Palincsar and Ann Brown. Post intervention data indicated an increase in listening comprehension at the kindergarten level, and an increase in reading comprehension levels for targeted fourth and fifth grade students. Limited improvement in reading comprehension of math word problems was evident at the seventh grade level. (Contains 28 references, and 3 tables and 11 figures of data.

        "description":"This report describes a program encouraging students to choose reading as a recreational activity. The targeted population consisted of first, second, third, and fourth grade students in a growing middle class community, near a large Midwestern city. The problem of students choosing recreational activities other than reading was documented through data collected from surveys given to students, parents, and teachers. Analysis of probable cause data revealed that students chose other recreational activities than reading. The influence of technology, the lack of positive role models, the lack of opportunity to read in the classroom, a narrow view of the value of reading, and the students' perceptions of themselves as readers negatively impacted the choice of reading as a  recreational activity. A review of solution strategies suggested by knowledgeable others, combined with an analysis of the problem setting, resulted in the selection of three major interventions: implementation of sustained silent reading, reading aloud to students in class, and parent involvement encouraging recreational reading. The data collected and analyzed at the conclusion of the action research project indicated that the students' attitudes towards recreational reading were positively impacted by the interventions. Students' choices on a survey of free-time activities showed a doubling of the number of students who chose reading as their first choice. The survey indicated a decrease in the number of students who chose playing video games and watching television as their first  choice of activities. Data also indicated an increase in the average number of minutes spent in reading at home daily. (Contains 36 references and 7 figures of data. Appendixes contain survey instruments, data, permission letters, book logs, and \"reading calendars\" for each grade level.) (Author/RS)",

        "description":"This paper shows how the concept of general objectivity can be used to improve behavioral science measurement, particularly as it applies to the Lexile Framework, a tool for objectively measuring reading comprehension. It begins with a dialogue between a physicist and a psychometrician that details some of the differences between physical science and behavioral science measurement. Building on these distinctions, a definition of measurement is offered that describes what goes on in the physical sciences and represents an attainable ideal of what should go on in the behavioral sciences. This definition of measurement is formalized in an equation that turns out to be the Rasch model, with the important difference that indicant calibrations are obtained via theory, not data. Through  the use of theory-based calibrations, a generally objective estimation of the measure parameter in the Rasch model is achieved. The paper then examines the differences between local objectivity obtained with the Rasch model and general objectivity obtained with a theory-enhanced version of that model. Next, it reports on a 10-year study of reading comprehension measurement that implemented the concept of general objectivity through the development of the Lexile Framework. Finally, it summarizes several of the benefits of objective measurement and general objectivity as they might be realized in the measurement of constructs other than reading comprehension.

        "description":"Twenty-seven third-grade children in a northern Louisiana public school participated in a study which examined whether a minimum amount of direct instruction in sight word recognition, combined with drill of sight words, could result in significantly better performance for the targeted at-risk children on the story and unit reading tests. The control group consisted of 16 students in an at-risk self-contained class; the experimental group consisted of 11 at-risk students, 3 of whom were special education inclusion students. Both groups received 165 minutes of language arts instruction daily from their respective regular education teachers. Control group students received instruction in the basal reading series from their regular education teacher in a whole-group setting. The  intervention used with the experimental group focused on expansion of direct instruction in vocabulary associated with each story and unit test. Data were collected over a 6-week period. Analysis revealed a significant difference between experimental and control group scores, in favor of the experimental group, on the cumulative unit test. The Mann Whitney Test revealed a significant difference in favor of the experimental group on the following unit test components: vocabulary, fact/opinion, and graphic aids. Data collected indicated that very brief direct instruction in sight word recognition combined with daily word drill assignments resulted in vocabulary and comprehension unit test scores of at-risk third graders significantly higher than those of control group students.

        "author":["Hill, Susan"],
        "description":"Since one way to study a non-reading primary child's phonics knowledge is to examine his/her invented spelling, a researcher's quandary led to a quasi-experimental design study, employed to answer three questions: (1) Do primary non-readers possess phonics knowledge? (2) Do primary non-readers possess phonemic awareness? and (3) Do primary non-readers spell at a high developmental level? If many reports and authorities are accurate, findings should be that non-readers lack these things, hence their inability to read. Subjects were 50 primary students from a small rural city in the southeastern United States, identified by their teachers as non-readers. As part of their routine, these children were instructed from highly phonetic basal readers and experienced daily drills from a  commercially prepared phonics program. Following a screening, 26 students were identified as reading less than 80% of the words from a passage in their primer and were classified as non-readers. After some were excluded for various reasons, the final sample was comprised of 21 children. The children were tested individually, and findings revealed that these students were phonetically knowledgeable, possessed phonemic awareness, and could spell at a level which includes the recognition of letter name vowels, consonants, and some short vowels. What was apparent was that they had been taught to use only one cueing system--phonics. If children actively construct knowledge through assimilation and re-inventions, then the approach to the teaching of reading must be to provide support for every  child in his/her development of all three cueing systems.

This paper does not challenge the general legitimacy of externalist arguments outlining the sometimes impractical consequences of holding an inflexible internalist view, but it argues that internalism should be adopted as an ethic in literacy education to protect the intellectual autonomy of learners. Internalism promotes the intellectual autonomy of students by positioning them as subjects rather than objects in generating knowledge, and by encouraging them to evaluate critically truth claims in discourse. Language arts teachers can promote intellectual autonomy in students by  encouraging them to evaluate truth claims in text, and by viewing students as participants in creating knowledge rather than as depositories for pre-existing information.

Subjects were 30 preschool and 30 school-aged children and their families from Kankakee County, Illinois, who signed up for the research (57 completed the study). They were divided into treatment groups and control groups for each age level and location--Kankakee and Bourbonnais. Children were pretested; t-tests were conducted, and test scores were not found to be significantly different for each group. Treatment group children were located at Kankakee, and control group children were  located at Bourbonnais. Parents kept a running record on forms provided of how many books they read with their children during the program's period. Re-reading was allowed, and each reading counted as a separate event on the list. Parents in the two treatment groups were given a &quot;Book Reading Suggestions&quot; sheet with eight ways to improve book reading quality, and whether parents followed these suggestions was monitored. The most books read by any family was 56; the median number of books read was 29. Findings suggest that receptive vocabulary and reading ability appear to develop along separate lines. The &quot;folk wisdom&quot; effects of shared book reading upon the development of either vocabulary or reading ability were not found.

The study attempts to specify features of instruction that make a difference in student learning by comparing high-achieving and under-achieving schools which are otherwise similar. It involved 19 middle and high school English programs in Florida, New York, and California schools exhibiting diversity in population, educational problems, and approaches to improvement, and it was organized as a nested case design with the program as a case and the class including teachers and students, as cases within. Findings suggest higher achieving schools are characterized by instructional programs in  which: (1) skills and knowledge are taught in multiple types of lessons; (2) tests are deconstructed to inform curriculum and instruction; (3) within curriculum and instruction, connections are made across content and structure to ensure coherence; (4) strategies for thinking and doing are emphasized; (5) generative learning is encouraged; and (6) classrooms are organized to foster collaboration and cogitation.

As with all beginning reading instruction methods, including the Big Book, heterogeneous reading group, holism, phonics, library book, and constructivist methods, controlled vocabulary involved controls, in the form of special vocabulary. The method also had many advantages: high word recognition, new vocabulary development, advancement of speaking vocabulary, supplementation by library books, and homogeneous reading groups. The emphasis was on success and achievement in reading skills. The controlled vocabulary philosophy may return in some form, in the manner that all reading methods cycle into and out  of favor.

Stress, among these students, takes all kinds of different forms and is derived from all kinds of different sources. Today's students live in a world of casual isolation and anonymity; they do not have the family ties that many of their professors had when they were young, or the friends, or the financial support networks. Today's accepted model is individuality, singularity, anonymity, but with this individuality comes stress, a kind of stress that older adults have never really had to face. The paper quotes Dr. Martin Seligman who writes that severe depression is 10 times more prevalent today than it was 50 years ago and that sexual abuse is also  increasing rapidly. These stressful conditions appear in college classrooms as behavior and motivation problems. It finds that stress makes a bad situation even worse; stress creates stupidity, whether behavioral, physical, or psychological. In an environment where education has become an economic commodity for &quot;holding your own&quot; amidst the changing technology, there is seldom the time, or opportunity, for building or burnishing the social skills, let alone the concept of community, that might help a student become a more complete person.

Subject were 8 children in a morning kindergarten class and 9 children in an afternoon class. Findings related to classroom context suggest: primary teacher support was a post-writing strategy utilizing students' zones of proximal development; teachers made little intervention to improve student's writing quality through modeled or shared writing; very little group  interaction or writing audience was observed; and journal writing was the second most frequent literacy event after read aloud. Regarding children's writings, findings suggest: some children made modest growth while others made little or no growth; large variations in writing fluency were present; topics came from students' own life or school experiences; drawing was a predominant feature of all writings; children developed an early repertoire of correctly-spelled conventional words (i.e. &quot;mom,&quot;&quot;dad,&quot;&quot;love,&quot;&quot;you&quot;); and extended repetition was the primary learning pattern for children with varying levels of progress.

          "Swiatek, Laura"],
        "description":"This report describes a program that was implemented to improve student assessment through the use of portfolios. The targeted population consisted of a first and third grade classroom in a suburb of a large Midwestern metropolitan area. The problems related to assessment were documented by state mandated test scores, teacher determined grades, teacher observations, student and parent surveys, and anecdotal records. Analysis of the probable cause data revealed that tests scores do not provide a clear picture of student growth and development. Evidence of this problem is low test scores, poor quality work, a discrepancy between performance on tests and student ability, and parental difficulty in understanding test scores. These factors, particularly the discrepancy between  state-mandated test scores and teacher-determined grades in language arts, caused difficulty in clearly seeing and interpreting growth and development in student performance. A review of solution strategies suggested by credible sources combined with analysis of the problem setting resulted in a determination to use portfolio assessment in language arts as an intervention strategy. The intervention strategy included student-maintained portfolios, student and parent conferencing with teachers, and the use of a variety of authentic assessments. Post intervention data indicated that the use of portfolios provides students with a sense of ownership in their own learning and provides both parents and students with a more complete picture of student growth and development over time. Portfolios  can be used to complement rather than substitute for testing and provide a more complete picture of student achievement and progress. They also provide teachers with a more complete picture of the successes of their teaching and areas where improvement is needed. (Contains 10 figures of data and 23 references.

They were participants in the National Head Start/Public School Transition Demonstration Project, a longitudinal study of the transition experience of Head Start children and their families in public schools in 30 sites across the country. Two cohorts of Head Start children were followed from kindergarten through third grade, half in demonstration classrooms (all K-3 classrooms in three schools) and half in comparison classrooms (all K-3 classrooms in four schools). Schools were randomly selected as sites; children and families in the demonstration schools received &quot;Head Start like&quot;  services (e.g., health care, social services, and family support), and all teachers received staff development and support in the implementation of developmentally appropriate practices in their classrooms. Training was designed to encourage classroom changes that would affect all children. The writing program includes reading, writing, spelling, and oral language and features a developmental continuum for each component. The continuum contains six phases from role play writing to advanced writing. Third-grade students wrote at least three times a week. Instruction was thematic using core books to integrate instruction in reading, writing, oral communication, and content areas. The extensive staff development and support for teachers in process writing, literature-based literacy  instruction, developmentally appropriate organization and instruction, and individual assessment benefited the entire class.

Through indepth interviews of respondents who sought out the Starr report on-line it appears that viewing the document on the Internet had little impact on political participation. More notably, it is evident that television coverage of the sexually explicit details contained in the report, and the announcement of its Internet debut, were the primary motivations for reading the document. Most importantly, this study contributes to a theoretical framework for analyzing the Internet and political participation, and demonstrates the usefulness of the methodological approach applied in this research.

        "description":"This paper speaks to the question of just what people in a human communication studies department do. The paper traces the study of communication historically, beginning with classical times in Greece and &quot;impersonal communication,&quot; when the first formal education in communication was not theoretical, but applied. The paper points out that although some attention was given to arrangement, the emphasis was on logic, proof, and plausibility. Rhetoric which convinced and which got results was &quot;good rhetoric.&quot; It also notes that rhetoric was tied to public oratory and was used in the formal schooling of Roman boys. The paper also states that during the medieval period, when the first universities were formed, rhetoric was one-third of the &quot;trivium,&quot; an undergraduate education of  grammar, rhetoric, and logic. According to the paper, that began to change in 1947 with the arrival at the University of Denver of Elwood Murray, a scholar who believed that it would be worthwhile to study and teach &quot;interpersonal communication.&quot; The paper then considers the contributions of some scholars who came after Murray, such as Evelyn Sieburg and Gregory Bateson, and discusses one interpersonal variable, &quot;confirmation.&quot; It concludes that some ways of relating are more satisfying than others: they are humanizing; they are individuating; and they are confirming. Making sense and making contact are not mutually exclusive. (NKA)",

        "description":"Analysis of the difference between male-centered and female-centered electronic discourse communities identifies patterns which may exclude or privilege individual females. This paper characterizes female-centered electronic dialogue through studying the roles of Sarah and Rachel, women in two separate sections of first-year English who became the central figures in each class's listserv; male-centered dialogue is represented by Josh and Kelsey who dominated the third class section. Each class exhibited a different pattern: (1) Sarah led a supportive but subjective interchange; (2) Rachel centered a lively, idealistic, often confrontational exchange; and (3) Josh and Kelsey reduced the intellectual level of the electronic conversations through sarcasm and insults. Their  aggressive, male interaction negatively affected the quality of listserv discourse. Clear gender distinctions are apparent when samples are studied from the three classes; his/stories differ from her/stories. Through analysis of sample electronic entries from all three sections, tabulation of number and length of male and female responses, and comparison of grades for the listserv assignment, the paper shows how the males'&quot;one-up&quot; behavior had a negative impact on the electronic conversation.

The guide discusses the need for parents to be engaged in their children's education and suggests four key roles for parents: create a home environment that promotes learning; provide extra services and support to students; work to make the system more responsive to all families; and serve  on school committees and actively participate in efforts to improve school quality.

        "description":"This brief examines two components of Colorado's school-finance act: state aid and local property taxes. It describes how the Department of Education accounts for about 41 percent of the state General Fund appropriations, the vast majority of which is used for the school-finance act. Roughly 10 years ago, the General Assembly set property taxes for school finance--taxes were based on the idea that most districts should impose the same levy, a so-called uniform levy. However, the General Assembly used a variety of methods to determine that levy and included the mill levy in the statutes. Because these limits are now the driving factors in school-finance property taxes, any change in assessed values influences changes in property taxes. When assessed values are relatively stable  statewide, property taxes can be expected to remain relatively constant. Changes in property taxes follow the reassessment cycle, which occurs every 2 years, thus creating a &quot;sawtooth&quot; effect in tax revenue. While property taxes have been increasing over the past 10 years, school-district mill levies have been declining and have become more disparate. Even so, changes in property taxes in recent years more closely follow the inflation rate than they did earlier in the decade. (RJM)",

The report is based on a study that used NAHS schools as a &quot;laboratory&quot; for researching reform practices. It documents their experiences in designing, implementing, and sustaining reform. Using in-depth case studies, the study drew on stories and examples from several of the schools to illustrate each of 10 reform initiatives. It focuses on strategies for raising academic standards and expectations and how to create small learning environments that enable students and teachers to work together. It shows how to structure learning around careers and  students' interests and how to promote student achievement by enhancing educators' professional development. Tips on linking classroom and workplace learning and advice on providing counseling to encourage in-depth college and career awareness are also presented. Other practices include: organizing the school day into flexible, relevant segments; assessing students' performance; forging partnerships with two- and four-year postsecondary schools; and creating active student support alliances involving educators, employers, parents, and communities.

It provides a current, state-by-state listing of local public school systems and other education agencies dedicated to the many institutions and organizations that deal with these entities. The directory offers instructions on usage, describes the types of agencies listed, and identifies the many abbreviations used in the text. Information on the universe of public schools and education agencies is collected annually in the NCES Common Core of Data (CCD) surveys. The surveys are completed from administrative records of the state education agencies by Common Core of Data Coordinators. The contents for the directory come primarily from the CCD  education agency universe data collection of spring, 1997. In the directory's introduction, several tables that summarize the contents of the file are provided. They are followed by the listing of education agencies, organized by state and type of agency. The directory lists all reported public, elementary/secondary education agencies in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Department of Defense schools.

The stories describe common sense, nonsense, inspiration, and failures--reinforcing the idea that leaders should rely on experience, not books or lectures, to refine their leadership skills. The text tells stories about team work, admitting mistakes, listening to criticism, not making empty threats, spending more time solving problems than complaining about them, planning to be happy, choosing words carefully, supporting people important to the organization, helping senior colleagues, nurturing relationships, being a leader in different situations, picking up paper in the parking lot, treating people with respect, dating the boss, knowing when to tell people things they do not want to hear,  being the difference in the lives of children, picking battles wisely, knowing when to laugh, promoting employees for the right reasons, remembering the gifts received during life, remembering why a job offer was made in the first place, respecting the opposition, solving problems as close to their point of origin as possible, speaking a few reasonable words, choosing wisely what information to share with a board, hiring the best people possible, treating other people's money with the highest respect, and using time wisely.

        "description":"This collection of essays discusses writing program administrators' (WPAs') research. The essays pose several questions to characterize WPAs' research practices: \"What is WPA research? What characterizes WPA research and the sites of WPA inquiry?\"; and \"What values guide WPA research?\" The 14 chapters are divided into 2 parts, \"Writing Program Administrators' Inquiry in Action\" and \"Writing Program Administrators' Inquiry in Reflection.\" Part 1 exemplifies WPA research by describing and conceptualizing specific research projects conducted as part of WPA responsibilities, and thereby provides a detailed picture of administrative research. Part 2 then draws on the concrete experiences of particular WPAs and particular writing programs, raising and reflecting on issues about WPA  research in general. Each chapter demonstrates that WPAs' inquiry is characterized by a recursive interplay between reflection and action. Some of the many topics addressed in the book include diverse research methodologies for diverse audiences, feminist methods, conflicts between teaching and assessing writing, outcomes assessment research as a teaching tool, the contributions of sociolinguistic profiling, assessing teacher preparation programs, reflective essays, local research and curriculum development, enabling research in the writing program archives, WPAs as historians, historical work on WPAs, the role of research in writing programs, and postmodern mapping.

The text examines the concerns that surround superfund cleanups, focusing on the legal framework, and furnishes some practical pointers, such as what to do if the school district is identified as a potentially responsible party. The document discusses ways to minimize future superfund liability in real-estate acquisitions, the identification of hazardous waste produced by schools, and definitions for \"hazardous substance\" and \"environmental damage.\" Strategies for handling underground storage tanks and dangers within the school, such as asbestos, radon, lead, and other toxic substances  are also detailed. An entire chapter is devoted to toxic torts and the unique proof problems that must be addressed in such cases. Information on the prevention of and response to environmental crises, such as those precipitated by construction and maintenance activities, are also addressed. The last chapter provides an environmental check list so that lawyers and administrators can check their compliance with applicable environmental laws and assess their preparedness for an environmental crisis.

Results indicate: (1) there is a dearth of policy research efforts looking particularly at inclusion policies, their implementation and their effectiveness in meeting desired goals for young children; (2) the policy research that is available points to slow progress in the effectiveness of current policies and systems to advance inclusion for young children, with only about 51 percent of preschoolers with disabilities currently educated in inclusive settings; (3) there were greater challenges to  inclusion in people's attitudes and beliefs in 1993 than there were in 1990; (4) the perceived policy barriers did not in fact exist in the 1990 study, only the belief that they did; (5) factors other than policy are reported to be important in advancing inclusion, including knowledge of the effects of inclusion, knowledge and skills of personnel to promote friendships, and children's abilities to manage their own behavior; and (6) the quality of the majority of natural environments is mediocre at best.

The focus of the project is to provide assistance in the development of state policy, a statewide training and technical assistance network, and model local sites for the purpose of establishing a community-wide interagency transition system using the STEPS model and adopted state policies. Outcomes of Project STEPS included: (1) successful facilitation of the development of a statewide transition system in the states of Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia,  North Carolina, and Delaware; (2) provision of liaison support to transition coordinators in states that implemented the STEPS model and funded positions to institute the efforts initiated through this project; (3) hosting a transition forum on an annual basis that included state transition teams from 13 states and territories; and (4) development and dissemination of an annual report from the transition forum that describes issues and strategies for state system development.

Data included observations of organizational and planning meetings and structured interviews with the students, parents, and facilitators. Analysis resulted in the following findings: students demonstrated four distinct types of participation (active, controlling, limited, and absent); and student participation was influenced by the student's personal style, the size of the meeting, and the level of abstraction in the conversation. Implications and recommendations are made for ways in which the facilitator can prepare in advance (such as identifying the student's personal conversational style); for  what the facilitator can do during the first few meetings (such as concentrating on individualizing the planning approach); for things the facilitator can do during more abstract planning sessions (such as making clear connections between the student's relevant starting points and the more conceptual planning).

Three factors that decreased participation were also identified: using jargon, using the third person, and  using patronizing language.

Findings are reported in terms of: (1) funding opportunities (funding agencies often disseminate information in ways that CBMOs do not, such as computer databases and the Internet); (2) successful grants (funding agencies tend to focus on process whereas CBMOs emphasize community connections and relationship-building); and (3) efforts to expand capacities (funding agencies focus on awarding extra points for minority  status whereas CBMOs emphasize collaboration and relationship-building). Three recommendations are offered to both funding agencies and CBMOs: first, be aware of and use all available mechanisms to learn about or publicize funding opportunities; second, grant developers and decision-makers should consider both the written quality as well as collaborative relationships in the proposals; and third, capacity-building efforts should include systems change to bring funding agencies and CBMOs together.

Findings indicated: (1) organizations were successful in closing a facility using either a gradual approach driven by individual consumers' job preferences or a rapid approach based on a specific closure date; (2) catalysts for change were primarily internal to the organization and in most cases multiple catalysts influenced the start of the change process; (3) leadership for the change process came from several different directions; (4) organizations which were  successful in a change process had a strong culture that emphasized qualities like openness to risk taking, continuous evaluation and improvement of services, and clear and unwavering vision; and (5) organizations that are currently engaged in an organizational change process need to be careful to focus on a clear goal and not be distracted by the change process.

Most of the individuals interviewed experienced a range of reactions from people at work but most reactions were reported to be positive and supportive. More individuals with HIV infection than cancer reported examples of negative or unpleasant experiences in their interactions with others.  Sixty-four percent of individuals with cancer reported receiving accommodations on their job, as compared to 50 percent of people who were HIV positive.

Challenges facing the family, teachers, and caregivers are also discussed and suggestions are given in the areas of communication, orientation and mobility, individualized education, transition, and inclusion within the family. The paper stresses that  individuals who are deaf-blind have a unique and valuable experience of the world and can have a high quality of life if they accept their condition, are provided educational experiences that help them maximize their abilities, and live in accepting families and communities. (Contains a descriptive guide to 7 organizations that offer help to families, caregivers, and teachers and an annotated list of 11 print resources.) (CR)",

The first fact sheet, \"Communication Interactions: It Takes Two\" (Kathleen Stremel), defines communication; suggests ways to find opportunities for interactive communication; offers specific suggestions for improving interactions (such as interacting often, allowing the child to participate in as many activities as possible, and providing examples for others); and gives an example of communication interaction. The second fact sheet, \"Expressive Communication: How Children Send Their Messages to You\" (Stremel), defines expressive communication, lists reasons to communicate at an early age and at a later age, explains use of a communication map  to assess the child's expressive communication, recognizes the progressive nature of communication development in planning an individualized program, and presents guidelines for developing an effective communication program. The third fact sheet, \"Receptive Communication: How Children Understand Your Messages to Them\" (Rebecca M. Wilson), defines receptive communication, offers tips for sending effective messages, and explains the use of a communication map to evaluate the child's current receptive language abilities and to design a program for the child based on his/her hearing and vision, motor abilities, and cognitive abilities. Each fact sheet also includes an annotated list of suggested resources. (CR)",

It begins by describing orientation and mobility skills, and emphasizes the need for a team approach in the development and implementation of O&M instruction. Instructional strategies are described, including initial assessment of O&M skills, program development and implementation, and evaluation. The basics of mobility skills are then addressed for guided travel, protective techniques, trailing, mobility devices, dog guides, electronic travel aids, and wheelchair mobility. Tips are provided for working with interpreters, and practical strategies for families and team members are listed, including: (1) provide opportunities for exploring all areas of the student's  environment; (2) encourage experiences on a variety on surfaces; (3) allow full participation in activities; (4) make full use of \"reference points\"; (5) encourage independent travel; (6) be sure lighting is adequate for children who have residual vision; (7) make use of physical boundaries; (8) provide opportunities for problem-solving; and (9) encourage association of familiar toys and objects with the environments in which they may be used.

There were approximately 40 educators and 550 students in the junior and high school programs. About 60 of the students were identified with disabilities, including learning disabilities, behavior disorders, and mental retardation. Analysis of observations and interviews with thirteen junior high and high school staff members uncovered four themes: (1) some educators are devoted to implementing inclusion while others are less engaged in the process; (2) inclusion occurs even when there is no formal program in place; (3) student behavior and the academic nature of the general education curriculum present some difficulties for students with  disabilities in inclusion classrooms; and (4) it takes a combination of administrative support, scheduling adjustments, and teacher collaboration to make inclusion work.

The digest states that people with autism respond better with structure and clear guidelines regarding expectations for appropriate and inappropriate behavior and recommends that the environment include systems or materials that can help the person to comprehend and predict the flow and sequence of activities.

It reports the outcomes of a phenomenological analysis of six young adults who discussed their problems with drug and alcohol abuse, unemployment or underemployment, their dreams of success, and their worries about the future. The participants came from a variety of familial backgrounds with varying socioeconomic status and had experienced stressful events and catastrophic life happenings. Each individual continues to struggle with problems with alcohol and drug addiction and with living with a disability. The report concludes that: (1) for transition to be successful for  students with learning disabilities, personnel involved with the process must collaborate and understand the other's role within the model program; (2) vocational training emphasis should be placed on enhancing skills learned by students; and (3) it is critical for the schools to adapt their programs of study to guarantee that every student who enters the school will leave that school with employable skills.

        "description":"The 21st annual report to Congress on the implementation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is  divided into four sections organized around a model that views educational results as products of three sets of factors: the context and environment in which the education is provided, student characteristics, and school programs and services. Section 1, on context/environmental factors, discusses parent involvement, access to the general education curriculum, and developing a highly trained workforce. Section 2, on student characteristics, focuses on special education in correctional facilities, states' progress in implementing comprehensive early intervention services and special education services for preschool children, and changes in the child count data.  Section 3, on school programs and services, addresses paraprofessionals in the education workforce, educational environments for students with disabilities, federal policies on discipline, and the population of students served by visual impairment specialists. Section 4, on student results, discusses graduation requirements and high school completion, state improvement and monitoring, progress on the implementation of transition requirements at the state and local level, and participation of students with disabilities and the use of accommodations in the National Assessment of Educational Progress. Extensive appendices provide data tables. (Individual sections contain references.) (CR)",

It describes the daily realities faced by teachers, students, families, and communities, and then offers practical advice for all classroom educators. The following suggestions are given: accept the premise that children are members of diverse family and community systems bringing multiple gifts of language, culture, and wisdom; become an ethnographer: keenly observe  children's language capabilities, both in the native language and English; encourage and accept children's attempts to communicate since errors are a normal part of language learning; provide many opportunities for children to communicate; plan authentic integrated communities that allow children to value and appreciate their identities; organize the physical environment to reflect the diversity of cultures in the classroom; build lines of communication among linguistically and culturally diverse families and educators; and initiate dialogues and advocacy work about language and culture among and across organizations and leaders capable of addressing the specific policy needs of young children. Contains many references to recent scholarship in the field and offers suggestions for further  reading. (KFT)",

        "description":"This study investigated the extent to which foreign words have become assimilated into the Japanese lexicon during the decade of the 1990s. Since the 1980s, a number of linguists and educators have argued that the rate of loan word absorption into Japanese has increased dramatically. However, most of the studies are speculative or anecdotal. This study presents clear empirical evidence of a marked increase in the penetration of loan words into the Japanese language. This rapid rate of absorption of primarily English loan words has significant ramifications for foreign language learning in Japan. Researchers used the Japanese Proficiency Test, Level 1, for the years 1990, 1992, 1994, 1996, and 1998 as the data source. They made the assumption that the test was a conservative  estimate of the degree to which foreign loan words have penetrated the Japanese language. Data analysis indicated that rather than moving towards a variety of English, the pattern of loan word absorption in Japan appears to be moving towards an appropriation of English loan words into Japanese, also called the katakanization of English.

It is written for bilingual and English as a Second Language program coordinators and local school policy makers. The research includes findings from five large urban and suburban school districts in various regions of the United States where large numbers of language minority students attend public schools, with over 700,000 language minority student records collected from 1982-1996. A developmental model of language acquisition for school is explained and validated by the data analyses. The model and findings from this study make predictions about long-term student achievement as a result of a variety of  instructional practices. Instructions are provided for replicating this study and validating the findings in local school systems. General policy recommendations and specific action recommendations are provided for decision makers in schools. (Contains 71 references.) (Author/SM)",

        "description":"This paper describes one teacher's experiences teaching English to Mexican university students at the Instituto Technologico y de Estudios Superiores de Mexico (ITESM), which is considered Mexico's top private university. The author taught two levels of English as a Second Language: English 2 and advanced English. The entire ITESM system used the same textbook, so there was consistency regardless of which campus students attended. The classes followed a format that included reading, listening to, repeating, and writing English. Students also wrote letters to students in a Spanish class at a U.S. university. During laboratory sessions, students played charades and picture acting games, and did scavenger hunts. English language movies were incorporated into all classes. Students  viewed the movies then wrote reviews about them. They also learned English idioms. They were given 10 vocabulary words per week. Toward the end of the semester, students learned the words to American rock and roll songs. In the advanced class, discussion groups on a wide variety of topics were very successful. Students also gave speeches on topics of their choice. Grades were based on tests, homework, class participation, and speeches. (SM)",

The class focuses on students' language development but makes use of themes, readings, and vocabulary from calculus. This model requires coordination before and during the term between the language and calculus teachers. Students are provided with enriched, intensive instructional teams who meet their curricular requirements. The school uses block scheduling for students in their first two semesters of college to help ensure success. Students are placed in a block of classes and travel with the same people from class to class in the enriched environment. The ESL/mathematics class meets 6 hours  per week, and students who register for it must have both the appropriate ESL placement and math prerequisites. A glossary of English words commonly used in math is available for students enrolled in the integrated classes. (Contains 17 references.) (SM)",

        "description":"This paper examines how semiotic analysis may be useful in teaching media literacy to nonnative speakers of English (NNSs), including both immigrants and international students who plan to return to their countries. It focuses on two television shows. The first show, &quot;Friends,&quot; covers issues and problems of contemporary urban life for members of white, middle class Generation X in which friends are thought to replace the nuclear family structure as the central unit of society. The second show, &quot;The X-Files,&quot; deals with the supernatural and the use of futuristic technology, treating an anomalous area between two binaries: the technologies and epistemologies of postmodern society and people's fascination with and fear of the extraterrestrial and the notion that more intelligent  life exists on other planets. This paper examines: media literacy and popular culture; social anxiety and the anomalous on television; naturalization and representation; modes of address; how advertising constructs the ideal viewer; stances for decoding; and doing media literacy with NNS students.

        "description":"Contrastive rhetoric can help English teachers of native Japanese speaking students to better understand cultural and first language influences which affect the acquisition of English expository writing skills. An awareness of the Japanese expository writing style called &quot;delayed introduction of purpose,&quot; which can cause problems in coherence for English-speaking readers who expect either a general to specific or a specific to general style, can enable English as a Second Language writing teachers to create or adapt lessons that will be appropriate for their Japanese students. This study follows the work of the late John Hinds, whose contrastive rhetoric research showed that Japanese writing uses a delayed introduction of purpose pattern that does not match any English rhetorical  pattern. The study examines essays written by Japanese English students in Japan and in the United States for evidence of a Japanese writing style. Pedagogical applications are addressed, and an annotated bibliography is presented for English as a Second Language teachers. (Contains 81 references.) (SM)",

        "description":"There are compelling reasons for integrating phonics into the adult English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) curriculum. The adult ESL student has the analytical capability to understand phoneme-grapheme relationships and can be taught to use any transferable native-language literacy skills in English spelling. In this essay, the potential of phonics instruction in the teaching of reading and spelling to ESL students with little formal education in the native language or English is considered. The discussion begins with an analysis of the features of English orthography and research on whether English orthography can be taught. A rationale for teaching phonics is outlined, focusing on its utility for native Spanish-speaking immigrants to the United States. A classroom research project  using phonics and spelling instruction in an adult intermediate-level ESL literacy class is then reported. Basic English spelling rules are reviewed, and a three-step approach to teaching them (phoneme-grapheme relationships; irregular verb tests; and guided compositions) is described. Results indicate the approach was useful in teaching students to spell and in encouraging writing. (Adjunct ERIC Clearinghouse on Literacy Education) (MSE)",

A drink is defined as twelve ounces of beer or wine cooler, four ounces of wine, or a shot of liquor. A 1993 nationwide study of almost 18,000 college students revealed that 44% were binge drinkers. The strongest predictor for binge drinking was living in a sorority or fraternity house; 80% of sorority women and 86% of fraternity men living in Greek housing were binge drinkers. Wechsler has created a 12-step program for institutions to address the alcohol problem on their campuses. Northern Illinois  University has used a social influence campaign to curb binge drinking on its campus. (JM)",

The course culminated in student identification of an educational problem or situation that could be addressed by using electronic presentation software. Students were required to identify the problem, conduct a needs analysis, and present an informal presentation describing the problem and the proposed product. Students were then given approximately 6 weeks to design and develop hypermedia software to enable a learner to work with the technology to arrive at a  potential solution. Students completed a survey indicating their feelings about the course. Findings indicated that students recognized the value of collaborative leaning in the development of a multimedia project, gained more from a studio-based class than through formal presentations, and were able to share a variety of ways that electronic presentation software can be used to enhance classroom instruction.

The target population for the MAPP program is youths aged 9-14 years, diagnosed with chronic illnesses (asthma, diabetes, and sickle cell disease). Program sessions take place in a clinic setting, using a portable computer. Three sessions have been developed on chronic illness and its effects on sexual development. The major aim of MAPP is to strengthen intentions to postpone sexual initiation and prevent pregnancy. Evaluation takes place by examining differences between a treatment and control group on pre-post tests at baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months. Measurement  instruments include a pre-post questionnaire, computer log, module development logs, and clinic checklist. Outcome evaluation includes comparison of knowledge and attitude change toward sexual abstinence and changes in behavioral intention to choose abstinence in both the intervention and control group. Preliminary reports indicate acceptance of the program by subjects, parents, and clinic personnel. Contains 13 references. (Author/MES)",

        "description":"A 1998 study of Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) faculty assessed the impact of technology on teaching and learning; this present study of MTSU students extends the 1998 study by measuring student perceptions about instructional technology and the impact it has on learning. A four-part questionnaire was distributed to 1,900 students in technology-equipped classrooms across campus. The first part of the questionnaire measured student perceptions and skills related to various types of technologies. The second part measured frequency of use of various instructional technology applications, including computer applications to present lecture outlines or demonstrate concepts, audio/visual equipment, electronic communication, and supplementary use or development of materials  such as World Wide Web pages, computer-assisted instruction modules, and computer-based applications. The third segment of the questionnaire gathered information about the projected future use of instructional technology by students, and the final portion gathered demographic information. Survey results led to the following major findings: (1) use of instructional technology positively affects student learning; (2) use of instructional technology increases student interest and satisfaction; (3) role of faculty and their ability to use instructional technology are major factors; (4) certain instructional technology techniques better facilitate certain learning activities; and (5) instructional technology is an integral part of today's learning environment.

The first section summarizes suggestions from a review of research on the effectiveness of audio media when accompanied by other forms of media; types of research studies (e.g., evaluation, intra-medium, and aptitude treatment interaction studies) are also described. Recommended teaching techniques for three learning modalities (kinesthetic, auditory, and visual) are outlined in the second section. The next section provides examples of the use of audio in multimedia presentations, focusing on the functions of three elements of sound: speech, including narration, dialogue, and direct address; sound effects, including contextual and narrative functions; and music. Literal and non-literal  sounds are discussed in the fourth section, followed by a section that addresses the functions of sound in radio and television (to provide information, establish outer orientation, and establish inner orientation). The sixth section covers four roles that audio media play in multimedia production: picture defines sound; sound defines picture; sound parallels picture; and sound counterpoints picture. Aesthetic factors of sound--figure ground, sound perspective, and sound continuity--are described in the next section. Two concluding sections list software for recording audio and automating online multimedia presentations and provide links to resources on audio file types and platform compatibility. (MES)",

Faculty were then invited to make a single presentation over this system. The social work department, recognizing both the opportunities and the limitations presented by this new system, elected to be one of the presenters. However, instead of simply broadcasting one presentation, faculty proposed that a comprehensive program be developed for high school students, using the distance learning system as one component. The comprehensive program included: (1) a satellite broadcast to teachers at the six schools to discuss student needs; (2) follow-up contacts by phone and in person with key personnel at the schools; (3) provision of six videotapes  dealing with drugs, alcohol, and violence to help prepare the students for the broadcasts; (4) administration of student questionnaires to determine problems and needs; (5) visits to the schools by senior social work students to examine student behavior; and (6) three satellite-linked, interactive, television broadcasts entitled &quot;Anger Management: How To Prevent Violence in Our Schools I, II, and III.&quot; This paper reviews and evaluates the results of this effort.

The project team included representatives from various areas such as information engineering technology, mechanical engineering technology, chemical technology, professional practice and career placement, and humanities and social science, thereby providing an objective multi-disciplinary performance of the project and evaluation of its result. The project goal was to form a kernel of instructors who acquired the know-how of distance education (DE), including Web-based education (WBE) and WBI tools and were, therefore, ready to provide faculty development on the use of WBI tools and WBE through a  series of workshops and training seminars. Activities included individual faculty development, regular faculty interdepartmental group discussions, hands-on training and workshops/seminars, and team-working/peer-to-peer mentoring. Main project outcomes included: faculty &quot;brainware&quot; on DE systems, including identification of various aspects of DE and WBE systems worldwide; and faculty &quot;brainware&quot; on WBI tools, including identification of features and capabilities of various WBI tools that can enable an instructor to design, develop, maintain, and manage WBE curricula and courses.

Data about their perceptions, practices, concerns, and the institutional norms under which they work were collected. The data collected from the survey yielded a prioritized list of faculty concerns and needs. Institutions must develop the infrastructure to provide technical training, technical support, administrative support, time for faculty to develop and teach these courses, a revised faculty reward system, and reliable computer hardware. The delivery of distance education on the WWW has great potential that cannot be  realized until the needs and concerns of the faculty that will develop the courses are met. Contains 15 references.

        "description":"Instructional design (ID) case studies that pose authentic ill-defined design problems in realistic environments can help instructional design students bridge the gap between novice and expert practice. Over the past 3 years, the authors have explored aspects of this educational approach through the development of World Wide Web-based instructional design at the Curry School of Education, University of Virginia. This paper begins with a look at case study methods and how they are used to help students gain experience in ID practice. The design and development of the Web-based ID Case Competition, the 1998 IT (Instructional Technology) Case Event, is described, followed with a report on the competition involving seven universities. Officials and students felt that the case  experience was valuable for developing ID expertise and preparing students for professional practice. These advantages and the opportunity for team collaboration were noted as motivators for participation. Most of the students were enthusiastic about the inclusion of emergent ID issues in the case and felt the experience expanded their knowledge of ID practice and application. The paper closes with a discussion of implications for the preparation of instructional designers and recommendations for future development activities. Survey and interview questions answered by participants are included. (Author/MES)",

The paper begins with a discussion of the IT Clinical plan, the sociology of the learning environment (e.g., situated learning, community of practice, intrinsic motivation, and cooperation), methods for developing expertise (e.g., modeling, coaching, scaffolding, reflection, articulation, and exploration), content knowledge necessary for expertise, and sequencing of learning activities. Data collection is then described: open-ended questionnaires were used to gather data from students enrolled in a professional development seminar (n=27)  about expectations of the Clinical experience; quantitative and qualitative data were gathered from students in two IT Clinical courses after fourteen weeks (n=10), representing the reality of the Clinical experience. Expectations and realities are examined related to peer interactions, faculty interactions, client interactions, task scope, personal/professional resources, professional development, and personal development. Responses to open-ended questions are discussed and illustrated with student comments around two general themes--client relations, and the benefits of the experience within the context of the characteristics of a cognitive apprenticeship learning environment. It is concluded that an environment conducive to apprenticeship learning was successfully established.  (MES)",

The effects of visual and verbal test formats were also examined. In general, results reveal an insignificant interaction between coding type and level of field dependence. However, field dependency was found to be an important instructional variable, and, for some types of learning objectives, the process of color coding instructional materials may reduce achievement differences attributed to differences in cognitive style. Unexpectedly, students who received verbal tests across all field dependence levels  achieved significantly higher mean scores than did those who received the visual test formats. (Author/MES)",

Persistent menus, or menus which remain on the screen, often accomplished by the use of HTML tables or frames, is a second approach. A third approach is the use of graphic or textual maps that show the path taken to a particular document. The purpose of this study was to determine whether visitors who are just browsing can do so more effectively under one of  the three menu schemas described above.

        "description":"This study investigated the relationships between hypermedia users' information processing styles and navigational patterns. Three aspects of navigational patterns were investigated: navigational depth patterns that reveal how comprehensively users access; navigational path patterns that display what sequences users follow; and navigational method patterns that show what methods users employ when using the system. Subjects were 102 undergraduate students enrolled in management courses. Information processing styles were measured by the Human Information Processing Survey. Thirty-four students were selected for each of left, right, and integrated information processing style groups. The subjects interacted with the A.g.i.l.e. Resource(TM) trainer program to complete open-ended and  closed-ended tasks. Significant differences were found among groups in navigational depth patterns; right dominant information processing style subjects accessed significantly more new nodes than left dominant subjects. There was a significant relationship between information processing style and navigational path patterns; right dominant subjects followed significantly more linear paths than integrated subjects. There was a significant relationship between information processing styles and navigational method patterns; left dominant subjects employed significantly more analytical methods than right dominant subjects, and integrated subjects used significantly more analytical methods than right dominant subjects. Results indicate that information processing style plays an important role  in how an individual interacts with hypermedia systems. (Contains 77 references.) (Author/MES)",

Vygotsky as a conceptual framework for implementing instruction that supports concept development and promotes higher level thinking skills in students. Three major components (i.e., language, scientific and spontaneous concepts, and the zone of proximal development) of Vygotsky's socio-cultural-historical theories of learning are considered. The relationship of these components to the commonalities evidenced in the mathematics and science standards that suggest the efficacy of integrated curricular activity are then discussed. Next, the characteristics of computer-mediated communication (CMC) are presented, and the rationale for its use in an integrated mathematics and science curriculum is discussed. Finally, a current project is  outlined that uses CMC as a facilitating technology for an integrated fifth-grade mathematics and science curriculum that is consistent with both a Vygotskian approach to learning and the mathematics and science standards.

Specifically, this paper examines the difference between systemic thinking and systematic thinking, the ideal mental model (dual structured systems) for ID, and the benefits from this mental model. The introductory section discusses the need for a dual structured instructional systems approach. An overview of the problems relating to systematic and systemic is then presented that covers the following topics: (1) dictionary definitions of the two terms; (2) different approaches of the two terms in the field of instructional systems design (ISD); (3) distinctions based on hard systems (typical  tasks, step-by-step procedures) vs. soft systems (typical events, heuristic problems); (4) the conceptual model of dual structured instructional systems; (5) some guidelines for increasing systemic thinking, including the ability to see the problem as holistic, to set goals in a given problem situation, to link possible resources in terms of goals, and to drive a tentative result; and (6) the benefits of the dual structured systems approach. It is concluded that both systematic and systemic approaches are necessary for ID. (MES)",

The use of metacognitive strategies was measured by a self-reflection survey, following the first and last assignment. These assignments were identical and provided for the assessment of performance. Results indicated that the treatment had a positive effect on learning. The change in metacognitive awareness led the researchers to conclude that  instructional strategies that teach students to practice metacognitive skills while learning course content improves the use and awareness of these skills, as well as performance.

The initial field test was conducted with two user groups--a graduate class of professionals in the field of higher education student development, and a small group of ministers certified as pastoral counselors. The evaluation utilizes data obtained through expert feedback, exercise field tests, individual and focus group interviews, and observation, as a basis for informing continued development of this design. Formative evaluation results are summarized in the following areas: usability; veracity; the extent to which the user felt the experience was informative; cognitive, or the extent to which  the exercise provoked thinking; affective, or impact on attitude; and the value of group discussion in the exercise process. Desired learning outcomes that focus on attitudes, beliefs, and biases may lend themselves to further evaluation of narrative simulation in creating contexts in which to examine deeply held beliefs.

The PBL definition and process are presented, and the following goals of PBL are summarized: metacognition; self-directed learning; critical thinking and problem solving skills; knowledge acquisition, retention, and use; collaborative learning; and higher motivation and positive attitude. A categorization scheme of assessment is presented that includes a wide range of evaluation techniques and tools to assess students' behaviors and products in a PBL approach. Process-oriented and  outcome-oriented approaches are used to classify the assessment methods. Process-oriented evaluation methods include: tutor, peer ratings; self-evaluation; unobtrusive measure; oral examination; observation of a patient interview and examination; patient problem simulations; review of case record; authentic assessment; and performance assessment. Outcome-oriented evaluation methods include: review of case record; student-judged evaluation; multiple-choice examinations; short-answer or word-completion examinations; essay examinations; patient problem simulations; and portfolio assessment.

        "description":"Despite gains in many areas, minorities remain underrepresented as scientists and science students. On of the reasons for this absence may be the presence of a common stereotype of scientists as white males. This paper argues that recent research in cognitive and social psychology shows that stereotypic processes are not automatic and that stereotypes can be reversed through the use of multimedia software in the science curriculum that includes graphic images with specific occupation and background information about ethnic groups. Community college students who used the counterstereotypic version showed less negative stereotypic attitudes afterwards compared with students using the same software without the counterstereotypic images, when used within a course context that  included discussion of cultural differences. Based on quantitative stereotypic attitude changes, a two-step model for implementing changes in classroom curriculum is proposed that could influence student stereotypes about who becomes a scientist and perhaps lead to an increase in the number of minorities studying and practicing science.

The primary questions used to frame the evaluation study were: (1) Are there any features of the specific Web-based courseware package (learning environment) that are difficult to access by persons with disabilities? (2) What are the ways in which accessibility might be improved for the Web-based courseware? (3) Are there any standard HTML features of many Web pages in general that are difficult to access by persons with disabilities? and (4) What tools are available for checking accessibility for future revisions of the Web-based  courseware? Subjects were 11 university students with disabilities. The methods outlined include computer-based analysis tools, computer-facilitated focus groups, and focused individual interviews. Common limitations and suggested solutions are discussed in the following areas: lack of alternative text for images, imagemap hotspots, and applets; forms usage; frames usage; graphical icons; tables usage; and browser-specific code. Additionally, the paper includes URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) for several Web resources on accessibility, including a site created by the author based on the results of the evaluation study.

Participants were a teacher and teaching assistant who taught a graduate course in distance education at Arizona State University, delivered through a computer conferencing system. Data collected included interviews, observations, and messages posted by participants to a virtual classroom environment. Findings suggested that, while teachers conceded that they spent more time teaching an online course than a traditional face-to-face course, they believed the online teaching experience to be a worthwhile endeavor. In the context of an online course, teachers felt that they were more present and available for students than in a traditional course.  Results of the study also suggest that students displayed better commitment to their work in an online course than a traditional course, because they have close interaction with the teacher. This close interaction can offset the lack of control the students may feel in a highly structured distance course. The personality, emotions, philosophy, and educational background of the teacher determine the structure and design of an online course, including the amount of interaction and time the teacher spends on online activities.

The sample for the study was selected from a list of technology users (faculty and administrators) who subscribe to Indiana Higher Education Telecommunications Services (IHETS) for delivery of instructional services. The questionnaire was distributed via e-mail and focused on three themes--faculty demographics, job satisfaction, and early socialization. In order to examine the effect of DE on faculty motivation, the following three factors were evaluated: (1)  differences in motivation of faculty according to career status; (2) difference in administrative and faculty perceptions of reward structure; and (3) difference in motivation to teach via distance. It is concluded that faculty are intrinsically motivated to teach in DE. Motivation theory supplies a foundation upon which faculty socialization to DE can be built. Theories such as goal setting, participant modeling, and intrinsic motivation can be used to foster an efficacious environment. (MES)",

The following research questions are examined via quantitative, qualitative, and exploratory data analysis procedures: (1) Does instructional grouping or Web page format effect navigational decisions in an online learning environment? (2) Are there differences in the number of unique URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) visited with respect to instructional grouping or Web page format? (3) Are there differences in student attitude toward instructional grouping or computer-mediated instruction? and (4) Are there differences in quality of students' written language with respect to instructional grouping or Web page format? Fifty  undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory educational survey class at a large southwestern community college served as subjects. Each subject was randomly assigned to one of four groups: cooperative learning with advisement; cooperative learning without advisement; individual learning with advisement; and individual learning without advisement. Subjects participated in computer-mediated instruction employing Internet resources to gather information and compose an essay. An interaction between instructional arrangement and homepage design was observed with regard to navigation. No significant differences with respect to attitude and performance were observed. Implications for instruction, navigation, and interface design are detailed, and areas for further research are presented.  (MES)",

Students' anxiety toward science was also compared across the three treatment groups and between genders. Additional data on students' preferred learning style were used to explore possible interaction effects with their respective instructional activity. Subjects (n=280) were seventh-grade students in one junior high school. Classes were randomly assigned to the three modes of instruction. Data collection and testing occurred prior to treatment, one day after treatment, and three months after treatment. Data analysis showed mixed results for all measures taken.  Differences in achievement favoring the conventional treatment from pretest to both posttests leveled out somewhat over time. Although anxiety levels declined for both genders after treatment, females reported significantly higher science anxiety than males both before and after treatment. There appeared to be a relationship between treatment and gender in terms of effect on science anxiety. No significant difference in achievement by learning style was observed. However, the interaction between learning style and treatment was significant in some cases. In looking at achievement defined as gain scores among the three achievement measures, some cases within the microworld treatment proved to be significant. (Contains 40 references.) (MES)",

An evaluation study is also presented that investigated the effects of implementing the context-driven approach into the initial planning of an instructional program. Twenty-one practicing K-12 teachers were presented with case-based material that elicited plans for developing instruction designed to support the learning of specific performance objectives within an electronic media-supported environment. Each teacher developed two plans for specific objectives using both a traditional systems approach as well as the context driven design  model proposed. These plans were analyzed and reported according to the number and type of instructional components and elements included, the type of contexts described and the role electronic media played within these contexts, the type of social interaction environments defined by the electronic media, and general attitudes about developing instruction according to the two different approaches. Major planning differences with respect to the inclusion of specific instructional components and elements were identified between the two approaches, as was the role electronic media played between the teachers' different plans. Differences between context selections were also identified and reported. Implications for future research are included. (Author/MES)",

Three different versions of an instructional WWW site were developed, corresponding to the different types of interaction strategies. Twelve eighth-grade students (six dyads) were each assigned three similar instructional problems to solve, and they worked within the different Web environments to accomplish their instructional tasks. When the dyads experienced the navigational site, they viewed a main menu with broad topics  displayed as hypertext links. When the dyads were assigned to the functional site, they began their exploration with a site-specific search engine. When the dyads experienced the adaptive (constructionist) site, they were instructed to construct a Web site that addressed the instructional problem. Preliminary results indicated a number of differences between the subjects' performance and behavior while experiencing the adaptive site versus the other two treatments. These included spending more time with the material, reporting a higher degree of learner control, a higher perception of interactivity, and an increase in the amount of positive interpersonal interactions.

        "description":"Problem-based learning (PBL), initiated when learners meet the problem scenarios, develops learners' skills and subject matter content to make the transition from beginner to more expert problem solver. Beginning students might benefit from simple, well-structured problems, in which the understanding of sets of rules and principles results in a straightforward solution. Facilitators might consider providing learners with more experience with complex, ill-structured problems. However, seldom have reports provided PBL facilitators the solutions for how to design or select problem scenarios so that they open the door to significant learning outcomes consistent with course or program goals. The gray area between well-structured problems and ill-structured problems needs to be further  clarified for better learning effect. After a brief literature review, the author outlines a decision model for problem selection that addresses three dimensions: (1) conditions, including learning objectives, prerequisite skills and knowledge, available time, and presentation formats; (2) methods, including the simplifying conditions method and the problem-stimulated/student-centered strategy; and (3) outcomes for well-structured and ill-structured problems. The conclusion suggests that a PBL facilitator should consider the learning strategies both systematically and systemically. Future research is required to further develop this decision model.

Data were analyzed to provide a multifaceted description of teachers' current professional computer uses, their perceptions of the effects of the computer on their work, and what most facilitates or impedes their computer use. Subjects generally use the computer for typical tasks, such as creating instructional materials and performing administrative tasks. Most perceived their computer use as having a positive impact on their work, making them more  professional, more creative, better informed, and generally better educators. Surprisingly, improved interaction with colleagues did not emerge as a particularly important use of the computer. Accessibility to e-mail and Internet access was moderate or high for only 33.8% of the subjects, and few use the computer to communicate with colleagues, a use that might ease the isolation of teachers and foster professional development.

The course was team taught with an instructor at the City University of Hong Kong; video conferencing and Internet-based technologies were used to facilitate collaboration. Data were collected through observation, interviews, and document review. Multi-faceted views of the object/outcomes of work emerged, which led to both breakdowns in the processes of the work activity and to innovation and modification. The sets of assumptions embraced by the communities of practice to which participants belonged strongly influenced what each individual considered correct and  appropriate behavior. Concrete, empathetic ways of doing, guided by an ethic of care, emerged as the more influential forces in gaining knowledge and guiding action in this case. The researcher suggests that accepting these forces as the set of assumptions underlying design practice creates new potential for re-shaping and renewing the practice of instructional design, its research agendas, and design education. Major topics covered include: four activity systems and their underlying contradictions; analysis from a historical perspective; and implications for practice, research, and design education.

The study extended existing student support with motivational strategies in the form of motivational communications that should serve to help distance education students to become or stay motivated, so that they will successfully complete their courses. The ARCS (Attention, Relevance, Confidence, Satisfaction) model of motivational analysis was used for design and development of the MMSS (Motivational Messages Support System). Development research was  used for addressing questions on the validity, practicality, and effectiveness of the motivational messages. The study examined the extent to which motivational messages based on the ARCS model are effective in distance education courses, and the difference in effectiveness and cost-efficiency between the personalized and collective process of enhancing motivation through motivational messages. Data were gathered through student questionnaires, student interviews, tutor records, and tutor interviews. Findings indicated that the messages were effective and appreciated by students; no significant difference was found between the use of collective and personalized messages as regards effectiveness.

Topics addressed include: (1) the dispositional bottleneck between opportunity and action, i.e., sensitivity to occasion; (2) attitudes and spontaneous versus deliberative processing; (3) attitude strength and sensitivity to occasion; (4) attitude strength and ill-structured problems, including direct experience in opportunities for critical thinking, the role of sensory information, the role of emotions, free choice, and opportunity for rehearsal; (5) the Jasper Woodbury Problem Solving Series, specifically the use of the video-based adventure, &quot;Rescue at Boone's  Meadow,&quot; with fifth and sixth graders; and (6) the &quot;Decision Making&quot; mathematics unit designed for use in seventh grade. The following three design principles for nurturance of critical thinking dispositions are presented: development of attitude strength takes time; students need to have a stake in their learning; and multiple perspectives on problem solving are built into the design. Two tables list critical thinking components in &quot;Rescue at Boone's Meadow&quot; and &quot;Decision Making.&quot; (Contains 32 references.) (MES)",

Typical navigation schemes use abstract symbols (arrows) to label basic navigational functions like moving forward or backward through screen displays. In a previous study, the use of concrete representations (screen miniatures) to indicate backward navigation functions was found to significantly reduce the number of errors users made in backward navigation. The current study tested this claim using a more diverse sample of 35 adult subjects representing different ethnicity, nationality, and educational background, and an electronic instrument instead of the original paper instrument. A HyperCard(TM) stack was  developed in two versions--one with screen miniatures, and one with arrows to represent certain backward navigation functions--and used to test subjects' ability to choose the correct button for a particular backward navigation event. Subjects using the screen miniatures made significantly fewer errors than did subjects using arrows. (Contains 28 references.) (Author/MES)",

The research design was a two-factors ANOVA (ANalysis Of VAriance) with mode of navigation (linear, nonlinear) and distracters (i.e., the presence of &quot;seductive&quot; links) as the two factors. Volunteer participants (n=75) were recruited from Internet listings that advertised the study, drawing from a diverse nationwide population. This paper reports findings of the following dependent measures as they relate to the two-factor research design: friendliness of the Web site, attribution of disorientation, overall level of disorientation, confidence in navigating the Web site passage, interest in Web  site passage topic, accuracy at stating main point of the passage, and number of ideas recalled from content of passage. It was found that preference for sensation-seeking behavior and/or spatial-holistic ability did not influence the participants' perceptions of disorientation. Other results indicated that recalling examples from the text was facilitated when the site had no distracters, but an interaction indicated that participants' conception of the main point of the passage was negatively influenced if the site had no distracters when in the nonlinear navigation mode.

Participants were 43 undergraduate students. In the first experiment, participants were assigned to one of the four conditions and expected to learn the information to solve a posed problem, while students in the second experiment learned the information to pass a reading comprehension test. Results from the first experiment revealed that students in the navigational condition outperformed those in the linear condition with respect to their problem solving score. While there was no significant difference between generative and non-generative  conditions, the study found that there was an interaction indicating that generative activity may inhibit navigational hypertext systems in problem solving. The second experiment revealed significant differences between generative and non-generative conditions. While no significant difference between linear and navigational conditions with respect to reading comprehension scores was found, learners' reading comprehension raw score and dwell time revealed that learners assigned the linear conditions outperformed those assigned navigational conditions; this effect was canceled by dwell time in the final analysis. In both experiments the computerized text used was identical. (Contains 44 references.) (MES)",

Four cases (n=9, including three group projects and one individual project) were analyzed from an introductory educational technology course for preservice teachers during a unit on telecommunications. Participants were asked to generate projects for integrating the Internet into the curriculum. Within this project-based context, learners searched for information resources that would accompany their project ideas. Specifically, the study examined: strategies used by participants to guide their information seeking; the role of system, domain, and metacognitive knowledge in locating World Wide Web resources; and the  extent to which student integrate Web resources into coherent projects. Three major findings related to use of hypermedia systems during project-based learning are discussed: (1) progressing from data-driven to goal-driven approaches was critical to developing a coherent project idea: (2) consolidating multiple information resources with proposed project methods and rationales was challenging for learners; and (3) metacognitive, domain, and system knowledge appear critical to achieving coherence in project development. Implications related to the role of instructional scaffolding in encouraging goal-driven and metacognitive processing during open-ended learning are considered. (Author/MES)",

Data were collected using learner participant surveys, observation field notes, interviews, computer transcripts, and course artifacts. Data analysis focused on participant use of TWISTER, characteristics of the participants and learning environment that influenced participation, and communication and interaction in the different components of the learning environment. Findings indicated that participants recognized limitations in interactivity frequency and levels in the compressed-video environment. Planned  activities successful in this environment included using a wide range of activities and providing several means of access for communication. Although open and collaborative activities encouraged rapport building and enhanced interaction, participants still identified challenges. Use of TWISTER to facilitate student-centered activities also presented challenges. The tool did not support the activities as intended, and there was low overall usage. For participants, the added value of the groupware features did not outweigh the convenience of e-mail. Existing habits and limitations in functionality and interface were likely contributors to this low use. Results suggested that distance learning environments need to be improved through devising learner-centered activities and increasing  interaction. Recommendations for practice are included.

A hypothesized model was developed that depicted anticipated relationships (based on the literature) among the variable sets. Of the 500 questionnaires mailed to instructional design practitioners, 201 valid responses were returned. Stepwise multiple linear regression analyses and path analysis techniques were used to examine the following variables and test the hypothesized model: designer background; designer attitude toward motivation; instructional context; use of core ISD (Instructional  Systems Design) elements; incorporation of motivation design components (analysis, attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction); and perceived level of the project's success. A revised model was developed from the results. The study found that certain background and contextual variables influence the incorporation of motivation design components and that certain factors in the hypothesized model have a significant relationship to the perceived level of success of a project.

For relevance, motivationally-adaptive CAI was higher than motivationally-saturated CAI, but not  higher than motivationally-minimized CAI. For confidence and satisfaction, motivationally-adaptive CAI was not higher than the other two CAIs. For efficiency, both motivationally-adaptive CAI and motivationally-minimized CAI were higher than motivationally-saturated CAI, but only the efficiency of the motivationally-adaptive CAI was identified as having practical importance. For continuing motivation, there were no significant differences among the three CAIs, but a significant correlation was found between overall motivation and continuing motivation across three CAIs. These findings support the contention that the ARCS model is useful for developing motivationally-adaptive CAI. Motivationally-adaptive CAI can be an effective, efficient, and motivating form of instruction that may also  enhance learners' continuing motivation. (Contains 51 references.) (Author/MES)",

Two classes in Mexico City conducted school activities with two classes in College Station (Texas). Researchers examined: school activities that successfully bring children of Mexican and Texan cultures together to learn with, about, and from each other; similarities and differences in language skills and pastimes between the children of both cultures; and prevailing impressions Mexican and Texan children had of each other prior to their distance learning activities. Activities were designed to help the students understand each other's cultures by walking in each other's footsteps.  The investigation relied on arts-based case study methods. Content analyses were conducted of lesson plans and observations, students' poems about the other nation, students' stories about a day in the life of a child in the other culture, student questionnaires, students' collages, and student self-profiles. Mexican children had enough experience of U.S. culture to accurately describe it in poetry. Most Texan children had little knowledge of Mexico and had to write about their own culture, create an imaginary place, or refer to stereotypes in order to create a poem. (Author/ MES)",

Thirty Iowa high schools were selected to represent the state. Interviews were conducted with students, faculty, and administration at each of these schools; results were transcribed and analyzed. Individual case studies were written for each site, describing the setting, current level of technology and technology use, perceived impact of technology, and factors contributing to the current state of technology use at that site. Additional analysis was conducted to determine relationships among the variables, including district size, geographical location, reported level of technology use, actual technology use, perceived  impact, and critical factors. The primary uses of technology were for word processing, Internet research, and vocational applications. The more technologically advanced schools are incorporating multimedia production into the curriculum as well. This integration of technology is occurring despite multiple barriers, the most significant of which are lack of vision, time, money, access, training, and technology support. The integration of technology in Iowa's classrooms has triggered some important changes. Teachers and students reported changes in teaching methods, increased student-directed learning, increased access to information, and more motivated learning for both students and teachers. (MES)",

Discourse analysis provides a methodology with which to articulate the relationships between language, social context, and the cognitive processes that underlie discourse perception and production. Results are described of a pilot study that asked participants about how they navigate the Internet, as well as how they conceptualize space and time while using the World Wide Web. Four education graduate students were interviewed for the study, and their answers were audiotaped and transcribed. By providing a clearer sense of how people construct their experience while on the Internet, the study begins to present techniques for  analyzing end-users that help to clarify more culturally relevant technology-based pedagogies. The goal is to discern strategies for studying people to help design educational media, such as educational Web sites, that take into consideration not only how educational media is structured, but also consider the guiding mental models that influence learning on the Internet.

The CUCEI has seven scales that cover the areas of personalization, involvement, student cohesiveness, satisfaction, task orientation, and innovation. The scales determine the fit between a student's perception of the actual classroom environment and their preferred environment. Participants were 13 graduate students enrolled in three different courses on instructional technology offered at a distance over the World Wide Web. In addition to the data collected with the CUCEI, qualitative information was also collected in order to assist with interpretation of CUCEI  results, including papers and presentations, discussion questions, online lectures, peer discussion and feedback, and student reflective journals and time logs. Results are examined related to the viability of the use of the CUCEI in this context, followed by a discussion of student assessment of their virtual classroom environment. It is concluded that the CUCEI is promising in its ability to assess the virtual classroom environment and provide instructors with valuable information about student perceptions of the environment.

Unique features having to do with the status of computing at the university have led to the establishment of the IS Lab, which has produced a series of successful initiatives regarding World Wide Web courses. The four key features that have led to successful Web courses, initiatives, and students are: (1) integration of academia and computing; (2) a university-wide policy of decentralization with regard to computing resources; (3) a lab mission that includes many levels of support as well as research and development; and (4) an openness in the lab itself to real-world methods. In particular, a close relationship with the College of Education allows  the IS Lab to offer a high level of assistance in Web course design and technology integration to faculty members. The IS Lab, having tested a variety of approaches to the creation of Web courses, has chosen two. Software packages are made available, with training provided, and these packages may be enhanced if desired by individually developed Web sites. A multidisciplinary, real-world team approach, modified to include instructional designers, is a second method. A set of standards for Web courses has also been developed. (Contains 25 references.)

Educators should feel comfortable searching and critically evaluating information found on the Internet before trying to teach these important skills to students. Educators can practice critical evaluation of Internet sources by conducting searches on topics with which they are familiar. Search strategies should include keyword list formulation and Boolean combinations. Using one of the evaluation checklists reviewed in this digest, teachers should be able to evaluate sites critically, and to examine the technical aspects of the site, the authority  of the writer, and the validity of the writer's content. At the end of the evaluation, teachers should ask the following questions: whether the site provides the information they need to solve their information problem; and if it does not, how the process could be varied to obtain the needed results. Self-assessment at the end of the information seeking process is a higher-order thinking skill that students and teachers should understand and apply. Critical evaluation of information can be applied to all information sources including World Wide Web sites. This ERIC digest lists what are the important aspects of evaluation for educators; and what are the important aspects of teaching Web site evaluation to students.

The library's original purpose was to preserve the 12,000 volume personal library of President Hayes along with archival material from his careers in law, the military, and politics. This was a radical idea at the time; no previous presidential papers had been gathered in one location or made available to the general public. The library has grown from a small eclectic collection to an important repository of the Gilded Age, a period in American history from the Civil War to the beginning of World War I. It is administered by the Hayes Foundation and jointly funded by the Foundation and the Ohio State Legislature. The library/museum  building has undergone two major expansions to adequately house its collections. Since 1937, there have been four directors of research, and each director has promoted the library's development. In 1984, two librarians were hired to solely manage library services. This paper discusses the growth of the library through the years, particularly the scope of the collections, finding aids, and the increase in patron use of collections and services.

A study identified a population of community colleges with staff development programs for part-time teachers. Its objective was to learn about current training programs at community colleges through a locally developed survey instrument. The literature supported the use of a series of interviews administered through follow-up telephone calls as well as the designed survey instrument.  Findings demonstrated that the representative sample of 66 community colleges does reflect a desire to properly train adjunct faculty in the ways and means of proper teaching. An appropriate paradigm should contain all the segments identified in the survey--orientation, governance, substance (content), delivery, and modes--to fully represent a well designed adjunct faculty paradigm. The ideal training situation for community colleges is to insure that the adjunct faculty member is included as a full teaching partner in the college program. Includes appendices.

        "description":"This document presents El Camino College's academic program review guidelines as of January 1999. Academic programs are scheduled for full evaluation once every six years and involve a two-year process. By or before the beginning of each fall semester, the Office of Academic Affairs notifies the dean of each division as to which programs are to be reviewed during that academic year. The department's full-time faculty decides which instructors will become members of the self-study team. The chair(s) of all self-study teams should receive an orientation in the program-review process from the Coordinator for Academic Program Review. Program self-studies contain six major sections: (1) overview and responses to previous recommendations; (2) the program environment; (3) the program  curriculum; (4) program resources; (5) program effectiveness and efficiency; and (6) recommendations for the coming three years. Vocational or other programs that are accredited by off-campus agencies should use the self-study and validation procedures prescribed by their accrediting agencies. Three years after the completion of the self-study, a brief midterm report is due. All faculty in a program working on self-studies or midterm reports receive up to 15 hours of flex credit for their efforts if they are not compensated through other means. (VWC)",

        "description":"The accelerating development of distance education and the use of technology-mediated instructional materials over interactive computer networks has given rise to heightened interest and thought by faculty and administration alike about related copyright issues. The evolution of distance education from early morning television broadcasts to today's use of the Internet and digital technologies has given rise to heightened content-owner concern about the very real threats of piracy and unauthorized use of copyrighted works in education. This paper examines these issues. It provides an overview of copyright law, including a discussion of the exclusive rights enjoyed by copyright owners and the limitations on those rights by certain exceptions and defenses. The paper describes  current efforts in Washington that may result in a specific exception designed to promote distance education through digital technologies. This paper also discusses trends in electronic course ownership policies. And it examines the liability of a higher education institution for the infringing actions of its students, faculty, and staff. This paper is designed to provide readers with an overview of essential copyright and intellectual property law as it relates to education in general and to telecommunicated instruction in particular. It is not intended to provide definitive guidance. (VWC)",

A Report to the Governor and Legislature in Response to a Request from the Board of Governors to Recognize the Center as the Official Community College Center for the Lemoore/Hanford Area of Kings County.",
        "description":"The Lemoore Center of the West Hills Community College District serves the Lemoore/Hanford area of Kings and Fresno Counties--an area lying within both the West Hills and the College of the Sequoias Community College Districts. Jurisdictional problems between the districts prompted the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges to grant permanent educational center status to the Lemoore operation. In May 1991, the Board agreed that the best solution was to recognize the Lemoore Center officially, for three reasons: (1) the center is already built and offers a wide range of programs; (2) it qualifies for educational center status, given its enrollment is in excess of 700 average daily attendance (ADA); and (3) a decision to locate a permanent center in Hanford would  have a deleterious effect on the financial viability of the West Hills District. The report presents the eight criteria the Postsecondary Education Commission uses to evaluate all center proposals and describes how the Lemoore facility satisfied these criteria: enrollment projections, alternatives to new campuses or off-campus centers, serving the disadvantaged, geographic and physical accessibility, environmental and social impact, effects on other institutions, academic planning and program justification, and consideration of needed funding. Appended in this report are the Guidelines for Review of Proposed Campuses and Off-Campus Centers (1990 Edition). (VWC)",

The proposed site for the center is just over 60 acres in size, which suggests that it will never evolve into a full-service community college. It is the Commission's view that the long-range projections for the center are fundamentally sound, that by the time of its proposed 1996 opening, much of the &quot;sticker shock&quot; over fees will have dissipated, and that students will be attending in increasing numbers. The Commission thus recommends that: (1) the Vacaville Higher  Education Center should be approved as an educational center of the Solano County Community College District; and (2) the Vacaville Higher Education Center should become eligible for Sate capital outlay funding as of the 1994-95 fiscal year.

Peters and Waterman, two management consultants, have spawned thousands of models, designs, and strategies for using organizational excellence as a gyroscope for navigating the turbulence of change. This paper presents Waterman's four-step template that provides those seeking to use instruction as a change management design with a perspective for assessment: (1) structure: engaging the task; (2) systems: leveraging change; (3) style: pick your strategies; and (4) strategy: the Minnesota mindset. A careful analysis of the components and infusion into a college's culture will give direction and perspective. The author concludes that the transition to a learning organization  is a task that will succeed to the extent that it is in the hands of those who must implement it. Faculty must be encouraged to create a common, shared meaning out of a reality that is kaleidoscopic-multi-dimensional and always changing. They have the ability if given the opportunity. (VWC)",

This commission was charged with reviewing pertinent data and making recommendations to the higher education community regarding financial aid, factors affecting the cost of attendance, accountability, and public policy issues related to higher education affordability. The commission arrived at the following findings: (1) there has been a dramatic shift in responsibility for financing higher education, and this additional burden is increasingly being financed by student loans; (2) institutional aspirations and public expectations  have a significant impact on the cost of higher education; (3) Missourians have access to a diverse system of public and independent higher education, with a wide range of tuition and fee levels; (4) state-level policy makers and the public have a limited understanding of institutional pricing policies; and (5) no student pays the full cost of a college education--colleges and universities subsidize the cost of higher education with different sources of revenue and the subsidy varies by institution. The commission's recommendations address issues of cost containment, state budget policy, pricing, financial access, and consumer information. Contains 12 charts. (EMH)",

Eighteen two-year colleges participated in the application and implementation of an educational equity model designed to enhance gender equity within the very fabric of the institutions (policies, practices, classroom climate, curricula, support services among others) involving continual commitment and nurturing. In order to complete a comprehensive evaluation of the initiative, the effort recently focused on student perceptions of equitable campus climates and personal/career growth support and opportunities. A series of discussions and group activities at statewide  service workshops resulted in a general consensus regarding dimensions of evaluation format, content, feasibility, among other factors. The students became the beneficiaries of the initiative, as confirmed by the generally favorable perceptions of equitable campus climates and learning environments. A few areas perceived as less favorable included awareness of sexual harassment procedures and policies, introduction of nontraditional careers and role models, free interaction without tension, and faculty/staff/administrator diversity.

        "description":"The key to better outcome performance measures for community colleges is finding an effective and valid method of determining students' educational goals or reasons for attending the institution. In an attempt to find a solution to identifying student intent, San Juan College (SJC) postulated that student intent at any point in time can be most accurately measured by their behavior. The question undertaken in this study is: if we look at what courses a student is enrolled in and make certain assumptions about intent based on that enrollment, would we have a usable measure of student intent? In the preliminary explorations of this question conducted at SJC, the emerging answer is &quot;Yes.&quot; Student intent data inferred from student enrollment does indeed appear to be a stable measure,  with face validity, and quite usable as a qualifier for performance indicators. SJC identified four &quot;enrollment segments&quot; that would be likely educational goals for students attending the college: Career, Skill, Transfer, and Lifelong Learner. The tables presented in this paper show that reporting performance indicator data by enrollment segment provides community colleges an easy method to communicate performance data that are appropriate for student intent and the multiple missions of the institution.

Student Congress and its sponsored activities were prominently classified as the least satisfactory aspect of the institution. Half of the students did not know of the availability of workshops. Every aspect of the institution measured in this survey was rated above average. Food Service and Health majors provided more favorable responses than students in other majors, and Liberal Arts students provided the least favorable responses. No specific satisfaction trend was observed as a  function of the length of time at the College, but native English speakers reported significantly higher satisfaction than non-native speakers did. Academic Support and Services ranked highest in this survey, while the Overall category ranked lowest. Items with the highest level of satisfaction over the nine-year period dealt with the Climate and with instruction. All items with the lowest levels of satisfaction during the same period dealt exclusively with Student Congress. Appended in this report are the Survey Form, Statistics, and Respondents' Comments.

This report provides statewide information from graduates of selected occupational programs regarding the effectiveness of their community college experiences. Data for the report were obtained from responses to a standardized survey. The survey instrument addresses attendance objectives, education status, employment status, salary, employment start-up, geographic location of employment, and satisfaction with employment and components of the educational program completed. Such information has implications for colleges as they develop new program proposals and perform program review in order to ensure that they stay in step  with the changing job market, thus providing for satisfactory employment and compensation for their graduates. Part I of this report summarizes survey outcomes, which include: (1) 98% of the respondents were employed, pursuing additional education, or both; (2) average salary was $12.62 per hour; and (3) overall, graduates expressed satisfaction with their programs and college services. Part II includes an in-depth analysis of survey results for specific program areas. The Appendices provide detailed data tables derived from the results of the survey.

        "description":"This report summarizes findings of focus groups of recent high school graduates conducted during new student orientation at Carroll Community College (CCC) in fall 1999. Students were invited to participate in focus groups at the conclusion of the all-day orientation. Three focus groups were held, two with six participants and one with five participants. Participants were asked to respond to 25 primary questions and topics. Topics included: reasons for attending CCC, exposure to and evaluation of various advertising techniques employed by CCC, experiences with high school counselors, high school visits from CCC personnel, the CCC athletic program, registration difficulties, evaluation of class schedules from CCC and other local community colleges, direct mail from CCC, college  logos, and evaluation of advertising slogans and graphic designs. Initial analysis suggests: common reasons for attendance are low tuition, convenient location, attentive faculty, and small classes; most students plan to transfer to baccalaureate institutions; direct mail is the best method for reaching students; radio, television, movie theater, billboard, and athletic department advertising are not very effective; and students prefer simple, bold graphics and advertising slogans that motivate and inspire confidence.

During the course of a semester, students in an English 101 course at Central Arizona College compile a portfolio of their compositions. Included in the portfolio is a rewrite of the first assigned paper (P-1). The P-1 paper was due the second week of the semester and received evaluative remarks only (no grade) from the instructor. Students were later asked to rewrite P-1. Near the end of the semester, 24 students were asked to respond to the following two questions: 1) Why was/wasn't the P-1 easy to revise? 2) Should the P-1 be included in the portfolio? This document presents student responses and the instructor's conclusions. Conclusions were: 83% of students found the P-1 easy  to revise and 96% believed the P-1 should be included in the portfolio; responses indicate that students understand the purpose of the assignment and are able to reflect on their improvement as writers.

The survey queried students about whether DE fit their lifestyle, previous DE courses, access to a computer, the Internet and e-mail, and whether they would enroll in an on-line course. A total of 906 surveys were distributed and 423 were returned, for a response rate of 46.7 percent. Key results include: 87% had a computer at home, 85% had used the Internet to research a topic, 74% had Internet access at home, 66% had a personal email account, approximately 45% indicated advanced or intermediate experience with e-mail and the Internet, 17% had no experience with e-mail, 9% had no Internet experience, and 3% had no access to a computer. Survey results  were used to construct three indices that measure the preparedness of the student body for DE courses: Readiness Index, Technology Index, and Interest Index. Results from the three indices are presented in tables, analyzing data by age, gender, area of residence and other variables. Authors conclude that a good portion of the student body is ready for DE and even expect to learn with computers and information technology. Contains 24 tables.

        "description":"Although institutions of higher education have traditionally offered courses to students at times and places convenient for faculty and the institution, new communications technologies allow for the provision of distance courses that are also convenient for students. Distance education is characterized by three factors: communication between educators and students is influenced by geographical distance, communication is two-way and interactive, and technology is used to facilitate learning. Recent trends in higher education, including increasing numbers of non-traditional students and shrinking resources, make distance education an opportunity for educational institutions to improve learning. Although studies have generally shown no significant differences between traditional  classroom-based learning and distance education, distance learning brings the opportunity to implement new instructional designs that are more participant-centered and that improve learning. In fact, these changes are currently underway, as more faculty are being given access to technology, and the training to use that technology. Finally, as institutions of higher education respond to the need for new instructional design formats to accommodate non-traditional students, several factors unique to older, employed students should be kept in mind, including the fact that individuals' work shifts can change from week to week, emergencies can occur at jobs at any time, not all people will need to study entire courses, and presentations should be kept short to avoid interrupting the work day.

In addition to vital facts and concepts, pupils should also acquire major generalizations. And, in addition to facts, concepts, and generalizations, pupils also need to be able to think critically. Cognitive objectives are salient for pupils to achieve in ongoing lessons and units of study. Related to cognitive objectives are affective ends for pupil attainment. Affective objectives in science involve attitudes, feelings, emotions, and beliefs. Teachers who stress the emotions and their consequences for individuals emphasize heavy pupil involvement in curriculum development. Pupils' interests are salient in learner-centered instruction.  The attitudinal dimension of the learner is paramount in an affective-centered science curriculum. Finally, there are five dimensions of emotional intelligence: self-awareness, handling emotions, feeling motivated in achieving definite goals, empathy, and development of social skills enables a pupil to help others in everyday situations in life. Emotional intelligence harmonizes well with an affective science curriculum. Affective and cognitive objectives interact. Democracy as a way of life emphasizes that pupils respect each other's ideas and contributions. The affective domain cannot be separated from the cognitive. (VWC)",

This paper describes how Internet instruction differs from traditional instruction, what changes must be made if an institution chooses to move into Internet instruction, and some ramifications of those choices. As a general rule, Internet instruction has nearly all the problems of traditional instruction, plus the difficulties intrinsic in doing something different within an organization that has stayed the same, as most colleges have. If colleges are to get serious about the Internet, they must commit funds, people, and time, and must change the nature of the organization. If not, they must recognize that they are not serious players. Instructors must be prepared for  hard work. Times are changing, and so must the institutional mission if community colleges are to survive. Colleges should use Internet instruction as means of increasing student success as well as improving access and quality. However, they can no longer continue to focus on marketing themselves as the inexpensive alternative--they must sell quality, and do the things that produce quality. Contains 18 references. (VWC)",

Also, the Commission comments on the uncertainties facing community college capital  financing--and higher education generally--in the next few years and explains why planning should continue in spite of the financing difficulties facing the State. In the third part of the report, the Commission analyzes the district's proposal for the new center within the context of the Commission's Guidelines for the Review of Proposed University Campuses, Community Colleges, and Educational Centers.

Statistical information available on student transfer show that, despite the effects of nearly a half-decade of recession-driven funding reductions, the numbers of students taking advantage of transfer opportunities to continue  their academic careers after high school have recovered from several years of decline to reach its highest point this decade. Section two summarizes the progress that has been made in meeting the major provisions of SB 121. Section three provides a qualitative description of how the transfer function operates at three selected community colleges. Finally, in section four, the Commission offers its overall findings about the transfer function and future directions that should be pursued. Appended in this report are a glossary of transfer-related terms, case study profiles, and a copy of SB 121. (VWC)",

Overall, the team was impressed with the high level of quality inherent throughout the college. However, the team identified a number of institutional shortcomings relative to the accreditation standards. Findings are detailed in the responses to the recommendations of the previous team, observations, conclusions and recommendations under each of the eight standard areas, which are institutional integrity, purposes, planning and effectiveness; educational programs; student services and the co-curricular learning environment; faculty and staff; library and learning  resources; physical resources; financial resources; and government and administration. The most serious shortcomings which must be addressed by the college are outlined as follows: The college has made little or no progress in responding to many of the recommendations identified in the 1990 Accreditation Evaluation Report. Because of conflicts over shared governance, a growing list of planning, evaluation, and decision-making issues are not being effectively addressed. A systematic and integrated process of planning and evaluation, which involves all segments of the campus community and influences the acquisition and allocation of resources, does not exist. (VWC)",

        "description":"Senate Bill 156 of 1989 established the &quot;Teacher Assistant, Associate of Arts&quot; degree program in the California Education Code as a new offering of the California Community Colleges. It funded the creation of the program by two community colleges in different regions of the State, and it directed the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing to examine students who earn the degree for licensure as teacher assistants. It also called on the Postsecondary Education Commission to evaluate the outcomes of the program and to make recommendations, as appropriate, to the Governor, Legislature, and other agencies. This report responds to that request by describing the programs established by the two selected colleges, Los Angeles Mission College in Sylmar and Shasta College in  Redding, and evaluating them from both a qualitative and quantitative perspective, despite the fact that much of the information needed for a thorough program evaluation is not available (Part Three). Part Two of this report discusses the origins and implementation of the two programs. The report also discusses the challenges facing the two programs and presents seven conclusions and recommendations for their improvement (Part One).

The guide reports on what electronic collaboration is--a process that connects individuals electronically via the Internet to work together on an intellectual, academic, or practical endeavor--and explains why educators should participate in the use of this powerful tool that brings teachers together out of isolation, provides time for reflection, and provides other coincidental benefits. This guide is designed for teachers, school leaders, curriculum experts, technical specialists, and anyone else interested in this emerging technology. One can be involved in electronic collaboration in many ways, from participating, to setting up a  collaborative environment, to moderating a discussion. This guide tells those interested in the technology about: ways to collaborate electronically (chapter 2), designing and implementing a collaborative project, and becoming an effective online moderator (chapter 3), and choosing appropriate tools to support a collaboration (chapter 4). A list of resources to help educators explore the possibilities of electronic collaboration on their own and to assist them in getting the latest information about tools and collaborative projects is included (chapter 5). The book provides information about many forms of electronic collaboration, but focuses on discussion groups, as they are the most common online activity. Contains an index. (VWC)",

        "description":"This paper draws on the literatures of educational administration, management, and marketing to address, empirically, two issues related to community college faculty recruitment: (a) factors influencing faculty application decisions, and (b) the utility of an existing model for recruiting community college faculty. It examines factors influencing job applicant decisions, and discusses recruitment-as-job-marketing as a model for recruiting experienced educators. The report highlights three advancements achieved by the present investigation. First, the study responded to the call for additional research about recruitment practices prior to the initial employment interview. Second, this study focused on the effectiveness objective of faculty recruitment (to maximize the size of the  applicant pool) via an empirical investigation. The third advancement was application of a specified recruitment model to the community college context. This paper addresses whether or not organizational characteristics and job attributes described in recruitment advertisements influence the reactions of applicants for community college business faculty positions. Marketing theory and a specified recruitment model framed a laboratory experiment (3 X 3 ANOVA design) assessing reactions to community college faculty recruitment advertisements varied according to instructional program and job attribute content. Applicants for a business faculty position reacted most favorably to recruitment advertisements containing academic transfer program content. Implications for theory and practice are  discussed.

        "description":"Noting that current conceptualizations of children's externalizing behavior problems suggest that impulsivity underlies diverse behavior problems and may contribute to peer rejection, this study examined the association between impulsivity and peer status. The study also assessed the unique contribution of aggression and impulsivity in predicting peer status, and examined mechanisms through which externalizing behaviors and peer status were linked. Participating in the study were 200 second- and fifth-grade boys, their parents, and their teachers from rural Midwestern communities. Data on impulsivity, aggression, social cognition, and peer status were obtained from multiple methods (questionnaires, interviews) and sources (student, peer, parent, teacher), and were analyzed using  structural equation modeling. Findings suggested that the organization and differentiation of externalizing behaviors change over childhood. Impulsivity and aggression could not be differentiated in second-grade boys. By fifth grade, the boundaries between these traits were more delineated and were differentially associated with peer relationships. The association between aggression and peer relationship could be accounted for largely by impulsivity, suggesting that impulsivity may have a greater influence on peer relationships than aggression and supporting the importance of impulsivity as a potential organizing factor in understanding externalizing behaviors. Findings also suggested that social problem-solving ability had little impact on the relationship between impulsivity and peer  status. Although social cognitive ability mediated the relationship between aggression and peer status, it did so only when impulsivity was not included in the model, suggesting that the mechanisms leading to problematic peer relationships may be different for impulsivity and aggression.

        "description":"This study used the &quot;double easy-to-hard&quot; paradigm to examine the hypothesis that the class inclusion (CI) task should be equivalent in relational complexity to the transitive inference (TI) problem. Participating in the study were 64 girls and 50 boys, with a mean age of 8 years, 6 months. Stimuli for easy versions of the tasks were displayed visually. A computer was used for presenting auditory stimuli and for recording reaction times (RT). Children were given the CI and TI tasks approximately one week apart in counterbalanced order. Subjects were first given an easy version of the primary reasoning task, then a dual task (easy version presented jointly with a secondary, probe RT task), followed by a hard aurally-presented version of the primary task. The probe RT task was  presented alone in the first session. CI problems consisted of presenting a superordinate class followed by two subclasses differing in number of items. The TI task was comprised of 3-term series problems consisting of two premises followed by a binary choice option. Findings indicated that various predicted relationships within and across tasks were significant for boys, suggesting that the CI and TI task are capacity demanding and that they impose similar processing loads. However, some dissociations between CI and TI tasks suggest that inclusive reasoning may be qualitatively different from that of the TI problem. None of the predicted correlations were significant for girls; their performance suggested the adoption of a strategy that reduced capacity demands of both reasoning tasks.  (KB)",

        "author":["Clements, Douglas H."],
        "description":"Educational technology can change the way children think, what they learn, and how they interact with peers and adults, or technology can teach the \"same old stuff in the same old way.\" This paper examines computer use with young children and how computers can be used more effectively. The essay describes changes in the past decade in computer use, noting the increased number of preschools with computers, the drop in the ratio of students to computers, and increased concern over equity of access. The paper examines computer use in learning mathematics and science, and maintains that, although young children make significant gains using computer-assisted instruction software, technology should emphasize problem solving. Examples are given of programs allowing development of  problem-solving skills. The essay then examines the computer's role in the home and preschool, suggesting that most children use classroom computers occasionally, mostly for drill-and-practice, although more early childhood teachers are selecting more open-ended programs. Children use instructional software even less at home, even if it is present, and far less often than games. Research suggests that computers are potential catalysts for social interaction and cognitive play, with children's interactions affected by the software being used. The paper considers changes in the adult's role as the nature of computer use has changed, and notes that with careful attention to establishing physical arrangements, giving assistance, selecting software programs, and enhancing learning, adults can  optimize the computer's advantages.

        "description":"Although geometry and spatial reasoning are important as a way to interpret and reflect on the physical environment and also form the foundation for learning mathematics and other subjects, many early childhood and primary school teachers spend little time instructing their students in these areas. This paper examines how young children learn about space and geometry, discusses how they think about specific concepts in this area, and presents activities and teaching approaches that early childhood educators can use to help them develop. Section 1 of the paper examines how children learn about space and geometry and begins with an examination of Piaget's belief that children have constructed &quot;perceptual space&quot; by infancy but develop ideas about space through action; this is  followed by a discussion of children's exploration of shapes by touch, drawing of shapes, and the development of perspective taking. This section also describes levels of geometric thinking--from a holistic, unanalyzed visual beginning through description to an analysis of geometric figures--and discusses the important role of education in this development. Section 2 discusses how children of different ages think about salient mathematical concepts: shape, spatial orientation, and spatial visualization and imagery. Section 3 presents suggestions for instructing young children, including use of manipulatives and pictures, computer manipulatives, and the Agam program to develop the visual language of young children. The paper concludes by noting that it is essential that geometry and  spatial sense receive greater attention in instruction and research. (Contains approximately 60 references and 11 figures).

        "description":"This pamphlet presents the results of a series of focus groups comprised of Native American children and adolescents regarding their perceptions of race and class in the media. The results indicated that although some youth were concerned most about the absence of their group in the media, others were primarily concerned about stereotyped portrayals. Many Native youth spoke first about problems apart form race, such as sex, violence, values, and the portrayal of youth in general. However, common themes relating to the minority experience appeared consistently in all the focus groups. First, on the rare occasions when Native youth saw their culture and race in the media, the portrayal was often an unflattering picture. Many youth stated that they do not necessarily look to the  news for role models or reinforcement of their identity. Second, youth suggested more differences in news media treatment based on socioeconomic class rather than race as a definite divider. Third, Native youth often stated a preference for programming that would appeal to everyone, have a diverse racial cast, and reflect the realities of their lives. The report concludes that Native youth are concerned about media portrayals of race and class, note the absence of groups other than whites and African Americans, and believe that media can influence opinions and relationships. However, Native youth provided a unique perspective, and their critique covered issues such as fairness, violence, and opportunity as often as race or class. (KB)",

        "description":"An examination of the way welfare reform is presented in the national news media can provide insight into which aspects of the reform news consumers consider important. This study used a content analysis to examine all stories about welfare reform in the national press from: (1) June through August 1996, during which time the federal legislation was debated and enacted; and (2) June through August 1997, during which time legislation was being implemented at the state level. Content of 680 stories was examined for: the welfare issues addressed; main focus; discussion of impact of the reform and how it affects children; length; and photo content. Findings indicated that the most frequent story focus was on the potential and actual impact of the reform, with politics also a frequent  focus. Children were the primary focus of 6 percent of articles and received a limited discussion in 38 percent. The Los Angeles Times contained more welfare reform stories that other sources, although The New York Times featured the most articles focusing on children. A greater percentage of editorials addressed children's issues than any other article type. Impact of welfare reform was most frequently discussed in terms of government budgets. The impact of reform on children's lives was discussed most frequently in general terms. Based on the findings, it was concluded that framing the welfare reform issue primarily as one that affects public budgets can have consequences on how news consumers perceive the issue, and vote or act upon it.

This document summarizes a study of news coverage of children in national media in 1994 and reports on the follow-up conducted in 1998. The follow-up study was based on a sample of national news coverage collected throughout November 1998 from five major newspapers and three broadcast networks. Part 1 of the followup study replicated and updated the 1994 study. Part 2 added an additional month over-sample to determine whether the coverage contained a primary focus on minority children. The findings of the 1994 study led to the conclusion that although news coverage of children was substantial, it was not balanced. Among the key findings of the follow-up study were the  following: (1) child-related newspaper stories increased 37 percent over 5 years while television coverage remained unchanged; (2) the proportion of child-related news stories involving crime/violence dropped considerably, the proportion involving cultural/health issues increased considerably, and family/economic issues continued to account for the smallest number of stories; (3) children's voices were twice as common on television news as in newspapers; (4) both media provided very little practical information for parents in child-related news stories; (6) about 20 percent of stories addressed public policy concerns, down slightly from 1993; (7) children of color received little coverage, with African-Americans receiving more coverage than all others combined; and (8) stories about  children of color focused on education more than crime/violence.

        "description":"The social and collective aspect in human activities has become one of the main issues in Vygotskian analyses of learning and development. The study assumed that this aspect presupposes some feeling of belonging together and having a shared commitment on the part of the participants. Asserting that relatively little attention has been given to this &quot;togetherness&quot; in research on learning activities in general or on communities of learners, the study addressed the phenomenon of togetherness among a group of 6-year-old students and their teacher in Amsterdam (The Netherlands) who were involved in a collaborative text-construction task. The issue was studied mainly from a participant perspective. After a theoretical analysis of the notions of togetherness and conflict, analysis was  done of a videotaped episode of collaborative work, using Hicks' (1996) multi-layered model of activity analysis. Findings showed that in this learners' community, a variety of strategies were used by the participants to maintain the togetherness in their shared activity. The paper concluded that &quot;togetherness&quot; is a real and meaningful aspect of collective activities; the study of which may deepen insight into the dynamics of a community of learners and its activities.

        "description":"In 1995, Head Start developed performance measures to promote accountability through the assessment of program quality and outcomes. This report is the Head Start program's first progress report on its self-assessment using the evolving Program Performance Measures. These measures were developed using ideas from the broad community of people involved with the Head Start program and early childhood education. It is anticipated that the measures will continue to change over time, both as more data on the outcomes of Head Start become available to augment the process data that report on service provision, and as new research demonstrates how Head Start program practices and children's development are linked. The report's first section, &quot;Background,&quot; discusses the impetus for the  Program Performance Measures, how Head Start assessment moved from a focus on process to a focus on outcomes, first steps in developing and implementing the measures, and the nature of the Performance Measures. Part II, &quot;Conceptual Framework,&quot; describes the model around which the measures were developed and how indicators and data sources will be used for each of the 24 measures. This section also describes each of the measures and provides examples of the available data for the first reporting year. The measures are grouped under the five objectives of Head Start: (1) enhance children's growth and development; (2) strengthen families as the primary nurturers of their children; (3) provide children with educational, health, and nutritional services; (4) link children and families to  needed community services; and (5) ensure well-managed programs that involve parents in decision-making. Part III of the report presents the strategic plan for implementing the Performance Measures, including establishing an ongoing system of data collection, developing a communication plan, instituting a feedback loop for policy and resource decisions, and promoting use of the data by local programs. Appendices contain a Performance Measures matrix and Performance Measures data. (EV)",

The report provides preliminary outcome data for measures outlined in Objectives 1 and 2, as well as process data for Objectives 3, 4, and  5. The outcome data are from the Head Start Family and Child Experiences Survey (FACES), a nationally representative sampling of Head Start programs, classrooms, teachers, parents, and children examining the quality and effects of Head Start. The data in this report are drawn from the spring 1997 FACES field test in which approximately 2,400 parents and children were studied in 40 Head Start programs. Following a description of the conceptual framework on which the measures are based, the report's introduction and overview present findings from the FACES study: (1) Head Start classroom quality is good; (2) Head Start children are ready for school; (3) program quality is linked to child performance; and (4) Head Start families are involved despite challenges. Chapter 1 of the report  discusses the findings in more depth. Chapter 2 describes additional efforts underway to improve the quality and effectiveness of Head Start, including revision of the Head Start Program Performance Standards, monitoring system, and training and technical assistance system. Chapter 3 presents the Program Performance Measures Matrix, which contains data from the Head Start Monitoring and Tracking System (HSMTS) and the Program Information Report (PIR).

        "description":"Census Bureau data have traditionally focused on national estimates of the numbers of children in organized child care facilities using various household surveys. In contrast, this paper presents data on the characteristics of child care businesses for individual states from the Census of Service Industries. Although focusing primarily on the most recent census period, 1992, some historical data are shown for the censuses of 1977, 1982, and 1987. Child care businesses are classified according to the Standard Industrial Code in effect during each census period, and are defined as establishments engaged in the care of infants or children, or providing pre-kindergarten education, where medical care or delinquency correction is not a major element. These establishments do not include  businesses providing babysitting services nor do they include Head Start centers operating in conjunction with elementary schools; these centers are classified under the principal types of services provided by these businesses (e.g., schools, hospitals). Among the characteristics of the child care industry shown in this paper are the number of child care businesses, their tax return status (whether subject to or exempt from federal income taxes), their annual payrolls, and their numbers of paid employees. In addition, examination of the number of centers that went out of business during the tax year relative to the number that filed taxes for that year provides an indication of the annual turnover of businesses in the child care industry. The number of child care centers in business in  1992 and the size of their employee payroll are also used in conjunction with estimates of the number of preschool-age children of employed mothers in each state to provide demographic demand indices for child care services. The number of preschool-age children are derived from the Bureau's mid-year population estimates in conjunction with labor force data from the Current Population Survey (CPS). Relating these business indicators with demographic demand indices for child care can help demonstrate the potential unmet need for child care among the different states. In addition, estimates of the proportion of preschoolers reported to be in organized child care settings from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) are used to illustrate the relative children/child care  employee ratios throughout the United States for this period.

This paper discusses issues involved in early educational and intergenerational care, focusing on potential barriers in the academic and human service aspects of intergenerational programs and the potential benefits of these programs. Potential barriers discussed include: the distinct practices and terminology in the field of early childhood education and gerontology and the need to provide cross-training; children's use of inappropriate language with older adults; and discomfort for participating adults or children in various types of  environments. The paper also maintains that senior adults and young children are on parallel developmental courses and have parallel needs. The paper recommends the use of activities that are therapeutic by design, such as looking at photographs to allow for memory recall for adults. Benefits of intergenerational programs for children, older adults, and the community are also examined. The paper concludes by noting that communities often lack opportunities for intergenerational contact and that intergenerational programs provide opportunities to benefit from the richness of an age-integrated society.

The project's focus was on early childhood education and community development. Though starting at about the same time and under similar conditions, the project's development in the two communities diverged radically: one community continued its early childhood work, among other activities, while the other concentrated on community action. In Fernhill, children's services included child care, playgroups, child assessments, and new mothers' groups. There, the project helped to ease the transition into school, helped children learn new skills, and encouraged  them to be more confident and expressive. The project in both locations allowed parents a break from their children, and provided opportunities to meet others, training and education opportunities, and opportunities for parents to work as volunteers. In Fernhill, a core group of parents undertook formal training and became childcare volunteers, while in Perthcelyn, the core group campaigned for services for themselves and for their children, leading to considerable changes in the project plan. The project's major success was in promoting child development, empowering adults, setting up community groups, and promoting large-scale regeneration. (KB)",

        "description":"Based on the premise that the earliest years of a child's life are key to predicting ultimate success in school and life, this Texas Kids Count Project report examines early childhood education in the state, focusing on children from low-income families. The report discusses the importance of the early years of life for neurological development and the need for quality child care and early education programs, especially as the number of children with working parents increases. The report notes that about 30 percent of Texas children younger than 6 years old live in poverty and thereby face increased risks, in later years. They deserve to receive early education that will help them enter school prepared to learn. The report also describes the benefits of early child care and  preschool education programs and the characteristics of quality early education. Information is provided on the availability of early childhood education, with the caution that children in low-income families are particularly at risk of receiving inadequate care. Also presented is information on the percentages of Texas 3 and 4 year olds enrolled in public prekindergarten programs for each county and for the state as a whole. Finally, the report describes the Parents as Teachers Program as a successful early parenting program that provides comprehensive services to families from the third trimester of pregnancy until children are three years of age. The report concludes with a call for greater investment in both the quantity and quality of early care and education. (Contains 33 notes.)  (KB)",

        "description":"Noting that one of the most frequently cited recommendations for improving school safety has been to increase parental involvement, this report explores the variety of ways that parents can be involved in their children's education. The report delineates factors placing a child at risk for underachievement at school and notes that while parents cannot always change these risk factors, they have a great influence over many challenges. In addition, the report lists obstacles encountered by parents in trying to participate in their child's education and notes that examining each barrier can make possible the creation of new approaches that foster participation. The report further maintains that greater understanding is needed about the areas of involvement that are most effective in  improving student achievement. Several ways parents can become directly involved in their child's education are delineated, and indirect influences of parents in the school environment, at home, and in the community are described. In addition, the report describes possible practices schools can use to maximize their investment in family and school connections. Finally, the report describes the Alliance Schools Initiative as a model program, a community-based program to increase student achievement in low-income areas throughout Texas. The report concludes by noting that although additional research is needed to understand the types of parental involvement that are most beneficial, it is clear that students achieve more when parents provide good reading materials, monitor television  viewing, supervise homework, and hold reasonably high expectations of their children's performance.

One particular situation that can provoke problems is the request for help. Helping is not an easy situation because an individual's need for something creates an imbalance which children try to avoid. This study investigated whether help was more frequently given or offered in a sensitive and respectful way when children either were friends or demonstrated a balanced relationship between the extent of both partners' mutual help. Videotapes of sixth-graders' spontaneous interactions in the classroom were analyzed. One hundred and thirty-four helping acts were identified and rated according to the type and quality of helping. Children were also  interviewed about their relationships with their classmates. Findings indicated that reciprocal friends demonstrated a more balanced account of mutual helping and manifested adverse behaviors less often than non-friend dyads. Adverse behaviors among friends appeared to be related to rivalry or competition and not to imbalanced helping accounts. Findings raised the issue of the ways in which children's behaviors reveal a rational reaction to the situation and where they appear to be influenced by equilibrium or disequilibrium of the partners' input into mutual assistance.

        "description":"Alluding to the difficulty in explaining the two opposing powers, the &quot;dark side&quot; and the Force, in the Star Wars movies, this paper focuses on the complex combination of negative and positive interactions among children who are best friends. Presented in question-answer format, the paper discusses research findings and needs related to two seldom explicitly asked questions. Question 1 concerns the definition of &quot;the dark side of friendship,&quot; and focuses on fights, arguments, and annoying behaviors. This discussion explores the distinction between aggression and conflict, the impact of violations of assumed equality between friends, dominance versus leadership in friendship pairs, and violations of confidentiality or other violations of trust. The discussion maintains that  additional research is needed regarding violations of trust, particularly using open-ended questions and direct observations of friends' interaction. Question 2 concerns the characteristics of friendships when the dark side is prominent, such as whether it is possible to have both positive and negative interactions on a frequent basis, the stability of such friendships, the role of popularity, and availability of other friends. Three additional questions are examined to illustrate the significance of research on negative interactions between friends: (1) what is the psychological and social profile of children whose friendships are high in negative interactions? (2) how does involvement in the dark side of friendship affect children's development? and (3) if children's friendships are  high in negative interactions, should adults try to change those friendships?

        "author":["Fagnoni, Cynthia M."],
        "description":"At the request of the Senate Subcommittee on Children and Families, the General Accounting Office (GAO) examined programs and services funded at federal and state levels providing direct early childhood care and education for low-income children up to age 5 years. Also examined were state and local assessments of difficulties low-income parents face in obtaining child care, and collaborative efforts among child care and early childhood education (ECE) officials to address parents' difficulties. Data sources included a national survey of child care administrators and departments of education, and a survey of 537 child care resource and referral agencies. In addition, interviews were conducted with program officials at all levels and early childhood researchers. The major findings  of the GAO study are as follows. In 1999, the federal government provided approximately $11 billion to fund early childhood care and education services, mostly targeted to low-income children. These services most often focused on education but also occasionally included meals, immunization referrals, parental support, and social service referrals. About 73 percent of funds were for Head Start and the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF). Most states also fund early childhood programs, beyond the federal matching amount. Some types of care, such as infant and toddler care, are still difficult to obtain. Barriers to obtaining the types of care needed by low-income families included its high cost, unavailability, and inaccessibility to providers. Although collaboration among child care and  ECE officials has had positive outcomes, it does not eliminate all gaps in care. Collaborative initiatives have been limited because of barriers such as differing eligibility requirements.

A total of 246 children, ages 5 to 10 years, were given the Separation Anxiety Test (SAT) and various measures of intelligence and social competence, including the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test and the Progressive Matrices. Preschool teachers and mothers rated children's prosocial orientation and social initiative. The findings indicated that there were no gender differences on any of the SAT-variables in any study. Five- to 7-year-olds scored lower on attachment and security of attachment than did older children.  Internal working models of attachment were related to intelligence scores in girls but not boys. In 5- to 6-year-old boys, insecure internal working models of attachment (IWMs) were related to preschool teachers' ratings of ambivalent parent-child relations. Among girls, however, insecure IWMs were related to avoidant behavior during everyday reunions. Among 5- to 6-year-olds, only boys' IWMs were related to preschool teachers' ratings of peer competence. Among 8- to 10-year-olds, IWMs were related in different ways to self-, maternal-, and teacher-ratings of empathy and to observed social behavior for boys and girls. The SAT measures most consistently related to social competence were attachment responses for girls and self-reliance responses for boys. (KB)",

Participants were parents of toddlers enrolled in 11 urban day care centers serving low-income families of color. The 12-week intervention consisted of a video-based PT program with group discussion. Eleven centers were matched and assigned to one of four conditions: PT for parents only, PT for day care teachers only, PT for parents and teachers, and no intervention. Data were obtained pre-intervention, post-intervention, and at 6- and 12-month post-intervention intervals by means of parent and teacher reports, parent-child observations, and classroom observations. Dependent variables included parent and teacher self-efficacy, child behavior problems at home and in day care,  parent discipline strategies, parent stress, teacher behavior, and quality of parent-toddler interactions. Preliminary findings included data from pre- to post-intervention for 158 study parents and 92 day care teachers. Findings indicated that PT parents reported less reliance on coercive discipline and gave fewer negative, indirect, and direct commands to toddlers during play than comparison parents. Children of PT parents used fewer aversive behaviors with their parents and demonstrated fewer classroom behavior problems than comparison children. Of children who exceeded cut-off scores on classroom behavior problems at pre-intervention, 80 percent of PT children fell below cut-off at post-intervention, compared to 40 percent of comparison children. Of children who exceeded cut-offs on  observed child deviance during observed parent-child play, 100 percent of PT children fell below cut-off at post-intervention, compared to 50 percent of comparison children. PT teachers reported improvements in child care self-efficacy. (Contains 16 references.) (Author/KB)",

This study examined fathers' teaching style differences and the effects of those differences on children's recall and transfer of a strategy for solving balance scale problems. Participating were 11 father-daughter and 9 father-son dyads. Children ranged in age from 9 to 12 years. Two balance scales were used during instruction, one with four pegs to each side of the fulcrum, and one with 10 pegs to each side. During a laboratory session, fathers completed a questionnaire regarding his aspirations for his child and his involvement in his child's life. Prior to the teaching phase, fathers' understanding of the  mathematical rule for solving balance problems was verified. The teaching interaction was videotaped. Following the interaction, children received a posttest of 4-peg problems to test strategy maintenance and were also posttested for transfer on a 10-peg scale and for far transfer using problems presented on paper. Teaching style was defined by the change over time in the proportion of words spoken by the father and child. The findings indicated that fathers were highly variable in the amount of time they took to teach the strategy, as well as in their teaching style. All fathers were equally effective in teaching the strategy to their children. A high correlation was found between frequency of help with homework and efficiency of teaching.

Four primary 5 classes, comprising 151 students, participated in the cooperative learning and four primary 5 classes, comprising 164 students, did not. All students were 11 years old. Between 76 and 81 percent of the students were Chinese, and the other ethnic groups represented were Indian, Eurasian, and Malay. Data were collected through sociometric surveys conducted before and after cooperative learning  was used in social studies classes. The findings indicated that after 8 months of learning in cooperative groups, children in the experimental groups showed significant gains in percentage of cross-race choices of friends. Target diagrams of the sociometry survey indicated, however, that children still showed a distinct tendency to select friends among the same race. Also, getting pupils to work collaboratively in heterogeneous groups did not seem to produce gains in acceptance of low status children. Inherent in groupwork are problems of status and personality, and the teacher plays an important role in integrated rejected and neglected children. (Contains 18 references.) (KB)",

        "description":"While research on prosocial behavior has dramatically increased during the last 20 years, there are few studies examining the role of self-evaluative emotions such as pride and guilt as consequences of and motivations for helping others. This study examined how children attribute pride and guilt for actions germane to the moral or competence domain. Participating were 95 five- to nine-year-olds from a public and a Catholic parochial school. The children were individually presented a story in which a protagonist experienced two successes, one in a moral domain and the other in a competence domain, or two failures. A foil event was presented that was congruent with an emotion opposite the one appropriate for the purposeful successes/failures. Children were asked how the protagonist  felt about himself/herself and what made the protagonist feel that way. Loglinear analyses were performed with the following factors: protagonist outcome (success versus failure), child age (below versus above 7 years), and school (public versus parochial). Dependent variables were appropriate emotional identification and moral domain identification. The findings indicated that older children were more likely than younger ones to identify the appropriate emotion and identify the moral domain. The appropriate emotion was more likely to be identified following the protagonist's failures versus successes. The moral domain was more likely to be identified following the protagonist's failures than successes. Parochial school children tended to perform at a more sophisticated level in  identifying an emotion appropriate for failure in a moral domain, and less sophisticated in identifying emotion appropriate for success in a moral domain.

The teachers received inservice training on cooperative learning and worked closely with a university research team as they implemented cooperative learning for social studies and other subjects. The teachers were subsequently interviewed in the middle and at the end of the project and observed three times in their classrooms. Teachers also maintained a journal regarding their experiences. Four major themes were identified within the four case studies: (1) the teachers' motivation for adopting cooperative learning in the classroom; (2) the concerns and difficulties faced by teachers; (3) the effects of this innovation on their pupils' learning; and (4) how the use of  cooperative learning affected each teacher's own professional development. The findings of the research underscore the need for strong institutional support if teachers are to be motivated to use cooperative learning in a systematic and sustained manner.

The study compared educational performance and developmental progress of preschoolers enrolled in the program with that of children in traditional kindergartens. The program's critical elements are family involvement, a child-centered curriculum, teachers as facilitators, and building collaborative relationship with important educational systems. Child assessment batteries were completed during May 1998 for 587 five- to seven-year-olds selected from 5 Step by Step programs and 5  traditional kindergartens in each country. Children were selected according to a stratified, randomized method with gender being the stratification criterion. Child assessment measures included the Test of Early Mathematics Ability; Emergent Literacy Assessment; Adapted Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test; and Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT). Findings for Bulgaria indicated that Step by Step children were performing at the same level as children in traditional programs. In Kyrgyzstan, Step by Step children dramatically outperformed those in traditional programs in both numeracy and literacy. In Romania, children in Step by Step classrooms from the low and high ends of the developmental spectrum were gaining more mathematical understanding than children in traditional programs and  scored higher on the TTCT Unusual Uses test. In Ukraine, Step by Step children outperformed children in traditional programs in mathematics, the flexibility subscale of the TTCT, and receptive vocabulary. (KB)",

Dweck (1994) to explore individual differences in achievement goals held by young children. The emphasis was on learning goals, which focus effort on mastering new tasks, and performance goals, which focus effort toward documentation of ability. Participating in the study were 39 Caucasian and 39 Hispanic kindergarten children enrolled in 6 public schools in Idaho. Subjects were asked to solve puzzles of cartoon characters, with some of the puzzles altered to prevent successful completion. Children were then asked to choose between additional challenging or no-challenge tasks. Based on their preferences for challenging versus  no-challenge puzzles and their reasons for so choosing, children were categorized into learning and performance goal groups. The findings indicated that the proportions of Hispanic and Caucasian students holding learning goals were almost identical. Twenty-one (54 percent) Hispanic children held learning goals, and 22 (56 percent) Caucasian children held learning goals. Kindergartners' preferences for learning or performance goals did not vary by ethnic group. There was an unexpected effect of gender on goal preference, such that 60 percent of males preferred performance goals, with the remainder preferring learning goals; these preferences were reversed for females, with 33 percent holding performance goals and 67 percent holding learning goals. The same pattern was observed in both the  Hispanic and Caucasian ethnic groups. (KB)",

        "description":"Noting that many factors can influence the extent to which families are engaged in their children's education, this study examined the influence of family and school barriers as potential barriers to parent involvement. The sample was taken from a local site of the National Head Start/Public School Transition Demonstration Project. Participants included 151 families whose children were formerly in Head Start, and were in second grade at the time of the study. Family involvement was divided into involvement in children's education at home and involvement in school activities. Family contextual variables included family structure, employment, family resources, and parents' childhood experiences of school. School level variables consisted of school climate and family-school  communication. A series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the contributions of family and school level variables. Demographic variables were entered in the first block, followed by family structural barriers, and finally school level barriers. Regression results indicated that neither the family demographic variables nor the family structural variables, as a group, were significant predictors of parents' participation in their children's education at home. The school level variables block, however, was significant, with family-school communication positively related to participation in children's education at home. For parents' involvement in school activities, all three blocks were significant. Yet, the school level variables predicted involvement  over and above the family level variables. Consequently, as some researchers have suggested, school practices seem to be as important--if not more so--as family factors in influencing family involvement. (Contains 10 references.)

This report is designed to provide state lawmakers and their staff with research and state examples of policy options to advance child care quality. The report outlines selected elements of quality early childhood systems that go beyond minimal regulatory standards. The report also discusses research findings, provides state policies, including legislative initiatives, and results of some of these initiatives. Following the introduction, the four sections of the report highlight four quality issues that legislators can affect and that are above  and beyond state regulation: (1) an effective work force--policies that promote training, education, career development, and better compensation for providers; (2) program quality and accreditation--providers who meet certain standards in addition to and above minimum regulatory requirements; (3) reimbursement rates--policies and levels of funding to child care providers who care for children who are subsidized by the state; and (4) comprehensive services--enriching the support services in child care programs, including health and education linkages and outreach to parents and providers. The report notes that, in the past few years, there have been innovative advancements in several key areas, including greater professional opportunities for providers, a focus on voluntary accreditation,  fiscal incentives in the form of variable reimbursement rates to high-quality programs, and establishment of early childhood initiatives that are enriched with comprehensive health and social services.

        "description":"From the academic--or instructivist--perspective, the young child is seen as dependent on adults' instruction in the academic knowledge and skills necessary for a good start for later academic achievement. This perspective is in direct contrast to the active and interactive curriculum assumed by proponents of the constructivist approach. This Digest considers instructivist and constructivist approaches to early childhood education and suggests that attention to children's intellectual development may inadvertently be overlooked by both sides. The Digest considers why the academic approach has grown in popularity, how to distinguish academic from intellectual goals, what research says about constructivism versus instructivism, the importance of children's intellectual development,  and teaching methods that support children's intellectual development. Project work is suggested as a way that young children can express their intellectual dispositions in the pursuit of serious topics, apply their emerging and academic skills, and generate high-quality products. The Digest proposes that the early childhood curriculum be structured so that it is focused on at least a trio of goals: (1) social/emotional development; (2) intellectual development; and (3) the acquisition of meaningful and useful academic skills.

        "description":"In the United States, the family is regarded as primarily responsible for financing the education and care of children under age 5 as well as the education of offspring in postsecondary education, with the intervening years of education publicly funded and considered the responsibility of society at large. This paper describes the student financial aid system for postsecondary education and identifies strategies with potential for financing an equitable, accessible system of high quality early childhood education and care. Presented in four major sections, the paper reviews the purposes and sources of financial aid; describes the delivery system, focusing on how financial need is determined; discusses accreditation as an indicator of quality in financial aid funding; and explores  the potential implications of the postsecondary financial aid model for financing quality early care and education programs.

        "description":"This descriptive study examined differences in childhood play across three generations, focusing on kind of play, time of play, and the place play occurred. Participating in the study were 100 persons randomly selected from an initial sample of 165, with 20 subjects from each of 5 age groups: 5 to 12 years; 13 to 20; 21 to 40; 41 to 65; and older than 65 years. The study population lived primarily in urban communities in upper East Tennessee. Data were collected by means of interviews and a 28-item written survey (conducted orally for those who for age, health, or physical handicap reasons could not complete the written survey). Findings revealed that respondents over 65 years had less experience in play with board games, puzzles, and hobbies than other age groups. Childhood play  with electronic toys/games was more common with the 5-12 year group than with other groups. Childhood play with parents was most prevalent among the 13-20 year group. Childhood pretend play had the highest score among the participants over 65 years of age. The two oldest age groups were more likely to have limited time for play than younger age groups. The respondents over 65 had the highest response to outdoor play, and the 5-12 year group had the highest response to indoor play. The degree of change appeared to be related to geographical location and family structure during childhood. Also implied was a relationship between play changes, historical events, and shifts in societal pressure. (KB)",

        "description":"This study examined the relationship between multiple school transfers during elementary school and student academic achievement. Participating in the study were 105 sixth graders enrolled in a northeast Tennessee middle school. Data were collected by means of examination of school records to determine student mobility, and student scores on the Terra Nova Achievement Test (language, reading, mathematics, and overall composite). Four groups of students were identified: (1) 30 students randomly selected from the group of students who had transferred one time or not at all during the elementary school years; (2) 30 students randomly selected from those who had moved twice; (3) 17 students who had moved 3 times; and (4) 28 students who had moved more than 3 times. The findings  revealed a significant correlation between multiple school transfers and student achievement scores. There were also significant differences in test scores between students who had transferred one time or less and students who had moved two times, three times, and more than three times. No other significant achievement differences were found among the four groups of students. It was concluded that students who remain in the same school or transfer only once have better academic achievement than more mobile students, and that after two moves, additional moves do not lead to further academic harm.

The Peabody Family Involvement Initiative (PFII) is based on themes related to families, family-school collaboration, and developmental issues, and involves three components: (1) general knowledge; (2) skills; and (3) authentic \"real life\" settings. The themes were addressed in a 1-semester university course taken during the sophomore or junior year and in the  implementation of \"theory into practice\" activities during a 15-week student teacher placement. Mail surveys were completed by preservice teachers just finishing the 1-semester course, by preservice teachers completing their student teacher placement, and by inservice teachers who had graduated from the program within the last 3 years. Sixty-nine surveys were returned from practicing teachers, for a 33 percent return rate. Findings indicated that teachers who took the course were more likely to feel prepared to implement parent involvement activities. Nevertheless, teachers who took the course indicated that they needed more preparation. The parent involvement activities engaged in most often were introductory home/school activities, written progress notes, phone calls to families,  participating in meeting with parents of children with special needs, and parent-teacher conferences.

Participating in the study were 20 second graders (7 females and 13 males) from 1 classroom in a rural northeast Tennessee school district. Data were collected by means of observation of five targeted behaviors during specified morning and afternoon periods in the classroom. Pre-intervention and post-intervention data were collected for 1 week. The 1-week intervention included the following procedures: (1) a behavior contract signed by students listing inappropriate target behaviors; (2) daily recitation of a pledge to be the best student possible; (3) charting of behavior violations by the classroom teacher; (4) entry into a lottery  for a book for students with no infractions; and (5) for students with no infractions for 1 week, an award of a free 100-assignment pass. Data indicated a significant decline in students' inappropriate behavior toward an authority figure following the intervention, and that males exhibited more inappropriate behavior toward an authority figure than did females. In fact, females exhibited no inappropriate behavior toward an authority figure during the classroom observations. (Contains 10 references.) (KB)",

        "author":["Hembra, Richard L."],
        "description":"As a condition of receiving federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funds, states are required to operate Child Support Enforcement (CSE) programs. Families receiving TANF are required to participate in the CSE program; families not receiving TANF may also request CSE services. However, since 1994, an increasing number of states have begun to pay out more to operate their CSE programs than they receive back in reduced welfare caseloads. At the request of the U.S. House subcommittee on Human Resources, the Government Accounting Office sought to determine how CSE welfare collections had changed since 1994, and how declines in CSE welfare collections have affected CSE program funding. Annual report data from the Office of Child Support Enforcement were analyzed, and  interviews were conducted with CSE officials in seven states experiencing declines in their retained collections. The study found that despite significant declines in TANF caseloads and CSE welfare caseloads, total state CSE welfare collections nationwide increased 11 percent between 1994 and 1997. While declines in CSE welfare cases might have been expected to lower CSE welfare collections for the states and federal government, the program's ability to intercept more money from delinquent noncustodial parents' income tax refunds more than offset the effects of the caseload declines. Although declining caseloads have resulted in lower retained collections in seven states, CSE officials in those states said the decline did not negatively affect their CSE program funding; the way a state  chooses to finance its CSE program determines its sensitivity to fluctuations in CSE welfare collections. It was recommended that Congress require states to charge a minimum percentage service fee for each successful non-welfare CSE collection to offset cost shifts caused by declining caseloads.

The introduction to the guide describes the partnership between ASSIST INTERNATIONAL, INC. and the ERIC Clearinghouse on Elementary and Early Childhood Education that led to the development of the ResilienceNet Web site. The introduction also offers a definition of resilience. The Selected Readings section of the guide reprints four papers and four ERIC digests on resilience: (1) &quot;A Guide to Promoting Resilience in Children&quot; (Edith H. Grotberg) divides resilience-promoting factors into categories that refer to children's external supports, personal strengths, and interpersonal skills, and explains how certain actions help or  hinder the development of resilience; (2) &quot;Developing Resilience in Urban Youth&quot; (Linda F. Winfield) identifies characteristics of resilient children and examines children's experiences during critical transitions; (3) &quot;A Framework for Practice&quot; (Bonnie Benard and Kathy Marshall) discusses a training program for staff who work with children; (4) &quot;Exploring the Dynamics of Resilience in an Elementary School&quot; (Saundra Murray Nettles and Frances P. Robinson) examines the processes of resilience in students at an urban elementary school; (5) &quot;Fostering Resilience in Children&quot; (Bonnie Benard) identifies protective factors that enable children to manifest resilience; (6) &quot;Turning It Around for All Youth&quot; (Bonnie Benard) describes how educators and schools can foster resiliency; (7) &quot;Cultivating  Resilience&quot; (Mary Finley) interprets, for application in rural areas, research findings that suggest ways schools and communities can protect children from various threats; and (8) &quot;Violence and Young Children's Development&quot; (Lorraine B. Wallach) examines the developmental consequences for children who are victims or witnesses of violence. The guide then highlights the ResilienceNet Web site and provides an annotated list of Web sites that address resilience. The guide concludes with two annotated bibliographies on the resilience of children and families. (BC)",

The sample of families was fairly homogenous: all two-parent families, primarily white and of European descent, with a target child who, at the beginning of the study, was in fourth grade. In a little less than half the families, the mothers were not employed outside the home. Children were interviewed in fourth, fifth, and sixth grades, and their parents completed questionnaires in each of those years. Assessments of the parent-child relationship were based on data from both the father and the target child. Findings suggest that fathers' perceptions of chronic stress at work, over a 1-year period, had a negative impact on the father-child relationship. The  effects were observed in terms of increases in parental withdrawal and more aversive father-child interactions. The data suggest that these findings were stronger among father-son dyads than among father-daughter dyads. Some variation from this pattern was found for the single-earner families. (HTH)",

        "description":"Cognizant of the American high school students' waning test scores and a decreased desire to pursue higher level courses in mathematics and science, there has been a categorical effort to identify the demographic and motivational variables that contribute to mathematics and science achievement. This study utilized the 1992 panel members (8,140 males, 8,349 females) of the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988. Two theoretical frameworks were used in the study: Walberg's Educational Productivity Model analyzed the interconnections among parental influence, family structure (intact: two-parent and/or nonintact: one-parent households), and the SES predictor variables within the home environment section of the model. The Shavelson, Hubner, and Stanton Structural Model (1976)  provided a theoretical mechanism for understanding the multifaceted construct of self-concept. The findings of the study disclosed that females and males closely paralleled each other on both criteria. The best predictor for achievement for both genders, regardless of family structure was prior ability. Similarly, both males and females in intact and nonintact households were directly influenced by low mathematics performance for the criterion mathematics. An additional key finding for males from both intact and nonintact households was that SES had a direct influence on both terminal variables. (Author)",

        "description":"Plans for advocacy networks were incorporated into a project to promote Appalachian middle school girls' interest and persistence in science, mathematics, and technology. The project took place at rural and urban sites with diverse (White and African American), low-income populations. The girls were invited to participate in the 3-year project without regard for their grades, teacher recommendations, or expressed interest in science and mathematics and were selected through stratified random sampling to ensure representative numbers of Anglo and African American participants. This paper focuses on the development of networks of &quot;advocates&quot;--parents, mentors, and teachers who would support the girls' schooling and aspirations. Advocate meetings were designed to focus on the girls  as students whose futures were worthy of time and effort, to give weight to the girls' achievements, to engage advocates and girls with one another, and to provide information that could empower advocates to promote the girls' academic futures. Initially, at both rural and urban sites, low-income girls faced similar constraints on academic success: low teacher expectations, lack of resources in schools, peer pressure toward active sexuality, and low parental involvement. Yet efforts to develop visible networks of advocate support produced dramatically different results, with family involvement much greater at the rural site. This outcome is discussed in relation to rural church-going activities versus urban consumer attitudes. (Contains 22 references.) (SV)",

        "description":"This master's research project investigated teaching practices in a Native community school in Manitoba in relation to the school's high dropout rate. The school was located on an isolated Native reserve in northern Manitoba, providing education through grades 9-10. In contrast to successful Native education programs elsewhere that are based in Native language and culture, the school delivered the standard Manitoba provincial education program. In the higher grades, student attendance was very sporadic, and almost all students failed to graduate. Student behavior problems were widespread, and teacher turnover was high. Surveys were constructed with teacher and student input and completed by most teachers and by all students in grades 5 and higher. Several factors emerged as  contributing to teenagers' decision to abandon school. Teachers were fully qualified to teach in urban mainstream schools but were poorly prepared for rural northern Native schools. No teacher had taken a university course in actually teaching Native children, and only Native teachers and local aides could speak Cree or relate to community cultural norms. Most staff were new teachers and had little knowledge of alternatives to teacher-directed lectures. As students grew into teenagers, their dissatisfaction with school developed into overt rejection, characterized by nonparticipation and misbehavior. Teachers' disciplinary efforts were unsuccessful.

In fall 1998, a survey of all 151 schools examined enrollments, budgets, staff, salaries, and benefits. Enrollments ranged from 2 to 174 students; 83 schools had fewer than 19 students, the point at which a school is required to hire a second teacher. General fund budgets ranged from $22,000 to $97,216 for one-teacher schools and from $57,882 to $113,000 for two-teacher schools. Full-time teacher salaries ranged from $11,565 to $38,775. Tables present the number of schools in various salary ranges and average salaries for each fifth of the schools. Some type of housing for teachers was provided by 41  schools, primarily the lower-paying schools. Only 24 schools paid a specific stipend to the supervising teacher. Other data include mileage paid to teachers, provision of health insurance, janitorial duties performed by teachers, professional and personal leave days, and salaries of school clerks. Findings are compared to those of a 1992-93 study. Appendices include the survey form, a list of participating schools, and comments from the surveys. (SV)",

Approximately 906,000 persons aged 15 and older were employed as hired farmworkers each week in 1996, and an additional 72,000 persons were hired as farmworkers as a second job. Hired farmworkers were more likely than all U.S. wage and salary workers to be male, Hispanic, younger, less educated, never married, and non-U.S. citizens. A third reported less than a ninth-grade education, compared with less than four percent of all workers. Between 1990 and 1996, real median earnings increased four percent for hired farmworkers while decreasing four percent for all workers. The first section of this report covers  demographic characteristics: gender, age, marital status, racial or ethnic group, citizenship status, education, unemployment, and secondary job holders. Other sections discuss part-time versus full-time employment, distribution of hired farmworkers by geographic region and type of agricultural establishment, and earnings characteristics. Educational attainment data are presented for hired farmworkers; all wage and salary workers; non-citizens; gender and racial/ethnic groups of hired farmworkers; hired farmworkers and all workers by employment status; and hired farmworkers by geographic region and by type of agricultural establishment.

        "description":"A teacher educator and artist explores alternate ways to think of teaching as a creative endeavor. This paper brings together the voices of Appalachian craftswomen and the wisdom of educator and philosopher John Dewey to create a patchwork that celebrates the common threads of quiltmaking and teaching. Interviews with West Virginia craftswomen and a review of selected literature on quiltmaking in Appalachia provide authentic voices whose words and stories are interpreted within Dewey's philosophy. Dewey's focus on the ongoing nature of process offers a means to know and appreciate the full measure of engagement and passionate commitment to the task at hand. Whether the task at hand involves piecing a quilt or designing a lesson plan, Dewey's philosophy pushes the creator to  embrace the presence and wholeness of the experience itself. The experiences of Appalachian quilters as they engage with the materials and methods of their craft can offer preservice teachers a new language for understanding Dewey's insights about teaching as a form of art. Parallels are drawn between aspects of the quiltmaker's and the teacher's experience, including use of a variety of shared materials, design as purposeful composition, creation of new pieces from old fabric, and the craft as a form of human connection.

The first question is one of purity or objectivity: giving credibility to research results by imposing adequate rigor on methods and interpretation to offset the agenda of a financial supporter or to balance the researcher's own perspective or ambitions. The second question regards the ethics of research. The action researcher has no more license to harm than does the academic researcher. It is argued that the applied or action researcher must have higher standards of ethics as the research subjects will not be anonymous and their lives or careers could be  negatively affected. Next is the question of power--the aura around \"research\" that elevates the researcher over his or her subjects, as well as the power of the qualitative research process to distort the researcher's perspective and judgment. Finally, there are the double questions of applicability and accountability. The action researcher must face not only the prospect of sharing research findings but also of seeing those findings tested and applied. Seven questions are posed to researchers concerning how to put qualitative methods to work for rural education. A table compares 10 aspects of academic, pedagogical, and applied/action research.

Among the points made are that, yes, all children can learn, but that is no big deal. Schooling should contribute to their education, but schooling is far from being identical with education. Learning requires sharing, but in a society organized to restrict sharing quite stringently, the practices of schooling are likely to cultivate miseducation and, in fact, have been structured to do so. Whatever the case with social and economic structures, however, parents and communities enjoy a greater interest and stake in the education of their children than anyone else and will defend those interests ferociously. Educators can help them instead  of putting barriers in their way. All too often, the most challenged part of the population is given the fewest educational resources. Studies in seven states show that increased size of schools and districts decreased achievement in impoverished communities but increased achievement in affluent communities. Thus, school consolidation conveniently benefits the children of the most powerful groups. As a related point, society's emphasis on economics has led to a lack of adults and adult attention in children's lives. Lack of care and attention is also related to anti-intellectualism--an emphasis on \"what works\" faster and cheaper rather than on the slow cultivation of intellect. (Contains 23 references.) (SV)",

This collection of 10 papers examines rural Black, Hispanic, Native American, and Asian and Pacific Islander populations and their economic well-being in the 1980s, an economically difficult decade for rural areas. Results show minimal minority progress as measured by changes in occupation, income, and poverty rates. However, the type and speed of progress were quite different among minority groups and between men and women of the same minority group. Results show considerable diversity among groups in the characteristics associated with poor economic outcomes.

The Monongalia County (West Virginia) Even Start Program was unusual in that it took place in a rural area and used home visits as the primary service delivery mechanism. An independent, third-party evaluation of the Monongalia County program collected data from program records, interviews, observations, and seven participant outcome measures over a 2-year period. An innovation configuration matrix (ICM) was constructed and used to describe and evaluate eight program components: identification and recruitment, home visits, early  childhood education, parenting education, adult education and literacy, collaboration, evaluation, and staff development. Findings indicate that the ICM is an accurate and useful portrayal of the program, and that the program had a large impact on adults' reading and mathematics literacy and parenting outcomes; tremendous impact on children's school readiness; and some impact on children's auditory comprehension, expressive communication, and total language development. Recommendations are offered concerning program continuation, program improvements, evaluation utilization, and new evaluations. (Contains nine references, seven data tables, and the ICM.) (SV)",

To support this aim, a major ARSI goal involves development of partnerships among families, communities, and schools. This manual was designed to help school and community facilitators build community involvement in the education process. Sections 1 and 2 describe ARSI and discuss community engagement as a form of stewardship and as a positive influence on student achievement. Section 3 outlines the ARSI community engagement process, developed with input from agencies and practitioners working in rural Appalachia. The process entails 12 steps:  establish a team, define the community being served, select school and community co-facilitators, develop a descriptive profile and submit it to appropriate district and ARSI personnel, complete a community engagement self-assessment, understand the school's vision for improved mathematics and science learning, develop a community engagement action plan, implement the plan, monitor progress, report and use collected data, celebrate success, and renew commitments and action plans. Sections 4 and 5 describe critical elements in high-quality science and math programs and professional development experiences and discuss what quality math and science education means for students in Appalachia. Section 6 contains 9 references and 44 additional resources. Appendices present overviews of national  science and mathematics standards. (Contains sample work sheets.) (SV)",

By virtue of their academic/political interests if not their personal differences, they acknowledged that their scholarship as graduate students was necessarily located outside the mainstream discourse of the science education community. The authors are committed to focus their efforts on new areas of educational research. They recount pressures to assimilate into the organized system of higher education, but they all have found it necessary to resist and maintain their individualism. The authors argue that it is the uniqueness of their  peripheral status that provides the crucial impetus for the original contributions that they plan to make to science education.

Results show that the cooperative groups discussed the theme in the problems, but they took longer to get the problems done due to checking and double checking and then checking with the teacher.

        "description":"This report describes a program for increasing class achievement by raising the motivational level of adolescents. The targeted population consisted of high school mathematics students from a metropolitan area located in central Illinois. The problem of low motivation level found in the targeted students was documented by student surveys. Evidence of this problem was also reflected in a high dropout rate as noted in the school's report card. The analysis of probable causes revealed that the students' lack of motivation was possibly caused by poor past performances, boredom, and a missing sense of ownership and responsibility. The attitudes of both students and parents continued to contribute to this problem. The presentation of inappropriate levels of task difficulty and a  non-stimulating classroom environment has also fostered low motivation. Possible solution strategies involved a threefold approach. The first intervention targeted the students in an attempt to raise their level of intrinsic motivation and to increase their sense of ownership and responsibility. This treatment plan included student journals and surveys. The second intervention targeted the interest level of the students in the classroom. Collaborative groups and the use of multiple intelligence activities increased the motivational atmosphere. The third intervention targeted the classroom presentation by incorporating strategies such as writing through mathematics and solving real-life applications. The teachers' personal reflective journals indicated that progress was made in this area.  Post intervention data indicated that cooperative learning and Multiple Intelligences (MI) activities did enhance the students' motivation for learning mathematics. Teacher and student journal reflections added a metacognitive element to this intervention. Appendices include the student survey and classroom materials. (Contains 73 references.) (Author/WRM)",

The hands-on approach used successfully in the program is described, and evidence of student improvement is also presented. The targeted population consisted of students in the first, third, and fourth grades in a single unit district in two rural, middle class communities, located in central Illinois. The problems addressed were evidenced by teacher observation, test scores, anecdotal records, and student surveys. Analysis of probable causes through research literature revealed a lack of teacher training in experiential science, current testing tools not coordinating with teaching methods, and teachers not being given necessary time to plan  and prepare appropriate science activities. In addition, teachers, administrators, and community were unwilling to change from content-oriented teaching to hands-on methods, as well as content-oriented textbooks and curriculum not offering hands-on activities to substantiate experiential learning. Also, constraints on supplies and money hindered implementation of hands-on science. Furthermore, technology required to implement hands-on science activities was still in its infancy. Test scores, teacher observations, and anecdotal records indicated a lack of scientific knowledge and procedures, and limited enthusiasm for the subject area. A review of solution strategies suggested by literature, combined with an analysis of the problem, resulted in the selection of the intervention: a program  implementing a hands-on science approach. Post intervention data indicated an increase in students' knowledge and the use of higher order thinking skills. Researchers also noted an improved attitude toward science.

        "description":"This report examines the problem of a lack of motivation in secondary mathematics students. A large percentage of our students view upper level math courses as only a means to an end. They lack self motivation and are driven by either parental concerns or the desire to score well on college entrance exams. They see very little transfer from the classroom environment to their own career goals. The targeted population consists of a single site in a rural suburban setting. The students will be those who are currently enrolled in Advanced Algebra, Trigonometry, and Calculus. Analysis of the probable cause literature supported this hypothesis that students: 1) do not learn much by just being in class, 2) meaningful activities are more transferable, 3) when everything is the same in a  daily structure boredom sets in, 4) secondary schools tend to offer strict methods of instruction rather than the use of exploration, 5) tend to achieve more when they are in control of their own learning, 6) active learning leads to less behavioral problems than passive learning, and 7) success is the most powerful of all motivators. After a review of the possible intervention strategies as presented by educational researchers, the goal was to measure the motivational levels of various levels of classes before, during, and after being exposed to cooperative learning. By tailoring cooperative learning lessons to real life situations, a direct correlation between motivation and active involvement of the learner could be detected. Post intervention data verified the hypothesis that students  tend to learn better and enjoy their educational experiences while being exposed to cooperative learning projects as opposed to a strict diet of lecturing. Mathematics on the secondary level still requires some degree of traditional delivery, so that students properly receive the concept in a desired manner. The mastering of the technique is often best obtained in group settings where students can experiment with different methods of procedure. (Contains 18 references.) (Author)",

        "description":"This report describes a program for improving attitudes towards mathematics and problem solving in order to improve performance in these areas. The targeted population consists of two high school geometry classes. The school is located in a western suburb of a major mid-western city. The problems of negative attitudes towards mathematics and problem solving and poor performance were documented using both student surveys and homework application problems. An analysis of probable cause indicates that both societal beliefs and parental attitudes adversely affect the students' attitudes about mathematics and problem solving. In addition, many of the traditional math programs including textbooks and curriculums are outdated and do not represent the current standards in the field of  mathematics. Prior learning experiences of both the student and the teacher including pre-service training and professional development can affect the attitudes of the students. A review of solution strategies suggested by knowledgeable others and an analysis of the problem setting resulted in the development of a three-pronged intervention utilizing an increase in realistic application problems, an increase in writing both reflective and content journals, and the use of cooperative groups. The benefits of these aspects of the intervention are to increase student interest and motivation as well as encourage students to solve problems not by memorization and regurgitation but by understanding the concepts and how to apply them. Post intervention data indicated an improvement in both  student attitudes and student level of performance in mathematics. Teacher anecdotal records and post intervention student surveys support the change in student attitudes. The increased level of performance was documented through application problems and content journals. The program described in this report was successful in achieving both of its desired outcomes.

The targeted population consisted of mixed-ability split second and third grade self-contained cross categorical, regular education third, and regular education fifth grade math classes in a suburban area located in the Midwest. The problem of frustration, inattentiveness and lack of motivation were documented by inattentive behavior checklists, student surveys, and reflective journals. Analysis of probable cause data at the site and in the literature indicated that students were frustrated, bored, and inattentive because their needs were not being met through the current educational system in which students of all ability levels were being taught in the same classroom. A review of solution strategies suggested  by knowledgeable others resulted in the development of a program that consisted of whole group instruction, compacting, and small group work. The goal of this program was to enhance motivation and enthusiasm during math. Whole group instruction introduced or reacquainted students with math concepts and vocabulary. Compacting helped meet the needs of every student. Small group work provided students the opportunity to work in heterogeneous groups. Implementation of the solution strategies increased motivation for math while decreasing inattentive behaviors. The use of curriculum compacting helped differentiate instruction. Through whole group instruction and cooperative learning, students were given a feeling of belonging. These solution strategies contributed to improving students'  enthusiasm for math.

The targeted population consisted of high school students in a rural community in a midwestern plains state. The problem of the ability to understand the abstract algebraic process of simplifying square roots was documented through teacher-made tests, teacher observation, and poor/inadequate homework. Analysis of probable cause data revealed that early teens may not have the cognitive ability to simplify square roots using an algebraic method based upon the mathematical/logical intelligence. The understanding of abstract concepts appears to be related to the way in which students perceive their own thought processes. A review of solution strategies suggested by knowledgeable others,  combined with an analysis of the problem setting, resulted in selecting an intervention consisting of a visual approach to simplifying square roots. The students were encouraged to use their choice of the algebraic or the visual method. Post intervention data indicated an increase in the targeted students' ability to simplify square roots through the use of the visual method presented in this report. Additional analysis of the data indicated a preference among the students for the visual method as compared to the algebraic method. (Contains 20 references.) (Author)",

Middle school algebra classes were especially informative because of the significant impact of the students' cognitive development transitions from concrete to formal operations. The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (1989) informed much of the instructional practices in those classes observed. In contrast to much of the literature (i.e., Dickey, 1997), these teachers were effectively implementing developmentally appropriate and challenging algebra instruction. However, teachers acknowledged some challenges in meeting some of the NCTM standards such as use of real-life examples.

Students in both kinds of courses realize the need for technology use in doing and interacting with mathematics. The value of knowing how to do mathematics with and without technology is fundamental to a fuller understanding of mathematical concepts. For schools that have limited budgets, small mathematics departments, or both, spreadsheets are favorable technological tools. Spreadsheets can be used for  many of the mathematical concepts taught in business mathematics and general physics courses.

The problem addressed was that many chemistry students, perform well in group learning situations, such as labs, but perform poorly on content-mastery tests. As a result of reviewing the literature, the writer found that a variety of methods and a student-centered approach made instruction more effective. The solution strategies selected were: (a) improving instruction by adjusting traditional teaching methods, (b) increasing motivation by using technology and cooperative learning, and (c) enhancing writing skills by means of SQ3R (Survey, Question, Read, Recite and Review), graphic organizers, and text analysis. The results of the  practicum indicated that the selected solution strategies fostered content-mastery among the subject students. There was an increase in the number of correct multiple choice items on content-mastery tests and an increase in volunteered answers. Student' essay writing scores improved as well. (Author/WRM)",

The first area of interest poses the question of whether Berry mathematics education graduates remain in the teaching profession longer than the averages indicated by other studies. A second arena in which the alumni were able to share information was in disclosing what they would feel to be useful advice to first-year teachers. Also, alumni input was an important  part of the on-going process of developing college programs that are in touch with the reality of today's classrooms. Respondents mention some of the factors that cause teachers to leave or think of leaving the profession which include lack of administration support and financial considerations.

The paper reviews the literature concerning constructivism, which is the belief that people come to know the world through mental activity that organizes and transforms their perceptions. Constructivism is the notion that people build their own knowledge and their own representations of knowledge from their own experience. These perspectives are grounded in the cognitive and developmental perspectives of Piaget, the interactual and cultural emphases of Vygotsky, as well as the educational philosophy of John Dewey. The essay argues that teachers must allow students to learn for themselves that which the teacher already knows. Through a survey of teachers, the  researcher found that most teachers view constructivist learning as the best method for teaching science. Most of these teachers believe that they are prevented from using this learning style by a combination of mandated district curriculums, inadequate or lack of equipment, and lack of experience and scheduled time.

The manipulatives consisted of objects such as unifix cubes, personal chalkboards, work mats, and various other articles, which allowed the students to see the math that they were calculating. These students did not use any of the standard workbook pages. The standard curriculum used was the Mathematics Plus workbook by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. This book does use manipulative concepts, but it was not supplemented with anything extra. Both methods of instruction were used with one first grade class. The methods were both used simultaneously but with different concepts; for example, the students were taught one  concept using manipulatives and the second concept using the math workbook. Two methods of assessment were used during the study. The Knox County Math Skills Test was the first test given, and the second test was a Teacher Checklist Manipulative Evaluation that one of the teachers performed orally with each student. The Knox County test was a pencil and paper test that did not use any hands-on manipulatives. The Teacher Checklist was a test that was developed using solely the manipulatives that the students used during their manipulative concept. The students were asked to &quot;show the teacher&quot; each skill using the manipulatives. The concepts tested by the Teacher Checklist followed those tested by the Knox County Skills Test, but the student demonstrated them physically with the  manipulatives used for learning.

Relatively little is known about their status and effectiveness educationally and in terms of their conservation value. This paper reports the findings of a survey involving 46 schools in 10 different Local Education Authorities (LEAs). The findings show that factors constraining schools from developing ponds, the ways in which they have come about and are managed and used, vary markedly between primary and secondary schools. The design, maintenance and amenity value of school ponds result in a number of compromises. These may be problematic in terms of conservation value but have to be resolved in an educational setting.

They then move to advocating dialogue about the shared truths of science and religion.

Owing to the university's commitment of service to the public schools in the state, the researchers accepted the challenge to assist in improving the school's science education program by working with the principal to solicit help from private corporations, and to collect baseline  data through involving the school's stakeholders (teachers, students, and parents) in the process.

The purpose of this paper is to compare and contrast the classroom social norms and student learning opportunities of two U.S. second grade classes that are attempting to implement student-centered instructional methods in mathematics. The principal concern in implementing reform ideas is the extent to which changes in teaching practice translate into changes in the learning opportunities that students will encounter in their mathematics classes. The teacher in a reform classroom in the U.S. is envisioned as a facilitator of students' individual and collective problem solving  based on their own sense making about mathematics. Reform involved reconceptualizing the relationship between the social processes of the class and the psychological states of the students. (Contains 19 references.) (ASK)",

There are many barriers for teachers in the integration of this technology which include time to learn how to use the technology, adequate hands-on staff development opportunities, support for release time and funding for professional development, adequate teacher empowerment for technology planning, and adequate recognition for teachers who engage in the extra effort to integrate instructional technology. The STAIRS model presents a plan of action to overcome these barriers. The model adopts an integrated approach to the successful sustained implementation of technology as teachers' strategies shift to an increased  emphasis on student-centered learning in a multi-sensory environment. The STAIRS model paves the way for this increased emphasis by developing a technologically-rich environment for students as they learn in an authentic, real-world context. (Contains 25 references.)

The first study was designed to explore students' skills in estimation and was implemented at three grade levels. It concludes that although there has  been significant improvement in mathematics performance overall since 1990 at all grade levels, the trend for student performance in estimation over the six years since the inception of the Estimation Study of 1990 is less clear. The second study was designed to assess problem-solving abilities within contexts that allow students to make connections across mathematics content areas. The Advanced study was administered at grades 8 and 12 and was designed to provide students who were taking or had taken advanced courses in mathematics an opportunity to demonstrate their full mathematical proficiency.

During the learning process, he must be aware of the way in which he learns, what he learns, and why he learns. For educators, their way of thinking has to be reversed.

The intention of this movement is to structure adult education in a way that it fits everyone. That means: more flexible programs, more individual education, more teacher independent learning, and more grading by certificates at different levels. People must be able to study in their own way, time and pace. The basic idea of the new system is Independent Learning. Some starting points of Constructivism can be a base for independent learning. In that way, practitioners may wonder how Constructivism and Realistic Mathematics Education (RME) can be a gateway to independent learning in adult education. If practitioners are able to develop a  numeracy program for Adult (Basic) Education, based on the learning principles of Constructivism and RME, then the students can be trained in learning to work more independently at the same time.

Hek (1994), it is apparent that mathematics is not universally included in the nursing curricula, nor asked for as a pre-requisite to entry. Changes in the profile of the typical student nurse from a school leaver with 5 'O' levels to a more mature woman with often fewer school qualifications have been one of the triggers for this study into student nurses and mathematics. In this paper, students' feelings about mathematics are explored and related to age, time elapsed since leaving school, and performance on a test of nursing mathematics. Provision for revision and mathematics support is described and the  results of a post-test are analyzed. The results indicate that pre-registration nursing courses should include an element of mathematics to alert students to their own shortcomings and provide a means to improve their computational skills before working in the clinical areas.

The author has been thinking and writing about Freire's work for many years, exploring his contribution to a radical politics of adult education. While Freire's work features strongly in debates about education and adult education generally, and about adult literacy in particular, his significance for adult numeracy/mathematics educators has been less discussed. In this paper, the author tries to redress the balance by considering the legacy of Paulo Freire's work for adults learning mathematics--and for teachers of adults learning mathematics, through a brief look at two very different developments in adults'  mathematics education, both taking Freire as a starting point: Marilyn Frankenstein's work with adults learning mathematics in the USA and the REFLECT program of development education.

The role of schools in producing a particular type of character capable of sustaining the democratic regime has long been recognized and democratic principles have long guided civic education policy. This paper elaborates the arguments and meanings expressed through the literature on multiculturalism and argues that multiculturalism advocates a specific conception of an ideal national public culture. Two specific claims about multiculturalism are advanced. First, multiculturalism is a unique contemporary expression of a historical idea known as cultural pluralism. Second, the literature in multiculturalism contains both a unified vision of U.S.  political culture and a variety of diverse theories concerning the specific political and philosophical principles to be used in constructing an ideal national political culture. The questions presented for citizenship training that derive from the debate about multiculturalism involve how a national public culture can be constructed from the diverse cultures in U.S. society and whether the U.S. \"paideia\" envisioned by multiculturalism is a desirable model for civic education.

The paper begins with Peabody's life and commercial career; describes his transition from that of a U.S. merchant to London-based merchant banker; tells how he made his fortune; describes how and why he gave most of his fortune to found libraries, museums, and foundations; and explores why historians have called him the founder of modern American educational philanthropy. Peabody's association with Motley offers insights into Peabody's unusual funeral and helps explain why the people and press of two  nations gave it so much solemnity and grandeur. The paper concludes with an assessment of George Peabody as a merchant turned international banker and educational philanthropist whose promotion of U.S.-British friendship has largely escaped historians' attention.

        "description":"The teaching of law and education for a law abiding behavior have without doubt been neglected in the German educational system. If schools have the task to teach students that they should become involved in a democratic society, that it is worth the effort to get involved in a democracy, then schools must teach their students the concepts and values that are fundamental to a democratic constitutional state. Of course, democracy and the rule of law are subjects that are talked about in class, but very often teachers only mention the institutions and explain the functioning of the different powers without reference to experiences the students might have had or the world in which they live. To list the various elements of the rule of law and government by the people without any  link to the students' experience or to current political affairs is not very useful from an educational point of view. The common way to improve the situation in schools is to collect information and texts and make them available through government agencies. Perhaps new information and communication technologies like the Internet offer better opportunities. More and more teachers use the Internet for the preparation of lessons or for investigations into problems. The German state of Northrhine-Westphalia's &quot;Learn-line&quot; is one education platform with an interesting and helpful structure which is a promising instrument for schools. A fictitious case (&quot;State governed by the rule of law&quot;) illustrates the instructional procedure. (Contains a diagram of Learn-line and a 3-item bibliography.)  (BT)",

The paper then discusses the Democracy Advancement Center (DAC), a leading civic organization (non-governmental), which maintains cooperation with the Ministry of Education. It focuses on materials the DAC has designed and developed for a new course in civic education at the eighth and ninth grades, discussing key ideas about the subject matter, teaching methods, and intended learners of the new civic education program.

        "description":"Any discussion about present-day involvement in political and civic life in Romania raises challenging questions, for example, the kind of democracy they have and how power relates to public life involvement needs to be examined. Another question is how an all-out education reform can help build a mentality of positive involvement. A 2-year opinion survey for students and professors early on elicited answers about human rights education which persistently ignored the ideas of influencing public decision-making and involvement in community life. Two years later the attitude of participants had changed appreciably, and reference to involvement and civic participation was expressed more often. An interactive teaching approach assisted and promoted by purposefully designed materials  and teacher training classes may have brought about the change. The project showed what the prevailing political mentality of the ordinary Romanian citizen was like in 1994-96 and the &quot;wonders&quot; that a specific educational approach can work in a rather short time. For a society in transition from totalitarianism to a democratic political system set on the tenets and mechanisms of modern liberal democracy, the rule of law and free market economics, the human rights issue, and liberal democratic values are a multi-faceted challenge. In Romania's schools and universities an apparent tension exists between what is referred to as civic identity, ethnic identity, and human rights universality. As of the 1998-99 school year a new curriculum framework has taken effect which should help bring  respect for the dignity of students and teachers (and parents) and a school-designed and developed social practice that is efficient in a democratic sense.

        "description":"McDougal, Littell and Company has designed the geography program called &quot;Daily Geography&quot; which incorporates geography into the daily social studies curriculum. &quot;Daily Geography&quot; aims to increase students' knowledge and understanding of the physical aspects of geography. A study tested the &quot;Daily Geography&quot; program to determine if it helps students improve their geography test scores. Subjects were 24 fourth-grade students from a school in eastern Tennessee. Along with the test, each student completed an attitude survey about geography. The class served as both the control group and the experimental group. The study took 10 weeks. During the first 5 weeks the class served as the control group, using only their regular social studies program. During the second 5 weeks the class  served as the experimental group. At the beginning of week 6, students were given a geography pretest and an attitude survey. Then, &quot;Daily Geography&quot; was used in the classroom, and students were given two geography questions per day and allowed to use any resource. Later the class discussed the answers to each question. During this time, the regular social studies program was used. At the end of the tenth week, students were given a geography posttest and an attitude survey that assessed final knowledge in geography. In the end, no statistical difference with and without the use of &quot;Daily Geography&quot; was found, and attitudes did not change. The use of &quot;Daily Geography&quot; did not increase the students' knowledge and understanding of physical and political concepts in geography over those who  do not use this program.

        "description":"This paper is a critical analysis of the role of the Tanzanian education system in enhancing young children's awareness of economic aspects around them. The major factors the paper considers are: the poverty of the country; the prominence of the education system as a socializing agent for children; the aim of early education in Tanzania; and young children's experiences of economic nature within their environments. Analysis reveals that young children in Tanzania encounter various aspects of economic nature at home, at school, and in their communities on a daily basis. Findings suggest that since the education system is the major vehicle for children's socialization outside the home and since formal learning takes place mostly in school, economic awareness can be enhanced within  the school system. The paper proposes some strategies for enhancing young children's awareness of the economic world around them. The strategies are: developing a culture for trade, reexamining gender roles, examining economic barriers facing children, and incorporating some aspects of foreign trade in children's daily activities.

The impact of gender role stereotyping and gender bias on teaching and counseling methodologies, educational and career choices, violence in schools, communication, and other aspects of education has not been taken routinely into consideration in developing policies, procedures, training, and technical assistance for schools. Equity concerns, however, need to be built into all educational thinking and planning to ensure educational excellence for all students. This report summarizes the problems and issues relevant to gender equity in education that the Gender Equity in Education Project Team, formed in February 1997, identified and the strategies developed to address them.  Organized into four sections, the report provides an overview of the team's consensus regarding its purpose and lists the team members. The report then identifies problems and issues related to gender equity and presents an overview of the conceptual approach and model for examining and addressing these problems. Next, it provides specific strategy recommendations, and finally, offers general recommendations that will, it is hoped, direct efforts towards gender equity beyond the term of this team.

        "description":"This third evaluation progress report concerns a 5-year project that links technology and the visual and performing arts with other subject areas to transform the education of K-12 students in Nebraska and nationwide. The report states that the &quot;Community Discovered&quot; project is continuing to make substantial and consistent progress in its training, classroom integration, and evaluation activities. It explains that the project focuses on enhancing education by developing interdisciplinary constructivist curriculum units that deliver the arts and art resources to the classrooms of Nebraska and the world via the use of the Internet, describing the project as a multi-element education program that brings the arts and art museums into classrooms electronically; develops computer  integration strategies; trains and supports teachers; builds curriculum, instruction, and assessment strategies; and seeks to build a nationwide community for the arts and technology integration. The report states that the evaluation process for the project continues to expand and evolve, with evaluation-related data being collected and systematically reviewed for formative input into specific project objectives and related project activities, and with a design focused on analyzing data related to each of the five goals and related project objectives. It also states that the evaluation determines the general progress and impact of the project on K-12 education in participating schools and includes a systematic review of the learning environments for both students and teachers. The report  also seeks to document the project as a potential model for replication by other educational institutions and organizations. Contains extensive appendixes. (BT)",

The report states that the project builds upon and extends the impact of the initial pilot project, the Art and Technology Integration Project, which was conducted by Westside Community Schools and Grand Island Public Schools in Nebraska. It also states that the &quot;Community Discovered&quot; project is continuing to make substantial and consistent progress in its training, classroom integration, and evaluation activities. According to the report, teachers in the project received training  in creating integrated curriculum, various technology/Internet skills, constructivism, and how to utilize the arts in an interdisciplinary unit. The report explains that the evaluation process continues to use multiple sources of information and includes a comprehensive approach to data collection that is targeting information related to each project goal and objective. These data sources include teacher survey data; electronic data; classroom observations and videotapes; teacher and student interviews; student projects and portfolios; teacher growth plans; focus groups; standardized and teacher-created test data; attendance records; trends in disciplinary actions; stakeholder surveys; and teacher classroom research initiatives.

In this collection of papers the definition of literacy is expanded as it can be applied to individual art forms of dance, drama, media, music, visual art, and design. These art forms are those specified as the subjects forming the Arts Key Learning Area in Australian schools. The writers have approached the topics of arts literacy from their own experiences as artists and educators. The purposes of the papers are to stimulate discussion among teachers of the arts and other subjects and to raise an awareness of the potential for the arts to enhance learning across the curriculum.

The study provides a deeper understanding about what is gained and what is lost when a decentralized curriculum is designed at the national level and implemented in local settings. Some insight is provided into how well the new curriculum is serving the needs of the different ethnic groups in a country with ethnically, culturally, and economically diverse populations. Data collection involved document analysis, site visits, and interviews with officials from the State Department of Education along with teachers and school administrators in four secondary schools in southeast Mexico. Findings suggest that the emphasis on homogeneously  implementing national standards without consideration of local context have created a situation where the tension between national standards and local needs could affect the quality of students' education. The educational possibilities for children of indigenous ancestry are particularly at risk. National versus local is a significant topic both in Mexico and the United States, as is the issue of diverse ethnic groups and the extent to which students will be well served by national curriculum standards.

The researcher conducted two teacher interviews and was a participant observer during the first month of the school year. Data analysis involved examining the teacher's vision of the classroom learning community; class activities designed to help enhance students' awareness of their class as a learning community; the class' work on developing a shared literacy practice (a book club); and power relationships between the teacher and students. Results indicated that the teacher had a clear goal of establishing a learning community. She told the students explicitly and  repeatedly that they were a learning community. In developing a shared literacy practice, she created opportunities for students to learn to participate. She encouraged students to think for themselves. When students used passive resistance when faced with challenges in doing the Book Club, the teacher persisted because she believed it would be a better way to engage students in reading, writing, talking, and thinking and would create opportunities for them to interact with each other that might help develop the learning community. She considered discipline to be the foundation for a learning community. (Contains 14 references.) (SM)",

This Digest describes the various socialization factors that influence a child's interest and involvement in physical activity. While role modeling exerts some effect, recent research suggests that the nature of parental influence may be much more complex. A useful theoretical model to explain parental influence on physical activity is the expectancy-value model of Eccles and Harold (1991). The model explains parent socialization behaviors related to sport and physical activity. There are various ways that parents can socialize their children to be physically active, including using parental encouragement, parental involvement, parental facilitation, and parental role modeling. Declining levels of physical activity exert a major  influence on the increasing levels of childhood obesity. It is important for children to begin developing healthy activity patterns early in life. Because activity patterns have been found to track over the lifespan, efforts to promote physical activity at a young age can have major long-term public health benefits. (Contains 16 references.)

Preservice teachers were placed in matched pairs according to teaching experience, then assigned to either a treatment group or a control group. The treatment group read a stimulus paragraph designed to bolster beliefs about efficacy, rated their agreement with it, wrote their opinion about why preservice teachers are considered effective, and completed the Teacher Efficacy Scale. The control group followed the  same protocol but read an unrelated paragraph. Results suggest that the stimulus paragraph had minimal effect on teacher efficacy, and that the minimal effect was primarily due to changes in general teaching efficacy.

Participants were randomly selected public school teachers enrolled in graduate education courses at three Kentucky state universities. They performed three tasks. First, they completed a biographical form that yielded descriptive statistics and measures of seven teacher personal characteristics. Next, they read one of four content-validated versions of a formal job description for a teacher vacancy on the local school council. Each version emphasized one of two validated sets of school council job attributes (management or instructional leadership). Each of the four versions specified whether the principal was the council chair or a council member with a teacher serving  as the chair. Finally, participants completed a two-item instrument that captured the degree of teacher attraction to the school council job depicted in the job description. Results indicated that teachers with greater numbers of dependent children and prior school council experience rated school council positions less favorably than did teachers with fewer dependent children and no experience on school councils. Results also revealed that the combined effects of dependent children and school council experience explained the 6.8 percent variance in teacher rating of a school council position.

Data are based on questionnaire reports of teachers from the Public School Teacher Questionnaires of the Schools and Staffing Surveys (SASS) and the associated Teacher Followup Surveys (a 1-year longitudinal component of the SASS). School attrition is subdivided into four components: teachers who voluntarily moved to different schools; teachers who moved to different schools through involuntary assignment; teachers who voluntarily left teaching altogether; and teachers who left teaching involuntarily through personnel action, or who retired. Summary results  are presented in two sections. A section on trends in school attrition focuses on school transfer, exit attrition, reasons for school transfer, and reasons for exit attrition. A section on predictors of school attrition focuses on: situational variables predictive of school attrition; teacher characteristics predictive of school attrition; working condition variables predictive of school attrition; teacher judgment variables predictive of school attrition; followup year variables associated with school attrition; reduced logistic regression models of voluntary moving, voluntary leaving, involuntary moving, and involuntary leaving; reduced logistic regression models using teacher career judgements; reduced regression models using administrative support; and full logistic regression models  contrasting attrition components.

New teacher preparation and inservice teacher professional development is key to educational improvement. This Digest examines teacher education goals, candidate selection, content of teacher education programs, and student teaching or clinical preparation in selected countries. Many countries identify quality teachers as the goal of their teacher education programs. The social mission of teacher education is quite broad across countries. Countries vary in how they create standards for teacher education. Qualifications for entering teacher education programs vary considerably. Most countries have multiple entry points into teaching. Traditionally, teachers have  been prepared in normal schools; however, many normal schools have evolved into multipurpose, 4-year colleges. Trends show teacher training being embedded in undergraduate degree programs, the requiring of undergraduate degrees for all teachers, and extending preparation requirements into graduate-level programs. Though there exists some variation in teacher education programs' curriculum content, most offer some combination of coursework in subject matter, teaching methods and materials, child growth and development, and other education courses. Student teaching or strong clinical practice is seen as essential in teacher preparation. The duration of such an experience varies widely and is influenced by teaching level and the nature of the teacher education program. (SM)",

        "description":"New U.S. teachers are challenged to educate diverse learners in an increasingly complex knowledge-based, technology-oriented society. Often, new teachers receive little support from colleagues or professional development. Many low-wealth urban districts with acute shortages are turning toward beginning teacher induction programs to keep new teachers from leaving. Research documents the value of teacher induction programs and describes multiple prototypes for implementation. Benefits include reduced attrition rates among new teachers and improved teaching capabilities. The number of state and local districts that have created programs for beginning teachers has grown substantially since the early 1980s, though programs and funding levels vary strikingly among states. Program  structure and the underlying conceptualization of teaching differ among districts. Induction programs increasingly provide assistance to new teachers by assigning them to mentors. Successful mentor programs depend upon the quality of training afforded the mentors. There is limited agreement about what new teachers should know and be able to do. A consensus is growing about beginning teachers needing to meet standards for practice that will attest to their grasp of essential skills, knowledge, and dispositions. Many school systems work with colleges to create learner-centered environments such as Professional Development Schools. This model of teacher induction has the potential to influence both members of the mentoring relationship. (Contains 20 references.) (SM)",

Researchers surveyed 128 beginning teachers and their mentors who were participants in the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater's Beginning Teacher Assistance Program, a university-based program that offers support to small- and medium-sized local school districts. Beginning teachers were asked to predict how often they would turn to their mentors for advice or help in 18 areas. Mentors were asked to predict how often their proteges would seek advice or help in the same 18 areas. Data analysis indicated that beginning teachers and their mentors generally overestimated how often they would come together to seek or give advice or help regarding the 18 areas represented in the survey. Help with policies and procedures and  general support and encouragement remained prominent areas over the course of a year's program. The focus of mentoring tended to default to the areas of information about policy and procedures and support and encouragement. (SM)",

The first project, Project Lighthouse, was designed to facilitate the inclusion of students with disabilities into general education classrooms. In this project, faculty and staff determined what kind of professional development they needed and in what format, and then school-based teams planned specific activities to address their identified needs. The second project was a science project designed to equip teachers with the knowledge and skills to help their students succeed in the sciences. The project included a summer institute, Saturday sessions during the school year, and a site visit from the project facilitator.  Based on experiences with the two projects, researchers created a professional development model that facilitates the growth of teachers toward sustained skill mastery using a focused, programmed approach which provides support to the teacher at each of six stages (basic information, observation, guided practice, skill enhancement, initial mastery, and sustained mastery levels).

The university changed its 50-minute Monday/Wednesday/Friday classes to 75-minute Monday/Friday and Tuesday/Thursday classes, with Wednesdays off for field experiences. This paper explains the process of developing the new schedule, which involved: informal discussion within the department; preliminary discussion with the dean, provost, and other deans; department approval; securing the support of academic departments; schedule building with individual departments; and advising and enrolling students. The transition to the 4-day schedule was very smooth. Advantages included having an easier time getting students into the field  on Wednesdays and providing supervising faculty with a day for field visits. Disadvantages included lack of participation by the secondary program. Students and faculty have reacted favorably to the new schedule. Though extensive planning and good communication were necessary to ensure successful implementation, the resulting advantages were worth the effort. (SM)",

Surveys examined their perceptions of the extent to which they conducted action research, problems encountered, benefits obtained, utilization of results, conditions required to conduct action research, ideal uses of action research results, and perceptions of traditional and new approaches to action research encouraged by Korea's Department of Education. Results indicated that 77.3 percent of teachers had no experience with action research. Teachers with research experience had over 5 years of teaching experience. Many teachers did research to get pay raises or promotions, but many others did so for intrinsic reasons. Most researchers conducted individual research. Problems  encountered included lack of research ability, lack of related materials, and lack of time. Benefits included attainment of self-confidence, development of new theories, and professional development. About half of the teachers implemented research results, and about half shared results with colleagues. More than half intended to do action research again. Most teachers believed that collaborative research was the ideal, though there was a wide gap between the actual and the ideal. Teachers perceived improvement of professional ability, spare time to do research, and school climate favoring research as conditions needed for action research. They believed that action research should be used to improve school practice. Teachers favored the Department of Education's new approach to action  research. (Contains 34 references.) (SM)",

After a review of the historical and current development of Chinese teacher education, the paper discusses issues related to teacher training for adult education. Results of a survey indicated that teacher training for adult education in China was very inadequate. The system needed a complete training program to train teachers at different levels, not just for subject knowledge, but also for teaching skills. This study also examined issues in teacher training for primary and secondary schools. Survey results indicated that this type of teacher training was also inadequate. Teachers in training receive too little practice teaching and too few current textbooks. Also, methodology was not considered an important  course. The political and social status of teachers in China was low, so people did not have much incentive to take up a teaching career. There was little reward for success in teaching, too.

The paper begins by discussing the role of narrative in learning history. The study involved a historiography course that was designed for students to study what Darwin wrote while on a particular voyage. Students selected a focused topic and wrote a historical narrative. They also wrote two essays on historical methodology. Researchers collected data from students' formal writing, field notes, interviews with the teacher, and discussions with students. Data analysis indicated that students did not necessarily learn to write in the narrative form because they had taken a number of history  courses. Few history courses, even at the upper levels, included direct, explicit instruction on how to craft convincing historical narratives. Students needed to be explicitly taught extended forms of historical writing in ways that made transparent each step in the process. Instructors had to contend with students' prior experiences with the subject matter. The eight appendixes present class assignment sheets. (Contains 71 references.) (SM)",

Researchers investigated what defined at-risk districts; how those districts differed from those not at risk; and what was known about the likely future demand and supply of minority teachers. Information came from a longitudinal data file on public school teachers in Texas from 1979-1996 obtained from the Texas Education Agency. Results indicate that three-quarters of all Texas full-time teachers are non-Hispanic White, whereas the student body is over half minority. Texas has done well in attracting minorities to teaching using many sources. Recently, minorities have accounted for 26 percent of new teacher cohorts. Alternative teacher certification programs are a rich source of minority teachers. Future  supply looks less promising, with decreasing numbers of teachers in the pipeline and the mandated teacher entry and certification tests proving a bigger hurdle for minority than white candidates. Results suggest that minority teachers display a greater sensitivity to pay and working conditions.

It elucidates the challenge of postmodernism and develops constructive proposals in response to its significance for teaching values. The operative contention is that a critical engagement with the challenge of postmodernism provides an opportunity for educators today to discuss values with their students. The first section of the paper presents three fundamental themes that are constitutive of the contemporary cultural climate of postmodernism: the rejection of the meta-narratives of history, the denial of objectivity, and the de-centering of the autonomous ego. The second section of the paper examines the practical considerations of postmodernism for teaching values: the  necessity of teaching values, the possibility of the development of a single value framework from which to make ethical decisions, the need to integrate value education into all subjects, and the effect of value education on the curriculum.

        "description":"This paper examines the relationship between preservice teachers' epistemological beliefs and their perceptions of their college preparatory work as being instrumental to their futures, arguing that preservice teachers often find little relevance in the theoretical, philosophical, and historical content presented in their preparatory classes. Nor do they find efforts to promote more critical, reflective, and complex thinking instrumental to future teaching. The perception that teacher education emphasizes abstract meanings rather than practical content may be noteworthy because of the tendency for practicing teachers to maintain their beliefs that undergraduate training was ineffective or irrelevant. One reason for decreased motivation among preservice teachers to participate  fully in required learning tasks may relate to a perceived structural incongruence between what they understand about the nature of teaching and the epistemological requirements associated with learning tasks. This incongruence may pose significant motivational problems during teacher training. It is hypothesized that when the content of preservice teachers' goals is at odds with the epistemological requirements of learning tasks, those tasks may be perceived as less instrumental to students. This may result in short-term efforts to manage learning tasks by ignoring task-associated complexities and redefining them in well-structured terms and/or engaging in various self-handicapping strategies designed to attribute perceived future failure to non-ability factors.

Forty-one inservice and preservice African-American teachers from an early childhood program in a Midwestern urban university participated in the study. The perceptions were gathered using a five-point Likert-type scale on 10 instructional planning skills for teaching science. Multivariate analysis of variance was employed to examine the differences of perceptions across 10 specified skills in the 2 groups of teachers. Descriptive statistics were used to identify the skills perceived as least knowledgeable  and most knowledgeable by the two groups. Results showed statistically significant differences between the two groups of teachers in their perceptions of the 10 skills of instructional planning for teaching science. Preservice teachers perceived that they had little knowledge in most of the skills. Inservice teachers perceived that they had considerable knowledge in the 10 skills. The findings of this study provide useful feedback to teacher education programs regarding the extent of knowledge and skills that preservice and inservice teachers will need to meet the demands of teaching science in primary grades.

The researcher conducted interviews with classroom English teachers and teacher educators in north Alabama to gain the participants' perceptions of their effectiveness in teaching diverse literacies, opportunities for practicing effective strategies and pedagogical skills, and opportunities for improving teaching and learning and professional development. Data analysis indicated that the teachers often felt unprepared to teach the multiple literacies required in the diverse classroom populations they served. Because of time constraints and test score demands for students, the  teachers felt that they were limited in teaching and modeling effective teaching strategies and multi-literacy pedagogical skills, especially connected to writing. Professional development and inservice opportunities were limited, as well. (Contains 15 references.) (SM)",

        "description":"By the year 2008, 2.2 million teachers will be needed to fill open teaching positions created by increasing student populations and the rapid rise of retiring teachers. The urgent need for qualified teachers looks to be overtaking the number of available qualified teachers. Despite the efforts of teacher training programs in nationally accredited universities, the gap between qualified practicing teachers and student populations continues to intensify. Many state legislatures are closely examining teacher training and licensing practices in order to upgrade performance expectations. In response, there has been a concerted effort to further provide for this projected need for qualified teachers by implementing alternative teacher certification programs for people who have  expertise in related content area. This paper argues that this line of thinking is wrong, suggesting that alternative certification will result in people who are trained in content area but who have no pedagogical experience. It recommends a program design that gives potential teachers the pedagogical skills to survive the rigors of today's classroom. The paper describes Mississippi's currently endorsed model for alternative certification, offering it as an example of why caution and reflection remain a professional necessity. It suggests that Mississippi's model must offer potential teachers experience via at least one semester of structured, supervised practice teaching. The paper lists six issues that a good alternative program must address. (SM)",

Researchers collected data on demographics, major and class rank (for preservice teachers), and education and professional experience (for teacher educators). Data analysis involved statistically comparing results on the Multicultural Knowledge Test to the average knowledge level score. Results indicated that there was a statistically significant difference between preservice teachers' and teacher educators'  multicultural knowledge levels. The knowledge levels of preservice teachers were significantly below average. The knowledge levels of teacher educators were almost average.

The studies examined underlying dimensions of school culture associated with context factors in elementary, middle, and high schools. Researchers used the Revised School Culture Elements Questionnaire (RSCEQ), which examined actual and preferred features of school culture. In the first study, over 3,000 teachers in 80 urban schools completed the RSCEQ. In the second study, over 1,300 teachers completed the RSCEQ. Researchers analyzed the data from the two studies differently. Results indicated that the RSCEQ is useful in measuring multiple dimensions of school culture. The results show that multiple dimensions of  school culture grounded in norms of professionalism can be identified and measured with reasonable reliability. The studies found somewhat dissimilar factor structures for the RSCEQ in the three different school levels and somewhat different operational definitions of these dimensions within school-level contexts. Two appendixes present RSCEQ items for study one and conceptual definitions and items operationalizing each RSCEQ dimension from factor analyses completed in study two. (Contains 32 references.)

School districts can join PREPS to receive such services as professional development sessions on instructional issues, crisis management, and program and faculty evaluation. PREPS' member districts joined forces with other Mississippi school districts to improve performance on state subject area tests, forming Teachers and Interns: Partners for Success. This paper discusses how the program was developed and describes program components, which include several professional  development sessions at which teachers receive curriculum materials. Sessions are designed so teachers experience the teaching strategies as students in a simulated classroom. Sessions emphasize the need to develop reading, writing, and higher order thinking skills. One session concentrates on assessment. Between July 1998 and April 1999, 10 subject area sessions were presented to 474 teachers from 70 PREPS member districts. Evaluation of the project by participating teachers indicated that teachers considered the sessions extremely effective. (SM)",

The instructors completed survey instruments to determine their theoretical frameworks. This included the Cognitive Interest Inventory, which provided a means of identifying beliefs for analysis using the theory of knowledge-constitutive interests, and the Educational Philosophy Inventory, which measured their beliefs about essentialism, behaviorism, progressivism, existentialism, perennialism, and reconstructionism. The researcher interviewed the instructors and their students, observed their classes, and reviewed the college catalog. Both instructors  revealed a good match between espoused theories and their teaching practices. The two instructors were primarily technical in both their theories and practices relative to their current jobs. The most striking difference found was that one instructor seemed more student-centered, and the other instructor seemed more subject-centered.

Fifteen graduate students enrolled in a seminar in early childhood education participated. Self-questioning strategy training was conducted to help students raise specific higher-order questions from assigned reading materials. The reciprocal peer-questioning condition was created to promote social construction of knowledge, providing a context which fostered the emergence  and resolution of socio-cognitive conflict. After each seminar session, students recorded their thoughts regarding topics discussed, issues raised, and questions unanswered. Weekly journals were collected by the instructor for analysis. NUD*IST (Non-Numerical Unstructured Data Indexing, Search and Theory Building) software was used for initial theory building and analysis. Students' weekly journal entries indicated the conceptual transformations that they went through. This study illustrated how a seminar structure was useful in helping preservice teachers' evolving constructions of knowledge, in promoting reflection, and in enhancing conceptual change.

The study occurred in a small parochial high school with a college preparatory focus. The teacher under observation was a 14-year veteran of the school. The study examined educational practices through world views, called cognitive interests. Data collection involved: an interview with the teacher regarding her educational background, teaching experience, beliefs about teaching and learning, and metaphors to describe her work; observation of her classes; examination of documents (e.g., course syllabus, assignment sheets, and progress reports); and data from the Butler's Cognitive Interest Inventory. Data analysis indicated a significant difference between the  teacher's espoused theory and her practice. She professed a practical interest, believing that her main role was as facilitator, but she used terms that indicated a preference for showing and directing rather than facilitating. Her teaching of composition was the greatest indicator of the gap between espoused theory and practice, with students discouraged from deviating from the model she provided. Students showed frustration during the composition class. The school and parents provided the teacher with much positive reinforcement for her technical approach in the classroom.

All participants responded to the questionnaire before beginning student teaching. Questionnaires were individually analyzed by two researchers to identify patterns or similarities. Findings from a collaborative analysis of researchers' notes served as the basis for developing three semi-structured interview questions. Interviews were  conducted with 20 respondents who indicated interest in further participation in the study. The results support the conclusion that most preservice teachers can clearly define guidance in positive terms of modeling and leading. However, conspicuously absent from their definition is any reference to the task of the classroom teacher to foster the development of self-control and socialization skills and to create the context for positive discipline. Students readied by the university to practice their profession rely more heavily on information they glean through personal experience than through instruction received in the teacher education program.

Students enrolled in 300-level methodology classes recorded strengths and weaknesses in their micro-teaching experience within a demonstration classroom and within classrooms in the school settings to improve teaching techniques. These strengths and weaknesses were then put into objective statements. Students statistically measured degrees to which these strengths and weaknesses were believed to exist and compared the data. Results indicated perceived strengths and weaknesses which, when measured, revealed emphases not readily apparent. The factors present in  both settings were similar, but they differed significantly regarding emphases. Twelve statements were measured using a Likert-type scale. The fact that an evaluator/assessor does not need to be present in demonstration classrooms as opposed to teaching in schools ranked first in priority. The second ranked factor was that in demonstration classrooms, it is possible to observe students whom one will be teaching prior to the lesson to determine the various teaching styles needed. Comparison of the two teaching environments revealed heavily weighted strengths in favor of using demonstration classrooms to improve teaching techniques. Teaching in schools was viewed only as being a more realistic teaching experience. (SM)",

The study examined teachers' beliefs about teaching and learning, teachers' personal practical knowledge, teachers' professional identity, contextual factors that enabled or constrained teachers' practice, consequences of isolation, and the role of professional development. Four teachers shared their thoughts regarding experiences they encountered on a regular basis. Data collection involved three phenomenological interviews, journal entries, and full-day classroom observations. Data analysis indicated that each teacher had a unique belief system, though there was some consistency among teachers, particularly related to  their strong spiritual commitment. All teachers longed for more professional and personal interaction, though three expressed self-reliance and self-dependence. Teachers all supported one-teacher schools and believed they were equal to their peers in their teaching effectiveness. Factors enabling practice included teacher autonomy, multiple years to work with students, and heterogeneous groupings. Constraining factors included scheduling difficulties, time constraints, and supervision demands. Participants noted both positive and negative consequences when attempting to meet diverse needs within the one-teacher school. Teachers wanted to engage in professional development in order to effectively meet students' special needs. The paper presents 7 recommendations for further study.  (SM)",

The purpose of the case study was to determine the level and nature of interaction among teachers who participated in grade level team planning meetings during the school year. Eight fifth grade teachers in a mid-South suburban school district participated in the initial phase of the study in the spring of the school year. Two teachers on the team were first-year teachers. The others ranged in experience from 2-13 years. One teacher was African American, and the rest were Caucasian. All were female. The researcher observed the teachers during their regular team planning meetings, which were 90 minutes Monday afternoons after school and 45 minutes Wednesday mornings  during their students' physical education period. The Monday afternoon meetings were devoted primarily to curriculum planning. The Wednesday morning meetings were devoted to team business. The team captain conducted both meetings. The researcher compiled field notes on individual levels of participation and categorized the types of teacher interaction. The analyses of these data provide insight into team planning and decision making as practiced in this situation, as well as the relative roles of veteran and novice teachers.

        "description":"This study examined the perceptions of violence held by preservice teachers, practicing teachers, and students at the middle school and high school levels. A total of 340 participants from five schools and a teacher training university completed a survey. Researchers divided the groups of participants into two main groups labeled school (middle school perceptions and high school perceptions). They divided the two main groups into three subgroups labeled status (students, preservice teachers, and practicing teachers). The survey asked specific and general questions regarding respondents' perceptions of violence and examined whether those perceptions of school violence changed significantly according to school, status, or an interaction between school and status. Data analysis  indicated that middle school respondents perceived violence as being more prevalent within their environment than did high school respondents. Preservice teachers had the highest perception of violence; practicing teachers had a somewhat lower perception of violence; and students had the lowest perception of violence. There was no significant difference between the interactions of school and status in the perceptions of school violence. (SM)",

This study examines the perceptions of preservice teachers who underwent the team interview process. A group of 48 students were surveyed to determine: their understanding of the interview process; their level of comfort during the interview; and their level of satisfaction with the process. Students completed the survey immediately after the team interview. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from the survey, which used a Likert-type scale and open-ended questions to determine students' agreement with six statements regarding: feeling properly notified about the interview  process; feeling prepared for the interview process; feeling informed about how to get results from the interview by those on the interview team; feeling comfortable during the interview; feeling that questions asked assessed their readiness for further study in teacher education; and feeling that they passed the interview. The results indicated that the average candidate was in agreement with the survey's six statements. The survey is appended. (SM)",

        "description":"This paper provides a program overview and review of the literature on the Teaching Students to be Peacemakers Program (TSPP), which offers peer mediation and conflict resolution to students of all ages. The program features seven steps: creating a cooperative environment; teaching students the nature of conflict; teaching all students the problem solving negotiation procedure; teaching all students to mediate conflict; implementing the TSPP; refining and upgrading resolution skills; and repeating the steps yearly through grade 12. A key barrier to the program's success can be teacher commitment to the TSPP. This can be addressed by displaying administrative support, providing education on the benefits of the program, and having frequent contact with designated trainers. Peer  mediation programs can be a significant part of a school's safety plan. Multiple studies have shown that involved students retain the mediation skills, teachers spend less time dealing with student conflict, and administrators can almost eliminate time spent on conflict resolution. While many programs train a few select students to serve as mediators, the TSPP trains all students to be mediators. (Contains 12 references.) (SM)",

The study also examines the impact of cross-over on classroom teaching, highlighting the experiences through oral narrative from two cross-over teachers in the district: an African American man who transferred to a previously all white high school and a white woman who began teaching in a previously all African American high school. Both are still teaching in the district. The narratives were gathered under a set of common themes and included their thoughts on the cross-over; prior  preparation for it; experiences during the first few days; relations with school administrators, students, and teachers; reactions of family and friends; experiences in the community; advantages and disadvantages of the cross-over; and current thoughts on the long-term efforts to integrate district schools. The teachers noted a desire to be part of the cross-over, though it was difficult. Part of the impact of the cross-over was teachers working harder in the classroom, mainly due to teachers' perceptions of racial attitudes and expectations. Both teachers believed that desegregation has fallen far short of their expectations. (SM)",

        "description":"Few preservice and beginning teachers are prepared for the diversity of today's classrooms. Educators must be aware of the many ways in which people are diverse and recognize that diversity is an enormous advantage. By 2010, 40 percent of students will be minorities. U.S. teachers are predominantly middle-class European Americans, yet one in four children (predominantly minorities) lives in poverty. Such statistics challenge teacher training institutions to matriculate teachers who are culturally sensitive and culturally literate. Multicultural education is a reform movement designed to bring about educational equity for all. It helps teachers recognize, accept, and affirm diversity. Culture and cultural diversity are important concepts for educators to understand because they  influence students' lives. Culture is shared characteristics of a group of people. Cultural diversity involves differences in those characteristics between groups. The idea that teachers need specific preparation for working effectively with diverse students is not new. Researchers have been examining the issue for decades. Teacher educators are vital in the professional development of preservice teachers. In order for the goals and tenets of multicultural education to be realized in teacher education programs, teacher educators' roles must be more narrowly defined. Teacher educators must assess their own attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge and accept the need to make multicultural education a curricular priority. (Contains 56 references.) (SM)",

America is composed of many different people from a variety of backgrounds and cultures. Regardless of cultural differences, many of these people make valuable contributions to U.S. society and will continue to do so in the future. Advocates of multiculturalism are concerned with how teachers are providing instruction for the diverse groups of children in their classrooms. Teachers are being held accountable for meeting the needs of all children in their classrooms, regardless of cultural differences. Therefore, teachers need a curriculum that incorporates diversity and makes allowances for the diverse groups  of students they teach. Failure to embrace multiculturalism allows members of society to continue to promote prejudice and racism. Opponents of multiculturalism disagree with the need for a change from the traditional curriculum to one that embraces diversity. Teachers are a key element in the process of incorporating multiculturalism into the curriculum, and they can enhance or inhibit the learning process. Multiculturalism should be embedded into the existing curriculum. Successful implementation of a multicultural curriculum will prepare today's students to become tomorrow's leaders.

Participants were undergraduate students enrolled in a language arts course for elementary school majors who completed a survey and attached it to a lesson plan and a reflection used that day. The survey asked why they picked the literature in their lesson plans, where they got it, what they liked most and least about it, and whether they would use it again. Students completed the survey three times during the term. Four students completed interviews regarding why they chose the literature, what factors appealed to them, how they would describe the selection process, how they  evaluated literature, and what factors would discourage them from using literature. Overall, participants chose literature for many reasons, which varied as students were increasingly exposed to children's literature and the need for its use in class. There was a shift from the importance of current teaching topic and personal experience in literature selection to a more broad-based range of selection reasons from the first to the third survey. Illustrations were an important factor in the selection process, as were book and award lists. Over half of the literature selections came from the library. (SM)",

Each survey included six primary questions related to the effective school setting. Data analysis indicated that 50 percent or more of the respondents perceived that their school systems were creating effective school programs and implementing them at all levels. Most did not differ greatly in their opinions concerning effective school programs within their school systems. Respondents  reported that school systems were implementing effective school programs at all levels. They believed that their school systems were striving to create effective school programs with autonomy and teacher involvement in educational decisions as well as expectations that all students can achieve at high levels. Most respondents felt their school systems had effective curricula in place to address the diverse needs of students. Respondents indicated that teacher collaboration within the schools and school systems does occur, though not always appropriately. Effective discipline policies were in place in the schools and involved input from teachers, students, and the community. (Contains 37 references.) (SM)",

Copies of the first lesson plans submitted by first-year teachers in one large Kentucky school system for a 3-year period (1995-98) were the data source for the study. Two researchers categorized the data into cognitive levels using B. Bloom's taxonomy. Data analysis found that 41.3 percent of the new teachers' lesson objectives were at the knowledge level, the lowest cognitive level. Only 3.2 percent of the teachers' lesson objectives were at the highest level, evaluation. About 19 percent of the objectives were at the comprehension level, the second lowest level of the taxonomy. The third lowest  level of the hierarchy, application, was at 16.7 percent. The next level of the taxonomy, analysis, was at 10.3 percent. The remaining 9.5 percent of the objectives were at the synthesis level, which is the second highest level of the hierarchy. The data from this study indicated that the first-year teachers in this school district were aiming their teaching primarily at the lowest cognitive level. The importance of developing higher-level thinking skills is discussed. The study points out that, in order for new teachers to be able to teach higher-order thinking skills, these skills must be developed in teacher education candidates. Two tables highlight lesson objective ratings and percentages of objectives by Bloom's taxonomy of cognitive levels. (Contains 14 references.)  (Author/SM)",

The first section describes a theoretical context for care in the school community and argues for its presence in capturing the essence of school reform. It explores one component of care, dialogue, and how dialogue provides a forum for the practice of care. The next section discusses the context and methodology of the study, which supports an examination of care in the development of teacher community. The third section uses two illustrative cases to examine the dialogue in this specific community which reveals how the teachers relate to one another in ways that are consistent with a definition of care. The first case focuses  on shared questions about student learning (how the teacher addresses the diversity of reading levels in the first grade). The second case concerns process (how the teachers rally around a curriculum mandate in order to develop a meaningful curriculum for first grade students). The final section of the paper discusses the implications for building caring communities in schools and offers some possible future directions. (Contains 33 references.) (SM)",
