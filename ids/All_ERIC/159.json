        "description":"According to this report, the accomplishments of the Sociolinguistics Studies on Southwest Bilingualism have been to (1) elicit a corpus of the speech (Spanish, English, and Mixed) of several hundred young adults and set up taxonomies of leading variables in both languages; (2) devise and apply a Sociolinguistic Background Questionnaire with over 90 demographic, attitudinal, and language usage items; (3) established working hypotheses for correlating such data with school performance records; and (4) develop a tentative working model (rational bilingualism) to correlate social and educational factors with language skills. Applications of the growing data bank are anticipated in programs aimed at curricular change for culturally and linguistically divergent pupils and students,  special texts and programs intended for bilinguals in both Spanish and English, and attitudinal profiles of bilinguals/biculturals useful in understanding and coping with the special problems of this population and related ones (Puerto Rican, Cuban, and other Spanish-English speakers).

        "description":"Pragmalinguistics, combining knowledge of linguistics and civilization, is a field under development within the realm of applied linguistics. It is concerned with the pragmatism of speech acts, which calls for knowledge of the relation between one linguistic element and the persons producing, using, and receiving it during the communicative situation. Pragmalinguistics attempts to develop a systematic inventory of all that belongs to communicative competence. Communicative competence includes not only grammar but also the way of living and the view of life specific to the competent speaker, since he needs them to make use of his ability to perform speech acts. Foreign language instruction should include these dimensions, as well as instruction in casual speech and fast speech  rules in second language learning, since the highly conventional style taught by high school teachers is inappropriate for the majority of conversations the student will have.

The evaluation of student achievement shows significantly better performance by individualized instruction students in reading and writing and equal oral performance compared with the basic course students. The findings confirm the conclusions of the first study and substantiate them with more rigorous statistical evidence. The data gathered over two years from a substantial student  population are proposed as a demonstration of the basic soundness of individualized foreign language instruction. (Author/RS)",

The emphasis is on the new institutions for several reasons. First, the new institutions are under greater pressure to justify their existence and their different ways of doing things than are more established institutions; second, one of the characteristics of most new institutions is a commitment to evaluate and assess; third, while there is a general similarity among the new institutions, as a group they are quite different from traditional institutions and traditional means of evaluation often do not apply. The components of the assessment model through which  nontraditional institutions are to be evaluated come under the five general headings accessibility, flexibility, personalization, synthesis, and efficacy of resources.

(2) If there is to be some form of accreditation, what is the future of voluntary associations in this effort? and (3) If there is to be some form of accreditation and if not by voluntary associations, then by whom or what? The arguments presented to the first question seem to deny that accreditation as it now exists should be allowed to continue. Reasons for this feeling center around the facts that: (1) very few colleges have any trouble at all getting themselves accredited, regardless of the quality of educational output; (2) the pursuit of excellence is not advanced by  accrediting procedures; (3) there is no further need for accrediting agencies because only 80 nonregionally accredited institutions are in existence; and (4) accreditation merely contributes to educational sameness between and among institutions rather than promoting quality education. Discussions of the arguments surrounding the other two questions are considered in the text of the document. (HS)",

The major focus of the analysis was the total impact at each college, rather than the separate and independent evaluations of the three interim term programs. Findings indicate a favorable reaction to 4-1-4 curriculum; however participating colleges indicated a lax attitude in defining and operationalizing exactly what the interim term does and  should accomplish.

Exposure to clinical settings, placement of temporal and procedural decisionmaking responsibility on the student, and elimination of the lecture/laboratory format are integral aspects of the program. Additionally, the involvement of the practicing physicians in the community in the educational process on a non-salaried  basis is designed to help reduce the costs of medical education for the student while enhancing the continuing education of the physician.

        "description":"In a 3-year study of the impact of education consultation on development of continuing medical education (CME) programs in community hospitals, results seem to indicate that: (1) limited inputs by physicians, acting as education consultants, can significantly facilitate development of hospital-based CME programs. Over a 2-year period, 40 hospitals, comprising a stratified sample of acute, short-term community general hospitals in four New England states, received education consultation and training of their physician education coordinators. Following consultation, trained behavioral scientists visited both the 40 consulted hospitals and a matched group of 40 control hospitals that did not receive consultation. Consultation was shown to be effective on both scores: consulted  hospitals implemented 60% of the consultants' recommendations within 18 months after they were submitted; and a statistically significant greater number of educational changes occurred at consulted hospitals than at the matched group of control hospitals.

A consultation model was set up and implemented in three selected hospitals located in depressed areas. The model of consultation is characterized by the following principles: (1) educational consultation is provided by an interdisciplinary team; (2) consultation is used both as a catalyst and as an educational activity itself; (3) consultation stresses critical self-examination as an avenue to insights and corrective measures; (4) consultation seeks participation of individuals who will authorize, effect, and ultimately accept change; (5)  consultation starts with recognition of felt problems and seeks to motivate consideration of long-range planning; (6) the approach seeks to maximize consultee involvement in program planning; (7) consultation tries to use educational mechanisms that will assure diffusion of its effects to the staff at large; and (8) consultation seeks to minimize the formation of dependency relationships.

Results indicated that white parents and students generally tend to have negative and generally similar attitudes toward blacks.

A questionnaire survey technique was employed with items designed to elicit responses in the areas of student personnel services, admissions effectiveness, and curriculum and instruction. The instrument was designed to identify the reasons which could contribute to a student's decision to withdraw; it was also intended to identify the college's assets from a student's perspective so that these strengths could be enhanced. Results indicated the attrition rate of  Nasson College was found to be somewhat higher than similar types of 4-year institutions included in a national sample. The technique and instruments described in this study can, with minor adjustments, be broadly applied to institutions of higher learning that consider student attrition to be an actual or potential problem source.

In general, the findings indicate that those faculty who tend to hold traditional and/or structured attitudes toward curriculum, who tend to use formal instructional techniques, and who exhibit a formal, nominal, and thing-oriented language pattern are usually from the Natural Sciences. By contrast, those faculty whose views of curriculum are nontraditional and/or nonstructured, whose instructional techniques tend toward the informal, and whose language pattern tends toward informality, verbality, and people-orientation are also from the same groups -- Social  Sciences and Humanities. The implications of this research suggest that the interrelationship between the faculty's working environment and their attitudes toward curriculum and instruction, which do differ by academic area, must be considered when a university plans for its future. The findings also suggest that administrative personnel practices should focus more on the concept of equitability than on equality in curricular determinations, in evaluating teaching effectiveness, and in student-faculty relationships.

This college would admit students following their graduation from high school and grant the M.D. degree in 6 years.

As the student progresses through the curriculum, he would be exposed to the basic medical sciences through an organ-systems approach to teaching that provides for maximal integration of the disciplines. The curriculum that has been developed insures that adequate time is available for the student to gain a broad liberal education in the arts and humanities. It eliminates the redundancy in the teaching of the  sciences fundamental to the education of a physician by avoiding the artificial discontinuity that frequently separates undergraduate premedical education from the early basic science years of medical school.

The difference has traditionally been that orientation planners concentrated their efforts on the framing of questions while the educational researchers focused on the development of a repertoire of techniques for obtaining answers. Since they have not had a satisfactory method of communicating with each other, the planners developed poor tools for answering their valid and relevant questions, while the researchers developed sophisticated methods of answering relatively impractical questions. What is needed is a plan to get the two groups together, to have the researchers apply their techniques to the questions asked  by those responsible for the planning of orientation programs. Such a model is proposed in this paper, and a working model in effect at the State University of New York, College at Oswego is described. (Author/HS)",

Specifically, the study addressed itself to the initial experiences of these students as well as to their subsequent adjustment to the institutional environment. Findings from in-depth interviews with black students include: (1) The relative proportion of black students of college age attending traditionally white institutions of higher education falls far below the corresponding proportion of white students in spite of vigorous recruiting efforts reported by these institutions. (2) Black students enrolled in white institutions appear to be attracted by such features as propinquity, low  cost and/or financial aid, availability of a particular program of interest, and a conviction of quality of program. (3) Few blacks in white institutions reported any effective assistance or encouragement from guidance counselors. (4) Some black students who choose white 4-year institutions seem to perceive them as being higher in quality, or their degrees as having greater market value than do degrees from the traditionally black institutions.

On examining the data it becomes evident that the city in which the individual colleges are located has a good deal to do with the pulling power of the college. In addition, the type of institution, such as a vocational-technical versus a liberal arts college, or colleges with religious orientation, has a good deal to do with college choice of high school students.

A sample of the same class took the &quot;Cooperative General Culture Test&quot; four times. Findings show that AVL aesthetic scores increased, and religious scores decreased for the class as a whole. Political values increased for men and economic values decreased for women. The change in aesthetic scores occurred later for men than women, whereas, the change in religious scores occurred later for women than men. A 9-fold curriculum  group breakdown showed similarities between the acquisition of particular kinds of cultural information and changes in corresponding values. The AVL profiles of undergraduates tended to become more clearly defined during their college careers and to resemble those of the faculty in the same curriculum area more closely. (Author/HS)",

This publication contains the results of this cost study made in the fall of 1971. The basic unit of measurement that comes under scrutiny in the Commission's instructional cost study is the student credit hour. Professional salaries, support salaries, operating expenses, and equipment charges are allocated to the student credit hour so as to yield cost per hour by (1) academic program, (2) student class level, and (3) institution. From cost data collected by the various institutions, statewide average costs by student credit hour by program and by level  are computed and used in the budget process to request instruction and departmental research monies that now comprise 54% of the operating budget for educational expenditures in the Tennessee public institutions. The cost per student credit hour is used additionally to identify high cost academic programs, and can thus be used in the internal management of the institution. (Author/HS)",

        "description":"This paper comments on some of the possible uses and values of the Institutional Goals Inventory (IGI), an instrument by which a college community can delineate institutional goals and establish priorities among them. In the practical sense, the establishment of institutional goals is an essential element in any kind of systematic institutional planning, which most institutions are now being compelled to do as they find resources to be increasingly limited. A second practical use of institutional goals inheres in institutional evaluation activities, which may be carried on for purposes of internal improvement and as a basis for rendering account to external agencies and interests. Ideologically, institutional goals can represent the basic principles of institutional policy, the  basics of an institution's self-conception, and the philosophy that can pervade the college and give coherence to all its operations.

        "description":"This paper summarizes the findings of a research project that was designed to assess the utilization of computer simulation models in the administration of higher education. The problem was approached through an examination of the experiences reported by colleges and universities that had implemented and were using one or another of these models as an administrative aid. The case studies represent a variety of institutional types and structures and reflect experiences with 3 of the more widely used simulation systems. These are generally known by the acronyms of CAMPUS, HELP/PLANTRAN, and SEARCH. It seems that overall, experiences to date have indicated that the time and expense involved with computerized planning models have not been justified in terms of the extent of their  utilization. However, this conclusion must be considered in the context of their utilization. However, this conclusion must be considered in the context of the following qualifications: (1) an important benefit of the utilization of these models is that attention is focused on long-range planning; (2) the models have the greatest potential of becoming a valuable tool in institutions that are in the process of change; and (3) the value of computer planning models in higher education is dependent on the ability of the user to recognize situations in which this tool is needed and appropriate.

It was found that during academic year 1971-72, protest at colleges was less organized, less demonstrative, less disruptive and often expressed in legitimate ways. In the secondary schools, however, especially in the urban and suburban schools, this was not the case. In these schools disruptive unrest in more common and is often exhibited in different and more violent ways from those presently seen at the colleges.

It is the eventual goal to develop models of academic administrative power before and after the initiation of collective bargaining. The analysis of the 91 collective bargaining contracts in higher education that are in force at the present time reveals that governance matters such as budgeting and long range planning still are largely management territory. The contracts have much more to say about the personnel area. Without doubt, the employment status of the faculty  member is receiving new emphasis. Still slightly over 50% of the agreements said nothing about appointment, evaluation or promotion, and less than 10% had achieved strong voice in these areas. Analysis of the more potent agreements shows that vague pronouncements disappear in favor of the specification of decisionmaking rights and procedures, sometimes culminating in the requirements of faculty committee approval.

It is suggested that a primary task of instruction is to assist the student to move from external motivation to internal motivation for learning and continuing to learn. It is proposed that these outcomes can best be facilitated by making two reforms in student evaluation procedures: (1) changing to a pass/no pass system of grading and (2) using criterion-referenced instruments, as opposed to norm-referenced instruments, as a basis for evaluation. An experimental approach to these methods are currently being tested in the Purdue University Department of Veterinary Anatomy. Students are given the mastery standard, provided with  numerous instructor and student-generated evaluation items. Students in this program no longer may receive a failing grade in the health professions courses. Until mastery is achieved, the student will receive an incomplete. If, after repeated attempts, he appears unable to pass, he should be counseled to consider other career options. In neither case does he even receive a failing grade or symbol. A significant outcome of the procedure is that learning is allowed to happen and the student is allowed to discover for himself his own level of excellence. (HS)",

Any definition of interdisciplinarity leads to a transdisciplinary model that necessitates an integration of some structure of goals with a system for integrating participating disciplines. If any such transdisciplinary innovation within the university is to be successful, it necessitates certain operational assumptions that include philosophical and budgetary commitment at the highest level of university administration. Four organizational patterns  are often employed in the establishment of interdisciplinarity at the university, one of which is the institute or center. The institute is seen as the most creative organizational structure for the innovative development of transdisciplinarity in the university. (HS)",

What is needed is a change in the role of teacher-educators in colleges and universities. Modifying the job of college teachers in education to one which involves teaching and research should not be construed, however, as an easy matter. It requires changing the philosophy of the colleges, revising their  policies and procedures and training their faculty to conduct research.

These demands require that colleges and universities desiring or holding federal contracts eliminate all traces of discriminatory practices with regard to faculty recruitment, hiring, anti-nepotism policies, placement, job classification and assignment, promotion, termination, conditions of work, salary rights and benefits, leave policies and fringe benefits. A complaint of discrimination may be filed by or on behalf of an individual or by one of the Commissioners of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Notice of the charge is forwarded to the employer within 10 days stating the date, place and  circumstances of the alleged unfair employment practice. After an investigation, if a finding of discrimination is confirmed and the employer and complainant have failed to reach conciliation, the individual or the Commission may file suit. If a court finds that an employer has intentionally engaged in an unlawful employment practice, it has the authority to enjoin the respondent from such practices, order affirmative action that may be necessary, and any other equitable relief that it may deem appropriate.

The differentiated system of higher education attempts to match student ability, needs and aspirations to broadly defined institutional missions, and there is a broad spectrum of diversity within that system. Aspirations for achievement, high school grade averages, and ACT test scores of entering college freshmen increase with the level of institution enrolling those students. Without a tremendous increase of resources and without a major upheaval of the existing system it appears impossible to meet the public's expectations for protection of academic quality and for expansion of equality of educational opportunity and access to higher education. In the short run,  expansion of opportunity and better education can perhaps be achieved more efficiently by improving the quality of educational attainment in the primary and secondary schools, particularly schools that serve the deprived. In the long run, equality of educational opportunity and access to higher education depend on sweeping social reform. (Author/HS)",

The purpose of the program is to strengthen American higher education by assisting selected private universities and colleges in different regions of the country to reach and sustain new levels of academic excellence, administrative effectiveness, and financial support. As of mid-December, 1964, a total of $218.5 million had been granted under the program to 10 universities and 47 colleges. To obtain the full amount of the grants, the recipients are required to match the Foundation's funds in varying ratios by raising funds from other private sources. In general, the program has been most dramatically successful in underlining and reaffirming philanthropy as  the great third force in college financing, an essential partner in support of higher education along with tax support and student tuition. Its impact is a new challenge to the convictions of citizens, boards of corporations, labor unions, churches and others in maintaining the diversity, responsiveness, and flexibility in our system of higher education in America.

        "author":["Leslie, Larry L."],
        "description":"In the past several years a trend toward government funding of higher education through students has been emerging. This trend, which proposes to apply the market model to higher education, is largely the work of well-meaning economists, persons possessing only the high motives of equalizing opportunity and improving efficiency in higher education. Their motives are so fine that less desirable, noneconomic outcomes have not received careful consideration. After careful study of the trend, it is felt that the market model probably cannot and should not be applied to higher education, the reasons for this being that higher education, as presently designed, does not sufficiently represent a marketplace. In additon, it is felt that such a system has limited goals, imposes federal  restrictions that may not be overcome by many institutions, and creates a limited public service because of the restrictions. It is recommended that the priorities of higher education be reexamined to determine the logical order of the economic and social factors involved. (Author/HS)",

First, it will indicate doctoral production. Second, it demonstrates that, at least for women, the already available pool is not being adequately used. Third, it will show that certain persons have, until very recently, been systematically filtered out of the pool. Fourth, it concludes by suggesting that really effective affirmative action requires an educational process aimed at three target groups: those who do the hiring, those who seek access to the pool of doctorates, and those who have traditionally contributed to  the filtering process which has kept women and minorities out of the pool.

The resulting summary data included information on entering freshmen at the U.S.C. and weighted normative data based on questionnaire results from 42 participating universities. The first part of this report examines the higher education plans of U.S.C. freshmen for the years 1968, 1970, and 1972 and compares them to the national university norms for the corresponding time periods. An analysis by sex is presented for the U.S.C. freshmen classes of 1971 and 1972 and the corresponding national  university norms. Results indicate U.S.C. entering freshmen plan to pursue graduate and professional degrees less frequently than their national counterparts, law degree plans represented the only area in which U.S.C. freshmen exceeded the national norms, U.S.C. female freshmen were more likely to seek nonprofessional graduate degrees than were male freshmen, and U.S.C. male freshmen were likely to seek professional degrees than were U.S.C. female freshmen.

Their task was to define, from their own perspectives, the higher educational needs of not only minority youth but all young people from backgrounds of poverty, and to develop recommendations for social policies that could lower the most persistent barrier to undergraduate higher education for the poor, lack of money. This, the panel's final report, seeks to give structure and measure to the national commitment required to fulfill the needs of the poor and minority youth for higher education. The panel proposes a new federal program of grants, loans and special services  that would provide the dollars necessary not only to fulfill the expectations of the poor for higher education, but also to match the promise of this society of equal opportunity for all its citizens. The dollar cost of lowering the financial barriers to higher education are great, but the social costs of continuing current inequities are even greater. Only with equal educational opportunity can there be equal economic and social opportunity. See also ED 046 333. (Author/HS)",

While others have examined aspects of consortia, this paper reports the first intensive effort dealing with effectiveness. The study is divided into 2 parts: (1) What constitutes consortium effectiveness? and (2) In what ways are the Great Lakes Colleges Association and the Associated Colleges of the Midwest perceived effective? Part I found that consortia exist for their member institutions and are effective if they meet the needs of their members. It also disclosed a 5 category framework of institutional needs that consortia should meet, the 5 E's expanded student and faculty opportunities, promotion of greater managerial  efficiency, promotion of experimentation and change, promotion of exchange through interpersonal contacts among the members, and entrepreneurship. The study found both associations perceived as effective in providing programs in the need areas of the members. It also found both the unusual preliminary survey mechanism and the 5 category framework to be useful research tools. (Author/HS)",

Educational innovations have represented an elitist view, and the aspirations of the \"new students\" from low-income and/or minority groups to obtain jobs that are not demeaning have been ignored or belittled. The new student faces special problems because he is not able to depend on his parents for financial support and because his parents' lack of knowledge of the system of higher education means that he must orient himself without specific parental support and encouragement. This new educational program attempt to approximate the real world of work with which the student must deal. Program philosophy  includes the modular approach; a concentrated learning situation is combined with an internship. A module consists of 9 weeks of instruction, spread over 5 days a week, for approximately 6 hours a week. Requirements for the degree can be completed in less time than with the traditional approach. In addition to the internship, concepts included in the program include a master teacher, master practitioner, and a senior journeyman. Advantages of the program include increased motivation, acceleration, and the stress on individual learning, including student participation. Six modules leading to an A.S. degree in computer technology and their course outlines are attached. (KM)",

Many committee recommendations require action at the superintendent and college president levels; therefore articulation is needed between head administrative officers. A Steering Committee was elected to present the recommendations to high school and community college administrators and to coordinate future articulation efforts. It is recommended that school division administrators consider references to future meetings and schedule inservice  education days accordingly.

The variables related to System Characteristics were: (1) the degree of state-level control over community college funding and budgeting directly affected the success or failure of coordinated planning efforts; (2) the existence of uniform procedures and a high level of homogeneity among community colleges facilitated coordinated planning. Variables  related to Agency Characteristics were: (1) successful planning relies on aggressive leadership from the state community college agency; (2) autonomy of the state community college agency facilitated project accomplishment; (3) projects tended to be more successful when they were a major organizational division of the state agency, with access to the state director; (4) project accomplishment was related to the level of community and campus involvement in planning. The Inner-Project Characteristics variables were: (1) staffing configurations and staff size were significant factors in project achievement; (2) combined short-range planning and program assistance objectives proved most successful in the OEO projects.

Career education is seen as the effort to help students integrate work oriented values into their lives and providing them with the experiences and opportunities they need to successfully pursue their continuing job interests. The essential components that should be included in a comprehensive career education system are: (1) design a comprehensive system of career ladder and lattices for occupational education; (2) design new systems and arrangements for interagency coordination; (3) redesign instructional programs at all educational levels to reflect career education objectives; (4)  redesign counseling and guidance activities at all educational levels to reflect career education objectives; and (5) design advanced planning and evaluation systems. Before a comprehensive career education plan can be developed, several essential preplanning steps must be taken; these are (1) establish an \"interactive network\" between local college vocational education directors and job placement officers; (2) select occupation areas for development of career ladders and lattices; (3) establish advisory committees on local, regional, and state levels; and (4) develop and demonstrate a basic career education plan.

After reviewing the literature related to evaluation in higher education, open-ended questionnaires were sent to all faculty members and to a random sample of 30 graduates. They were asked to list areas of concern and specific questions dealing with curriculum relevancy. Information about counseling services was solicited from the counselors. The second step  in developing the follow-up questionnaire consisted of summarizing and categorizing the responses of persons who completed the input questionnaire and transforming each major question and area of concern into a structured questionnaire item. The pilot edition of the questionnaire was comprised of four parts and 36 items, as well as space for biographical information. With the exception of the open-ended items, the response mode for all items was based on a five-point Likert-type scale. The instrument was reviewed by second-year students, faculty members, counselors, and 30 graduates. The final version contains four parts and 32 items. Appendix C to the report provides the questionnaire, consisting of question and answer sheets. (Not available in hard copy due to marginal legibility of  original document.) (DB)",

Of the questionnaires, 34.3% were completed and returned. Analyses of the responses revealed that: (1) the student's financial needs and personal or health problems apparently compete most with his chances of continuing in college; (2) there appears to be concordance between reasons cited on the exit and follow-up questionnaires; thus, information gathered from the exit questionnaire may reflect the student's true feelings; (3) concerning the small proportion of discordant responses, it appears that &quot;work interference&quot; as a  reason for withdrawing stated on the exit questionnaire may also reflect that &quot;lack of interest,&quot;&quot;personal or health problems,&quot;&quot;courses not relevant to my goals,&quot; and &quot;general feeling of not getting anywhere&quot; may also play a part in the student's choice of seeking more financial support instead of continuing college; and (4) in reference to those who did not cite any reason on the exit questionnaire, the two most frequently cited reasons on the follow-up questionnaire were &quot;to become employed,&quot; and &quot;personal or health problems.&quot; (Author/DB)",

Over 200 usable questionnaires were returned. Because of scheduling variations and other factors, such as the newness of the Media Center and the related problems of lack of student awareness and necessary &quot;debugging,&quot; some study contamination resulted. Nine tables provide the study data. Conclusions resulting from the study are: (1) schedule descriptions clearly need revisions; over half of the students did not know what TBA meant at time of enrollment, and nearly half did not know at the time of completion of the  questionnaire; (2) there was little difference in TV viewing habits or hours of employment between students in the two types of classes; (3) only about 1 student in 10 had ever taken a &quot;media&quot; course previously; (4) before taking the course, about one-third of the &quot;media&quot; students and two-thirds of the &quot;traditional&quot; students thought the two approaches were of about equal difficulty; (5) nearly three-quarters of all the students indicated that prior to enrollment, their knowledge of &quot;media&quot; courses was vague or non-existent; (6) major reasons for choosing the &quot;media&quot; class were that it promised to be more interesting with more freedom in choosing hours; reasons for choosing &quot;traditional&quot; class were more conveniently scheduled hours and apparent lack of information about the &quot;media&quot; class;  (7) students generally preferred the mode in which enrolled.

        "description":"In order to compile a population profile of actual writing skills demonstrated by first-semester freshman composition students during the opening and closing weeks of their courses, a pre- and post-test survey was made of 16 classes of freshmen among eight community colleges and three universities in the greater Los Angeles area. Theses and support essay tests were written by 486 students, 285 of whom returned for the post-test. Grading criteria were based upon four equally weighted items: content, organization, mechanics, and sentence structure (including diction). Each item was graded on the stanine (standard scale of nine), and the grades were then averaged for a composite stanine score--the final score--which was used for both individual and group comparisons. Results showed  that the universities, because of their more rigid screening procedures, scored considerably above the norm on the pre-test gross. UCLA headed the list. The post-test results were based on the two-tail test, which included only those scores from students who had taken both the pre- and post-tests. Again UCLA headed the list. The universities as a group scored 1.22 stanines above the community colleges as a group; however, the colleges achieved both a greater stanine gain (1.89) than did the universities (1.4), and their results had a greater level of probability. Groups exhibiting the greatest gains were generally those which had been fairly small and had received extensive, individualized essay writing assignments in their courses. The survey indicates that placement tests and remedial  courses as related to English composition leave much to be desired. (DB)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to identify the factors in attrition over which Southwestern College might exercise some control and through which experimentation could be conducted toward changing the patterns of attrition. Data were gathered from college files on every student who withdrew from one or more classes for the fall 1971 semester. A comparison was then made between the characteristics of the withdrawing student and those of the total student population. The comparison showed that minority students, day students, full-time students, students between 18 and 25 years old, and students receiving financial aid tended to withdraw at a significantly higher rate. Sex and units completed were not significantly related to student withdrawal. However, minority students did not  withdraw from the college at a significant rate. The study indicates a relationship between W grades and ability. Forty-eight percent of the total student population received a W grade, but students who made up the Dean's List for fall 1971, representing 11% of the total student population, accounted for only 5% of the W grades. That marginal students receive W grades in place of D's (and the no longer used F grade) is suggested by the fact that students are still being disqualified at approximately the same rate as before the F grade was abolished.

Instruments on student and teacher characteristics were administered at the beginning of the semester; most of the measures of learning effectiveness were administered at the end of the semester. The results supported the hypothesis regarding direct relationships between learning effectiveness and student characteristics, instruction characteristics, and teaching methods. Among the student characteristics that  showed the strongest positive relationships to learning effectiveness were self-concept of academic ability and internal reinforcement control. Among the instructor characteristics that showed the strongest positive relationships with effective learning was the attitude that education should be oriented more toward a student's interests and concerns than toward mastering the subject matter. With respect to teaching methods, student-directed and structured classes were far superior to instructor-directed and unstructured ones. A 30-item bibliography is included. (Author/MJM)",

The design of the study included an experimental group of teachers who participated in Minicourse 5 along with corresponding experimental and control groups of students who were administered pre- and post-experiment tests of mathematics performance. Videotaped samples of tutoring sessions were analyzed using the t-test for correlated means and the Wilcoxon matched-pairs, signed-ranks test to determine changes in teacher tutoring behavior and the degree of retention of this behavior. Resulting effects of teachers' participation in Minicourse 5 on students  were assessed via achievement in mathematics. Statistically significant differences in mathematics performance occurred in favor of students in the experimental group over students in the control group. Conclusions arrived at from the results were that Minicourse 5 improves mathematics tutoring performance of special education teachers in selected skills and that these skills are pertinent to the teachers' instructional content. An extensive bibliography and appendixes of Minicourse material are included. (Author/MJM)",

Two groups of undergraduate teaching interns were outfitted with wireless FM receivers. One group was given praise (by an observer fitted with a wireless microphone) whenever they emitted any of a predetermined set of positive behaviors. The second group received no feedback. The results showed that the technique was effective mainly when positive verbal comments on the part of the intern were reinforced. In the experimental group, the rate of this behavior rose dramatically in the training sessions. In addition, during the training phase, interns in the experimental group punished much less than  the control subjects.

However, for such comparisons to be valid, it is suggested that evaluations must be made on some common basis since many educational and employment decisions are based on these evaluations. Standardized tests, often used when comparisons are to be made, offer some guarantee of a common evaluative basis, even though they may contain measurement errors. Among the many transforming and scaling work techniques that have been suggested, two measurements are considered useful in terms of groups of scores, that is, central tendency (mean and median) and dispersion (standard deviation and interquartile range) measures. It is suggested that while transformations are required in order to  validate results from different examinations, one should consider what purpose the transformation is to serve. Also, discussed are transformations that convert marks to T scores and the differences among percentiles, ranks, and standard scores. It is concluded that certain basic educational problems are revealed when scaling or transformation techniques are used. (JS)",

The results suggest that aptitude tests have been useful instruments in predicting general scholastic aptitudes but have not been as successful in predicting technical aptitudes. Possible reasons for this finding may be that (1) a student's high interest does not necessarily indicate a high aptitude, and (2) the inability to measure every aspect of the achievement process. It is concluded that further research is necessary for aptitudes  to be identified and measured more accurately. It is felt that much of a test's usefulness is the adequacy of its manual. With the exception of the DAT manual, most seemed to lack presenting adequate norms, their source, and appropriate validity and reliability data. It is suggested that (1) present multifactor batteries do not adequately differentiate aptitudes, 2) adequate guidance will depend on supplementary information, and (3) student motivation requires more attention and measurement.

Evaluation models were reviewed as well as the literature on curriculum evaluation procedures and designs. The study was conducted in two fourth grade classes using the Individually Prescribed Instruction mathematics curriculum. A specific evaluation technique was designed based on a quasi-experimental design for establishing cause and effect relationships. The four steps used in applying the model were defining the goals, plan, operation, and assessment. The results indicate that the procedures developed for this  study were successful in (1) monitoring the total classroom environment by identifying those variables that interfere with learning, and (2) attempting to define and apply strong inference procedures for evaluating instructional materials.

The tests were administered to 1,310 6 to 11 year old Anglo, Negro, and Mexican-American school children. Separate analyses were performed by sex, age, and socioeconomic level for each of the ethnic groups. The findings support the results from other studies, that is, that Mexican-American children do relatively better on the performance than on the verbal tests. It is noted that the size of the standard error of estimated Full Scale IQ for the Vocabulary and Block Design subtests could lead to misclassifications of individuals in  predicting IQ scores of less than 85, 80, and 70 for diagnostic purposes. However, it is suggested that both scores could be used to provide estimated IQ scores for groups of individuals. It is concluded that no other combination of two WISC subtests would have produced better overall predictions for all three ethnic groups. The sum of the scaled scores for the Vocabulary and Block Design subtests correlated .880 with Full Scale IQ. (Author)",

In addition, three accountability schemes which are considered exemplary of the kinds of proposals presently made and which cover a broad range of accountability types are also discussed. The schemes are: the voucher plan, performance contracting with an external contractor, and performance contracting with a teacher. In Part II, it is suggested that traditional methods of evaluating teachers are not adequate. For example, it is felt that principals' judgments are usually too subjective to provide valid data while standardized tests are often too insensitive to student performance on the specific goals and objectives of a given  educational program. It is suggested that student performance on relevant measures be used as the primary basis for a teacher evaluation system. The steps needed for instituting two potentially effective systems--an objectives-based approach to outcome accountability and performance tests--are described along with their advantages and limitations. The difficulties of implementing any kind of an evaluation system are considered as well as how these difficulties might be overcome if the focus of the approach is on the improvement of teacher skills and educational practices.

Parents were instructed in teaching their own children. Differences in gain scores and learning rate on the reading instruments tested the hypotheses of efficacy of parental help for 26 second graders. Treatment included diagnosis, teaching the parents personality theory, learning theory, and reading methodology, demonstration lessons with children, and parents teaching their children in 12 one-hour practicums. Analyses of variance and covariance on the California reading grade equivalent scores and percentiles failed at the .05 significance level. Percentile rank by the one-tailed t test using the paired difference method approached significant rank  loss for controls at the .10 level. Improvement on learning rate for the 14 experimental subjects was significant at the .001 alpha on the Oral Reading Inventory using the t test, paired difference method. Gain scores on inventories were significant at the .005 level by variance and covariance analyses. It is concluded that the findings indicate that some parents can be good remedial resources for their children's learning difficulties. (Author)",

High school juniors were given a pretest that included items of each format and a parallel form as a posttest several weeks later. Between the pre- and posttests, experimental subjects received instruction in one of the three formats; controls received no special instruction. Pre- to posttest gains were analyzed using a two-way multivariate covariance analysis. The six dependent variables were the geometry and nongeometry posttest scores for each of the item formats. The seven covariates included the pretest scores corresponding to the six dependent variables and the Scholastic Aptitude Test-Verbal pretest  score. Results of the statistical analysis showed that each of the three formats was susceptible to the special instruction directed toward it. The complex or novel item formats seemed to be more susceptible than the more straightforward item format. Female subjects tended to benefit less from the instruction than male volunteers. Mean gains of nearly one full standard deviation obtained by the &quot;complex&quot; format groups were considered to be of practical consequence and likely to influence admissions decisions. It is concluded that instruction was effective in two ways: subjects seemed to have learned a systematic approach to the item format and some basic mathematical concepts. (Author)",

Some comparisons are emphasized regarding internal and external validation procedures, although they both result in important data. Chief among these is the fact that internal validation occurs under strict controls, but the information acquired is only conclusive for the system in which the research occurs; external validity  studies offer more generalizable results, but the conclusions cannot be as definite. For internal validation the test may be specifically designed to fit the system, but for external validation the test must be standard for both systems.

It involves the application of the word association technique long used in psychoanalysis to the classroom setting. The actual testing procedure requires the selection by the instructor of a number of stimulus terms which sample a wide range of the concepts covered in the course. The student is usually required to produce four associatives for each stimulus term, providing sufficient discriminatory power for evaluating student knowledge. After details of the method, its analysis and psychometrics are given, it is concluded that the word-association technique  is of sufficient reliability and validity to warrant further investigation.

Subjects were 980 black urban school children, and the question and answer scales used included the Crandall-Katkofsky-Crandall intellectual achievement responsibility scale, Bialer's locus of control questionnaire, and versions of the Rotter scale for high school students.

A measure of ambivalence was obtained by using pairs of unipolar scales to assess positive and negative attitudes toward a number of objects. When attitudes were correlated with relevant behaviors, the ambivalence variable acted as a moderator by clearly distinguishing between more and less predictable groups of subjects.

A 9-test Project Access battery was administered, along with a biographical inventory, to 18,000 junior-year students in Los Angeles, Memphis, and Washington, D.C. The ethnic groups studied were Black, White, Mexican-American, and Oriental, and subjects from all four groups were from low socioeconomic backgrounds. The tests measured word meaning, inductive reasoning, comparing mathematical quantities, spatial scanning,  reading comprehension, grammar, following complex directions, geometric analogies, and associative memory. Principle axes procedures were applied to the correlation matrices within each ethnic group. The first five components within each group were then rotated, using Varimax procedures. The original correlation matrices are presented in the Appendix.

Training sessions held afterwards to help teachers focus on outcomes of instruction, their measurement, and the interpretation of scores to students were viewed negatively by the teachers, who at first felt there was no need for testing themselves. There was a change of attitude when facts were presented concerning the great range and low median of their scores. Although the scores did not improve substantially over time, the teachers did apparently function better. The procedure offers a means of supplying teachers with unlimited information  about their proficiency in given areas and should be helpful to all school personnel in the improvement of instruction. The results of the testing indicate that at least a third and probably 40% to 60% of teachers are deficient in most of the instructional areas for which they have responsibility, and a significant number have less than average ability.

        "description":"The emphasis in this study is on the development of a diagnostic measurement model for instruction. The content used was junior high science, but the content and subjects were used primarily as a means to an end. The model represents an attempt to incorporate Gagne's learning taxonomy into Tyler's model of the educational act. Focus is on the hypothesis that if a learner can demonstrate the ability to identify new examples of concepts within a verbal statement, all that is required for the learner to gain an understanding of a statement or rule is that he put the concepts together in proper order. Project activities included: (1) structuring a unit of beginning junior high school chemistry beginning with the most basic statement possible and proceeding by adding new statements in  such a way that no more than one new concept was added with each statement, (2) constructing a concept test for each of the key concepts within the statement, and (3) constructing a criterion test in which the correct answers involved the positive transfer of the rule or statement. Conclusions include: (1) In nearly every case on the pre-test, the number of students demonstrating the ability to transfer the statement increased with the number of concepts attained within the statement; (2) Teaching the specific concepts missed on the pre-test resulted in a significant percentage of the learners being able to transfer the rules and statements which contain the concepts on the post-test; and (3) The data provides for the kind of systematized instruction represented by the model. Two tests  are provided (see TM 001 113 - 114). (Author/CK)",

        "description":"A research study is reported which investigated the influence of the variables of race (examiner and child race) and expectancy (high and low) upon the scoring of individual IQ tests. Video tapes of two children (one black, one white, 10 years old, in the 85 to 95 IQ range) being administered the Wischler Intelligence Scale for Children were shown to 32 practicing school psychologists for their evaluations. Half of the psychologists were led to believe the children were brighter than they actually were (high expectancy); the other half, that they were duller (low expectancy). The expectancy and order of child presentation (high-black, high-white, low-white, low-black, etc.) were randomized. The results indicate that in the case of expectancy white and black examiners score  children (white or black) in a similar manner; i.e., in the direction of expectancy. Expectancy has the most influence upon scores obtained when children and examiners are of the same race. The implications for psychological examiners are that expectancy of student ability has a predictable influence upon the IQ attributed to that student. The question remains, however, as to whether such a small average difference in IQ scores has any educational significance. (Author/LH)",

Consideration is limited in this first report of a series of reports on these test findings to age and sex differentials. In addition to information from the distributions of raw scores, standard score equivalents and percentile ranks of these raw scores as derived from this highly representative national sample are included. Mean scores were found to be lower than those from Harris' normative data throughout the age range on the Man and Woman Scales for both boys and girls. The differences were found to become progressively greater with age. The  variability of scores within each year of age from the present study tends to be slightly less than that in Harris' normative groups, particularly on the drawings of a man by boys. Tables and appendices comprise more than half of the report. (Author/LH)",

Among the weaknesses cited in many measurement models are their untested assumptions of linear order and unidimensionality and their inability to generate non-associational relationships for a given set of empirical events. Tree theory is a measurement model whose intent is the generation and testing of specific logical relationships among empirical events. Tree theory has as its basic mathematical framework free Boolean algebra and employs the multinomial distribution as the basis for its statistical tests. The method of tree theory is described in terms of its Boolean algebraic and statistical procedures.  Applications are then cited for the fields of evaluation and developmental psychology.

        "description":"The usefulness of generalizability theory in assessing the reliability of classroom observation instruments is illustrated, with a new index of reliability, called the coefficient of generalizability, given as an index of how well one can generalize from the instrument to the universe score according to the conditions of observation. Data from an instrument assessing verbal behavior are reanalyzed using generalizability theory. Three raters observed two classes of five student teachers, and three facets (class, occasion, and rater) were specified for study. Analysis of variance yielded the components of variance due to these facets, and ratio of the estimated universe. Score variance to the observed-score variance was computed as the coefficient of generalizability. The possible  effect of various hypothetical conditions of observation on the coefficient of generalizability was considered. The results showed the coefficient of generalizability for one rater observing one class on one day was near zero for most of the summary variables for the instrument, but it increased when the number of observers and days of observation were increased. This was directly attributable to rater bias. Different observer training procedures might improve the usefulness of the instrument. (Author/LH)",

Monte Carlo methods were used to investigate the properties of standard estimators under each of the missing data models. Applying standard techniques which ignore the occurrence of missing observations may yield misleading conclusions. Some tests and estimators are fairly robust to the model for missing data, but others may be seriously affected. If the model for missing observations is complex, the sample information may be insufficient for adequate data analysis. This report is useful since the problem of missing data is recurrent in  educational research and may present serious difficulties even for simple problems. (Author/LH)",

Students who had either taken the course earlier or were concurrently enrolled in the class served as testing managers. Rooms were capable of supporting up to 250 students during class time for written exams. \"Permits\" to take a test have required the signatures of interviewing managers for admission into the testing room and permission to take a particular test. A testing manager's signature was then required for permission to continue through the next set of oral interviews with the interviewing manager. Written exams required a minimum of 90% mastery to pass and oral interviews required a minimum of 100% mastery. Failed exams could be taken at a later time without penalty. A  general trend toward maximum testing was shown until the fourth testing week. Following this peak, the trend reverses to form an inverted \"U\" shape. This effect conflicts with the expectation that a positively accelerated rate of test-taking would occur in a self-paced system of instruction. Current studies are investigating this effect.

Six groups of examinees were studied: black females, black males, fee-free females, fee-free males, white females, and white males. Significant interactions were found for every subsection of the ATGSB. Other conclusions include: more significant results from the race within female  comparisons than within male; neither sex was favored over the other in a uniform fashion; neither race was favored uniformly over the other; generally, the white group exhibited the lowest mean criterion scores for those who omit particular items, and the fee-free group exhibited the highest; and there appears to be more randomness of response in the fee-free group than in either of the regular center groups.

        "description":"Over a two-year period this study examined the relationship of two levels of supervision with both the job performance and weekly earnings of the hard-core unemployed (HCU). First- and second-level supervisors were measured on consideration, initiating structure, and social insight. After six months on the job the HCU's perceptions of their first-level supervisor's consideration and initiating structure behaviors were concurrently related to HCU job performance. After two years on the job, the weekly earnings of the HCU were strongly predicted by the six-month perceptions of both first-and second-level supervisory behavior on the consideration and initiating structure dimensions. With both job performance and weekly earnings, consideration was correlated positively and structure  negatively. These findings indicate that the relationships with supervisors, particularly early in the HCU's experience with an organization, is indeed related to job success. The positive relationship with consideration indicates that employer's attempts to be successful with the HCU should encourage supervisory styles which are supportive of HCU job efforts, while the negative relationship with structure suggests that supervisors should restrain from imposing structure on a culture which may be unaccustomed to external, rigid demands upon behavior.

Particular importance should be given to 1) selecting standardized norm-referenced tests of the appropriate difficulty in remedial programs; 2) selecting appropriate items for criterion-referenced tests, because their validity depended on accurate diagnostic testing; and 3) proper test administration procedures.

The use of testing jargon is minimal, and the concepts that are presented in technical terms are supplemented by listings in the glossary of key terms. Section I of the manual presents a brief discussion of test validity. Section II discusses  ways of selecting the sample of candidates to be studied, the choice of predictors and criteria, and the necessity for cross-validation. Section III describes the report that is sent to the institutions who use the computer programs on which this manual is based.

Focus was on the interactions which took place within the school buildings. Three data collection techniques were used: a visitor's survey, an afternoon and evening mapping survey (observational techniques), and the use of archival data, primarily administrative calendars. The data revealed not only a quantitative difference between school complexes, with greater participation seen in this district, but a qualitative difference as well in the visitors' purposes. Parents became more aware of their educational rights and  responsibilities, and community professionals were active in the schools. There were many ongoing activities and repeated instances of parents and teachers working together and recognizing the overlap in their goals for children. (Author/LH)",

A misconception regarding symmetry (one aspect of \"robustness\") is prevalent: that in nonsymmetric distributions the mean and median are always non-coincidental. It is to this fallacious point that the discussion is directed. A generally accepted index of skewness, as identified in mathematical statistics texts, is the third moment of a random variable around its mean, but this index, sometimes denoted as Beta , is really the average cubed linear z score for a distribution. Thus if the distribution is symmetric, Beta will be zero. By considering two nonsymmetric distributions, further discussion of the point is given. In conclusion, when there is concern about symmetry (for either pedagogical  or technical reasons), the data should be plotted and the distribution examined. This inspection technique along with Beta computation will result in a more valid conclusion regarding symmetry. (LH)",

Children's drawings of their classroom are evaluated as a form of communication. Data are reported which examine both the validity of regarding the drawings as projections of personality and the appropriateness of treating the &quot;classroom view&quot; as an instrument for examining the world of the child at school. Although there seems to be no generally accepted framework for inferring personality through art, its involvement in a process of communication is a constant feature. The Draw-A-Classroom Test may then be of  value to both the teacher and the child because of its potential communication value and its use as a non-coded informal procedure to increase rapport and understanding in the classroom.

The procedure involves the use of individualized data sets, computer prepared to student requests. A package of five programs is presented, which generates the data. They include programs for sampling from bivariate and multivariate normal distribution from independent normal distributions for T-tests and one-way analysis of variance cases, generation of data for rank order correlation, and for analysis of variance designs with two or three independent variables. A separate set of hand-outs to the paper illustrates the use of the program for generating data. (Author/LH)",

If this is true, it is particularly important to scrutinize educational programs in parochial schools in looking for examples of innovative approaches that might be of value in the public schools. The present study was initiated after it was learned that the pupils in an inner city parochial elementary school in Kansas City, Missouri were achieving at a much higher level than normally is attained in inner city schools in big city school districts. In addition to  learning something about the particular instructional approaches being implemented in this highly rated inner city parochial school, the purpose of the present study was to determine whether the apparent success of the school could be unequivocally attributed to its educational program as compared with other possible factors that might help to account for the ourstanding performance of its students. These factors include the social class of the family from which the students come, and the degree to which the parents of the students have attitudes supportive of education. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The development of the Congo's present formal education system began shortly after Protestant missionaries first entered the region in 1878. A distinct imprint had not been made on educational planning by the colonial government until problems compounded by the First World War demanded attention. A 20-year plan, which rested firmly and comfortably on the present system, was than jointly undertaken by Catholic missionaries and the government. The manpower requirements determined by a school's environment were to dictate the school's curricula. Profound educational reforms occurred after World War II. Educational policy became politically contentious and remained so during much of the last six years of colonial rule. The basic orientation remained education for colonial dependency.  Since there was only a period of 18 months--a period of frantic activity--between the decision for, and the accomplishment of, Congolese independence, there was little chance to make modifications which might have begun to decolonialize the system. A government planning office in the Ministry of Education was created in January, 1961, to tackle educational problems with the assistance of seven foreign advisors provided by UNESCO. What has been achieved since 1960 is significant, but since the Congo had never had a history of educational planning, educational planning per se remains to be accomplished. (Author/JM)",

Seven of these centers were operationally funded through carryover funds under the Tydings Amendment to Title I, E.S.E.A. The eighth center was operationally funded under Title III, E.S.E.A. The clientele could be described generally as acting out, underachieving inner-city youngsters in grades eight through 12, who were identified as having some latent degree of academic potential. Designed to provide these secondary school youngsters with nontraditional opportunities to complete their education, the overall program was evaluated in terms  of five specific objectives: academic performance, student behavioral change, the development of self-image, and work-study relationships. In terms of the stated criteria, no one objective was attained by the program as a whole. When the data were further analyzed on a team basis, in only one instance did a team attain the criterion level specified, and this on only one of the four test variables presented. It should be noted that the quality and quantity of the data submitted presented an unusual number of problems. (Author/JM)",

So as to demonstrate that secondary school compensatory education could continue to be effective, HH 100 became an ever-evolving program. This evolution occurred in terms of the articulation of language remediation, guidance services, and cultural exploration oriented around the several focal areas: (1) HH 100 was to provide an atmosphere in which experimentation, change, and program development could be accomplished in response to the particular learning problems of about 100 selected disadvantaged students; (2)  Students were to be helped to adjust not only to a regular school program but also to future program changes as these were to occur; (3) Remediation for specific learning deficiencies was to be provided, particularly in the basic skill areas of reading and language; (4) Available funds, although limited, were to be used to expand the experiential backgrounds of the students; and, (5) The program was necessarily aimed toward an improvement of student self-concept. Here the goal was to facilitate the development of higher educational, vocational, and life style goals. (Author/JM)",

So that decision-makers might know more about the effects of desegregation in Houston, the Houston Council on Human Relations has conducted a survey of 142 parents and 1105 students of schools with the sizable number of Mexican-Americans and blacks enrolled. The results of these surveys must be viewed in the context of two overriding circumstances that bear on student and parent attitudes toward desegregation: (1) the desegregation plan,  ordered by the Fifth Circuit Court, and (2) discipline in the schools. The results of these surveys imply that, for all else desegregation may have accomplished, it has not resulted in a meaningful contact between racial groups. Most students will prefer to attend a school where their own race predominates, and most parents do not believe desegregation has improved attitudes. The most unfortunate corollary is that mere numerical desegregation has not produced attitudinal desegregation. Groups in a desegregated school still keep to themselves. (Author/JM)",

And the very high ratio of black students to black teachers shows that Louisville trails all the other 11 systems in this study in the vital area of hiring black teachers. Four comparisons show just how far Louisville has fallen behind the rest. (1) In 1968, only three of the 11 city school systems included in this report had less segregation of elementary school students than Louisville. Today all have less segregation than Louisville. (2) In 1968, six systems had less segregation of junior high school students than Louisville. Today, all have less segregation than Louisville. (3) In 1968 three systems had less segregation of  senior high school students than Louisville. Today, only Atlanta has more segregation. (4) In 1968, only two systems had less segregation of elementary school teachers. Today, all have less segregation than Louisville. There is no evidence that the disparity in curriculum and programs that does exist in Louisville's segregated educational facilities today does not limit educational opportunities for black students.

On February 26, 1969 the Commission on Human Relations was designated by the Mayor as the Task Force to follow-up on the recommendations of the Civil Disorder Report. This report--two years after the Interim Report, three years after the Civil  Disorder Report--has been undertaken for two purposes. First, a sufficient period of time has elapsed to allow for most of the policy and program changes originally recommended to have been implemented. Secondly, the recently elected officials of the city government have expressed a need for examining the current status of social conditions in Kansas City in order to explore approaches to further improving those conditions.

Human beings, accustomed to far simpler social environments, have reacted to these inputs with habituation or adaptation. As these inputs increase in complexity and intensity, the process of habituation is likely to accelerate and the processes of adaptation must become more complex. Under such capacities the survival of man will increasingly depend on his capacity to use  his intellectual power to adapt to his changing environment as well as on his ability to adapt the environment to his special needs. Such capacities are likely to be the product of learning experiences designed to cultivate the mind and spirit of man in ways which combine competence in the use of knowledge, compassionate and empathetic appreciation of values, and mastery of selected skills. It is then these three which must comprise the dimensions of career education--education which prepares for continued progress in the life of a person. (Author/JM)",

Blacks cannot waste time in the search for ideological purity, closing out those who happen not to agree on every detail of a specific program. Blacks, together with the other oppressed groups of society, must recognize that the agenda is no less comprehensive than life itself. Education is the focus of this essay, but clearly there are myriad relationships between educational issues and those which are usually considered beyond the scope of a paper on education. Faced with the failure of the public schools and the concommitant continual hostility, insensitivity, or apathy, many blacks have decided that retreat and surrender or  individualistic effort are the only courses open. Equal opportunity in education will not become a reality overnight--even if funding increases drastically, even if the busing question is equitably resolved, even if teacher training is improved, even if admission to college is guaranteed to all who wish to apply.

This new concern has called attention to a large gap in the municipal policy-maker's information resources. Social scientists have employed a field method, participant-observation, that can potentially provide some of the types of information sought by the policy-maker. Four modifications of this method, intended to make this method more applicable to the needs of the policy-maker, are tested in this study: (1) several neighborhoods have to be studied simultaneously, using the same general research procedures; (2) more than one investigator should study the same area; an economic approach is to have a field worker operating  primarily in one area, and secondarily in another; (3) the participant-observer's work can be designed to emphasize the quantification of observable events; and, (4) small-area data, whether available through the census, special surveys, or municipal records, can be used in close conjunction with the field work. To test these four modifications, a field study of seven New York City neighborhoods was designed, with seven participant-observers working in these neighborhoods for a three-month period (the summer of 1970).

To find a qualified group of outstanding teachers of the disadvantaged, school systems or projects which in the view of responsible evaluators could be considered successful or promising in educating their problem-burdened populations were identified; and then were identified the specific school unit within those projects which best fulfilled the objectives of the programs.

        "description":"Despite the turbulence of the late sixties, attitudes of white Americans towards desegregation continued to change almost as though nothing was happening. Even though there is some evidence in the National Opinion Research Center data of a negative reaction to black militancy, this negative reaction has not impeded the increase in proportion of the American population willing to endorse pro-integration attitudes. The integration of transportation is virtually no longer an issue in the United States. However, integration of schools is still very much an issue, even though now in the North more than eight out of every 10 respondents endorse school integration. Since 1956, the proportion of Southern whites accepting school integration increased by 32 percentage points so that now  almost half of Southern whites are in favor of it, and almost three-quarters of the total national population believe in integrated schools. There is no evidence of greater opposition to integration on the part of the white ethnic. However, those &quot;threatened&quot; by blacks with respect to competition for housing and jobs do show a lower level of support for integration. If the extent to which Americans are now somewhat more likely to say that Negroes should not push where they are not wanted is a measure of negative response to black militancy, such a response is fairly evenly distributed in the Northern American population.

        "description":"The question of the evaluation of the impact of religious education is important for three reasons: (1) it is of fascinating theoretical interest to learn what are the effective means of transmitting fundamental values and what are the ineffective means; (2) it also seems appropriate to evaluate the contribution of religion to the improvement of the quality of urban life; and, (3) from the point of view of the churches, or indeed from the point of view of any human institution concerned with the transmission of fundamental values, there is excellent reason to ask whether one institutional transmission is more effective than another or whether one set of techniques promises greater payoff than another set of techniques. There are many obstacles to evaluation of religious education  and especially urban religious education. Very few educators are eager to have their work evaluated before the evaluation takes place, and even fewer are likely to be pleased with it once it occurs. Those who propose to evaluate religious education will encounter certain special problems. For example, religious educators in some circumstances are sacred persons, and any criticism of religious education runs the risk of being taken as a criticism of the sacred. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The data which has accumulated at the National Opinion Research Center over the past several years on the differential personality constellations of eight American white ethnic groups seemingly offer conclusive evidence that even when social class is held constant, immense differences of personalities have persisted among these groups. Among American ethnic groups there is a positive correlation between sympathy for racial integration and identification with and involvement in the ethnic community. There are four other major observations that can be made about the subject of diversity in the United States: (1) most Americans feel ambivalent about the fact of diversity and also about their own particular location in ethnic geography; (2) precisely because of this ambivalence about  American cultural pluralism, there has been in the last quarter of a century relatively little in the way of serious research on the subject despite the fact that the later stages of the acculturation of the immigrant groups should have been considered a fascinating subject for social science; (3) on the whole, American social and cultural pluralism has worked rather well; and, (4) for a number of different reasons, there has been a dramatic increase in interest in America's cultural heterogeneity in recent years.

        "description":"Despite all its flaws, the American experiment in pluralism has in many ways been an incredible success. We have been so busy criticizing our failures, so busy comparing ourselves negatively with Sweden and Great Britain that we have not bothered to ask how the United States of America has been able to absorb so much diversity without tearing itself apart. Neither the melting pot nor the cultural pluralism model is a particularly useful way of looking at American society: we have a society of ethnic groups. An ethnic group is defined as \"a collectivity based on presumed origin, which shapes to some extent the attitudes and behaviors of those who share that origin, and with which certain people may freely choose to identify at certain times of their lives.\" What then is to be said  about the current emphasis on \"militant ethnicity?\" First, the data we have collected at the National Opinion Research Center make it clear that the \"militant ethnic\" approach will only appeal to some people. Second, to the extent that the strategy of militant ethnicity presumes a \"pillarized\" society, it simply is inaccurate in its reading of the social structure of the U. S. The society would be pillarized only by such circumstances that the overwhelming majority of Italians, for example, thought of themselves as Italians most of the time and if being Italian became the almost exclusive identity which they chose to predicate of themselves.

        "description":"This paper begins with a very simple theoretical question: Do the cultural heritages of the Old World persist among children and grandchildren of the immigrants from the various European countries? Two ethnic groups--the Irish Catholics and the Italians--about whose country of origin there exists something of an anthropological and sociological literature are chosen for study. From this literature are derived a considerable number of hypotheses about their respective differences in the Anglo-Saxon American norm and from one another. To the extent that these hypotheses are sustained by the available evidence, one is able to assert that there is a persistence of diversity of cultural heritage within the United States, predictable on the basis of the culture of the countries of  origin. Also, the fact of ethnic cultural diversity in the United States is thereby established, a fact which many social scientists are not yet prepared to concede. An ethnic group is defined here as a large collectivity, based on presumed common origin, which is, at least on occasion, part of a self-definition of a person, and which also acts as a bearer of cultural traits. On the basis of the evidence presented, it can be safely said that it would be very difficult to understand the present behavior of American immigrant groups without knowing something of the cultural heritage from which the groups came.

Urban Arts is an arts school without walls for junior and senior high school students who leave their home schools part of every day during school hours to study with professional artists where the artists work. The participating arts agencies provide the learning environments, the artist-teachers, and the instructional design of the courses. A total of 626 students representing just about every social, economic, ethnic, and educational background in the city enrolled for courses during the school year; another 327 took summer school courses. The Bryant School Museum Program involved 600 students. Students  enrolled in 13 classes offered during the school year; nine during the summer program. Classes were ungraded and students received no grades but did get credit for successful completion of courses. Classes were taught by 32 artist-teachers. In general, they were talented and young not-yet-recognized artists, although there were exceptions. An Advisory Board of students, parents, and Minneapolis Schools' personnel was selected to help set policy for the program. It met four times during the year. (Author/JM)",

Based upon data collected during the 1971-72 school year, it considers pupil achievement and attitudes as well as the attitudes and perceptions of parents, the community, teachers, and administrators. It also includes an assessment of selected features of the World of Inquiry School. Generally, urban pupils enrolled at suburban schools did not achieve expected gains in reading or mathematics as measured by their performance on New York State Pupil Evaluation Program Tests. Teachers and administrators alike expressed concern about meeting the social, remedial, and instructional needs manifested by  the children. Excessive absenteeism also appeared to affect the achievement of some pupils. The World of Inquiry School, an experimental demonstration school, has pupil enrollment representative of the greater Rochester area. Generally, pupils at this school reflected higher achievement in reading and mathematics than counterparts citywide during 1971-72. Parents of urban children readily expressed their support for the transfer program, although the reason reported for this support was not the reduction of racial isolation but the obtaining of better educational opportunities for their children.

Furthermore, to the extent permitted by available funds, RRI has carried out research to identify desegregation policies under the control of educational authorities which have demonstrable positive or negative effects on the attitudes and achievement  of students. To date, a battery of non-cognitive measures for assessing the effectiveness of racial balance programs has been developed and field-tested, and the non-cognitive and cognitive effects of several important desegregation policies have been investigated. Policies which have been studied include those which result in variations of (1) racial balance across schools within a district as well as (2) across classes within a school, and (3) the proportion of black students per class. Preliminary evidence concerning teacher effects on students' racial attitudes has also been analyzed. (Author/JM)",

From the pilot study conducted with the principals and assistant principals in York County, Virginia, in the spring and summer of 1969, a picture of the principal adjusting to his situation was developed. The entire population of the principals of junior high, senior high, and combined schools in the State of Virginia was surveyed for the statewide study. This constituted a total of 481 principals in 134 school districts. Of the 481 mailed questionnaires, 326 were returned, or a 68 per cent return. (14 questionnaires were incomplete, and therefore not usable.) Respondents  represent 123 of the 134 school districts in the state. The survey contains data from 113 principals from rural areas, 56 from suburban areas, 46 from small towns, 36 from cities of less than 50,000 population, and 61 from cities of over 50,000. Of the 302 principals who gave the level of racial mixture in their schools, 115 were principals of schools that were 96-100 per cent white, and 11 were principals of schools of less than five per cent white. When the survey was conducted, only 165 of the 312 principals were principals of schools with more than a five per cent racial mixture. Of the 312 respondents in the survey, 82 per cent were white.

Instruction in reading and mathematics was based on the results of the testing by which children were selected for the program, and the diagnostic reading and mathematics tests given at the start of the program. The program for each week was centered on a theme. Field trips provided the children with needed experiential background and concept development. The theme gave the week's work a focus, evidently maintained pupil interest and motivation, and was the source of content through which reading and  mathematics skills could be developed. As needed, other content was brought in to supplement the theme. Another procedure effectively used at the four schools was the establishment of centers in the classroom for individualizing work on specific topics in reading and mathematics. The work in academic areas was supplemented by work in art and physical education. The children also received service in speech therapy and guidance. Individual and group guidance sessions were carried out for children requiring this support. Testing was also an available service. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Data for this study were gathered as part of a national survey of reading activities of adults. The study was conducted by the Response Analysis Corporation of Princeton, N.J. A national probability sample of 5,067 adults, age 16 or older, were interviewed in their homes and asked about all the printed matter they had read or looked at the previous day--this sample representing 69 percent of the total number of adults who were interviewed. Four subsamples were also examined: blacks, whites, low-income blacks, and low-income whites. A comparison of the reading habits of blacks and whites in the general population indicates that the proportion of white readers is greater than that of black readers in every type of reading material. There is a larger racial difference in newspaper  reading than in any other form of reading; this difference exists between all blacks and whites as well as between blacks and whites who are poor. The results of the study indicate that newspapers are not reaching a very large proportion of blacks, especially poor blacks. Even among those blacks who do read newspapers, certain sections such as editorials, women's and society pages, and regular advertisements are read considerably less frequently than by whites. It is speculated that newspapers do not respond to blacks' needs and concerns to the extent that is done by other printed media such as books and magazines. (Author)",

The data for the study were gathered by questionnaire administered in personal interviews to a six percent sample of California Title I projects, enrolling ten percent of California Title I students. All projects in the study used the same performance measure, the Stanford Reading Test. Information was gathered and used for pupils in four elementary grades. The instructional variable which is most consistently and dependably related to reading gains was that for the trained reading specialist. Specialist instruction was  the only school input related to reading performance in the third grade considered separately, with the strength of the relationship even stronger in that grade than in the four pooled grades. While the variables for instruction by professionals were less statistically significant, they showed signs of having some importance. Of the variables constructed to measure planning and coordination, only that for hours of planning itself was related to performance. (Author/JM)",

This study had two main goals: (a) instrument development; and (b) the gathering of data on subjective culture--that is, the typical ways in which the samples tested perceive their social environment. To reach these goals, it was desirable that as many disparate samples as possible should be used. It was possible to obtain four geographically and demographically distinct samples: (1) white female college students, who filled out the questionnaire as part of a course requirement in an introductory psychology course; (2) black working-class and  lower-class high school boys from the Chicago Heights area; (3) white high school boys, working-class and lower class, and some Spanish speaking adult males from Chicago Heights; and, (4) black adult subjects, classified as &quot;hardcore unemployed,&quot; from St. Louis, Missouri. Two open-ended elicitation questionnaires were prepared. The instructions to the subjects were &quot;translated&quot; by five black university students into &quot;Black English&quot; and back into standard English to insure that they would be understood by all subjects.

The goal of the program is to improve the language skills, self-concept, and school adjustment of disadvantaged students having no serious emotional problems, of average intelligence, and with one to three years' reading retardation. Children are selected from eight feeder schools on the basis of these criteria. A team of six teachers and a guidance counselor run the program in a cluster of rooms in the Hartford Public High School. Since the students are specially selected, have their own unique curriculum, and are separated from the other ninth-grade students in the high school, the  program has a school-within-a-school atmosphere. Upon successful completion of a year in the program, the HH100 students are transferred to the regular tenth-grade school program. The HH100 program is characterized by small classes, individualized instruction, intensive counseling services, and remedial language instruction integrated within a special ninth-grade curriculum. As an adjunct to the instructional program, a program of cultural activities, civic trips, and guest speakers is provided. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The Fernald School's program of remedial instruction for disadvantaged children began in 1966. As a facility of the Psychology Department at the University of California at Los Angeles, the school has been concerned since its founding in 1921 with the diagnosis and treatment of learning disorders, particularly those not due to mental retardation or severe neurological or emotional pathology. Their program for disadvantaged children described in this booklet, however, represents a departure from the school's previous restriction to clients from families that could afford tuition. Children from grades two through 11 are served by the program. Students selected are male, of average intelligence, and at least one and one-half years retarded in basic school skills. The disadvantaged  students in the program are drawn from the mid-city area of Los Angeles. Two-thirds of the disadvantaged students are black, and the remaining one-third are Mexican-American or white. During the first academic year, 60 children were in the program; during each of the following two years, there were 80 students. The three factors that Fernald staff members see as differentiating the experience of students at Fernald from that at other schools are: (1) the degree to which the program is individualized; (2) the low student-teacher ratio; and, (3) the total-school environment, which results from these and other special characteristics.

The objectives of the school year program are: to increase the number of pupils completing college preparatory requirements and being admitted to college; to improve the quality of academic work of pupils in the program; and to improve pupils' attitudes toward education, resulting in regular school and class attendance and punctuality. The objectives of the College Bound summer program are: to raise the ability  levels of incoming students in English, mathematics, and foreign languages; to provide a transition between junior high school and high school; to provide motivation for learning; to improve study skills; to help resolve individual and home difficulties affecting learning; to add to cultural background; and to provide a transition between high school and college for a small number of specially identified College Bound graduates. The school year program is presently serving approximately 10,250 pupils, while the summer program serves approximately 2,000 College Bound students. (Author/JM)",

The primary objective of the program was to improve the motivation and achievement of disadvantaged students by providing special mathematics and reading instruction in combination with field trips and other activities designed to demonstrate the relevance of classroom learning to the solution of real-world problems. A second wave of eighth graders entered the program in 1968, and the first-year students went on to a newly developed ninth-grade R-3 curriculum, the three R's signifying student readiness, subject relevance, and learning reinforcement. In 1969, new State  regulations required the project to include the entire seventh-grade population of the school in the program. The program was forced to drop the eighth- and ninth-grade program temporarily in order to handle the new and larger seventh-grade service group. Plans were made to reexpand the R-3 program to the eighth and ninth grades as the seventh graders progressed through those grades in succeeding years. The 1970-71 program included all 240 eighth-grade students, and the 1971-72 program continues the program for these students in the ninth grade. (Author/JM)",

To accomplish this, four design and evaluation conferences were held to plan clinical experiences for prospective teachers and to develop a student manual of clinical experiences. Also, a pilot study was conducted to determine the feasibility of incorporating the clinical experiences in vocational teacher education at three universities each using different plans. Temple University integrated clinical experiences into the existing methods courses; Southern Illinois developed a new clinical experiences course; and Colorado State University provided clinical and field  experiences during the student teaching quarter. A result of the study was a self-contained manual of 20 clinical experiences to be used in preparing more effective teachers of disadvantaged youth. The manual can be easily incorporated into existing vocational teacher-training programs, and should result in more student teachers wanting to teach the disadvantaged, and make them more effective in doing so. The five groups of experiences in the manual familiarize the student teacher with the disadvantaged student, the poverty community, and the makeup of a typical high school in a disadvantaged community.

Data were collected by means of interviews for all 10 air pollution control areas in Ohio, eight wastewater and water treatment facilities for Ohio cities with a population under 100,000, and eight wastewater and water treatment facilities for Ohio cities with a population over 100,000. Data were collected by mail questionnaire for 200 randomly selected wastewater and water treatment facilities for Ohio cities with a population under 100,000. An anticipated increase of 109 persons (a 31 percent increase) in all wastewater  treatment positions from 1971 to 1974 was reported. An increase of 156 persons (a 12 percent increase) is expected from 1971 to 1974 in water treatment positions, and a 119 percent increase (152 persons) is anticipated from 1971 to 1974 in air pollution control positions. These increased personnel needs justify the development of training programs in environmental management occupations. A proposed curriculum for a 2-year program in this area is included. Numerous tables present the data. (AG)",

These data serve as a baseline for the CCEM installation efforts, and this initial survey is reported to provide more effective program planning information to the CCEM project staff. Findings from the survey showed that pupils (Grades 4-6 and 7-12), staff, and parents all had extremely positive attitudes toward career education, implying that a curriculum change in the direction of career education would probably be welcomed. There was one potential problem in the career education program: the granting of high school  course credit for work experience. The survey showed that most of the parents did not approve of course credit for any of the nine job possibilities listed, but high school students wanted credit for two of the jobs and the staff members would grant credit for all nine. However, there was close agreement among the students, their teachers, and their parents about the value of career education and about their generally positive attitudes toward it. A second report will be made after June 1973 to compare the same populations and to identify changes in attitudes toward career education. (MF)",

Participants included 50 2-year college faculty members who were involved with business technology and engineering technology students. Learning and developing new teaching techniques by understanding the problems, viewpoints, and aspirations of minority youth students, particularly Negro and Puerto Rican, was the major emphasis. The theme of &quot;open admissions&quot; was focused on by means of various presentations during the  entire summer institute. Participants developed individual demonstration projects which were carried out during the fall 1971 semester and summarized in reports. A series of separate group meetings were held, and at the final meeting after separate morning sessions, the entire group reassembled for a summary and critique session.

Over 17,500 applicants to the full-time day programs offered in 24 Minnesota Area Vocational-Technical Schools were tested with a battery of five standardized vocational, personality, and aptitude tests and a personal data sheet in order to determine significant individual differences among those who are accepted into these schools, begin related employment, and achieve successful vocational adjustment, and those who do not. From these data bases, three instruments proved most useful for predicting success for vocational students: (1) the Minnesota Vocational Interest  Inventory, (2) the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire, and (3) the Minnesota Importance Questionnaire. Other success criteria were inconsistent, although the existence of significant differences among male and female groups and those successful in different occupations was documented from pre-enrollment test data.

Personal interviews with community leaders, agency representatives, and major employers in the four study communities were conducted by the author, using the key informant technique with 84 community leaders in order to gather information about the manpower development process from their perspectives. This case study approach was found to be useful in studying the interrelationships between job creation, job training, and placement efforts in the community context. The two communities with the largest employment levels also  were characterized by greater ease of placement and greater reported use of training agencies by employers. Efforts to coordinate job training programs were found in all but one city. Job training diversity varied from city to city. The overlapping nature of leadership in some areas made program coordination easier. A series of 10 recommendations points up changes needed in current manpower development practices, specifically those involving vocational and technical education. (AG)",

Implementation of the new or revised plans of occupational guidance and counseling in participants' schools during the 1971-72 school term was the second phase. Important long-range goals were to help students improve their knowledge and understanding of vocational education and their ability to make wise career  decisions. As part of the on-site experience, counselors observed vocational education teachers instructing students, heard presentations by the teachers designed to familiarize counselors with a variety of curricular activities performed in the vocational training areas and with the aptitudes students need for success, and participated in simulated work tasks. Each counselor participated in at least 15 of these sessions, known as Work Sample Exposures.

        "description":"Using an econometric model of four simultaneous equations for State cross-sectional data and of two equations for city cross-sections, the following determinants were estimated: (1) current spending on education, (2) the ratio of vocational to current educational expenditures, (3) the over-all enrollment rate in public schools, and (4) the percentage of publicly enrolled students in vocational programs. Interrelationships among these variables are significant. Particularly, current spending per student and over-all enrollments interact so that attempts to increase instructional resources available to each pupil are frustrated by changes in enrollments. In addition to feedbacks among these endogenous variables, influences of 26 exogenous variables, including proxies for racial,  religious, occupational, and industry mixes were examined. These are notable determinants of spending per student or enrollment rates, as are other variables representing factors that help to establish demand for educational services. Important variables in this latter category are income levels, income distribution, adult educational attainments, and competing claims on public resources. An appreciable impact of State and Federal educational aid is also present. Finally, instructional costs affect educational spending per pupil, but putative effects of higher salaries are diluted possibly by scale economies to districts, factor substitutions, or changes in teacher-student ratios.

        "description":"To evaluate the adequacy of a home economist assistant curriculum compared to the skills, knowledges, and attitudes needed for entry employment in the auxiliary home economics field, 50 employers were personally interviewed, and the employers and 31 graduates were surveyed by mail. The mailed questionnaire requested information regarding the importance of knowledge in certain subject matter areas, desired job skills, and job responsibilities. Results of the surveys indicated that students need maturity and work experience in addition to a well-rounded vocational home economics education background. Employers indicated that students need to be taught how to work, to accept responsibility, and to work with different types of people. Over 80 percent of the graduates reported working  in jobs directly related to their major field, which include food and non-food related positions, and 90 percent are experiencing job satisfaction with their present employment. A major recommendation stemming from the results is that the length of the program should be extended from a year-long course to a 1 1/2- or 2-year program which includes work experience as a requirement.

Department of Labor, was designed to stimulate permanent employment opportunities for the disadvantaged and to encourage the upgrading of existing low-paid workers in agencies receiving Federal grants-in-aid. In July 1970, grants totaling $12 million were allocated to 127 grant-in-aid recipients in 43 States for the projected entry employment and training of 3,520 disadvantaged and for the training and upgrading of 2,254 existing low-paid workers. This report represents an analysis of the 117 projects that became operational and includes a description of such program components as: (1) program administration, (2) problems  encountered by project directors and enrollees, (3) benefits of the program with respect to administration, flexibility and objectivity, communication, and career development, (4) recruitment and selection, (5) orientation program, (6) job development, and (7) education and training. In general, program success varied directly with the style of supervision employed. It was found that contemporary supervisory styles were closely associated with the successful projects, while traditional supervisory practices were more closely associated with the less successful ones.

Evaluation was based on changes in grades, attendance, and attitudes of students as compared with the previous school year when the new coordinated program was not in effect. The CVAE program grew out of two previous vocational programs, one a state training plan for disadvantaged students and the other developed in Forsyth County to combat their high dropout rate, negative student attitudes, and student frustrations and lack of basic skills. These two plans were evaluated and their most advantageous aspects combined into one program, CVAE, initiated throughout the state in the 1970-71 school year. This combined  program was designed to help reduce the high dropout rate in Georgia by offering the students realistic academic and vocational instruction with work experience and individual attention. Data were collected through visits with school coordinators and random sampling of students. Conclusions from the survey data indicated that the new program appeared to be accomplishing its objectives and that its real potential was encouraging. Additional program studies and expansion of programs were recommended. (MF)",

This was accomplished through a number of experiences and activities developed in five classroom units and three counseling procedures. The classroom units focused on distribution, manufacturing, office, health service, and general service occupations, while the vocational counseling techniques were concerned with self-concepts, interests, and the decision making process. Early in the project, a broad-based advisory committee representing the major industries and employers in Hartford was established. The teachers and counselors  participating in the project and the advisory committee formed six sub-committees, and each sub-committee developed a unit covering their particular occupational cluster. The project did not accomplish all its goals but a beginning was made. In subsequent years the project will be projected down into the elementary grades and up into the secondary schools with the aim of developing a comprehensive K-12 program. (SB)",

The subjects were interviewed for the first time in the summer of 1966 when they were between 45 and 59 years of age. Twelve months later the sample was reinterviewed. Data from these two surveys are presented in two earlier monographs (ED 026 525 and ED 039 331). The present report utilizes data collected by means of a mail questionnaire in mid-1968 and by personal reinterviews with the sample in mid-1969, which helped to describe the magnitude and patterns of change in the status of the respondents that have occurred over the first 3 years of the study and to identify some of the causes and consequences of these changes. As in the two previous  reports, analysis is based exclusively on cross-tabulations of the data. The five chapters of the report are: (1) Changes in Personal and Family Characteristics, (2) Longitudinal Measures of Labor Force Participation and Unemployment, (3) Job Changes, (4) Collective Bargaining Coverage and Hourly Rate of Pay, and (5) Summary and Conclusions.

This publication reports the evaluation of a World of Manufacturing program implemented into the Pontiac School District during the 1970-1971 school year. During the summer of 1970, teachers who were to be responsible for implementing the program attended inservice training session at Ohio State University. The project was then undertaken in five Pontiac junior high schools, where 300 seventh, eighth, and ninth graders participated in the 2-semester course. Evaluation of the program was accomplished through pre- and post-program administration of an achievement test developed for the World of Manufacturing  program. Analysis of the achievement test results indicated significant gains in post-test performance for seventh and eighth graders but loss or lack of gain for ninth graders. Also, a higher number of correct responses were obtained on 37 of the 50 items when the pre- and post-test results were compared. These two findings indicate that the program met its objectives related to achievement, but the significance of these results with respect to education is questionable.

Findings of the study supported three conclusions that the use of a proceduralized job guide approach would: (1) increase the number and type of challenging job positions available to relatively unskilled students, (2) enable a broader spectrum of relatively unskilled students to participate in work experience programs, and (3) modify the employer's perception that relatively unskilled students cannot meet the requirements for selected job positions.

The following 2-year demonstration project was designed to train underemployed workers in area vocational schools for existing jobs and to update the preparation of vocational and technical teachers. The teacher training program became a regular University of Tennessee program that continued to use TAT facilities for course credit. The third project, beginning in 1969, concentrated on training disadvantaged persons with a  training model developed for use in industrial facilities. The fourth developmental stage, beginning in 1972, involved an assessment of all past TAT experience, including a survey of post-placement TAT graduates, and inauguration of a regional utilization network workshop to explore new ways of applying TAT's research in manpower development skills.

The school-based Comprehensive Career Education Model(CCEM) is being developed in six local school districts, and its current objective is to develop and test a career education system (K-12) in these districts. During the 1972-73 school year, it is anticipated that 85,000 students at all grade levels will be exposed to approximately 100 curriculum units. The employer-based model is designed as an out-of-school alternative to career education for students aged 13-18. The goal of the home community-based model is to offer a career-oriented educational program to out-of-school youth and  adults who want additional learning opportunities. This career-oriented program will be strongly supported by career development centers located in the community. The residential-based model is being designed to offer education as well as family life, community, health, and economic development services to disadvantaged individuals and families drawn from rural areas. Some of the implications of these models are discussed. (SB)",

The present vocational education system is an umbrella for a wide variety of programs, which have as a common denominator their eligibility for Federal support through the different vocational education acts and amendments. These programs usually supply students with a marketable skill while providing them with a basic knowledge of the humanities and may include training in homemaking skills and  consumer education. On-the-job training, apprenticeships, community colleges, and other programs supplement vocational education curriculums offered in public schools. In fiscal 1970, only one sixth of the total government expenditures for vocational education represented Federal funds, showing that Federal support is too small a percentage of the total for the Federal Government to be a primary change agent within vocational education.

A sequential approach features innovative teaching techniques, such as job simulations, which utilize role playing, resource speakers, occupational songs and games, and self-awareness activities. Also included are skill training programs in nine specific occupational areas, an open-ended continuing education program, and both general  and specific career exploration activities. Inservice teacher training programs, a school-community public relation program, decision-making activities, and the fused curriculum increased student interest, motivation, and program relevance. Continuation of the program was recommended. Extensive resource materials are included, as well as various suggestions for program improvement. (AG)",

S. Office of Education at the request of the National Advisory Council on Vocational Education. The report contains both a summary of findings for the 20 cities (Volume I) and a series of individual city reports (Volume II). Limited to programs which are publicly funded and provide formal classrooms with institutional training, this study covers over 390,000 enrollees, often served by vocational skill centers. The data suggest: (1) Federally funded facilities operated by public education systems could provide opportunities for skill training for those not otherwise served; (2) A  need exists for increased administrative coordination; (3) Some overlap between educational institutions and manpower agencies is apparent; (4) The existence of substantial gaps for out-of-school groups, especially teenagers can be seen; (5) Whites were concentrated in post-secondary institutions, while the enrollment of blacks was distributed equally; and (6) Frequent duplications of training for occupations for which there is a surplus of workers need improved program coordination and better planning in relationship to the labor market, necessitating training services for program administrators and the provision of technical assistance. Numerous tables present the data. (Author/AG)",

However, there are few programs for the emotionally disturbed, and the most neglected of all may be the children of migrant families.

Railroad passenger traffic declined, while freight traffic rose sharply from 1961 through 1969. Output per man-hour has increased  6 percent annually over the last decade, and other productivity measures have shown gains. Although employment levels have declined, opportunities for women, minority groups, professionals, and specialized manpower remain good.

Two hundred 10th grade students from four Washington, D. C. schools were randomly divided into a control and an experimental population. The control population remained in the regular curriculum, while the experimental population received one week's training in achievement motivation simulations. The sample population was divided by schools into two equal experimental and control groups. All 200 participants were pre- and post-tested with the Vocational Development Inventory, the Semantic Differential, and the Classroom Climate Scale one month before and one month after the simulation. Statistically significant differences  between treatment and control groups in three out of four schools demonstrated that vocational maturity increased as a result of the treatment. No statistical effect on other variables relating to school and vocational attitudes was achieved by the treatment.

Emphasized are possible implications for public policy and for the way in which the labor market behavior of adult women is viewed. The labor force participation rate of white women in the group increased from 47.4 to 51.0 percent, while the rate for black women remained steady at 67.4 percent. There was a decrease of 11 percentage points in labor force participation by white women with no children under the age of  six in 1967 but with at least one child under six in 1969, which shows the deterrent effect of young children on mothers' labor force participation. A favorable demand for well-trained women is reflected in positive relationships between the labor force participation rate, rate of pay, and educational attainment. Health, marital status, and job satisfaction are other variables considered. Factors associated with the job changes of about 20 percent of the white women and 25 percent of the black women from 1967 to 1969 are discussed.

Of 11 significant discriminators among the 20 independent variables considered, statistical analysis identified \"grade point average\" and \"absenteeism\" as unique significant predictors of the tendency to drop out of the vocational curriculum. Only \"absenteeism\" was a unique significant predictor of the dropout status of those in the non-vocational curriculum. The non-vocational dropouts and the vocational retainers revealed  similar characteristics on cognitive variables. In contrast, the vocational dropouts and the non-vocational retainers show similar characteristics on socio-affective variables. Since both cultural factors and a negative overt response to the school envrionment are related to dropout proneness, a coordinated community effort is needed to resolve this problem. Because the dropout predictability for the non-vocational sample was half that of the vocational sample, vocational dropouts should be identified and prevented earlier in their programs.

Curricular and instructional plans were developed by 20 teachers for the purpose of furthering vocational understandings among their students. These teachers now realize that blue-collar jobs and other work held in low esteem are essential to our society, and they are better prepared to aid their pupils in making vocational choices. Pre- and post-testing, resource persons, field trips, and self-analysis were techniques employed in developing and evaluating teachers' attitudes towards vocations as a result of a 5-week summer workshop at Miami University, Oxford, Ohio. The positive response  of the participants both to their workshop experiences and to the testing of self-developed materials in their classes demonstrated the effectiveness of the program .

It was found that the movers improved their employment status, their occupational status, and their income after the move as compared with their economic status prior to the move and as compared with a similar before-after follow-up of the nonmover comparison group. Rough cost-benefit approximations indicate that the relocation subsidy was a sound economic investment. However, the &quot;relocatees&quot; expressed dissatisfaction with a number of non-economic aspects of their new environment, and almost 20 percent had returned to their home area within 6  months of their relocation. It is recommended that government-sponsored mobility projects be expanded, but that greater emphasis be given to counseling and other supportive services. (Author/AG)",

In order to answer 11 questions focusing on task performance frequency and importance, career ladders, job clusters, and educational requirements, demand questionnaires were mailed to 1,588 nuclear licensee firms. Positive responses were received from 418 establishments, from which a sample of 17 firms was chosen. A task analysis personal interview instrument was developed by the Southern Interstate Nuclear Board and administered to 53 supervisors reporting for 20 job titles covering 475 technicians. Emphasizing career  ladder development within the nuclear industry, and the development of a curriculum guide for nuclear technician training institutes in the region, it was concluded that: (1) The substantially different health-related technician job cluster requires special training, (2) Secondary and post-secondary curriculums should be developed, (3) Task similarities may require common elements in their preparation, (4) Career ladders can be developed, and (5) Further task analyses should be conducted.

Supplemented by a $1.7 million grant in October 1971, the USOE selected six Local Education Agencies from 53 candidates, providing each with a CVTE resident project team to offer technical assistance, on-site  consultation and a direct liaison with CVTE, which is accountable to the USOE for the entire program and funds expended. The CCEM project identified: (1) eight conceptual elements, (2) eight student learning objectives, and (3) a matrix, or developmental model, with 32 themes and 1,477 sequential goals extending across all grade levels. Operational and evaluation procedures for CCEM are delineated, and program developments are specified. (AG)",

This paper is designed to help the professional 4-H adult worker improve his role as a socialization agent. Socialization, the process by which a person learns the ways of the group in order to function within it, is viewed from the perspective of the individual and society. Among society's socialization agents are the family, the peer group, and the school; the adult agent learns to work within the framework of these influences. Some of the difficulties confronting the adult socialization agent are changing expectations and roles, the impact of  technology, lack of cooperation, and less of adult influence. Better recruitment and training techniques are suggested, as are planning, implementation, and evaluation of programs. A bibliography is included. (RS)",

A Marriage Role Expectation Inventory of 37 statements was given to groups of women. The groups included professional and subprofessional Headstart personnel, members of Extension Clubs, parents of Headstart students, and limited-income women enrolled in Office of Economic Opportunity programs. Scores were tabulated according to income, education, and age on a traditional versus equalitarian scale. The results indicated that higher income levels do not mean more equalitarian attitudes about the roles of men and women in marriage; women from the lowest income groups were not more traditionally inclined. The  amount of formal education had a positive relation to equalitarian concepts with women with elementary or less education seeming more traditional and valuing manual homemaking skills. College educated women attached less importance to homemaking skills. They attached more value to kindness in husbands, while less educated women attached greater importance to ambition and being a provider. (RS)",

The Adult Basic Education in Corrections System is defined in terms of its two basic elements: personnel training and model implementation. The adult basic education in corrections conceptual model is presented. The implementation of the conceptual model in 115 delivery systems is described. The need for personnel training at regional and national levels as well as preservice and inservice training in  institutions and agencies is stressed. The need for continued use of the conceptual model in creating delivery system designs and the concommitant need for initiation and operation of the systems in correctional institutions are emphasized.

Model development was accomplished through three activities: (1) needs assessment, (2) goals definition, and (3) model synthesis. Assessment of needs for adult basic education in corrections was accomplished by survey of institutions to determine discrepancies between existing programs and ideal programs. Goals of adult basic education in corrections were defined in a National Work Conference. A Model of Adult Basic Education in Corrections was synthesized from two independently developed models. Training of selected leaders in corrections in adult basic education was accomplished  in two 24-day seminars. The training program aims called for development of knowledge and skills and fostering of positive attitudes relating to adult education in corrections. Results of pre- and post-tests against program objectives indicate that the aims were achieved at criterion levels. (Author)",

Forty dyadic groups were composed which ranged from compatibility to incompatibility through all possible combinations on the 3 channels. The groups tested the hypothesis that there would be a linear relationship between intra-group compatibility and a set of 5 dependent variables. Each of the dyads was scheduled for a half-hour discussion period in which members worked together to solve a case study problem. Following the discussion sessions, each member completed a post-meeting test instrument. Results of 3 of the linear relationships were in the predicted direction; the fourth set of data provided conflictual results; and the fifth set of data gave results  not supportive of the theory.

Thirty Berea College Students who were given initial and inservice training in community relations and in methods and materials for teaching adults worked in 21 community locations. Emphasis was placed on recruitment of adult students and on the development of person-to-person relationships between teachers and students. Teaching was done in small groups, individual tutoring in homes, and using educational television, and was planned to be responsive to the needs of the participants. From August 1971 to August 1972 over 300 persons participated. Significant progress was made in subjects most often studied;  during the spring term 60% of those studying mathematics advanced a year or more. Thirteen participants passed the GED test; 5 participants have been accepted by colleges and 4 are currently enrolled. The results show that functional illiterates and educational dropouts can be interested in education, that progress can be made by taking educational programs to the people, and that mature college students can be effective teachers.

Results indicate that 4% of the population over 16 suffers serious deficiencies in functional reading ability; another 11% failed on more than 10% of the test items. One percent of the sample was totally illiterate. The young (16 year olds) and the old (over 50) scored significantly lower than other age groups. A positive correlation appeared between income and reading ability; the  scores of these with incomes under $5,000 were lower than those with higher incomes. Educational level appears to be the factor most closely related to test scores. Scores were higher in the Midwest and West and lowest in the East; cities and rural areas contain the largest number of people with reading problems. Blacks did more poorly than whites on the test because of lower educational backgrounds. (RS)",

The average range of functional illiteracy for rural dwellers was 4-16%; the percentage of city residents with functional illiteracy was 4-13%. Fewer persons residing in small towns and cities had difficulty reading forms and suburban residents filled out the forms most easily. The South had the highest range of functional illiteracy (4-15%), and people in the West tended to have fewer reading deficiencies than those in other areas. Practical literacy appears to  decrease in direct proportion to income in the United States. The age group from 16 to 24 proved the most literate and the oldest (50 and over) were the most deficient in reading ability. Women had fewer deficiencies than men. The literacy range of immigrants to the United States was 7-16% compared to a range of 3-13% for the native-born. Reading ability increased in direct proportion to years of education. (RS)",

Three of the stories were written at different levels of difficulty according to the Automated Readability Index (ARI). The stories were presented to a predominately black high school remedial reading class where the 2 &quot;easier&quot; versions were more readily comprehended than was the more difficult version. Five of the tape-recorded stories were compiled in a booklet &quot;Big Red and Other Adult Stories.&quot; The book was given to 2 groups for evaluation: graduate students in reading and a predominately black group of trainees for a federal project. Both groups rated the stories of high interest  value for black adults; authentic, and suitable for use as instructional material. (Author/RS)",

Results indicate that the Tiffin Lawshe test can be used by the supermarket industry in selection of persons for training programs; a questionnaire gave an adequate  indication of leadership ability; education did influence the test scores; and the test and questionnaire did not take personality, attitudes and goals into consideration. However, the Extension Division of the University could coordinate industry training programs, and one can use scientific principles to arrive at sound, useful, and pertinent information. (RS)",

In addition, the trainer incorporates both actual and mockup instruments that enable the trainee to practice equipment operation procedures and malfunction  isolation and correction.

        "description":"A concept of \"learning\" generally accepted today is that of a lasting change of behavior as a result of experience. The experience itself involves such things as the gathering of information and the acquiring of intellectual and social skills whereby to put this information to work for whatever purpose the learner has in mind. The concept of lifelong learning generally embraces both learning by chance and learning by design, and it has three dimensions--perpendicular, horizontal, and depth. The perpendicular includes formal learning throughout the life-span, from nursery school through post-doctoral work. The horizontal evisages breaking through the artificial barriers surrounding a field of study to unite with other fields in a cross-disciplinary pattern. The third dimension,  depth, transcends all formal approaches to reach almost a metaphysic. One problem affecting lifelong learning is the threat of compulsion created through legislation and social pressure, aiming to transform lifelong learning into lifelong schooling. Instead of participating in learning, the individual may find himself undergoing compulsory adult education which would undermine the humanistic element. Another problem is the tendency to treat the concept of lifelong learning as a kind of popular cliche or slogan to be used to promote adult education offerings. A strategy proposed to foster lifelong learning is to work through existing schools and universities to diffuse the concept as widely as possible to educators and students alike. Adult educators need to learn to use the media  consistently and efficiently and help adults acquire the skills needed to embark on their own styles of lifelong learning. (Author/CK)",

It is pointed out that change characterizes rural Vermont and that a need for a balanced environment is slowly being recognized. The program operates as follows: (1) An aide visits a family, gets a picture of the situation; (2) The aide initiates preliminary assistance with the family; (3) Aide and counselor together clarify family health situation; (4) The farm aide works with the family on farm and home problems that have come to the surface; and (5) Followup is continued with the family. Three basic guidelines have regulated the enrollment and  acceptance of cases: (1) The family must have a net annual income of less than $2000; (2) It must have relation to agriculture; (3) A member of the family must have an identified health problem. Results were two broad areas of project action and accomplishment: (1) the public type of assistance in which there was work with agencies and officials relevant to the development of policies and program related to the concerns of disadvantaged families; (2) the major work of the project which consisted of assistance provided and accomplishments of the individual families. It is concluded that the three factors contributing to the success of the project were: (1) the Extension-Vocational Rehabilitation team approach, (2) the high commitment and quality of staff in serving rural families, and (3)  the practical supervision.

        "description":"A speech on the main purpose of the university, particularly with respect to its relation to the working class, is presented. It is pointed out that this purpose should be to serve the community in the true sense of the word. In Africa, today, there is a race between education and economic and social catastrophe. The training function of universities with particular reference to updating and upgrading skills and knowledge of the entire national work force at all levels is important. Problems to be solved by the university include: (1) increasing production in all economic sectors; (2) establishing good trade union organizations, (3) cultivating a sense of nationalism, (4) cultivating a greater sense of respect for traditions and culture, (5) producing &quot;free&quot; citizens who know and  can judge for themselves about political and economic systems and issues, and (6) effecting social change without a breakdown. An important function of the university is that of training the trainers. In addition, in many African countries, books and publications which are geared to local conditions, and more importantly, to labor education and industrial relations in Africa are in very short supply. It is therefore part of the responsibilities of African universities to develop suitable primers, textbooks and other literature at various levels of education. Possible barriers that might make it difficult or impossible for the universities to perform their role in workers' education are listed. These include inadequate financial support, poor physical facilities, and undue government  interference. (Author/CK)",

These factors are, among other things, creating and widening what is most commonly called the \"Generation Gap.\" It should be apparent, therefore, that those issues which are most appropriate to the training of youth workers, who deal with  adjudicated delinquents, have much broader implications for the areas which involve society's relationship and focus on all youth.

For 14 pairs the \"high\" member was female; in 14 pairs the \"high\" member was male. In the social situation \"high\" males lowered their levels of performance only slightly whereas there was a highly significant tendency for girls to depress their performance. In half the dyads in which the girl was from the \"high\" quartile she actually performed more poorly than the \"low\" boy. Such a reversal occurred in only one of the fourteen pairs with an initially \"high\" male. Presence or absence of behavioral avoidance of success was not paralleled in fantasy,  as shown in protocols on Horner's projective test. A higher proportion of boys than girls told stories in which success led to unhappy consequences. The results are attributed to current mores among adolescents of both sexes. (Author)",

The subjects consisted of sixty students drawn from an undergraduate educational psychology course. The results of both studies failed to confirm the hypothesis. Test anxiety was less sensitive to fluctuations of evaluative stress than state anxiety, and more closely related to general trait anxiety.

It is emphasized that the purpose in proposing the Transactional Analysis model has been to aid the psychologist in organizing counseling data and in generating desirable counseling responses.

While the theory is not proposed as an all inclusive answer, or the only available model, it is advanced as a very helpful tool. (Author/BW)",

Two major communication programs consisted primarily of a series of mailings to parents and third involved direct personal contact with parents during a summer orientation. The results showed that in general, parental reactions were quite positive. Also, the series of mailed treatments appeared to have little or no impact on parental communication styles.

Each successive review, including this one, has seemed to confirm and strengthen the conclusion of the 1964 Report, that cigarettes are a major cause of death and disease. In the first three chapters of this report, the relationships between cigarette smoking and cancer, cardiovascular disease, and non-neoplastic bronchopulmonary disease are reviewed and evidence is presented which helps develop our understanding of the mechanisms which are involved in these relationships. In the final three chapters, information is presented on public exposure to air pollution from tobacco, on the relationship between tobacco and  allergy, and on the harmful consituents which are found in cigarette smoke. The chapter which discusses the harmful constituents of smoke is a useful statement of our current knowledge in this field. (Author)",

The basic purpose related structure of the information collection and analysis process made it possible to provide information that had multiple uses in management of the program. The fundamental question at which assessment was aimed was: Were the program management strategies employed in the 1970-71 National Drug Education Training Program valid as ways to initiate a coordinated national attack on a critical social problem? Evidence collected in this assessment suggests that the program was not only a success in terms of original expectations of impact, but also in terms of original assumptions of how to bring people together to deal  effectively with social problems. A detailed description of forms design, field testing, information collection, and analysis as well as information related to management support provided, is included in Section II of this report.

It was stated that uncredentialed persons on school district payrolls are given few genuine opportunities to interact professionally with children, parents, and helping agencies, thus creating a waste of resources and a form of discrimination. These conclusions are supported and alternatives are offered by the reporting of observations gleaned from participation in programs utilizing paraprofessionals. The primary source referred to was School Parent Advisors to the Neighborhood (SPAN), a project based in Rochester, New York, that employs 33 adults as home-school-community relations workers. SPAN is a consistent, visible bridge between school  and neighborhood. The 33 SPAN workers work with staffs of public and parochial, elementary, pre-kindergarten and secondary schools. They work toward a number of goals, most importantly at motivating and involving parents in dealing with the educational needs of their children. (Author/BW)",

The general purpose of this study was to determine whether these expressed solutions have some useful application to the problems of disruption. Description was measured through a situational survey and a self-description form filled out by the student along with a teacher rating of the student's behavior. The situational survey consisted of seven specific situations which were provocatively disruptive in nature, followed by a general question about annoying situations. The solutions to the survey were rated according to clinically oriented criteria of disruption. The results were generally minimal as far as any consistent or outstanding patterns of disruption. Signs of  disruption in various solutions were not evident in the teacher's or student's self-index of disruption. It was concluded that the survey was valuable as a probe, leading to pertinent questions. (Author/BW)",

Subjects were a class of 100 veterans who entered a special program at a major university in 1971. Two standardized test instruments and a locally developed instrument were administered. The results are presented on several different dimensions. These results indicated that the veterans in this study could be  considered different from the typical returning serviceman, but not free from the need for meaningful supportive services. In addition the stereotype of the returning Vietnam veteran as an alienated, anti-social individual generally did not apply to this educationally oriented group. (Author/BW)",

The administration of the project was conducted by a class of 17 undergraduate psychology students. The subjects qualifying as dropouts were people who had made initial contact with the center, i.e., had been processed through intake, but had failed to keep subsequent appointments. In general, it was concluded that the project was disorganized. The student workers looked for direction from the mental health center staff, only to be confused by different sets of answers. It was suggested that in the future student researchers be organized in a three-week workshop on interviewing  techniques. The response to counselors was generally found to be positive. A number of specific suggestions from clients were also presented. (Pages 11 and 12 may be illegible.) (Author/BW)",

Three hundred and forty-three elementary school counselors, guidance directors, elementary school principals, superintendents and counselor educators were randomly selected to take part in the survey. Responses to a 3-part questionnaire were analyzed and compared by means of several statistical techniques. A number of results are presented. The investigation supported the hypothesis that there is a dichotomy between the perceived and actual roles of the elementary counselor as seen by counselors, administrators and counselor educators. The study revealed that all groups presently stress the remedial functions of the counselor although they recognize developmental guidance as an  ideal goal. It was also emphasized that unless elementary counselors become actively involved in defining their role and making that definition known to others, elementary counseling will continue to be of decreasing importance.

Some goals of career education include: (1) making education relevant to the individual; (2) assuring the opportunity for the individual to gain marketable skills; (3) increasing options upon departure from public education, and (4) utilizing community resources. Elementary school counselors must involve themselves in career education through career awareness, including a knowledge of the self and of the work world.  Elementary children are in the process of defining and formulating vocational values and choices. Career education and guidance is necessary to aid them in skills, interests, and attitudes.

The results indicated that female internals perceive their parents as being more nurturant than do female externals. For males no relationships between locus of control orientation and parental attitudes were found. In the second phase male internality was found to be associated with higher grade point average and scores on  achievement tests and female internality was associated with higher achievement scores.

The differentiating treatment between the experimental and control groups consisted of a peer-led counseling group experience. The \"effect\" of the group experience on academic behavior was measured by comparing grade point averages of the experimental and control groups.

Measures of performance and attractiveness of the game were obtained. For both boys and girls, performance was highest when the game was labeled sex-appropriate, intermediate when no sex label was given, and lowest when the game was labeled sex-inappropriate. For attractiveness, the appropriate and neutral label conditions were similar and both were higher than the inappropriate condition. The IT Scale for children was used to test the hypothesis that children who were high sex-appropriate would be more influenced by the labels than children who were high sex-inappropriate. This hypothesis was not confirmed but there is some reason to doubt the ability  of the IT Scale to distinguish preference, either within a sex or between sexes. (Author/WS)",

The sample consisted of 86 patients who were admitted to the adolescent crisis ward during 1969 and 1970. The population could be divided according to four distinct crisis groups: (1) the suicidal group; (2) the aggressive group; (3) the psychotic group; and (4) the drug-induced psychotic group. Questionnaires were given out and data was analyzed in reference to various questions. It was found that the parents of the patients in the Adolescent Crisis Ward are perceived as significantly more punitive than parents of a control group of normal low socioeconomic children. It was also found that the perception of parental behavior by psychiatrically  disturbed adolescents in a crisis ward can be described in terms of three dimensions: the nurturing parent, the punishing parent, and the bipolar parent. Finally it was found that the four crisis groups are not significantly different with respect to their perception of parental behavior. (WS)",

Sweney and Weston (1970) found ten independent dimensions which explain attitudes and expectancies of their professors. These became the basis for the Learning Encounter Measure (LEM). Many of these dimensions suggested underlying intrafamilial attitudes. The studies reported related scores on LEM with interpersonal attitudes from the Chromatic Differential Test (CDT). 188 college students involved in a tutoring program took the LEM and CDT as part of their in-service training program. The intercorrelations found on these two scales indicated very strong relationships between intrafamilial attitudes and preferred professor behavior. The  results indicated that needs for structured simplicity were related to rejection of self and negative association with mother. The needs for professor control was related most to negative feelings to father and some negative attitudes toward mother and self. (Author/BW)",

In the experimental testing design, 1460 children in selected fifth, seventh, and ninth grade classes in three Texas cities of varying sizes underwent training with the use of the system. Experimental and control classes were tested before and after the former classes were exposed to the materials. Results indicated that the materials had a significant effect upon increases in knowledge about  different careers, knowledge on where to get training for those careers, and upon increased positive attitudes about job importance and job favorability. These effects had generality across pupil grade levels, and teachers' attitudes about the materials. (Author)",

The trait anxiety factor was interpreted as measuring stable individual differences while the state anxiety factor defined a transitory state of the organism that varied over time. A trait-state conception of anxiety was then proposed that specified the relationship between state anxiety (A-state) and trait anxiety (A-Trait). The purpose of this study was to derive and evaluate various predictions with respect to trait anxiety. It was predicted that, in general, subjects high in A-trait would evidence more stereotyped, and hence less variable, self-images than low A-trait subjects. Two procedures for determining A-trait were utilized. The subjects were drawn from a Special Talent Development  Program, a college opportunity program for minority youth. The results led to the conclusion that the state-trait distinction is a fruitful one for predicting both differences in performance and in the self-images for individuals who differ in A-trait.

The research around which this report is based is discussed under the headings of sensitivity training groups, self-disclosure, trust, cohesiveness (interpersonal attraction), ambiguity tolerance locus of control, affect, and personal style. This quest for the elements which compose a vital group leads to a cognizance of the characteristics, attitudes, and dispositions which should be emphasized or nurtured during training. The variables of trust, self-disclosure, and cohesiveness are of current concern to the proponents of the t-group method. The  expression of affect variable is another essential ingredient in vital group relations. These variables, in addition to locus of control, ambiguity tolerance, and sixteen personality factors, have been chosen as targets in the inquiry. Implications that the first four variables are related to the differentiation of a good group are found throughout the body of research. Only within the \"good\" encounter group does one find the unselfish giving and receiving which is sought by a number of people today. (Author/WS)",

        "description":"The purpose of Experiment I was to investigate the context effect of letter perception for nonword material. The significance of finding a context effect for nonwords would be that the basis of the effect would have to be a product of a person's knowledge of the phonological or orthographic structure of the language rather than attributable to a person knowing a particular letter string as a word. Letter strings composed of an initial consonant, a medial vowel pair, and a terminal consonant pair (CVVCC) were compared with strings composed of the same initial and terminal units but with a medial consonant pair (CCCCC) in a tachistoscopic recognition task. Exactly the same letters in the same positions (first, fourth and fifth letters) were detected with much higher accuracy in the  CVVCCs as compared to the CCCCCs. The objective of Experiment II was to see if the presentation interval used in Experiment I was too short to allow maximal performance for the CCCCCs. It seemed possible that iconic memory deteriorated too quickly after the offset of presentation to allow the subjects viewing CCCCCs to extract enough information for maximal performance. The hypothesis was confirmed in that performance for the CCCCCs improved by extending the presentation time. (Author/WR)",

        "description":"One hundred thirty-eight second graders, identified by their teachers as &quot;poor readers with incomplete phonics skills&quot; were given four specially constructed tests of phonics skills: a context test over meaningful but visually unfamiliar words, an isolated sounds test, a McKee type multiple choice test, and a word completion test. Eighty of the cases were also tested with the Burnett Reading Survey Test and a Test of Cognitive Abilities. The group was normal with respect to intelligence but were poor readers. Scores on the context test were significantly lower than those on the other phonics tests but were correlated higher with the Burnett Word Identification and Word Meaning Tests than any of the others. The factor measured by the context test accounted for a much higher  proportion of the variance in the Burnett subtests than did any of the other phonics tests. The context test approach was deemed to be a much more valid diagnostic technique. The patterns of responses on the phonics tests indicated that the Isolation, McKee, and Word Completion tests measure a less mature level of skill than the Context test. This suggests that they might be used to determine if prerequisite abilities have been developed. (Author)",

The major objective of the IMC project was to supply teachers with a wide variety of useful instructional materials for specific skills geared to the one basal reading series that was adopted for all inner-city schools in the Minneapolis Public School System. At all points the teachers took an active role in designing the materials to meet the specific needs of educationally disadvantaged children in the Minneapolis area. Of the 240 teachers who had the opportunity to use the IMC's resources, 98 percent did. Before the beginning of the 1970-71 school year,  the center had to extend their operation day to sixteen hours to meet the demand. Informal opinions and surveys have indicated that the IMC is a beneficial factor in improving reading instruction. (Author/WR)",

The BSC approach was remedial, and each year more than 700 students, the majority in grades four through six, participated in the program. In 1969-70 the Talking Typewriter was one major aspect of the program. The student spent 20 minutes a day using this teaching machine and received 20 minutes of additional instruction from teachers and aides. In 1970-71 the BSC program was substantially revised. More hardware was used, in addition to the Talking Typewriter, and a multimedia room was developed. The students spent equal time in the multimedia room, on the typewriter, and in the related classrooms. The results for 1969-70 indicated  that students did not make gains large enough to help them catch up in reading, nor were their gains better than a comparative group. The results for 1970-71 indicated that the BSC program was more successful, and students were progressing at a rate faster than the average child. Center children made average gains of eight and nine months in vocabulary and reading comprehension over the six-and-a-half month testing span. (Author/WR)",

These three categories are (1) grapho-phonic, the information from the writing system and from the phonological system of oral language; (2) syntactic information, the information from grammatical structures of the language; and (3) semantic information, information related to meaning and concepts represented by the printed word. An effective language experience program is one based on educational, psychological, and linguistic understandings. In the implementation of the program, teachers seek to help children relate the written language code to the spoken language code at the same time as they help children develop strategies  for language recognition of the grapho-phonic, semantic, and syntactical information. Communication is foremost in this child-oriented program with reading instruction built on existing language performance, but the instruction does not stop with and is not limited to that performance, as language facility is constantly extended.

Six groups of children were finally chosen: middle and lower class Blacks, Mexican-Americans, and Anglo-Americans. The major observation drawn from the data was that factors derived from the tests differed markedly across groups. It was further concluded that present tests were inefficient in that several subtests seemed to measure the same factors.

        "description":"A collection of papers delivered during the Fifteenth Annual International Reading Association Convention is presented which represents a variety of views on diagnosis and/or on the manner in which diagnistic information is interpreted. The papers have been arranged into three sections. The first deals with the importance of diagnosis, presents some methods for collecting and interpreting data about reading progress, and describes a plan for bringing about changes in reading performance. The second section treats tests and testing and provides information on ways a teacher can use tests. Included are an analysis of several diagnostic tests currently available, a discussion of problems and solutions in utilizing both standardized and informal tests, and a description of the  development of a diagnostic test. Section 3 is composed of four reports analyzing data to shed light on the relation between intelligence and reading improvement, the stability of reading achievement, and critical evaluations of methods for determining levels of achievement. The papers are arranged in a way that makes the monograph easy to use, especially the treatment of the statistical studies. Tables and references are included.

Three sample groups of 120, 60, and 320 consisted of volunteer undergraduate students. Results of the analyses showed that (1) Although the number of salient, semantic dimensions derived when scaling the stimuli via the semantic differential and multidimensional scaling procedures were basically the same, the specific interrelationships exhibited among the stimuli under the two procedures were quite different; and (2) When the nouns were  used in a paired-associate learning task which incorporated both sets of relationships, significantly different levels of learning were observed. These results suggest that in learning situations such as this, the use of a multidimensional scaling algorithm may represent a more efficient procedure than the semantic differential for specifying the semantic interrelationships among small sets of verbal stimuli.

Ways in which the accountability program can be successful are listed and some advantages of performance contracting are given. Lastly, expected changes in schools resulting from accountability programs are presented as follows: (1) The teacher role will change from information giver to learning director; (2) Schools will become more open and less group-oriented; (3) Curriculum will be more relevant; (4) Myths can be exposed and eliminated from the schools. Some  experiments in accountability are sighted and a bibliography of 23 articles published between 1970-71 is given. (Author/AL)",

Elective courses are defined as programs at one or more grade levels which allow students to choose courses that appeal to them from a wide variety of offerings. The study is based on data from over 100 programs in 37 states. The examination proceeds from a discussion of the rationales for these programs to examinations of program structures, patterns of course offerings, course designs, methods and results of evaluation. It concludes with a discussion of some of the important problems and promises of elective programs.

The responses were assigned to the five categories of Personal Association, Moral Judgment, Thematic Interpretation, Technical Approach, and Factual Narration. The conclusions of the study, derived from statistical interpretation of response frequencies and directive method, indicated that prereading orientation in a specific direction narrowed the students' responses, while nondirective treatment, allowing the student freedom to structure his own reactions to poetry, widened the frequency of responses in many categories.  The conclusions were seen to have implications for teaching, and to suggest problems for further research. A selected bibliography is included. (Several pages may be light.) (Author/DI)",

The objectives of the course include demonstrating an understanding of: (1) the origin and nature of language, (2) the process by which language changes and develops, (3) the abstract nature of the thought and language process, (4) symbology and the levels of meaning of language, (5) the psychology of language and how it affects behavior, and (6) the psychology of language and how it affects culture. It is believed that the course is important because language is a unique tool enabling man to create culture. Since language is a system of symbols and human behavior is a response to symbols, the study of the nature of language is  intertwined with the study of human behavior and with the effect of language on the civilization of man.

        "description":"A heuristic strategy model of sentence comprehension, similar to ones suggested by Bever, Fodor and Garret, is discussed, with the focus on the conceptual characteristics of such a model and on relevant research. Briefly, the model assumes that a speech perception device constructs a representation of a heard sentence corresponding roughly to a written transcript. This representation is then scanned for cues to the sentence's underlying grammatical relations and lexical content. The model claims that structural hypotheses are formulated while material within a clause is being processed and that a structure is assigned at the end of the clause regardless of whether sufficient information is available to determine that assignment unambiguously. Research on the following topics is  discussed: the nature of the cues used in inferring structural relations, the time of formulation of structural and lexical hypotheses, and the question of whether and how prior context may restrict the set of hypotheses considered. Methodological problems with tasks such as phoneme monitoring, probe latency and sentence completion are raised. Present evidence is too equivocal to support firm conclusions about comprehension processing, but suggestions are made for further research. (Author/DI)",

The project involved creating a testing instrument, reviewing of the instrument by a panel of experts, and applying the resultant test to a small population of college students and to a criterion group of acknowledged sensitive users of English. By means of pre- and post-test, comparison was made between the performances of students and members of the criterion group. Reliability and validity studies were made of the results. Though the test was necessarily crude, it was found that certain areas of linguistic response warranted serious consideration in the development of future language competency tests:  sociolinguistic and semantic context, deep structure of word-groups and sentences, primary factors of extended discourse, and, possibly, organization of extended discourse.

        "description":"The question of whether a high school newspaper should act as a voice of official school opinion or should be an organ of dissent is discussed. A student editor argues that the school administration should recognize the students' right to freedom of the press. A teacher-sponsor argues that the newspaper should be part of the curriculum, acting both as a public relations medium and a voice of student opinion. A principal argues that the newspaper can be an expression of the students' search for truth, but that a line needs to be drawn between freedom of the press and the freedom to disrupt orderly educational processes. A librarian argues that if responsible dissent were encouraged by administrators there would be no need for underground newspapers. The Attorney General of  Kentucky states that school publications are free to express opinion as long as it is not libelous, obscene, pornographic, inflammatory, or disruptive of school activities. To help schools solve this problem, a journalism curriculum guide for use in various courses is discussed. (DI)",

They also conclude that the processes of reading and literary response involve complex relationships among the reader, the literary work, and the situation of reading.

Data from two experiments involving third and fourth grade students revealed that a few very vivid sentences were integrated, which suggests that the ability to integrate anaphorically linked propositions precedes the ability to analyze all clauses into forms that are appropriate operands for the integration function. The subjects knew the anaphoric structure but could not process individual propositions to the point where the rules applied mediated memory. Furthermore, when the sentence subjects were repeated rather than pronominalized, the  sentences were not uniformly integrated in memory. This inability to integrate sentence memory representations was attributed to short memory limitations that prevented successful anaphora resolution. (HS)",

The authors suggest that such a course begin by encouraging students to talk with one another and to engage in dramatic improvisation.

The units on talk and drama, writing, and reading are provided with cognitive and affective objectives, seminar activities, large group activities, and discussions of the role of the teacher. The authors conclude with guidelines for evaluating the teaching of talk and drama, writing, and reading. They argue that one of the basic principles of this evaluation should be the belief that learning is deeper, more lasting, and more useful if the gap  between intellectual perceptions and emotional attitudes can be bridged. Included are a bibliography and appendices discussing some large group activities in English classes; some suggestions for combining music, art, and literature; a list of slides; a list of films; a list of recordings; and a list of titles ordered for an outside reading program.

Kenneth Croft, James Ney, John Fisher, Mary Finocchiaro, among others, contributed articles to the ESOL section, which groups materials into three categories--Cultural Differences, Bilingualism, and Curricular Innovations. The SESOD section, however, groups materials under Attitudes, The Historical Perspective, and Contrastive Dialectology. Contributors to the SESOD section included Robert Cromack, Ralph Fasold, Kenneth Goodman, J. L. Dillard, and William  Stewart. Both sections urge the teacher to explore the cultural background of students, to accept their language or dialect as a valid linguistic system, and to see in their diversity the strength of American society. Ralph Fasold's review of \"Language and Poverty\" by Frederick Williams concludes the anthology and stresses once more the adequacy of the difference model, a position held by the authors whose articles appear in this issue.

Winston Weathers in \"Prose Composition and Modern Awareness\" (from \"Oklahoma English Bulletin,\" 1968) argues that English teachers need to be more innovative in the teaching of composition and more willing to accept a variety of writing habits, procedures, and behaviors. They should also accept new categories of rhetoric and style, the principle of disjunctive writing, and more involvement in real life. Neil Puhl in \"Specified Behavior\" (from \"Iowa English Yearbook,\" 1970) describes a composition program consisting of pretests, preassignment objectives, writing assignments based on performance objectives, duplication of some of these writings, peer group evaluation of the writings, student self  evaluation, and student-teacher conferences. Frank Manchel in \"Reversing the Process\" (from \"The Leaflet,\" 1969) describes some weaknesses of the La Mancha Project's first year, which was designed to study the writing process, both in composing and communicating. He then notes that the coming year will see more emphasis placed on studying the mass media and on encouraging the students to use their writing for self-examination. (Author/DI)",

Have positions responsible for the planning and supervision of curriculum been eliminated or added? Has the position of the department chairman been strengthened or weakened?

Two experiments were conducted testing the hypothesis. No single result from either test unambiguously supported the hypothesis, but the many near-significant or significant trends in expected directions lent support to the hypothesis. Stronger recency effects than those observed were expected, but the authors suggest that the recency experience provided may not have been sufficiently long or intense enough to produce these effects, so alternative  recency training procedures are being contemplated.

The three strategies embody the well established learning principles that students learn better when they: (1) know what it is they are trying to learn; (2) value the objectives toward which they are striving; (3) are actively involved rather than being passive; and (4) receive feedback and confirmation of learning. After outlining the strengths and weaknesses of the three strategies, the author emphasizes that these methods are not panaceas but require greater teacher efforts than what might be required for traditional teaching. The article concludes with a bibliography of  materials available for study and implementation of these strategies. (Author/RN)",

The basic system utilizes remotely operated video-tape cameras to record and review conferences and lectures. Since the participants are undisturbed by cameramen and equipment, the recordings appear more natural and less staged. The system provides a method for immediate feedback as well as a rapid and economical method for editing. Once the conference or lecture is recorded, the tapes are duplicated for playback on video playback monitors or for release on closed circuit television. Consequently, the system reduces the time required to prepare materials for distribution to interested audiences.  (Author/LG)",

To illustrate the new production techniques, a theatre event, called \"Mandala,\" is described. \"Mandala,\" was created by a university class which prepared the script, directed, and performed employing the premise that \"each person was himself an actuality\" rather than an actor preparing for a role.

The authors note that, in print and in practice, continuing education of administrators has failed to develop to the extent that it can be described as in the beginning stages of a science and that truly innovative programs are lacking in current practice. The authors then propose a comprehensive process for planning, implementing, and evaluating programs for the continuing education of administrators. They argue that a planned, systematic, and continuous administrator education program is basic to the solution of the critical problems facing education. A bibliography is  included. (Author/DN)",

After outlining the assumptions, rationales, and strategies behind attempts to institute interdisciplinary administrator training programs, the author describes in detail several Canadian and American programs that provide such training. Although some of the programs described consist only of shared classes and seminars, others entail a completely integrated program of experiences. The author describes several sources of resistance to the adoption of training-in-common and shows how these resistive forces must be overcome if the implementation of in-common training programs is to be  accelerated.

After examining statutes and cases, the author concludes that teacher discipline has changed substantially and notes that some of these changes represent significant decreases in the restrictions on teacher conduct.

The most important overall objective of educational policy during the decade has been (1) educational opportunity for all and (2) equalization of educational opportunity. This expansion appears to stem from the so-called social demand approach to educational planning, which claims that places should be provided by the public in all branches of education for all children who seek them and who have proved that they have the requisite abilities to benefit from courses in the particular branch of education in which a place is sought. Although it was assumed that rapid expansion of educational opportunity  for all would accrue from this approach, the policy actually contains an antiegalitarian bias in favor of middle class children. Both the inputs (resources) and the outputs of the educational systems have increased enormously during the past decade despite partially conflicting manpower and efficiency considerations. A radically new approach to the problem of relating forecasting, planning, and policymaking appears needed for the educational systems in question.

        "description":"Member countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development have experienced three changes in post-compulsory education over the past two decades: (1) prolonged secondary education has become the experience of a rapidly growing proportion of the population, (2) the proportion, therefore, of the age group entering some form of higher education has increased and will continue, and (3) as the proportion entering and completing higher education increases, so the numbers undertaking studies at an \"advanced\" (e.g. graduate school) level will increase. In most cases, these trends are the result of conscious policy decisions that represent the desire of governments to maximize talent utilization, equalize opportunities, and increase the educational participation of  certain underprivileged segments of society. This wider participation has led to important changes in both the external organizational structures and in the internal curriculums (including methods of teaching and assessment) of higher education. This growth in scale and cost raises important questions about controlling the higher education system and about the role held by education in the social system.

As such, it deals with (1) present models of rescheduling, (2) the school vacation, (3) basic comparative cost analysis, (4) busing requirements, (5) curriculum design requirements, (6) career opportunities for professional staff, and (7) conclusions and recommendations. The plans considered are those that limit the number of students in attendance at any one time to less than the total enrollment and those that accelerate completion of school to less than the traditional 12 years by extending the length of the school year. In the first group, the report covers the four-quarter plan, the four-quarter plan with rotating vacations, the twelve-four  plan, and the 45-15 plan. The continuous four-quarter plan and the 11-month plan are discussed as representative of the second group. Some of the specific plans representative of a combination of the two principles are discussed: the New York Multiple Trails Plan, the New York Continuous Progress Plan, the Metro-Atlanta Plan, and the Flexible All-Year School Plan. A useful table compares the characteristics of major plans on the basis of the length of the school year and school day; divisions in school year; grade levels; time required to effect savings in classrooms, number of teachers, and dollars; vacations (other than Christmas and Spring Break); advantages; and obstacles to change.

Under this plan, students would attend school for 45 days and be absent from school for 15 days in rotating shifts throughout the year. Eleven subcommittees researched various aspects of a continuous school year, such as calendars, staff relations, census and attendance, pupil personnel services, maintenance, climate control, public relations, data processing, government and institutional relations, and curriculum planning. The reports of these subcommittees make up the bulk of this presentation. As a result of study findings, it was established that year-round schooling is a viable educational program for the Boise schools. In addition, a  simulation program evidenced that the school staff had the capability of developing the necessary calendar, that the existing facilities could accommodate 25 percent more pupils under an extended year calendar, and that the amount of education for the dollar over the long term would be greater than under the present 9-month system. However, three objections to the program were voiced by the school authorities: (1) primary grade children should not be required to change teachers every 45 days, (2) well-established extracurricular and enrichment programs would have greater difficulty in maintaining their high standards, and (3) the question of summer employment for youth would still remain unsolved.

In examining the nature of these interactions, he sets the complex of concepts into historical perspective, inferring from the practices of recent years a set of theoretical possibilities. The publication provides information helpful to curriculum workers, supervisors, administrators, and teachers who desire to be well informed as well as enthusiastic about the new degree of freedom in planning space for learning; organizing children, time, and staff; and preparing the curriculum. After exploring some of the  definitions of the concept &quot;open,&quot; its wellsprings, and its dimensions, the author devotes three chapters to discussions of the relationship of &quot;openess&quot; to space, structure, and curriculum. In the concluding chapter, he addresses himself to some of the problems that teachers and others working in open schools might be expected to deal with in the process of making certain that learning under the new freedom really adds up.

        "description":"This paper reports a case study of 47 students drawn from an open education and a traditional school. After statistically controlling on student background and earlier academic performance, investigators found no significant differences between students from the two schools in adjustment to junior high school as measured by grades, attendance, discipline, and satisfaction with school. Before entering junior high, the open elementary school students had a stronger preference for open school organization than did traditional elementary school students. However, the differences disappeared during the first year in junior high as the students from the traditional elementary school increased their acceptance of the open school organization. General findings indicate that students from  open elementary schools see greater similarities between elementary and junior high school than do students from traditional elementary schools. These results are discussed in terms of the diversity of activities and the dominance of authority as organizational properties of schools. Some evidence on how family factors may influence student transition between different stages of school organization is also provided. (Author/DN)",

The major implication of this study suggested that the climate of the schools might be changed to make them more receptive to innovation from within or from without the system. The study replicates portions of the 1967 study, and has the additional objectives of relating findings to organizational models and delineating characteristics of an innovative school system. System innovativeness is determined through the study of data collected from a random sampling of professional staff members in the eight school systems. The variables studied to determine the ranking of the system include  staff perceptions of school system interpersonal process norms, norms of staff meetings, function of the principal, and other influences. Four major concepts examined and related to a framework for organizational growth are organizational health, an organization conceived organically like a living organism, Likert's model of the human organization, and Mooney's model of creative systems. In the final section, a number of generalizations concerning innovativeness are presented following a review of the data gathered from the 8-school study. These characteristics are presented, and a profile of innovative school systems is developed. See previous related study, ED 029 808. (Author)",

However, the game proved ineffective in changing political attitudes not directly related to log-rolling. (Author)",

Explained were factors to be considered in the study of deductive reasoning and the predictive ability of isotropic theory, theory of spatial paralogic, theory of spatial images, and deep structure  theory. Findings indicated that instructions to use spatial imagery in problem solving systematically facilitated problem solution for the adjusted subjects. On the average, each of the 54 EMR subjects used four categories for spatial assignments so that prediction of series problem errors from spatial assignments was severely handicapped. Absolute errors were generally greater for subjects who had lower verbal IQ scores. No consistent differences in absolute or relative errors resulted when age was used to organize the data. (GW)",

Collection of both word-association and sentence-association responses indicated that a substantial number of stimulus words and sentences yielded a high degree of response commonality. However, contrary to hypothesized results, data indicated that nonassociation word pairs may be read with greater accuracy than high association words. Data also failed to support any facilitative effect of high associations on pupils' gain in reading at either the sentence  recognition level or the sentence comprehension level. Anecdotal records examined teaching styles and lessons for each class. Failure of the data to confirm the authors' hypothesis was thought to be due to the children's prior exposure to phonic/analytic methods of instruction and to their inability to organize verbal materials according to semantic or associative properties. Instructional materials were included in the appendix. (GW)",

Subjects were given 12 successive trials on each of five stimulus lists. Findings indicated that EMR children demonstrated less category clustering and recall than normal boys on the categorized list, and less associative clustering and recall than normal boys on a stimulus list composed of high associative paradigmatic noun pairs. EMR subjects demonstrated significantly less recall than normal boys on stimulus lists composed of either low associative paradigmatic or low  associative syntagmatic word pairs. Investigators focused on M. Semmel's model of the language behavior of EMR children as a guide. Reviewed was the literature on the major psychological theories attempting to explain the organizational processes involved in learning and memory, on category clustering in free recall, on associative clustering in free recall, on subjective organization in free recall, and on clustering studies of children.

It was hypothesized that adult demands would correlate with a child's language response capability and would constitute a useful index of the child's language environment. Using 15 categories of questions (such as tag question, auxiliary and infinitive question, and main verb introduced question), examiners analyzed adult questions generated from seven mother child interactions. Interrogation profiles showed a shift in the adult interrogation from a heavy concentration in a few categories among the youngest subjects to a more even distribution among older subjects. Results  indicated that type of verbal demands an adult places on a child changed in relation to improved language capability. (GW)",

Results showed that use of games did not significantly affect overall frequency of off-task behavior in either regular or EMR classes, although individual teachers produced considerably different results.

Ss were 19 second through fifth grade students who were distractable and had various individual learning and/or behavior problems. For 1 year, they left their regular classrooms to spend 2 hours daily with a special education teacher. Individually designed educational programs were highly structured and emphasized both social and academic success, which students were not accustomed to achieving. Students were provided with success experiences in social, motor, academic, and perceptual areas. They charted their own successes and were rewarded for growth. Pre- and post-tests measured academic performance (math, spelling, reading, writing skills) and self concept. Additional data included personal  behavior graphs, work samples, videotapes, and behavioral checklists. Ss made significant gains in all academic areas tested, and competencies in social interaction improved more than could be attributed to maturity alone. Self-portraits showed that all students felt they had improved both academically and in social interaction. Heterogeneous grouping of students demanded only one special teacher and was considered economically efficient. (KW)",

The county is characterized by a diminishing agrarian economy, poverty, a 75% black school enrollment, and educational disadvantagement. Factors to be considered in planning are described as fourfold: nature of population, continuum of needs (determined by kinds of needs and number of levels on which each must be met), parameters of needs (determined by size of group), and availability of resources. Need for preventive rather than remedial programs is stressed. Described is the county's Special Needs Resource Room Program in the primary grades, the program for educable mentally  retarded individuals, and planning for secondary level educationally disadvantaged students. Overall, educational planning in rural areas is said to involve need appraisal and ordering, strategy development, matching resources to strategies without duplication, developing multi-county solutions to low-incident exceptionality problems and inservice teacher education, securing supplementary State and community agency services, and assessing effectiveness of programs.

Early planned screening by teachers and school officials is recommended; students obtaining an IQ score of 80 or less on a group test should be referred for individual psychological evaluation. Identification, certified by a qualified examiner (state certification in school psychology or a licensed psychologist), takes into account the following factors: medical examination, psychological testing, achievement test, adaptive behavior, other tests deemed necessary, parent interview and permission, and case  history. Placement in a program for the retarded is said to be the responsibility of a special staffing committee or an exceptional child admissions specialist. Guidelines for grouping students by chronological age are given, and reasons for dismissal from the program are mentioned. (KW)",

Ss were students in three regular first grade classrooms, one of which served as a control classroom. Following a teacher training program, teachers trained experimental Ss in the target survival skills using social and non-social reinforcement, vicarious reinforcement, and shaping procedures. The Gates-MacGinitie Reading Readiness and Primary A were administered before and 4-6 weeks after the intervention program. During each testing week, observations of each S's classroom behavior during reading periods were made for 5 consecutive days. An interactive coding system was  used to record survival skill behaviors. Data supported the hypothesis that an increase in survival skills leads to a similar increase in academic achievement. Among Ss matched for mean survival skill scores and standard deviations, experimental Ss gained over three times as much in survival skills and almost twice as much in reading as did the controls.

Each S's ratings on the WPBIC were scored on five factors and subjected to profile analysis. Homogeneous groupings were established on the five behavioral dimensions: acting-out, social withdrawal, distractability, disturbed peer relationships, and immaturity. Correlations indicated that, with the exception of acting-out and distractability, there was  little overlap among item clusters comprising the five factors. Sex difference was significant within each of the three grade levels; neither grade level effect nor interaction between grade level and sex was significant. Results suggested that teacher checklist ratings of student behavior are a valuable and relatively inexpensive method of identifying homogeneous groupings of classroom behavior. (KW)",

Token reinforcement produced the greatest increase in appropriate behavior, followed by cost contingency, social reinforcement, and change of setting. Cost contingency produced the most consistent and least variable behavior across all subjects. A substantial treatment effect was  also associated with change in classroom setting, teachers, and instructional materials.

The decline was particularly intense in computer-based vocational guidance systems and in computer-assisted instruction projects. The only area showing growth was computer-managed instruction. This decline is unfortunate, because computers will be essential to the education of the future. 2) A model of education in which an educator or a computer manipulates a learner's behavior will not do. A better model calls for the learner to define his own objective and then constantly refine it. 3) Some recent signs of increasing cooperation among researchers and developers include the  transportability of software, regional cooperation, increased professional responsibility, and innovation in helping students actually to build computers. 4) Questions which remain to be answered include how to maintain adequate privacy against data banks, how to keep information secure, how to destroy records that are no longer useful, and how to increase cooperation among researchers in different but related areas.

        "description":"A number of different methods have been used by instructional television (ITV) projects to obtain audience feedback, and some of these are now being used in the ITV system in El Salvador. We know that pretesting programs on a representative sample can bring considerable gains in learning. Another feedback source can be a classroom of pupils in the production studio, or a small number of students participating in programs on camera. Some projects teaching advanced material have used a talk-back system that permits students to use remote microphones to talk to studio teachers and to have their questions or comments broadcast to the whole audience. A device found on almost all projects is classroom testing. Because tests are time-consuming they are often separated by wide intervals.  However weekly tests can be provided over television, and the results quickly integrated into program content. Finally, regular comments from classroom teachers, supervisors and utilization workers are common to many projects. And although ITV in El Salvador uses some of these techniques, current feedback channels should be strengthened, and new ones developed. (MG)",

Of the 92 teachers who completed the course 72 completed both questionnaires. Because participants in the course were younger, more experienced and better educated than most teachers in El Salvador, the results have limited generalizability. The results indicate that during the course teachers gained a better understanding of the objectives of El Salvador's Educational Reform Plan, that they moved toward a more realistic understanding of the disadvantages as well as the  advantages of ITV, that they came to feel ITV in the classroom will require more instead of less class preparation time, and that more attention will have to be paid to teaching principles of problem solving. In addition, by the end of the course the teachers came to expect more of the Educational Reform Plan, in curriculum and organization. (MG)",

Because the supervisors were not trained as researchers, they needed an instrument that was simple to use as well as reliable. Several indicators were defined to distinguish between modern and traditional teaching methods, for example the ratio of discussion time to lecture time, the ratio of opinion and thought questions to memory questions, the use of learning aids, and the amount of time spent by students on projects of their own choosing. These were measured on a classroom observation form made up of 33 categories. Each category was divided into segments of class time. The completed form records the number of minutes the teacher spends at each  activity--dictating, writing at the blackboard, reviewing individual projects, and the like. Approximately six hours were needed to train teacher observers to use the forms. The instrument was tested and proved effective. (MG)",

The emotional climate of the typical elementary and secondary classroom must be changed, but without sacrificing progress by the children in the achievement of subject matter goals. However, with traditional classrooms, children need more feedback, praise, and attention than one teacher can provide. Computers offer a more responsive environment for learning; further, they can help teachers spend more of their time on human relations skills and less on rote, lower-order tasks for which they may not be prepared. Also, computers make genuine adaptive education for every learner possible in a way that no teacher alone can do and can greatly expand the available curriculum for learners. Thus, curricula  need not be restricted by what is possible to teach: learners individually can have access to a wide variety of the world's knowledge and will be able to take more of the responsibility for what is learned. Realistically, estimating the costs of using computers will necessitate some new models for schooling which are explicit about educational goals and which capitalize on those new objectives that are made attainable by the application of computers in instruction.

        "description":"A sociological theory of authority was used to investigate some nonintellective, perhaps unintended, consequences of computer-assisted instruction (CAI) upon student's attitudes and orientations toward the organization of the school. An attitudinal questionnaire was used to survey attitudes toward the teacher and the computer in a junior high school which serves predominantly Mexican-American families of low socioeconomic status. The questionnaire was administered before and after the experimental period. Results of regression analyses indicated that if CAI gets normative support from school officials who authorize its exercise of power as a monitor of students' task-specific behavior, and if teachers do not have control over that technological resource, students are likely to  form authority relationships for goal attainment with the computer that are comparable to those usually formed with their teachers. This reduction in the students' dependence on the teacher's task-specific resources undermines the students' relationship with the teacher, especially with first-year CAI students. The longer range (second and third year) effects of the CAI program more favorably reflect some of the program's anticipated functions. (Author/JY)",

The general direction of change was toward less teacher talk and lecture. The questioning techniques of teachers stayed fairly constant with the only statistically significant change being in the mean number of questions asked each month. The conclusions were that students can give accurate feedback which  effects change in teacher behavior and that this change can be described and quantified using interaction analysis techniques.

Both approaches have the same basic philosophy that the child should learn language and culture together, at his own pace, stimulated by his curiosity and his growing awareness of similarities and differences between cultures and languages. The difference lies in the physical settings and the resulting degree of isolation from regular schools. The Main Street School is completely independent while the Regional Reception Centres operate in classrooms, usually portables, attached to regular schools. The technique for comparison was two-fold. Interviews were conducted with students who had been &quot;graduated&quot; from either  of the programs. For the second part, the regular-school English teachers of the students interviewed completed a rating of the students in such areas as discipline, general adjustment, general performance level, and prediction of how far the student will go in his schooling.

The first part of the paper demonstrates why subject raising is not a common syntactic device in SOV languages and why it is difficult to prove that the transformation exists in these languages. The author suggests that there is, however, one sentence pattern in Japanese where subject raising is involved; the remainder of the paper is devoted to presenting evidence to prove the existence of this phenomenon.

The study begins with a philosophical and historical view of methods of teaching modern foreign languages. Data, collected from 10 percent of the modern foreign language teachers in secondary schools in Florida by means of a personal questionnaire and an attitudinal scale related to foreign language teaching methods, are analyzed. Five salient factors which evolved from the scale are correlated with characteristics in the respondents' personal and professional backgrounds. Conclusions indicate that teacher attitudes toward modern foreign language teaching methodology are not significantly related to sex, age, foreign  language teaching experience, academic degree, how the second language was learned, experience with the language laboratory, or whether the teacher has had training in special foreign language workshops and programs.

At this point, the Ontario government cut back on funds, hoping to curtail the problem of over-education. Presented here are: problems in forecasting requirements for academic staff and using analytic models for supply/demand comparisons; an illustration of the use of a model for analyzing Ph.D.  enrollment alternatives; and principles and suggested policies for graduate enrollment and financial support.

Since World War II when veterans proved that older persons are more motivated to learn than traditionally younger students, colleges have been providing continuing and adult education programs that allow for degrees to be earned on a part-time basis and even on a nonresidential basis. The myth that a college degree is a necessity to earn a good living is also being shot down. Cross-country truck drivers, on the whole, earn more money than college professors with Ph.D.'s. Education needs to be changed to train those people who are  interested in occupations outside of academic fields to function in their jobs to the best of their abilities. Although it is important for a person's schooling to enable him to earn a living, it is felt that the synergetic attribute of the individual will begin to grow in importance. This synergy can be viewed both in a limited perspective as the way in which the physical, mental and emotional aspects of an individual combine and interact to form a personality, as well as a broader perspective that observes the interaction of the individual as a part of a whole that can focus on society, mankind, the universe and beyond.

        "description":"Executive Order 11246 requires presidents of higher education institutions to meet certain equal employment responsibilities and prohibits recipients of Federal contracts from discriminating in employment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. It also calls for affirmative steps to attract more women and minority applicants for employment consideration. The guidelines reaffirm that goals and timetables are required as a part of affirmative action programs, make clear that quotas are not required or permitted, and describe in functional terms the difference between the two. Nothing in the affirmative action concept requires a university to employ or promote any faculty member who is less qualified than other applicants competing for that position.  Affirmative action does require, however, that any standards or criteria that have had the effect of excluding women and minorities be eliminated unless such criteria are conditions of successful performance in the particular position involved.

Several conclusions are made: (1) When students hold favorable or unfavorable impressions of the Paracollege, it is at least as much a function of their own educational preferences and personal characteristics and attitudes as it is of information or evidence about the effectiveness of specific features of the program. (2) If the  Paracollege is to be expected to live up to its original charge to serve a cross-section of the St. Olaf student body, it will need to make a concerted effort to counter its developing image by deliberately attempting to attract the kinds of students who now view Paracollege as inappropriate for them. (3) Within the student body there is a diversity of educational preferences and styles that seem to suggest that more rather than fewer curricular options might be made available to students. (HS)",

The findings indicate how students changed from institution to institution in relation to their characteristics at entrance. These characteristics included educational and vocational values; religious, political, and civic attitudes; personality characteristics; and intellectual disposition. Intellectual disposition was a construct and continuum in which one extreme represented broad intellectual and esthetic interests, theoretical orientation, and intellectual independence, and the other extreme represented a practical orientation, conventional and less flexible forms  of thought, and lack of esthetic interests. The only statistically significant evidence of differential change in intellectual disposition was the percentage of students in one of the elite colleges who changed from a pronounced pragmatic to a pronounced theoretical orientation over the 4 years. The report of the study summarizes changes on the several scales of the Omnibus Personality Inventory and changes in attitudes and values. (Author/HS)",

The major role of these 4 new universities is to provide general undergraduate programs on a level of quality comparable to that of established universities in Ontario. This emphasis creates problems for all in attracting and holding scholars who expect opportunities to supervise advanced students and conduct research, although Trent and Brock Universities will find it much easier to solve these problems in a short time because of their accessible geographic locations. Lakehead and Laurentian Universities, however, operate under the double disadvantage of distance and of location in slow growth  economic regions. In order to achieve the legitimate goal of equality they must overcome regional inequalities of economic development and educational opportunity and expectation. If they are to succeed, the new universities need the active support and cooperation of other universities, and recognition from the Committee on University Affairs and the provincial government that additional help channelled to them can greatly assist in achieving regional economic and social development and genuine equality of educational opportunity.

It was found that the program has been strikingly successful in producing university and college staff for Ontario and Canada and also in providing the means to train in Ontario some of those specialists needed in an increasingly complex society. It is recommended that the competition for the program be modified, specifically by awarding the bulk of the fellowships in a province-wide procedure with the awards portable within Ontario rather than tied to a specific university. For  graduate students whose academic ability and promise do not justify scholarship support, a grant/loan scheme coupled with a limited opportunity for employment is recommended. In addition, it is recommended that awards through the program be increased from $750 a term to $800 a term in recognition of the increasing cost of living. (HS)",

The Lawrence and Lorach concepts of differentiation and integration were utilized in the analysis. The results obtained supported the conclusion that considerable differences existed between the administrative services divisions and the student personnel and instructional divisions on measures of formality of structure, interpersonal orientation, and goal orientation. The findings also confirmed that the divisions which have greater differences have more difficulty in working effectively with each other. (Author)",

        "description":"Results are presented of an analytical study of journalism instruction in Alabama junior colleges, senior colleges and universities, State junior colleges in neighboring States; of student publications, their staffs and advisors on all Alabama campuses; and of regional and national norms for junior college journalism education as a pattern for definition of goals in Alabama. Questionnaires on journalism instruction were mailed to the 21 public and private junior colleges and to the 29 public and private senior colleges and universities in Alabama. The same questionnaire was sent to the State-supported junior colleges in the four adjacent states of Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, and Tennessee. A second questionnaire on student publications was sent to all junior and senior  institutions in Alabama. All Alabama institutions responded to the first questionnaire, and all Alabama junior colleges and 24 of the senior institutions responded to the second questionnaire. Sixty tables present the response data. Results of the study, which relate to journalism programs in Alabama junior colleges only, show that junior college journalism education in Alabama is virtually non-existent. Of the 21 junior colleges, only 5 identified journalism as a course of instruction. Student publication production is, in every case, related to classwork. Only one school has more than one course identified in the catalogue, and in only one of the 5 colleges is the journalism instructor educated primarily in journalism. A number of recommendations are made with respect to State-wide  definition, journalism curriculum initiation, journalism curriculum, faculty, and &quot;terminal&quot; courses. An appendix presents a resolution of the Junior College Journalism Association. (DB)",

A case study of faculty attitudes toward innovation for the faculties of Harcum Junior College and Harrisburg Area Community College was evaluated. A set of 12 items were developed which included 5 areas of concern to two-year college educators. Individuals were asked to respond to each item by checking among the following the one of five responses which best represented their opinions: 1 = strongly agree; 2 = mildly agree; 3 = neutral; 4 = mildly disagree; 5 = strongly disagree. For the first 10 items in the questionnaire, responses could be viewed as a continuum ranging from \"Acceptance of innovation\" to \"Orientation to traditionalism\". The  last two questionnaire items provided information about faculty feelings toward their backgrounds for and college support for instructional research. Results of answers include: (1) The highest vote for traditionalism was offered by Harcum in connection with student dress; the lowest, also recorded by Harcum was in connection with student dissent; for in this latter category Harcum opted for the highest \"innovation\" vote.

        "description":"A report of the status of those Montgomery Community College students who received their Associate Arts degree in 1970 is presented. This report is a facet of a 10-year follow-up program of Montgomery College graduates. In 1970 the majority of Montgomery Community College graduates who continued their education transferred to the University of Maryland. However, a large number of students transferred to schools in 22 states or U. S. territories, and two countries. Montgomery County Public Schools were the source of over two-thirds of all the graduates. The remainder were either non-residents or immigrants. The typical career-oriented graduate was 21 years old, earned a cumulative grade point average of 2.68, and was employed within four months after graduation. His counterpart  was transfer-oriented, 22 years old when he graduated, earned a grade point average of 2.60, and enrolled full-time in a four-year institution the fall after graduating from Montgomery. It appears that the College does not provide effective placement services for graduates; however, students are able to secure jobs through other means and job satisfaction was indicated by a majority employed. The mission of the College is often described in terms of &quot;transfer&quot; and &quot;career.&quot; From the results of this study it appears that those graduates who plan to transfer are able to enroll in the college or university of their choice with a minimum of credit loss. At the same time career-oriented students either have a job at the time they receive their Associate Arts degree or obtain employment soon  after graduation. The study suggests that there are perhaps some services which could be provided by the College in the area of graduate placement. (Author/CK)",

The study was divided into distinct phases. In Phase I, a procedure for identifying three &quot;most successful&quot; programs on each college campus was developed and implemented. In Phase II, characteristics of &quot;successful&quot; differences. The technique used in Phase I is the Delphi technique, which is a means of structuring communication to overcome these detrimental effects of open communication. Phase I began with a project planning conference whose primary objectives were to acquaint college representatives with the objectives of the study, to make necessary modifications in the plan, and to enlist local college support  for the field study. In all cases, agreement between Delphi panels was sufficient to identify three programs which met the project definition of success. In Phase II of the study, a questionnaire was developed and administered in a standardized interview of first-line administrative personnel of successful and &quot;other&quot; vocational education programs. Hypotheses tested were: (1) Vocational programs identified by Delphi panels as most successful have common identifiable characteristics; and (2) Vocational programs identified by Delphi panels as most successful differ from &quot;other&quot; programs in program characteristics. The essential results of the Phase II questionnaire are shown in tabular form. (CK)",

Emphasis in the initial project will be in the area of reading. To effect the link between resources and practitioner, a liaison researcher, serving as an active communication link or interface, will be employed. A survey instrument will be designed to identify and define specific research problems and needs related to reading in the target schools. Information from an established data bank on teachers, pupils, schools and  programs for the same schools will supplement survey findings. One goal of the project is to make target personnel more knowledgeable about research findings and how these findings may be utilized in their day to day teaching and supportive activities. A second goal is to provide information to local schools for the development of programs. At present, these local schools lack information resources and thus experience difficulty and frustration in establishing these programs. (Author)",

A method of fast written communication among certain key libraries, formed into an operating system, would provide a means of developing all the libraries in the state that wished to cooperate with others in providing better service to their patrons. With the decision at the state level to begin statewide implementation of subject specialization, and the increasing need to develop a more efficient interlibrary loan system, it was apparent that some kind of modern communications system was called for. A decision was made by Miss Ernestine Grafton, State Librarian, in the fall of 1969 to begin a teletype  network. In October of the same year, eleven libraries were interconnected on universal exchange of the Northwestern Bell Telephone TWX System. This manual is specifically designed to facilitate use of this system in participating libraries. (Author)",

        "description":"Almost all of the published work on the philosophical question of mechanical intelligence has argued in favor of one or the other of the polarities of possible positions. It is however possible to take a position between these two extremes, those of the True Believer and the Infidel. While this agnostic position is not a strong position in the sense of having a good many logically compelling arguments in its favor, it gains its viability by virtue of the weaknesses in the polar alternatives. Although agnosticism concerning the possibility of artificial intelligence is believed to be a position held by many computer scientists, there has been no attempt to present this position in the literature. In an attempt to remedy the situation, this report presents the agnostic's position  regarding artificial intelligence. (Author/NH)",

The traditional and new approaches are briefly compared and explained while the actual planning and development are discussed with an eye toward producing as an ultimate goal the ideal information center which if fully realized would not have a book on its shelves. The feedback techniques described can be further enhanced by introducing or modifying existing automated routines. The statistics thus derived would greatly assist future library planning. By incorporating the expert knowledge of the specialists in the various areas of interest the librarian operating under the Delphi approach gains an insight infrequently  realized that can lead to a more effective and efficient use of space and provide the patrons of a given library with the assurance that the material at their fingertips is of high relevance to their scholarly needs.

In recent years the provision of facsimile copy service has supplemented and in some instances supplanted the circulation of journals as the mechanism for accessibility to research materials. This study compares the cost of faculty photocopy service at Shiffman Medical Library for September, 1971 and March, 1972 with the projected cost of journal circulation for the same months. Appendix 1 summarizes the cost of facsimile copying for September, 1971 and appendix 2 summarizes these costs for March, 1972. These summaries indicate the number of persons requesting service as well as the service load per department. The total costs for  the services are $710.20 (September 1971) and $794.90 (March 1972). These costs are lower than the projected costs of journal circulation and the photocopy service had the additional advantage of freeing faculty time for other tasks. The economic and service advantages demonstrated in this report indicate that photocopy service for faculty members is the most feasible avenue of access to research materials in the university.

The cognitive task selected was the Goodenough-Harris Draw-A-Man Test. Subjects were 42 children, aged 4 through 6, and were randomly assigned to treatment, paternal or maternal instruction. The findings from the analysis of the change factors of the test indicated that the father was an effective agent in affecting pre-posttest increment in contrast to the non-intervention controls. Hypotheses indicating that paternal influence was more effective than maternal influence were only partially supported. Hypotheses concerning  cross-sex influence in producing positive and significant change were not found. The final hypothesis, that children instructed by a parent display more positive and significant pre-posttest increment than the control group, was clearly confirmed. A conclusion is that non-verbal learnings appear to be readily amenable to intervention. (LH)",

It describes the development of specific cognitive skills including conditioning; perceptual and discrimination learning; transfer; verbal learning and memory; and concept learning. The essay concludes with some generalizations. Massive changes occur in the child's intellectual capacities from birth to nine years. Children of the same age differ in learning capacities and the child's capacity varies with the way a task is presented. Children learn from systematic  experience from birth onward, and many tasks routinely regarded as relatively simple by adults require capabilities that many children do not achieve until late in the age range.

Are the results similar for children living in different environments? Five intervention programs are outlined: 1. Traditional nursery school; 2. Community Integrated program; 3. The Montessori method; 4. Karnes structured cognitive plan; and 5. The Bereiter-Englemann(B-E). As a result of the program, some children in the demonstration center no longer function in the retarded range. Behavior has improved and several have entered  a public school or preschool for normal children. It is suggested that mothers of infants might accomplish more at home with guidance, since professional tutoring is not feasibly practical, and children with higher IQ need special early programming to attain their potential.

Included in the February 1971 test battery were visual tests for attending to letter orientation, letter string order, and letter string detail; auditory tests for sound matching and sound blending; and learning rate tests for picture-sound association and word segmentation. For background information a letter-naming test was also included. Data were gathered on two forms of each  visual test by testing a child on the complete test battery one day and the alternate forms of the visual tests the preceding or following day. Item analyses, test reliabilities, test correlations, and descriptive statistics are reported for the test battery. Implications for further test revision are discussed. (Author)",

Activities emphasize language and concept development, the development of a positive self-image, and enrichment experiences. A program for parents operating concurrently includes home visits and contacts, group meetings, newsletters and homework, book, picture, and toy lending libraries, and a &quot;teaching tiny tots&quot; lesson plan. Results are reported which exceed expectations in language and measured IQ gains as well as in personal and social development. Parents  gained in knowledge of child growth and development.

        "description":"Giving names for pictures of familiar objects to nursery school children improves their later recognition of those pictures. This improvement occurs even though the children can easily name the pictures when asked. The present research eliminated the sufficiency of several possible explanations. The names might have provided a response to rehearse and consequently use to differentiate the recognition alternatives. But this explanation is insufficient since names help even for recognition tests containing distractors with the same names as the correct pictures. Names might have helped by providing specific retrieval cues. The child could then use this general knowledge in analyzing and storing specific characteristics. This explanation is insufficient since grossly incongruous  descriptions help recognition as do appropriate labels or descriptions. It seems that under these conditions any description which is itself meaningful stimulates a young child to more actively analyze and store accompanying pictures. The extreme non-specificity of this effect suggests caution in attributing labeling effects to specific characteristics associated with the label. (Author/RG)",

It discusses the origins, curriculum change, new concepts of intelligence and the various teaching methods such as Montessori and the British Infant School. Unlike previous generations, today's child is exposed to visual and auditory stimulation, and to forces converging simultaneously on the preschool curriculum. Events in technology, social and political changes, have exerted tremendous influence on revamping preschool educational programs. A checklist to determine whether or not the home provides for the development of early reading is offered, along with a Selected Book List for children of various ages. The need for emotional development and language skills is reviewed, good  experiential backgrounds on which to base language, and an interest in reading. Although the learning of reading is highly individualized, it appears that preschool children can learn to read earlier. The parent is warned, however, that worry about a child's inability to learn to read may handicap a child, and in that case instruction is best left to the school. Trust, encouragement and interest are suggested. (For related documents, see PS 005 928 - 929.) (RG)",

A group of 40 black and white males and females between the ages of 4 to 8 were tested. The methods used were: 1. Negative Word Association Task, 2. One-Dimension Description, 3. Coordinated Language, 4. Hungry Pig, 5. Transformation, 6. Language and Seriation, 7. Seriated Picture Comprehension, and 8. Clay Manipulation Task. The greatest performance differences occurred between ages 4 and 5, and ages 6 and 8, but race was not found to be a factor, and sex  emerged only twice as a significant variable. Comprehension appeared to precede and be a requisite for production of coordinated language during development. Results, though tentative, were thought to offer suggestions for future research.

It analyzes: (1) rate of deviant child behavior, (2) agents who affect it, and (3) relationship between rate of deviant child behavior and patterns of family interaction. Thirty-three families with a child 4 to 6 years old without treated behavior problems participated. Both parents, not under current psychiatric care, were living in the home, which included no more than four children. Results indicate that over 96% of the average child's behavior is  nondeviant and 35% of it represents positive social interaction. Even the most deviant child displayed 88% appropriate behavior. The average child, however, puts out responses which parents consider deviant once every 3.17 minutes. The probability is that the child will not obey one out of every four commands the parents give. The conclusion is that deviant behavior is more successful in coercing people to respond. (DJ)",

Traditionally, investigators have categorized a series of child behaviors as deviant based solely on their own assumptions with no empirical basis for classification. The present study was directed toward the deviation and comparison of two methods which could provide a more empirical classification base. In method 1, 66 parents of young children who had been recruited for observational research were given a questionnaire which required them to characterize the observed child behaviors as deviant or nondeviant. In method 2, behaviors were classified on the basis of the proportion of  aversive and positive consequences which they actually received during the observation period. Those behaviors which received less positive and more negative consequences were presumed to be viewed as more undesirable or deviant. Comparisons of the two methods revealed a significant degree of agreement between questionnaire and observational derived classification. (Author)",

In New York City about 40 children per year die from maltreatment (1% of deaths of children under six years of age). Many parents of battered children were battered themselves. Outward symptoms indicate maltreatment by abusive parents. Day care programs can recognize and report suspicious incidents, prevent abuse, help rehabilitate families and educate the public. When a report is made, the Department of Social Services can close a case, resolve it without recourse to the courts, or gain protection of the State for the child. The doctor treats the child and retains him until the appropriate Family Court  convenes. He is responsible for gathering the facts to be used in court proceedings. The court considers the facts, including the child's statements if he is old enough to talk, and makes the disposition of the case. It may suspend judgment, specify some particular form of conduct for the parents, or remove the child temporarily or permanently. A re-hearing may permit the return of the child to rehabilitated parents. The report concludes that a solution of this problem requires the full range of social, medical, psychiatric, legal and educational resources. (DJ)",

        "description":"In a cognitive-developmental analysis of achievement and moral judgments, 300 black and white subjects aged 4-18 made moral and achievement evaluative judgments in sixteen situations. The situations differed according to the intent (effort) and ability of the person being judged, and in the objective consequences of the behavior. Analysis of variance revealed that the three evaluative dimensions of intent, ability, and outcome are systematically used in both achievement and moral appraisal. Further, there are highly significant age trends. In both the achievement and the moral conditions subjective intent replace objective outcome as the main determinant of judgment. However, following the age of 12 in the achievement context, objective outcome again becomes the more important  determinant of evaluation. It is contended that society reinforces this more \"primitive\" developmental stage. Racial differences in the time of onset of the various stages were exhibited, although the sequence of evaluative stages was identical between racial and sex grouping. In addition, the data strongly support the position that achievement strivings are maintained by social reward, while moral behavior is controlled by social punishment. (Author)",

The nursery school is primarily a middle-class institution and as such does not attempt to provide an intellectually stimulating environment, since that is already available at home. Other sources of opposition to evaluation are its linkage to \"accountability\" and differences in value systems and specific goals. New approaches to preschool education now make the role of evaluation even more critical, and there are ways in which it can serve the teacher, such as making her aware of the most effective methods of teaching for specific types of children. Evaluation is further important in the parent-participation programs and in meeting legislative requirements.  Differences in kinds of evaluative data and in ways in which information can be collected are widespread, but concern should be with improving the relevance of evaluation as well as its technology.

A total of 413 children were tested using Kohn's Behavior Checklist and Competence Scale to assess their overt functioning in group settings. The study seems to support the usefulness of this instrument and procedure for identifying, at an early age, children who are later likely to have severe problems.

Some guidelines are provided for teachers of preschool classes, dealing with the importance of consistent routines, of allowing the child a choice in his classroom work, and of avoiding confusion and frustration when tasks are too difficult for the child. Aggression, defiance or withdrawal are less likely to occur as children learn new concepts and are more in control of their feelings. The four chapters are headed: I. Developing Impulse Control Through the Daily Routine; II. Classroom Structure and Impulse Control; III. Teacher Planning Can Prevent \"Management\" Problems; and IV. Classroom Hints.

Examining objects, acting them out, and experimenting with them, the child learns to make representations. By feeling, smelling, watching and describing, as well as dealing with real objects, the child's understanding is increased. At Object Level, children use real objects and places, while at Index Level, a child is helped to remember the whole object, given only one aspect or part of it, and uses his own mental images.

The Symbol Level, and 2. The Sign Level. It is noted that children cannot read or work with concepts they have not yet acquired, and that teaching alphabet, phonetics, and the actual writing of words, is probably not helpful for many at preschool level. It is also thought that preschool teaching might tend to interfere with learning to read or speak. Quiet Area activities are suggested, and that no child be pushed into large groups. The importance of environment is stressed, where speaking, writing and reading language is valued. (For related documents, see  PS 006 089-092, and PS 006 094.) (RG)",

The importance of conversing with a child instead of lecturing, and stimulating him with divergent questions are thought to be of help. Games and activities, having fun with languages, are suggested. The teacher must establish a way to relate to the child by speaking to him in a natural tone. The three chapters are concerned with: I. Encouraging Children to Speak; II. Helping Children Learn To Name, Describe, and Relate Things, People,  Places, and Events; and III. Preparing Children to Read and Write. (For Related Documents, see: PS 006 089-093.) (RG)",

It involves 150 children, ages 3, 4, and 5 from a rural isolated section who watched 170 daily television lessons broadcast over a commercial station, participated in a weekly group session of 10 to 15 children in a mobile classroom facility under the direction of a certified teacher, and received a weekly home visit from a paraprofessional teacher. Evaluation included overall effectiveness to the program, relation of student achievement to areas of program emphasis and an assessment of parents' attitude toward the program. Pre- and post-testing revealed that,  although the demonstration did not produce significant changes in IQ in comparison with the control group, such changes were obtained in the areas of pre-reading skills and in the overall achievement of the program's objectives. Parental attitude toward the program was highly positive. The successful operation of this demonstration of the HOPE Program by the Kanawha County Board of Education indicates that comparable results may be obtained when the program is replicated by school districts.

Results of the study, which used 405 students in selected classrooms, and which confirmed the hypotheses, indicated that: 1) A group of objects does exist which primary school children associate with school; 2) There are perceptual differences of the child and the adult, and there is need for evaluation of the adult-experimenter mode in selecting stimuli to be used in such studies; 3) There are differences between the lists precipitated by degree  of common experience, complexities of the classroom, and differential skills; 4) Perceptions of objects as school-related tend to be more uniform at the more advanced levels; and 5) Race and sex significantly affect primary school age children's perceptions of objects as school-related.

Assuming (1) that infants respond differently to novel situations than to familiar ones; (2) that the infant's pattern of response is a partial reflection of the process of acquiring a perceptual memory of the stimulus, and (3) that sex differences may occur in the rate of habituation, 120 infants either 12 or 18 weeks old received five presentations of a standard stimulus. After this, when the infant displayed a fixation of less than 3 seconds, the number of additional trials needed established their habituation criteria. Discrepancies of 0,1,2, or 3 arbitrary units were introduced on the next trial. Results indicate that while young infants took longer to habituate than older ones, they showed no differences in response to  discrepancies. If a new stimulus is presented before habituation is complete, infants respond differently than they would otherwise do. Conclusions are (1) Sex differences may reflect differences in maturation rates, (2) Developmental processes during the first few months of life may influence memorizing more than using what is learned and (3) Infants may moderate discrepancies by ignoring those he is not ready to assimilate.

        "description":"A classification of natal influences is proposed with a model of their operation. Natal influences affect maternal capacity, maternal load, and maternal efficiency. Since maternal load is increased in twin pregnancy, results of twin studies must be generalized with caution. The method of co-twin control is exemplified by examination of a small sample. The results of the intrapair analysis imply that current formulations of hereditary and environmental contributions to phenotypic variation are inadequate to account for observed intrapair differences. Two alternative, though nonexclusive, interpretations of intrapair variation are suggested. The first interpretation stresses the role of complex maternal-fetal-environmental interactions, and the second, a \"genetic indetermination\"  which derives, in part, from the information characteristics of the genes.

The Subjects were 30 boys and 30 girls in the fourth grade. An adult female experimenter administered Kagan's Matching Familiar Figures task to half the children of each sex to give a measure of the childrens' reflective or impulsive cognitive style. An adult male administered the task to the other half. Then the children were given a risk-taking task which consisted of ten toggle switches in the off position. Nine of the switches are safe; for each one the child moves a light comes on and the child received two cents. The tenth switch turns on a buzzer and the child must return his winnings. Two-way analysis of variance tests were done on the three dependent  variables. The only significant difference among these four groups was between boys and girls with a male experimenter. Girls took significantly more risks when working with the male experimenter. Expected relationships between risk-taking and cognitive style measures did not appear. A review of risk-taking studies is included in the introduction. Replication of the sex difference is recommended. (DJ)",

A questionnaire covering the environmental influences in the life of the child was asked of each mother, and the questions were analyzed to determine the relationship to the thinking ability of the children. Some of the findings were: marital status is more related to performance in black children than in white; father's occupation has a more differentiating effect in  blacks than in white in the semantic context; age is more effective for spatial abilities than for language; sex contributes little at this age level; race is more effective for language-based performance than for spatial relations; white children with higher scores seem to have more permissive, more concerned homes; black children with high performance seem to have highly structured homes with concerned, striving adults.

        "description":"The problem of measuring attitudes in preschool children is discussed. The general rationale employed is closely related to that of the semantic differential (SD). Research employing the SD with older children and adults has demonstrated that the primary dimension of affective meaning is that of evaluation. It has also been shown that evaluation scores from the SD are closely related to scores obtained from conventional attitude scales. It was demonstrated that a comparable evaluation dimension is present at the preschool level, and procedures were developed for assessing attitudes in preschool children employing this rationale. Procedures are picture-story techniques in which the child is shown a picture containing two figures and is told a story in which a positive or negative  adjective is employed. The child is asked to select the figure which he thinks is the one described in the story. This method has been used to assess preschooler's attitudes toward the colors white and black and toward human figures with light and dark skin-color. Findings and results of this and other studies are described and a new revised version of the Preschool Racial Attitude Measure is presented. Conclusions include: (1) A child's racial attitudes may be associated with certain parental variables, and (2) Racial attitudes may partially result from the child's early learning experiences involving light and darkness.

        "description":"This study was designed to examine the effectiveness of social reinforcement as a function of familiarity with the adult agent administering the reinforcers. First and fifth grade children were tested in a marble dropping task on two successive days. On the second day half of the children at each grade level were tested by the same experimenter (familiar condition) while a different experimenter (stranger condition) tested the other half. First graders were more responsive to social reinforcement provided by a familiar adult than by a stranger. Fifth graders tended to be equally responsive to social reinforcement from either a familiar adult or a stranger. These data failed to provide direct support for either the valence or arousal hypotheses of social reinforcement effects. A  cognitive interpretation was suggested to account for the data. Problems associated with experimental designs and dependent measures in studies assessing the effectiveness of social reinforcement were discussed. (Author)",

        "description":"The present study was undertaken to investigate the interplay of motivation, socio-emotional interactions between the child and his educators in the impact of early educational intervention on the later development of disadvantaged children. The study attempted to concentrate on obtaining a broad spectrum of the child's functioning and changes in the child's functioning over time. The focus was equally on immediate and long range effects of early educational intervention. By attempting to encompass a wide range of the child's functioning and a broad temporal span it was hoped to avoid ending up with fragmented findings. The children were drawn from four public schools located in an urban slum area. Negroes constitute seventy-one percent of the population in the target area. Each  of four schools in the area opened a nursery program for 15 four-year-old children. Each classroom had one head teacher and one assistant teacher. The classes operated four days a week; on the fifth day, the teachers were engaged in a continuation of their in-service training program, making home visits, and working closely with parents and school personnel. Three different types of measures were employed to assess development in the area of intellectual functioning: standardized intelligence tests, measures of academic achievement, and a measure of cognitive style. Measures of socio-emotional functioning were also employed. Two major findings are: (1) The three groups on entering school did not differ from each other on their intellectual functioning; and (2) Initial exposure to school  resulted in a larger increase in the level of intellectual functioning.

        "description":"This thumbnail review of the symbiosis between psychology and education is intended to suggest that perhaps those concerned with education have borrowed too uncritically the fashionable topics in psychology. What is of particular concern is the usefulness of the anxiety construct for research and theory dealing with individualized instruction (II), and attribute treatment interactions. Individualized instruction today implies individualization in only one respect: pupils proceed through the same materials, in pretty much the same way, but they do so at their own rate. Individualization of the method of instruction hinges upon the establishment of attribute treatment interactions (ATIs). The major purpose of this paper is to critically evaluate ATI studies in which anxiety has  been used at as the attribute variable. A comparison of the distinguishing characteristics of individualized and conventional instructional practices suggests a compelling rationale for expecting an interaction between anxiety and these two instructional strategies: In II, students are required to master a clearcut instructional objective; in conventional instruction, objectives are frequently non-existent and/or vague. Two other studies of this nature were reviewed. All of the studies reviewed are inconclusive regarding ATIs between anxiety and classroom instruction or II. However, the present rationale suggests that such interactions are possible. (CK)",

Information was sought concerning the following: (1) the maximum singing range of preschool children compared to that of first grade children, (2) the range within which accurate singing could be expected from the majority of kindergarten and first grade children, (3) the relative ease with which most children hear and vocally reproduce comparable major and minor melodies, and (4) the developmental stages in musical growth evidenced by kindergarten and first grade children. Related research is reviewed. The present study was conducted in two cities. The criterion test, administered as a game, was given individually to each child. Each item of the test was  played on a sing bell by the examiner, then sung by the examiner. The examiner then asked the child to sing the item. The entire test was recorded on magnetic tape for later evaluation. Results include: (1) The child in this stage of development habitually uses his speaking voice instead of his singing voice; (2) The child will normally sing in a vocal quality, but will not consistently perform the correct melodic direction; (3) There are two types of singers: the one who sings at the proper pitch level but evidences intonation problems, and the one who transposes the entire melody to another key; and (4) The child will sing most of the melody accurately. It is concluded that girls possess lower pitched voices than boys and blacks lower than whites and that white children have a wider  singing range than comparable black children. (CK)",

        "description":"The theoretical rationale underlying the present investigations begins with the assumption that perceptual categorization of racial groups is a prerequisite for subsequent attitude development. It is predicted that if increased perceptual similarity of other groups does indeed initiate attitude acquisition, then it follows that a decrease in similarity should conversely make it more difficult for the child to maintain negative attitudes. For the 1st study, 192 nursery school and kindergarten Ss were used. Half of the Ss were black and half white. In order to test the prediction, two-choice discrimination learning tasks were used to assess similarity. The tasks employed schematic facial drawings as discriminanda. Stimuli were presented by means of a Kendler-type apparatus with two  apertures. The findings are generally in accordance with the view that racial labels may increase the perceptual similarity of another race prior to the time that children enter the first grade. The second study sought to obtain data with regard to the question of what happens to attitudes when perceptual differentiation techniques are introduced. Ss were 96 black and white children from the second and sixth grade. The two tests of major interest to this study are the Projective Prejudice Test and a Social Distance Index. On both instruments, Ss were told that testers wanted to know what kinds of things make children want to be friendly with other children. Findings include: (1) Younger children expressed more prejudice, and (2) Both distinctive labeling and stimulus predifferentiation  training elicited lower prejudice scores than did a no-label control condition.

Contrary to Freudian and other hypotheses, separation protest was found to be related positively to maternal unresponsiveness to crying and negatively to maternal sensitivity to signals, while positive greetings had the converse of these relationships. The first factor yielded by a factor analysis seemed to reflect a security-insecurity dimension in an infant's organization of attachment behavior to his mother. The anxious cluster of behaviors included separation prgest and  crying on reunion, as well as crying when put down and frequency and duration of crying in general. The secure cluster included positive greetings on reunion and (to a lesser extent) following a separation, as well as positive responses both to being held and being put down.

This study focused on some of the problems faced by adolescent Native American Indians, as seen in a 100-year-old Indian Boarding School in western Oklahoma. It was contended, after working with some 400 students in the western plains area, that, though Native American Indians differed markedly from other minority groups and among themselves, adolescence has presented them with special problems which can be related to other minority groups. Another problem identified in the report was the unit of interaction between Native Americans and persons of European extraction--commonly referred to as the &quot;Indian Problem,&quot; this problem is actually a problem referring to the interface  between the 2 peoples. Other problems discussed were the disassimilation of the Indian, his confused state and world views, and the background of the Indian child. It was concluded that the symtomatology of Plains Indian adolescents of western Oklahoma had its roots in the reciprocal complementarity of inner conflict, social organization, ideological movements, and the assumptions of the educational systems to which they have been exposed.

In the San Juan Elementary School trilingual program, the time spent teaching Tewa decreases with grade level--from 2 90-minute periods per day for first graders to 2 30-minute classes per week for sixth graders. As a result of this program, students have exhibited a greater sense of cultural identity and openness, as is evidenced by the fact that the children use Tewa in participating in classroom discussions. Also, children have been willing to reveal their Tewa names. The positive effects of this program have been confirmed by some of the parents. That the Tewa language abilities of Indian children be identified and that the bilingual  approach be designed according to their needs are suggestions for future programs. (HBC)",

While in the beginning the goal of these institutions was to improve rural conditions by equalizing the economic and social status of all rural people, today there exists a conflict between the people and these institutions. The processes of institutionalization and audience politization along with the magnification of technology and resource wastage are in turn critically undermining program effectiveness. Thus, the Trinity is encountering continuing setbacks in the United States and Yugoslavia. Most Trinity institutions are preoccupied with maintaining &quot;existence&quot; rather than with fielding action programs to service the rural areas, and other institutions lack the resources. In  this paper, specific areas of conflict with the Trinity, as seen by the rural people and the field staff in the United States and Yugoslavia, are examined. Summary sketches of 2 to 3 conflicts stemming from program inconsistencies and paradoxes precede each of 3 questions: (1) Who is going to service the rural population? (2) Who is going to be serviced? and (3) What is the service going to consist of? Conflicts which are seen to be unfolding in the United States and Yugoslavia today are discussed. (NQ)",

Since the school design should be able to accommodate recent trends in teaching methodology and any future developments, space requirements, as well as how instructional programs relate to space, are discussed. Facilities for small, isolated elementary schools, which should be flexible and functional buildings, are described as they relate to kindergarten, primary, intermediate, upper, and special education programs in Alaska. This report presents activities  and learning experiences which have implications for construction and space and the current teaching methods used. Also given are the specifications for Alaskan teachers' living quarters. Alaska's rural high schools are discussed in terms of the educational program, learning environment, and special facilities needed. Suggested space and equipment allocations for schools of various sizes, the elementary classroom-teacher cluster, and the orientation with high schools are illustrated. (NQ)",

Although neither the full complement of faculty nor student body was available at these sessions, the evaluation team felt confident that those attending did furnish them with direct and honest responses. The administrative staff also assisted the team with all reports and data relative to the school program. Team members prepared individual position papers on major topics in the evaluation. These, in turn, were digested and combined with conference data into the final report. The transition evaluation was prepared to serve as a guide in Haskell's move toward full junior college status. The table of contents includes the following: (1) the objectives of a  comprehensive junior college; (2) an analysis of Haskell Indian Junior College--faculty, students, curriculum, facilities, and administration; (3) a summary of 17 recommendations; and (4) 6 appendixes--a bibliography of materials reviewed by the Haskell transition evaluation team, a history of Haskell Indian Junior College, 1972, a statement of the school's philosophy, minutes of the Haskell transition evaluation team meetings, the consultants' recommendations, and job descriptions of administrative personnel.

The general objectives which are realistic in terms of assisting the Hispano child to compete in his present school situation and in preparing him for future occupational and social endeavors are to (1) instill the desire to become a useful, contributing member of society; (2) develop an appreciation of the Hispano culture and heritage and for the American way of life; (3) develop acceptable standards of aspiration,  self-respect, good mental health, and the powers of self-expression; (4) increase his ability and proficiency in the use of the English language; (5) develop his ability to work in the typical classroom and compete with his peers; and (6) correlate English and Spanish in all areas of the curriculum where it is feasible. Specific recommendations are made in the areas of integration, use of Title I funds, curriculum, oral language, reading and other academic areas, personnel, and parental involvement. (Author/NQ)",

This proposal discusses 3 of the general objectives thought to be realistic in terms of assisting the Hispano child to compete in his present school situation and in preparing him for future occupational and social endeavors. These general objectives consist of integration, which is a vital and fundamental step towards attaining quality education; a relevant curriculum for all elementary pupils;  and the fostering of pride and identity in his own culture and heritage. The Congress proposed the formation by the Denver Public Schools of a task force in each area of study: (1) social studies, (2) language arts and humanities, and (3) math and science.

Its aim is to produce a citizenry that is knowledgeable concerning the biophysical environment and its related problems. Three major sections constitute the guide. Section 1, Biome Descriptions, gives a general and detailed description of plant communities in Powell County followed by their associated soil profiles. Section 2 offers a summary of field sites. Underdeveloped sites throughout the county are suggested which allow for study of water environments, biomes, soil areas, fire burns, clear cuts, pollution areas, animals, range  management, and geology. Established outdoor environmental areas in six communities are then covered in detail. This includes a general description of the area, choice of location, pictures and maps, and a site analysis chart of biotic and abiotic features. Sixty field activities which can be completed at the outdoor sites are enumerated in Section 3. Each activity gives topic of study, grade level, site(s) in which it may be undertaken, procedures, and related information. This work was prepared under an ESEA Title III contract. (BL)",

The hypothesis of the instructor is that in the broad field of social studies it is probably impossible for a teacher to answer all questions that students might ask, and that it might not be advisable to always answer all student questions even when the answer is known. The students view this theory as anti-intellectual. Reaction sheets are completed by the students following the instructor's experiment in classroom question and  answer techniques. (SHM)",

The objective of the sequent occupance unit is to illustrate the impact which the discovery and utilization of a large natural resource, namely, iron ore, can have on the development of a city, in the hope that students will then generalize to other areas and resources. In the latter half of the unit students examine the region of the South as a whole, taking note of different characteristics in different parts of the South, and try to decide what criteria are used to set the South off from other regions of the country.

In the study on Phoenix, the importance of irrigation, the development of new techniques, and inventions that resulted in a changing situation are presented. A case study on Los Angeles illustrates the use of land by various cultures, the development of a port city and railroad routes, change as a result of specific developmental factors, climatic influences, and today's urban problems. Sub-unit three, a study of Seattle, follows  the same kind of pattern as in other case studies.

The basic methodologies employed are the linguistic methods of Kenneth Pike and Claude Levi-Strauss for use in the analysis of social phenomena. Communicative mechanisms by which members of a group of addicts will establish and maintain the territorial integrity of their social subsystems are isolated and identified by the use of sound and visual recording devices in a controlled experiment attempting to examine the relationship of behavior patterns to the communicational patterns and interactional dynamics of the subjects. The use of audio-visual devices permits the investigator to repeatedly examine segments  of behavior. In the study of drug addiction it is necessary to examine the social and cultural matrices from which the pathology springs and the communicative networks, channels, and patterns which serve it and support it.

With major emphasis on democratization, the objectives of current experimental activities in education focus on structural changes, learning process, curriculum role of the teacher, evaluation of student achievement, physical facilities and equipment, organization of the school, and the role of the school in society. The NCIE not only makes administrative decisions about school reforms but also expends resources and personnel to carry out the decisions. Strategies include central planning  and control undertaken in close cooperation with schoolteachers in an attempt to implement and disseminate reforms throughout the whole educational system. Discussions in other chapters include a critical analysis of the NCIE; definitions and qualifications of experimentation and research, the process of innovation in education; an alternate model; and the nature of resistance and groups that resist change.

During the first year Markles Flats was in operation a strong leadership was lacking, some students were drifting and unruly, and community interaction  was somewhat neglected. Although pupils progressed academically at the same rate as students in other Ithaca junior high schools, on the positive side, the Markles Flats students evaluated their school higher, and a parents' organization was started.

Supplementing teachers' guides, the objective of the handbook is to give teachers confidence in teaching economics and, further, enthusiasm about the subject which they will relay to their students. The non-credit course is organized into general sessions handled by an economics instructor for approximately two-thirds of the available classroom time, with the remainder of the time handled by experienced classroom teachers holding grade-level meetings for smaller groups of teachers. Seven sessions of two to three hours each deal with a variety of instructional techniques of  interest to teachers, primarily lecturing, transparencies, films, problems, and quizzes. The handbook material suggests procedures for each of the grade level meetings, emphasizing discussion, and for general session meetings, offers short descriptions of topics, a list related instructional materials, and a brief description of how each session should be organized. The ten unit topics are on economics in general, producers, consumer economics, business and governments, specialization and trade, money and banking, economic growth and stability, jobs, income and unions, Oregon's public services and goods, and a review.

        "description":"This study describes the educational system and discusses major educational trends and problems in elementary, secondary, higher, agricultural, and vocational education of four major French speaking West African countries since their achievement of independence. One major problem considered is that rapid expansion of educational opportunity in terms of existing formal systems cannot be maintained in the 1970's because of limited resources, yet popular demand puts pressure on expansion since less than 50% of each age group attends school. Further, the existing formal education systems are not adapted to the needs of rural development--which is essential to economic development. A challenge for the 70's is to produce and implement new strategies for education. The book is divided  into six main sections. Education during the Colonial era from 1870 through 1960 is discussed in the first section. The next four sections present Republic characteristics, describe the education systems at all levels, including information on vocational and agricultural education, and explain educational expenditures of the four mainly agricultural Republics of Guinea, Mali, Senegal, and the Ivory Coast. The last section compares major characteristics of the educational system during the first decade of Independence and derives generalizations concerning common trends and problems. (Author/SJM)",

An extensive tryout conducted in 1965 in four areas of California, Illinois, Ohio, and New Jersey involved 47 teachers and approximately 2200 students in the formative evaluation. Teachers administered the School and College Ability Tests (SCAT), form 2A, and also the Introduction to Geography and Intra-Urban Unit Tests as pre-tests and post-tests. Students and teachers completed questionnaires on their impressions of the unit, as summarized in an appendix, responding positively. On the average, from the pre-test to the post-test of the  Intra-Urban unit test, there was a mean increase of 19 per cent in the number of students answering the questions correctly. Recommendations for improvement are that a greater variety of readings be included, more attention be focused on local communities, some activities need to be dropped because the unit is too long, and that the unit test, class discussions based on unit readings, and student exercises be examined and analyzed.

Fall 1970 pre-election and February 1971 post-election questionnaires provided the random sample survey data base. Major findings indicate that students identify with the Democratic Party; there is a close congruence between father and student party affiliation, and between the students' party preference and that of the local area; students tend to be active and engaged in higher order  political activities; students' age is unrelated to political participation; statistically, there is no difference in level of political activity engaged in by males and females; social class has no influence on level of political activity; one-half of the students under the legal voting age in 1970 expressed no party preference; the election recess was not successful in promoting student political participation; and the enfranchisement of 18-year olds will not greatly change present political patterns.

Differences in response to student radicalism and dissent involve the function of the school system and its teachers, the nature of the students' role in the educational setting, and attitudes toward dissent. The conservative views the school as a system developed to disseminate academic knowledge, preserve the power status quo in the school, and preserve student-teacher differentiation. The radical sees the school function as facilitating creation of a better environment which incorporates school-community cooperation, promoting interpersonal relationships, and, further, assisting in  development of a counter culture. To deal with conflict and change, the National Training Laboratory has emphasized several working principles: Administrators need to: 1) keep up with the facts and issues involved in the conflict; 2) open the channels of communication; 3) identify mutually-held goals; 4) encourage a non-violent approach; 5) act to meet the key issues in a reasonable, rational manner.

        "description":"School attendance, an element at the center of educational history, not only uncovers important aspects of day-to-day history of schools, but also reflects a broad social, economic, and demographic structure of the times in which patterns of school attendance record family decisions about formal education. Rather than studying school registers to investigate who went to school, this paper demonstrates how, through the census, the gross patterns of attendance among the children of any group can be studied. A case study of Hamilton, Ontario, during the year 1851, when the mean school attendance percentage was 40.8, and 1861, when the mean school attendance rose to 57.8, shows how, although the ethnic composition and family structures of the population remained similar, patterns of  school attendance changed dramatically. Factors, in addition to age, affecting school attendance were religion, ethnicity, occupation, wealth, and family size. The source of the increase was proportional; more children to school and the difference between groups remained as they were before. Despite the rise in school attendance among every group, the poorer groups did not gain an advantage of more schooling than other groups, so that for the most part, schooling still reflected and reinforced the class structure of this mid-nineteenth century Canadian city.

A projection and recommendations for bank policy and  operations responding to the changing situation of the '70s are suggested in part three. Besides the established areas of lending, technical, agricultural, teacher training, and improved secondary education, new and increased lending activities will focus on non-formal education and training, more efficient and productive education by means of curriculum reform and the coordinated use of new technologies, and management studies to improve the planning and control of educational systems.

Investigator-prepared student texts were published in three formats: pre-organizers, post-organizers, and no-organizers. Two investigator-constructed norm-referenced Anthropology Achievement Tests were administered at each grade level. A one-way fixed-effects analysis of covariance, with reading as covariate, used the class mean scores of the three treatment groups on Anthropology Achievement Test One and Two at each grade level to determine if the adjusted mean scores differed significantly (p .15) across treatment groups. Computed F ratios were non-significant at both grade levels when class means were used as the unit of  statistical analysis with reading as covariate. When class means were used as the unit of statistical analysis, the findings of the main treatment effect were consistent. The data did not produce evidence that pre- or post-organizers facilitate learning of structured anthropology materials at either the third or sixth grade. (Author)",

The objective of the study is to test the hypotheses that: (1) significant differences will be found between students' mean achievements in the basic subject matter areas across ability levels; (2) specific periods could be identified wherein students' achievement across ability levels and grade levels for respective countries becomes statistically different; and (3) factors could be identified which influence pupil achievement. Test instruments include the California Achievement Test, Otis Ability Test, a project-developed test, and other data-gathering methods. A few of the major  findings are that grade point averages are more significant predictors for student gains and levels of achievement than standardized achievement tests; high ability students consistently gain more than average or low ability students; British high ability students and U. S. average and low ability students show higher levels of achievement in reading than their respective counterparts; U. S. students register higher levels of achievement in language usage and in mathematics. Contents also include research related to this report, a broad overview of educational structure in both countries, and implications and recommendations of the research.

The objective of the symposium was to explore the QOL concept, to define QOL in terms of its components, and to develop suggested quantitative approaches to its use in guiding public policy. The articles are classified under the following five topics: 1) Defining \"Quality of Life\" Measures -- the State of the Art; 2) The \"Quality of Life\" Concept; 3) QOL: Environmental Perspectives; 4) QOL: Economic and  Social Perspectives; 5) QOL: Psychological Perspectives.

This definition, it is pointed out, implies that all the items on the test must measure the same thing. A classical test theory for criterion-referenced tests is derived.",

Teachers can evaluate students at the beginning of the school year to identify problems and again at the end of the year to evaluate progress. Definitions of the traits used are given. Traits examined are aggressive/submissive; social/nonsocial; independent/dependent; cooperative/uncooperative; eager/dull; talkative/uncommunicative; attentive/non-attentive; active/still; happy/sad; leads/follows; imaginative/prosaic;  persistent/nonpersistent; gregarious/lone; obedient/disobedient; and courteous/rude.

The social science content includes Site, Route and Boundary Components; Interdependence of Components; Economic, Political and Social Aspects of Components; Environmental Quality of Community; and Comparison of Communities in Different Parts of the World. The first segment of the IRSS program 1970-1971 was pilot-tested and analyzed in 1969-1970.  Evaluation of an expanded field test in 1970-1971 indicates an absence of cooperation in administering the program at the classroom level. (DJ)",

The program is a 10-week course for parents of three- and four year-old children, an educational Toy Library for the parents, and a training program for the teacher-librarians who will teach the course and operate the library. Two toys were rejected on the basis of the evaluation--color cubes and sifo shapes. Evaluation of the course by use of an open-ended questionnaire indicated that the parents felt more competent in helping their children and had a better understanding of what to expect of the child. Evaluation of the children's achievement was made through comparison of pretest and posttest scores on the Responsive Test. Results of the evaluation indicate that the children learned a  considerable amount because of their involvement with the program. (DJ)",

Measurements devices used were questionnaires for students, teachers, and randomly selected community residents; Iowa Test of Educational Development for all seniors; personal interviews with 50 parents and 50 non-parents; a school survey inventory for teachers; and a questionnaire for graduates for the past five years. Areas are identified as strength, acceptable, or problem areas. The community indicated concern over student freedom and had a negative attitude toward the teachers. The  teachers widely accept the New Design even though they express a desire for closer relations with the students. The students' general impression of the program is good. Achievement tests indicate that the learning rate does not differ significantly from the typical groups of seniors nationally. The graduates indicated that they received an education that adequately prepared them for life. (DJ)",

The effects of heterogeneity of variance, nonnormality, and nonlinear transformations of scales were studied separetely and in all combinations. Monte Carlo procedures were followed to generate random digits which had the following shapes: normal, positively skewed, negatively skewed, and leptokurtic. Interval, ordinal, and percentile rank transformations were used for all of the computations which were based on 5,000 sets of randomly generated numbers, each set containing either 5, 15, or 30 such numbers. A total of 1,332 combinations  of differences in shape of distribution, variance, size of sample, and type of scale were studied. The results indicate that the distribution or r do not deviate significantly from the theoretical distributions even under the most severe combinations of violations. However, there were many significant discrepancies for the t test. The results of this study lead to the conclusion that the t test is not as robust as generally thought and that researchers should consider all of the basic assumptions before applying this test to their data.

Samples of 30 perceptually handicapped (PH) and 30 normal subjects (N) were randomly selected from children so classified on the Frostig DTVP, providing they had IQ scores between 85 and 115 on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. The two samples were further stratified on sex and race. A test of visual memory for letter-like forms was administered to both samples in two presentations, one a group paper-and-pencil test and the other a machine presentation which provided reinforcements for correct responses. An &quot;X Design&quot; controlled for practice effect between the two presentations. Analysis of covariance was performed co-varying  the visual memory and IQ scores for both presentations. No significant differences in performance were found on either presentation of the visual memory tests, between the PH and N groups, between the sexes, or in the interaction of perception ability and sex. There was insufficient evidence to conclude that attention to the task was an important variable in perception testing. However, the use of DTVP in testing perceptual ability was found to be highly questionable. For related documents, see TM 002 117, 118.)",

It is an objective-projective technique that requires choice between two alternate types of behavior portrayed in pictures and accompanying verbal descriptions. Gumpgookies are amoeba-like creatures who behave in ways intended to show differences in motivation. The history of the development of the test is reviewed and results of extensive testing reported. Factors analyzed were school enjoyment, self evaluation, purposive behavior, self confidence and instrumental activity. Ethnic-cultural differences are examined. A major problem with the development was in regard to response sets which led to the conclusion that these may be more important in other tests than is recognized.  The paper concludes with a brief description of initial development of using the Gumpgookie technique to measure other traits in the affective domain such as warranted self-esteem, warranted other esteem, and integrity or responsibility.

The target occupational groups (Social Worker, Forest Ranger, Banker, and Mechanical Engineer) were chosen because they had been rated to represent extreme high-low combinations of mechanical competence and favorable-unfavorable view of technology. Responses to the questionnaire were analyzed by a 2 X 4 (sex of subject-by-target occupation) multivariate ANOVA. Differences between occupational group centroids were highly significant whereas other  contrasts were not. A discriminant function analysis reveals a two dimensional discriminant space in which the configuration of occupational groups reflected the rater-derived configuration.

        "description":"A survey of recent literature was undertaken to locate validity studies of paper-and-pencil tests which met the following criteria: (1) Studies were conducted in a business or industrial (i.e. non-education, non-military) setting; (2) Separate statistics were available for blacks and whites; (3) Race was not confounded with some outside variable which would preclude meaningful interpretation; (4) Necessary data were reported to enable a test of homogeneity of regression between racial groups. For each of 20 studies which met these criteria, a homogeneity of regression analysis was conducted on each predictor-criterion pair to determine if there were significant differences between blacks and whites in standard errors, slopes, or intercepts of the regression lines. The number of  significant differences in standard errors and in slopes was less than would be expected by chance, indicating that tests do not have differential validity between white and black groups. For intercepts, significant differences in excess of chance were obtained. The direction of the differences was such that job performance of blacks was overestimated by tests. (Author)",

        "description":"A technique for detecting and studying item (or test) x group interactions independent of differences in level or dispersion of the groups is described. It involves construction of a scatter plot with two groups represented, one on each axis. Each point in the scatter plot represents the coordinates of a measure of a characteristic for one group plotted against a measure of the same characteristic for the other group; and the set of N points in the scatter plot represented the variables under study. The shape of the ellipse represents the degree to which the two groups in question share similar profiles. One method of analysis is to measure the departure of each point from the major axis of the ellipse and to study specific items that are most aberrant. Another is to calculate  the variance associated with the item x interaction. Although the technique is not intended as a measure of item or test bias, it is useful in diagnosing cultural differences and comparing different types of groups. (Author/DJ)",

Two of the samples were constructed with the knowledge that no examinee could possibly have copied from the answer sheet of any other examinee in the sample. The third sample was taken entirely from a single center believed to be free of cheating. In each sample the answer sheet of each examinee was compared with the answer sheet of every other examinee. Eight detection indices were developed and distributions were run for possible operational use in making future judgments regarding examinees who were actually suspected of copying. Covariance analyses between samples indicated statistical but not practical significance, and  consequently it was judged that any one of the samples could serve the purposes of operational detection as well as either of the other two. Empirical tryout of the indices against known and admitted copiers gave some results which permitted the elimination of three of the indices from further use. Practical considerations removed a fourth, and further statistical study eliminated two others. The remaining two have been in successful operational use at Educational Testing Service for more than two years. (Author)",

The Rasch model is an adaptation from the theory of latent trait analysis. According to it, answering an item correctly is a function of the difficulty of the item and the ability of the person being tested. The raw scores serve as the basis for estimating the scale of ability. The author concludes that the properties of the Rasch analysis suggest solutions to a number of measurement problems in occupational engineering including developing and equating alternate forms of a test and estimating and interpreting changes in trainee performance. The item-free characteristics of this measurement model may allow the  development of individually tailored tests. (DJ)",

Item responses on a job satisfaction questionnaire administered to 219 professional workers and 242 semi-skilled customer workers were analyzed. Discriminant functional analysis was conducted on the total sample. Respondents were then randomly assigned to one of two subsamples. Two different discriminant function analyses were then undertaken to maximize group differences in each of the samples. Inconsistency of the results indicates that weights so derived are not generalizable to an independent sample from the same population. Though an increment in predictive efficiency of 11% might be realized with the differential weighting system, the  veracity of the increment is doubtful due to the failure of the differential weighting system to cross-validate. Investigating other weighting techniques, such as latent trait measurement models, empirical techniques for weighting each multiple-choice alternative of a test item, and confidence weighting, is suggested.

Evidence of inaccuracies of the assumptions underlying the corrections is adduced. The Pearson equations which rest on these assumptions are mentioned as a basis for scaling and equating procedures in existence. An alternative approach is suggested, and its application to anchored equating, vertical equating, scaling, and equating with mixed essay and objective material is described. The alternative approach consists of a principle for choosing objective  functions whose optimization would lead to a selection of conversion constants for equating. The principle is that equal equating test scores should be associated with equal reported scores on the average. Constrained optimizations are suggested where policy considerations so indicate.

Correlating teacher responses to each item with the mean class responses (across the 343 classes) disclosed a modest relationship between the two sets of evaluation: a median correlation of .21 for the items. In addition to the general lack of agreement between self- and student evaluations, there was also a tendency for teachers as a group to give themselves better ratings than their students did. Comparisons between student and faculty responses were also made across items, and a rank  correlation of .77 indicated a good deal of similarity in the way the two groups rank ordered the items. Discrepancies between individual teacher ratings and ratings given by the class were further analyzed for: (a) sex of the teacher (no difference found), (b) number of years of teaching experience (no difference), and (c) subject area of the course (differences noted for natural science courses vs. those in education and applied areas). Among other conclusions, the results of this study would argue for the collection of student ratings to supplement self ratings. (Author)",

Three variables were tested in an experiment using 96 third grade subjects--amount of training, number of alternates in an item, and number of items. The concept hierarchy involved an orderly progression from a concept involving one relevant of three varying dimensions through two relevant of four varying dimensions (concept 2) to four relevant of six varying dimensions (concept 3). This established the basis for computing mastery evaluation cut rules on the basis of the model. Reliable differences occurred for training level and for concept difficulty, but not for test length or item types. The results of the validity analysis were, in general, favorable to the model. It is thus concluded that  the proposed model is reasonably valid. This evidence could be used as a basis for a demonstration or experimental implementation of the model in an educational environment that uses mastery evaluation procedures. (DJ)",

        "description":"The basic objective of the study was to determine the validity of four new indices of item quality. Three of these were based on analyses of differential, empirical weights for item choices, and the fourth was designed to measure the relative attractiveness of distracters. A secondary objective was to ascertain the validity of the conventional discrimination indices. To attain these objectives, multiple-choice items designed to vary in quality with respect to nine common item-writing principles were prepared. The quality of each item was rated independently by three judges, and the average of their ratings was used as the criterion to determine the validity of the indices. The special test items were administered to a sample of college undergraduates, and the five indices were  computed on the basis of their responses. The data were analyzed, and the conventional discrimination index was found to be a moderately valid measure of item quality. The weighted combination of the new indices also appeared to be valid. Because all of the new indices did not operate in the way expected, however, it is suggested that further research on them is necessary before they are considered for practical use in test-construction projects.

High school girls classified the items from the MMPI Psychopathic Deviate scale into clusters representing different traits. These clusters agreed closely with the factors obtained in previous factor analyses of self-reports to these items and were highly similar for individual subjects. Desirability was substantially related to the clusters, but generally did not mediate their correspondence with the factors or each other. These results indicate that the lay theories possessed validity as well as communality and that desirability had a distinct but limited involvement with the theories.  (Author)",

Computers have radically changed the time required for data processing. In testing, many promising developments, such as Kristof's reliability for vector variables, latent class and latent struction models, one-factor ration scale in testing and Bayesian procedures, are still largely in the theoretical field. Interest in scaling did not become important until Messick applied methods previously developed to attitude scales in 1956. Multidimensional scaling techniques have recently been utilized in a number of research areas and applied fields. Factor analysis theories are reasonably well developed. Applications to aptitude tests have been made, but have been only  sketchily used in other fields in which they would be extremely valuable, such as economics, sociology, and physiology. In the field of mathematical learning theory, work needs to be done for individual learning curves and in comparing various stochastic and continuous models. Quantative psychology has moved a long way in 40 years. (DJ)",

Bayesian analysis is a set of procedures for changing opinions about a given phenomenon based upon rational observation of a set of data. The Bayesian arrives at a set of prior beliefs regarding some states of nature; he observes data in a study and then modifies his beliefs into posterior probabilities. The computational vehicle for determining posterior probabilities based upon observed data and prior beliefs is Bayes' theorem. Because of the problem of putting numerical values on prior information, the value of Bayesian ideas might ultimately be in the clarification of the classical approach rather than in substituting one for another. Application of the procedure to the concept of personal  probability is used as an example of how the technique might apply to education. (DJ)",

        "description":"A Performance Indicators in Education program has been developed in New York to serve both local and State needs. The performance of a school or school district may be defined as the difference between its actual output and its expected output. To obtain an equation for computing expected output, the academic status of students and a number of nonschool variables are analyzed. By entering a particular district's data on the variables used in the equation, an expected score is computed. If a district's actual score is higher than its expected score, the district is doing better than expected with the students it has and the conditions under which it operates. If a district's actual score is lower than its expected score, it is doing less well than expected. Using this rationale,  performance scores for reading and arithmetic at the elementary school level were computed for 630 school districts in New York State. The results, along with various kinds of descriptive data, are reported on a set of tables showing the district's percentile rank on each variable and the relation between actual and expected scores on eight output measures.

These data as well as pupil socioeconomic data were used to form a correlation matrix. The data were then subjected to a stepwise multiple regression routine using various posttests as the dependent variable. The results indicated that for the Stanford test data, the achievement continuum was consistent and significant, and suggested that there is a need for a greater emphasis on pupil creativity in language arts. For arithmetic, the  general achievement level in the Fall was less important to Arithmetic Application than to Concepts or Comprehension; the Creative Ability test figured prominently in all three subtests while the Creative Attitude test played a minor role. For non-Stanford data, academic achievement seemed to be a necessary correlate for Creative Ability but not for Creative Attitude; self-concept was influenced mainly by affective rather than cognitive variables, and attitude toward school measured slightly with everything.

They are: (1) their measurement forms, that is, student performance in relation to the performance of other students or with respect to some specific criterion; (2) general or specific kinds of objectives in which the measures are founded; and (3) their modes of construction, that is, reliance upon items that differentiate among students or items that reveal degree of mastery on a given objective. The results of examinations of how both kinds of measures are actually constructed and used, however, indicate that these kinds of distinctions are misleading and can weaken the overall value of the evaluation effort. It is recommended that, for evaluation purposes, the essential difference between  norm- and criterion-referenced measures should not be viewed as an intrinsic measurement difference but rather as a question of the interpretation of that measurement's results. With respect to ongoing evaluation, it is suggested that both norm- and criterion-referenced interpretations are needed for such diverse purposes as (1) identifying program components needing improvement, (2) identifying students needing special attention, (3) providing the basis for accountability systems, and (4) determining whether a program is being implemented as planned. It is concluded that unless both kinds of interpretations are made, realistic evaluations cannot be made. (Author)",

The logic is based on the conjecture that recruits who can learn a sample of the job requisites in a mini on-the-job training situation will demonstrate the same ability on the job. This is held to apply regardless of the recruit's low score on the usual classification tests. The initial and criterion tests are described and the correlations among the mini job learning test results and the usual Navy predictors are given, and the relationship of the derived cultural deprivation scores both to the usual Navy classification tests and the job learning tests is presented.

The various ways of generating the extended model (blocked circularity) are discussed. It is noted that a reduction to a canonical form is possible for the block circular case. Hypotheses representing block versions of sphericity, intraclass correlation, circular symmetry, and a general matrix are presented.

        "description":"Correlations between the Enrollee Test Battery (ETB) and performance on more conventional tests were examined to determine the ETB validity, in addition to a small-Scale study of predictive validity of both ETB and the conventional tests. Three types of paper and pencil measures were utilized: the ETB, conventional cognitive skills tests, and scales of criterion questionnaires. There were 23 tests in all. The study sample consisted of 74 (29 males and 45 females) predominantly black high school dropouts, between 14 and 17 years of age, who were enrolled in two Neighborhood Youth Corps Out-of-School projects. Answers to the criterion questionnaires were obtained from 44 of the enrollees six months after they had left the program. Predictive validity for the tests was examined by  correlating each of the 23 tests scores with factor scores derived from the questionnaire criterion scales for each of the three criterion samples--Program Completion, Post Program (Employed), and Post Program (Not Employed). Levels of concurrent validity for the ETB was determined from intercorrelations between the 17 tests of that battery and the 6 conventional cognitive skill measures. That matrix was also factor analyzed. Results of the study show that measures of the ETB, which was designed specifically for use with disadvantaged adolescents, appear fairly coherent and logical in their patterns of relationships with each other and with conventional cognitive skills tests.

The following reasons for opposition to behavioral objectives are explored: (1) meaningful objectives are often discarded because of difficulty in stating them as measurable outcomes; (2) there is confusion of the indicator with the objective; (3) emphasis is on the indicator rather than the goal; (4) there are restrictions on teacher strategy and measurement; (5) pre-determined tasks result in negative student attitude, and (6) measurements exclude self-evaluation and responsibility. An alternative program in which objectives and measurements are treated  separately offers the following advantages: (1) objectives can be expanded and defined as necessary for clarification; (2) objectives relevant to student interest are more appealing; (3) measurements are quite likely to be more relevant and less aversive to students; (4) it is easier to see the relationship between the measurement and the objective; (5) objectives do not restrict the teacher or student in selection of learning strategies; (6) more flexibility is allowed in measurement; and (7) opportunities can be capitalized on more easily.

A brief definition of the three domains--psychomotor (doing), cognitive (thinking), and affective (feeling)--is given, and it is pointed out that affect (Feelings) is present with either cognitive or psychomotor activity. The two dimensions of experience (positive or negative) are related to the responsibility of educators to provide positive experience for the student by building on what is meaningful to the individual student. Krathwohl, Bloom, and Masia's classification of affective objectives is then briefly discussed in relation to the two dimensions of experience. The dynamic aspects of the self are discussed and  presented in a taxonomy of affective behavior. The objects of affect frequently found in education are listed as (1) Self, (2) Others, (3) Society, (4) Learning, (5) Work, (6) Leisure Time, (7) Aesthetics, (8) The Natural World, and (9) Life. The need to determine what characteristics are important or essential to the well being of the individual and society and the behaviors associated with these characteristics, as well as the conditions and kinds of experiences necessary for their development, are pointed out. The implications of the model for education are that schools need to focus less on controlling the student and more on helping him develop self-direction and self-control.

Objectives for the program were delineated and students were chosen for the program on the basis of low or discrepant test scores and a willingness to participate. Evaluation of the program was based on the following measures: reading comprehension scores (pre- and post-tests on the Metropolitan Achievement Tests--comprehension section only for grades 1-8, and the  Mamaroneck Reading Attitude and Interest Inventory), attitude inventory, and qualitative data. The data showed that all but one group made progress; reading comprehension level was raised; pupil attitude showed no measurable change; parents and children were favorably disposed to the program; but teachers' reactions indicated little enthusiasm for the program.

The first paper states that in making a job performance evaluation, anything that can be specifically defined can be measured. However, to develop a testing program that is both useful and cost-effective, it must be known who will make what decision, using the obtained measurements. Analysis and interpretation of the particular purpose and setting are needed. Feedback data show how improved decisions can produce dollar gains far beyond the cost of developing and employing measurement. In the second paper, the essential elements of a quality control system are illustrated, including: (1) training objectives or performance requirements, (2) proficiency and diagnostic measures,  (3) data reductions and analysis, (4) procedures for decision and corrective action, (5) communication procedures, and (6) managerial support.

The first method assigned to each option of an item the mean standard score on the remaining items of all subjects choosing that option. The second procedure assigned the mean score on a parallel form of all persons choosing the option. When compared with formula scores, it was found that scores generated with the empirical weights were more reliable but less valid when correlated with undergraduate grade-point average (GPA). Test homogeneity was increased through empirical option weighting, and factor analysis revealed large increases in variance accounted for by the first factor. Examination of  the actual weights assigned to each option revealed that the weight for omit in most cases differed considerably from the weight which would be assigned under the usual formula score assumptions. It was suggested that the weighting procedures used tended to capitalize on omitting behavior which, although a highly reliable tendency, may actually be negatively related to the GPA criterion used.

Pupils in innovative plants made their strongest showing at the third-grade level, with boys stronger than girls. White third-grade boys' test results favored conventional schools, black boys, innovative schools. At the fifth-grade level white boys' test scores again favored conventional plants; eighth-year test results generally favored conventional plants for all sex/race groups except black boys. Correlation is  drawn between the test results and the length of time the fifth-year pupils had attended school in the county school system. Causal interpretations of the findings are dependent upon further analysis of the data and on future longitudinal studies to reduce the speculative elements involved in accepting data-based hypotheses about the programs' effectiveness.

        "description":"A methodology for busing to achieve school desegregation is described. Two different approaches are proposed: a student interracial contact score and a quota method. Travel time and number of children bused are proxies for busing costs. Useful data include travel time, school capacity, and student residences for each region and level of school. A higher ceiling on individual travel time allows greater balance within the area. For example, when contiguous districts are added, busing 25% of the students can achieve 95% desegregation with a 45-minute upper limit as opposed to 90% with a 35 minute upper limit. Portable classrooms are not very helpful nor is splitting schools into smaller grade spans. For the sample city, cost of raising desegregation from 41% to 85% was $16 million  ($25 per student). The critical factor in reducing costs is the greater use of each bus by shorter trips and an efficient system of staggering school starting hours. Alternatives to daily busing are described. (DJ)",

Measures of central tendency include the mean, median and mode. A second important class of descriptive statistics is measures of variability described by the standard deviation. Inferential statistics estimates what a total set of measures would be like on the basis of a sample. The standard error of the mean is a statistic that indicates an estimate of the reliability of the sample mean. The t-ratio is the ratio of the expected difference in a set of scores to the obtained difference. This can also be  interpreted in relation to the normal curve. The coefficient of correlation is a measure showing the relationship of measurements on one set of variables to the measurements on another set of variables. Two variables can be highly correlated without being causally connected. (DJ)",

The state legislature has appropriated $22.5 million for state-local performance pacts and an additional $500,000 for performance contracts to provide contractual relationships which involve the achievement of specific educational goals before payment is made. Sixty-eight school districts have entered into contractual relationship with the state to deliver guaranteed service. Allocations range from $7,000 to $11,800,000. The 1/2 million dollars for experimental performance contracts will be  competitively awarded on the basis of proposals from local and intermediate school districts. The six basic steps involved in the educational model are (1) identification of goals by each local school district; (2) development of performance objectives; (3) assessment of student-program needs; (4) analysis of delivery systems; (5) evaluation of programs; (6) recommendations for improvement.

Because the coder must classify unlisted occupations on the basis of general resemblance to available examples, the scale requires judgment. Using it, however, does not require much training. Duncan's Socioeconomic Index, which provides scores for occupations used in the 1950 census, can be used to code occupations directly. Coding is complex and requires much training. Modifications of the Hollingshead scale rearranged the format, reversed the direction of the scores, altered values of  businesses and farms to reflect 1971 dollars, and added categories for &quot;No Occupation,&quot;&quot;Don't Know,&quot;&quot;Not Ascertained,&quot; and &quot;Inapplicable.&quot; The modification of the Duncan SEI entailed a number of changes in the SED scores, census occupation and industry codes, and coding procedures.

The most powerful predictor tests were designed to provide a more adequate screening device than is currently available for the use of classroom teachers in grouping for reading instruction. A second major purpose of this study was to explore the relative contributions of perceptual-motor and cognitive intellectual ability measures at the first and third grade levels of reading instruction in order to suggest guidelines for instructional emphasis in teaching reading skills. Two hundred and four first grade students and 202 third  grade students were divided into validation groups and tested with various combinations of perceptual-motor tests and cognitive-intellectual tests at the beginning of the year. Their scores were correlated with their reading achievement scores at the end of the year with the higher correlations indicating the more effective batteries. Results indicate that perceptual motor tests were better predictors of reading achievement scores for first grade children while cognitive-intellectual tests were better for third graders. (DJ)",

The subject taking the test considers himself the 6th member of the group and responds at the end of each scene (1) to record responses which show a high degree of communication of empathetic understanding, and (2) to select from five alternatives the response which shows the highest degree of empathetic understanding. Results of the free response version showed an inter-rater reliability of .95. Correlation of the multiple choice version with the  Carkhuff Empathy Scale was modest, .56. Test 3 attempted to assess understanding of group dynamics. It demonstrates that some measurement of observational understanding is possible, but is still in the experimental stage.

Such categories overemphasize test interpretation rather than design characteristics of achievement tests. Data from most measurement situations may be reported or interpreted either according to criterion- or norm-referenced standards. How the test is developed and what it represents is of critical importance. The paper proposes alternative conceptualizations of test design: construct-referenced, objectives-referenced and domain-referenced. Using student data, the teacher needs to identify deficiencies in achievement, possible explanations, and remedies and to put the remedies into operation. An analysis of the utility of each test type results in the appraisal that  domain referenced tests provide the most information for teachers and therefore are the most desirable as data sources for instructional improvement. However, because of lack of knowledge about instruction, poor training in available instructional principles, and lack of resources to encourage changes in instructional habits, it is concluded that instructional improvement, even if measurement considerations were satisfied, is not imminent.

Data for the 56 tests were collected on 172 boys and 210 girls who had just completed the fifth grade. Six sets of derived factors, three orthogonal and three oblique, were interpreted. Six clear comparable common factors and one that is fairly clear were obtained for the boys.

The GATB consists of 12 tests which measure nine aptitudes: General Learning Ability; Verbal Aptitude; Numerical Aptitude; Spatial Aptitude; Form Perception; Clerical Perception; Motor Coordination; Finger Dexterity; and Manual Dexterity. The aptitude scores are standard scores with 100 as the average for the general working population, and a standard deviation of 20. Occupational norms are established in terms of minimum qualifying scores for each of the significant aptitude measures which, when combined, predict job performance. Cutting scores  are set only for those aptitudes which aid in predicting the performance of the job duties of the experimental sample. The GATB norms described are appropriate only for jobs with content similar to that shown in the job description presented in this report. A description of the validation sample is included. (AG)",

Six general types of dimensions are identified: 1) Ecological Dimensions which include both geographical and meteorological and architectural and physical design variables; 2) behavior settings, which are the only units thus far proposed which are characterized by both ecological and behavioral properties; 3) dimensions of organizational structure; 4) dimensions identifying the collective, personal and/or behavioral characteristics of the milieu inhabitants; 5) dimensions related to psychosocial characteristics and organizational climates; and 6) variables relevant to the functional or reinforcement analyses of environments. The six categories of dimensions  are non-exclusive, overlapping and mutually interrelated. Their common relevance is that each has been conceptualized and shown to have important effects on individual and group behavior. The overview presented is necessarily incomplete and sketchy but serves to illustrate the broad range of dimensions relevant to this area. Implications for a robust and socially relevant environmental psychology are considered. (Author)",

        "description":"The stability of reading performance, as measured by the Metropolitan Achievement Tests, Iowa Tests of Basic Skills, and Iowa Tests of Educational Development, was studied using students in grades 1 through 7 and grades 9 and 11. A reading vocabulary test and a reading comprehension test are included in all three test batteries. The standard scores on the three tests were pooled to obtain a composite reading score for three independent samples of students. Sample I consisted of grades 3-6 and 9 and 11, the number of students varying from a low of 71 (grade 5) to a high of 1,116 (grade 9); Sample II was made up of students from grades 1-7 and grade 9, the number varying from 520 (grade 2) to 1,240 (grade 7); and Sample III contained students from grades 1-6, varying in number from  1,095 (grade 6) to 1,320 (grade 1). Results of the study showed that substantial long-term stability was reflected in both the vocabulary and comprehension tests; grade 1 scores correlated above .5 with all subsequent measures. By the end of the primary grades, students' scores correlated above .70 with all subsequent measures. When the coefficients were correlated for attenuation to allow an estimate of the relationships after errors of measurement on the test were removed, the values were about .10 higher. It is concluded that although reading does not represent temporary maturational status for most pupils, it does have substantial relationship with terminal achievement levels in both reading vocabulary and comprehension.

The invariance of the Rasch item easiness estimates was shown to be related to the goodness-of-fit of the items to the Rasch model. The deletion of items with low Rasch probabilities increased the invariance of the Rasch item easiness estimates. Estimates of the amount of ability indicated by the raw  scores on a test (ability estimates) were also shown to be invariant with respect to the ability of the calibrating sample for tests of 25 or more items, even when relatively small samples were employed.

Much of the advocacy of the criterion-referenced test, however, seems to be less an illustration of that test's merits than an attack on the supposed deficiencies of the norm-referenced test. It is argued that norm-referenced tests are automatically biased against minorities, \"do not help the learner to learn.\" and are not related to today's curriculum. It is pointed out that while such arguments may be true of some norm-referenced tests, criterion-referencing does not automatically correct such shortcomings. It is also pointed out that both types of tests have a place along the continuum of  measurement uses and that publishers must take the lead in developing appropriate instruments for the teacher's use, whether these be called formative, criterion-referenced, or diagnostic. Finally, it is pointed out, the criterion-referenced movement can be a process which forces one to be clear about goals before one starts. (Author/CK)",

The items for the Inventory came from a critical analysis of the literature fundamental to the nongraded school movement: (1) individual differences, (2) pupil evaluation and progress, (3) curriculum, (4) instruction, and (5) organization for learning. These areas formed the subdivisions of the Inventory. In all, 104 items were developed for the five areas: individual differences, pupil evaluation and progress, curriculum, instruction, and organization for learning. Since two types of information are required: (1) knowledge and (2) acceptance of theoretical foundations of the nongraded school movement, each  item called for two answers. The rationale for the Inventory is: If the Inventory is to assist educators actively engaged in nongrading the school's instructional program, it should isolate for them areas where the staff's knowledge and/or acceptance of the principles involved is such that it is unlikely for this aspect of nongrading to be operative in the instructional program. The efficient identification of such areas may enable educators to institute procedures to rectify the situation and possibly heighten the chances of having a truly nongraded program in their school.

Following each criteria, spaces are provided for recording estimates of time spent in the activities, and some of the possible implications of various estimates are discussed. The importance of this method of examining the processes and experiences of the classroom is seen to lie in the fact  that teachers become aware of their priorities as evidenced by the varying degrees of emphasis in activities over which they have control, and thus should be in a position to rationally confirm or modify their value priorities.

Scale A, Planning Orientation, includes items dealing with: Concern with Choice, Specificity of Planning, and Self-estimated Amount of  Occupational Information. Scale B, Resources for Exploration, involves a self-rated assessment of resources for use in planning. Scale C, Information and Decision Making, assesses the students' possession of actual occupational information and his knowledge of how to integrate personal and occupational information into educational and vocational decisions.

Level of confrontation was measured from audio-tape ratings made by the student counselors in counseling sessions. Personality variable were taken from the student counselors' scores on 18 scales of the CPI. Spearman's rank correlation method was employed to test for agreement between level of confrontation and each of the personality variables. The t test was utilized as the statistical procedure to test the significance of the rank correlation, and the .05 level of confidence was used. The findings revealed that  three personality variables related significantly with the level of confrontation. The three personality variables were Capacity for Status, Sense of Well-Being, and Achievement via Conformance. The remaining 15 personality variables were found not to relate significantly to the level of confrontation. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"The effects of a new curriculum, introduced at Hiram College in 1969, which emphasized interdisciplinary studies, increased freedom and responsibility, and eliminated traditional graduation requirements in favor of nondepartmental courses, more electives, and more individual faculty attention for freshman, were studied. The research strategy was to compare the development during college of old and new curriculum students in the areas of (1) satisfaction with various aspects of the college; (2) intellectual, social, and emotional attitudes and values; and (3) academic achievement in English and in traditional general education fields. The data were collected over a three-year period, using the 9-item Satisfaction with Hiram Scales, the Omnibus Personality Inventory (OPI), CEEB  English Achievement, and five Survey of College Achievement scales. Three freshman groups, one old curriculum and two new curriculum, were tested for satisfaction and English achievement before and at the end of the freshman year. In addition, attitude and achievement scores of the last group to spend two years under the old curriculum were compared with corresponding scores of the first group to finish two years under the new program. Only standards admissions data were available as input measures for the old curriculum students. Study results showed that: there was significantly less disillusion and more year-end satisfaction with the new program among freshmen; new program sophomores were higher than the old on several OPI &quot;intellectual&quot; disposition scales and felt better adjusted than  did the old group; new program freshmen scored higher on English achievement than did the old group; and new group sophomores scored as high as the old in five traditional academic areas.

ESEA Title VI provided pilot funds Cluster III B classes to explore the city on field trips related to school work. Eighteen teachers and 270 pupils (primary through high school) could plan a trip a month, by classroom or by school. The classes visited 72 sites which introduced pupils to services offered for their recreation, health, welfare, transportation, and commerce. Trip destinations included parks, hospitals, the airport, and shops. Each class dined at a restaurant. Follow-up activities in the classroom reinforced the goal-directed and incidental learning. Near the end of the year, teachers submitted general community  awareness questions for a simple multiple-choice test. The test was given to pupils in the program, a similar low-income inner-city EMR comparison group, and a white middle-class outer-city EMR group. Those primary and elementary pupils who were in the program groups scored significantly higher than their inner-city peers which meant that the field trips had been of value. Outer-city primary/elementary pupils scored as high as the program group, indicating that something (most likely families of a higher socio-economic level) had supplied them with knowledge of the community. This finding demonstrated that the program was compensatory for primary/elementary EMR pupils. According to test scores, inner-city junior and senior high EMR students did not increase their community awareness as a  result of the program. Expansion of the program at the primary-elementary level in the inner-city was recommended. (Author/CK)",

The primary organizational concepts found in Project Focus are team teaching, flexibility in scheduling, role redefinition for teachers and administrators, and community involvement. There are six Focus elementary schools. Project Impact uses the same fundamental organizational concepts as Project Focus. Impact projects are to be found in one senior high, four junior high schools, and three elementary schools. The specific goals of the two programs were as follows:  (1) to improve the self-concept of students; (2) to improve pupil achievement in the basic skills of reading, mathematics, and other essentials; (3) to stimulate intellectual curiosity and the self-motivation to learn; (4) to help students become more self-directed and self-disciplined; and, (5) to help students develop satisfying human relationships.

The questionnaire elicits opinions on several discrete though related themes, and was pilot tested and first used in the present study. The results of the study support the conclusion that metropolitan location should be treated as an important independent variable in future research. Youth in or near the inner city appear to be more negative about their neighborhoods than are youth elsewhere in the metropolitan area. Consistent indications were found throughout the study that students in one of the two upper middle class schools in the sample  were less satisfied with and less well integrated into their neighborhood and its institutions than were respondents in other communities. Fragmentary evidence was found indicating that youth in middle class neighborhoods may perceive their neighborhoods to be less stimulating than do youth elsewhere in the metropolitan area. An impressive percentage of students reported that they felt they could turn in time of emergency to sources of help available &quot;nearby&quot; in their neighborhoods. (Author/JM)",

The study was undertaken with the expectation that some of the cross-cultural similarities observed in previous studies would be replicated, but also that much would be learned about the unique ways of role perception within subcultures of the United States. Role behaviors were elicited from members of the subject population by means of  an open-ended questionnaire. Stimulus role pairs were obtained by random selection from a list of 27 stimulus persons used in previous research. Each subject was asked to write three behaviors which could occur between the two persons listed. A total of 21 such pairs was used. As in previous research elicitation, questionnaires were &quot;decentered&quot; by asking five black consultants to translate them into &quot;Black English&quot; and back again. The major advantage of the decentered version in standard English is that it contains mostly words that are familiar to ghetto blacks. (Author/JM)",

It was decided to select such magazines appearing between 1965 and 1969 that had a wide circulation among black readership. The study was restricted to 36 short stories which contained some interactions between black and white characters. Each interaction was viewed as involving an initiator (Actor) and an object (Recipient) toward whom the interaction was directed. The Actor and Recipient together constituted a role-pair. The results indicate that blacks perceived whites initiating the interactions more in general than the blacks. However further analysis  revealed that the blacks were seen as initiating more interactions when they were in the role-pairs of female-male, employee-employer, person helped-helping profession, citizen-police official, citizen-public official, and female-female; whereas whites initiate more interactions when they are in the role-pairs of male-female, employer-employee, helping profession-person helped, police official-citizen, public official-citizen, teacher-student, and male-male.

This situation is particularly serious for the school children, who are classified as &quot;white&quot; or &quot;nonwhite&quot; but never as Puerto Rican. A second impediment permeating all Puerto Rican problems is the language barrier. Agencies in Boston and Springfield consistently had insufficient Spanish-speaking personnel, placing the Puerto Rican in the fringe area of a man who knows his needs but who can find no one to listen. The report is based on three sources of  information: statements of speakers at an open meeting held May 11-13, 1971; exhibits submitted directly to the Committee; and telephone conversations with speakers following the open meeting.

        "description":"Three experiments compared cognitive processes in Caucasian nursery school children from different socioeconomic backgrounds who were equated for performance on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. The first demonstrated that children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds experience more difficulty in solving a series of extradimensional and intradimensional shifts than children from high socioeconomic backgrounds. This deficiency was postulated to result from a decreased rate of attentional response acquisition which is offset with experience. The second experiment demonstrated that low socioeconomic status children organize their recall of categorized and non-categorized lists to the same extent as high socioeconomic status children but are less effective in filtering  inappropriate items from recall output. The final experiment demonstrated that children could identify stimuli presented via the visual and tactual modes and could make cross modal judgments regarding the equivalence of these stimuli. There were no effects of socioeconomic status on this ability, and extramodal are easier than intramodal judgments. Overall, the results do not support a simple notion of a deficiency of complex cognitive processes in lower class children. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The conviction that a complete reform of the educational system was necessary has won over the minds of the Spanish people and the government. The observations made from all levels about the bases of the educational policy were borne in mind in the preparation of the Draft Law of Education and Financing of the Educational Reform, which, having been approved by the government in September 1969, was presented to Parliament by the Ministry of Education and Science in April 1970; 13,000 amendments were made to the Draft, published August 4, 1970. The Spanish Reform Bill is inspired with the conviction that all those who share in educational tasks must be committed to the success of educational work, and that those who are responsible for these tasks must have their minds open to  experiment, reform, and collaboration from whatever source this may come. The concept of social integration is one of the ideological keystones of the reform. The legal methods for achieving it are that General Basic Education shall be compulsory and free in all public and private sectors. The inter-relation between the different educational levels is another of the notable characteristics of the new systems. It is also sought to improve the yield and quality of the education system.

        "description":"A survey in the fall of 1969 revealed that of the 51 major cities which responded to a questionnaire, only four did not employ their own security officers or use city policemen in daily school operations. It is contended that it is impossible for a favorable climate for learning to be established within this type of environment. Further, it is believed that this visible manifestation of the problem of security in the schools only represents the surface of a much greater problem. It is the position of the National Urban League (NUL) that security personnel and armed policemen should generally be removed as permanent fixtures in our schools. NUL should call on students, community members, and educational personnel to determine ways to develop a climate for learning in the public  and private schools. These groups must form an effective coalition directed toward quality education in an atmosphere of trust, cooperation, and mutual respect. The problem of \"security\" in the schools is nothing new to the established American educational experience. The use of law enforcement agencies to insure safety of the children and the smooth operation of schools is deeply rooted in American history. The unchallenged use of more and more security forces in our schools must be reversed. [Due to the quality of the original, parts of this document are not clearly legible.] (Author/JM)",

        "description":"About 25.6 million persons were below the low-income level in 1971, according to the results of the Current Population Survey conducted in March, 1972, by the Bureau of the Census. The sex of the family head continues to be an important factor in the poverty status of families. Families with a female head in 1971 accounted for only 12 percent of all families, but 40 percent of the low-income families. White families headed by a female accounted for about one-third of all white families in the low-income category; the corresponding figure for Negroes was about three-fifths. Although the total number of low-income families did not change over the past year, the proportion headed by a woman increased from 37 percent in 1970 to 40 percent in 1971 with a corresponding decrease in the  percent of low-income families which were headed by a man. In 1971, one-tenth of all white persons were in the low-income category as compared to about one-third for Negroes. There are significant differences in the age composition of the white and Negro low-income groups. In 1971, children under 18 years accounted for about 36 percent of all white persons below the low-income level as compared to 52 percent of all low-income Negroes. In contrast, aged family heads (65 years and over) and aged unrelated individuals comprised about 17 percent of all low-income whites, but only about seven percent of the low-income Negroes.

        "description":"If community psychology is a discipline of principles, methods, and techniques designed to adapt tomorrow's psychologists to a community orientation and commitment, then ecological parameters necessarily become fundamental concerns. It is no revelation that urban America, particularly the central city, is characteristically the home site of \"Black America.\" What are the ecological implications of this life style, or pattern, for community psychology's development? A fundamental implication for community psychology curricula suggests an emphasis on the phenomena of power and oppression in community dynamics. It is within this framework that the community psychologist can be seen as a \"social interventionist\" with a mission of assisting the power structure or bureaucracy to become  more responsive to the needs of its clientele while simultaneously promoting people power by assisting community residents to cope and deal with the system's institutions. One means of implementing this educational process is to focus on a given neighborhood base. Further, it seems appropriate to attempt to study the role as community resources of selected neighborhood-based community institutions for both the people they serve and the power structure with which they interface.

The Visual Arts experimental program covered a ten-week period involving six student teachers from the College of Education, Florida Technological University, and 24 classroom teachers and 541 students in grades one through six in the Grand Avenue Elementary School. Twelve of the classroom teachers and two of each of the six grades comprised the control group, with the remaining 12 classroom teachers and two of each of the remaining six grades providing the pilot group. The student teachers spent the entire  school day of every week at the elementary school. Each student teacher was responsible for two pilot classrooms of the same grade for the total 10 week period. An art lesson was presented by the student teacher every day in each classroom. The remaining time was spent in the same classrooms observing, identifying student needs, developing art-related materials to be used by the classroom teacher in other disciplines, and in individual supportive advice and instruction.

In Park School, the process of community involvement has been characterized by bitterness, hostility, and distrust. After September 1970, with the assignment of new personnel and the formation of new structures--the Task Force and the Park School/Community Council--a new context of school-community relations was created. In this context, new programs were developed in an attempt to overcome the crucial problems of low reading ability and the isolation of the school from its surrounding community. The basic problem remains at Park, as at other inner city schools--children from  working-class homes simply do not do as well in school as middle-class children do; the correlation between low occupational category and placement in special education programs has been paralleled by a similar correlation between attendance at inner city schools and both low scores on reading tests and placement in two-year secondary school programs. What is generally agreed to be a basic cause is that the home and the school in low socio-economic areas are engaged in a conflict of values.

Near the end of the first year of the desegregation program, the principal investigator was asked by the School Board to make a survey of the students' attitudes toward the program. Following the second year of the program, the principal investigator was again asked to conduct a survey to determine what changes in attitude had occurred over the past school year. The investigation reported here is the third in this series of surveys, and is designed to measure the attitudes of graduating high school seniors to a school integration program that began when the students were enrolled in seventh grade classes in the community. By means  of a mail survey conducted in the summer of 1970, students were asked questions concerning interracial friendships they made and developed during school, their experiences with interracial violence and aggression, their evaluation of the pursuit of education in an integrated school, their perception of social mixing on the part of other students, the quality of education they received in integrated classes, and their own experiences with interracial dating.

An introductory chapter describes the development of the objectives and presents the format and ways to use this report. The objectives are presented in 10 chapters, one chapter for each of the 10 major classifications of functions required of teachers and teacher-coordinators. A final chapter suggests ways to use the guidelines. Illustrations are provided for the development of  a conceptual framework for modules in the execution of instruction category, a sample module with performance objectives, and learning experiences and assessment instruments based upon the materials provided in a general objective. Suggestions also are made for the development of performance objectives based upon general objectives in other categories of pedagogical functions. (Author)",

The Center for Vocational and Technical Education executed this program by developing a curriculum model and by conducting five regional training workshops. The workshops had two purposes, the primary one to evolve a basic curriculum package from the model and the secondary to train instructors and improve teaching skills. The curriculum package consisted of a course guide, the instructor's lesson plan guide, and a student study guide. The workshops provided 30 hours of teacher training for the 64  participants from 35 States, a nationwide sampling selected for their knowledge of accident investigation and major teaching or coordinating responsibilities. The curriculum package developed at the workshops is not a final product; field testing and evaluation will be performed before acceptance and publication. The report includes pre-workshop information, workshop programs, and participant evaluation forms. (CD)",

To fulfill these purposes, interviews were conducted with appropriate officials of the Departments of Labor and of Health, Education and  Welfare and with appropriate state officials. In addition a review was made of records relating to IR programs in 12 states and on-site visits to 92 IR institutions. Some general conclusions were: (1) the IR program provides a wider range of occupational offerings (mainly for men) and a longer training period, at a lower cost to the federal government, than any other form of training; and (2) the approach to training is traditional &quot;locked-step&quot; rather than individualized and lacking in innovative features.

The lack of skills shortages was admitted to be the main reason for the shortcomings in performance, although the term &quot;skills shortage&quot; had yet to be defined and skills shortage occupations had not been identified. Of 905 demand occupations identified in 14 labor market areas, 156 occupations fell within MDTA's scope and of these, there were institutional manpower training programs for 88. Other inhibitors of program effectiveness and related problems include: (1) lack of a system to define or identify demand occupations at the local level, (2) restrictions imposed on present job training programs, and (3) the  questionable benefits to be derived by adding additional training programs. Data were collected nationally by examining hard-to-fill job orders at government employment services, performing a want-ad analysis, and interviewing over 25 employers as well as others knowledgeable about manpower conditions.

Critical incidents were obtained through personal interviews with 224 students and 28 teachers. Analyses were performed contrasting student achievement and the critical incidents across subject areas, across technical school districts, within separate subject areas, and across five models of individualized instruction and four class  scheduling patterns. Some principal findings were: (1) Higher grades and fewer course incompletes or withdrawals were received by students who possessed these characteristics, previous experience in the subject, high school graduation, and enrollment in an associate degree program; and (2) Course characteristics which were most effective included student-pacing of their own programs, use of pretesting to place students within a course, student selection of special study topics, and use of different types of testing procedures.

Activities carried out during the study included: (1) selection of four secondary schools for intensive study, (2) administration of a questionnaire to assess student perceptions and value orientations, (3) development of school-community profiles for each of the 15 schools in the district, and (4) a national canvass of all school systems with a student  population of over 50,000. Results of the study revealed that there is an identifiable need for a career development program and, within the context of career development, a need for expanded vocational education opportunities. The greatest need appears to be in the inner-city schools. However, the study indicates that a majority of the students who are disenchanted by the school system are not exclusively in inner-city schools; hence, the phenomenon of student dissonance should be recognized as a city-wide concern. On the basis of the results of this study, it is recommended that the concepts of career education and community-based education be combined into a program of career development.

Previous education and training was found to reduce the amount of job training required. A shutdown of the plant being studied did not provide an appropriate test of transfer of skills from that plant to other employment, although the prior skill development was a major influence in transfer to new jobs.

This information was then related to career opportunities in the District. The results revealed that Grade 8 and 12 students preferred television as a source for career information, while adults thought daily newspapers were better career information sources. Awareness of VTAE by the survey population was not a problem, but they frequently did not realize the  variety of offerings and opportunities available to persons in employment training. General goals for over one-third of them included colleges, while one-fifth to one-fourth were destined for a vocational-technical school and an equal amount for employment. The main career interests of students tended to be inbusiness and office, health, public services, and transportation. These career decisions were influenced by parents, teachers, brochures, friends, television, magazines, and career days. (SB)",

To reduce the dropout rate, develop options in vocational education, and utilize existing resources more fully, an investigative team of 26 vocational teachers and counselors representing business education and related fields at the secondary and post-secondary level used questionnaires and interviews to gather data on six occupations: (1) accountants-bookkeepers, (2) office clerks, (3) sales clerks, (4) secretaries, (5) stenographers, and (6) administrative-management trainees. Covering 428 interviews  involving 160 jobs with 112 employers in a 21-county North Mississippi area, a nation-wide research advisory committee of educators provided positive and valuable business and community feedback for the project. Recommendations presented include: (1) career guidance for Grades 7 and 8, (2) general and specific responsibilities for program initiation in Grade 9, and (3) the encouragement of the development of essential materials through research grants.

        "description":"The relative efficiency of various manpower programs as seen through cost-benefit analysis is assessed, and the contribution that cost-benefit analysis has made in evaluating manpower programs is discussed, taking into account a variety of methodologies presented in different studies. Vocational rehabilitation appears to yield the highest benefit-cost ratios, followed by programs involving on-the-job training, vocational education in vocational high schools, out-of-school institutional retraining programs, post-secondary vocational education, Job Corps, and drop-out prevention programs. Comparisons of these activities are hindered by economists' failure to agree on a common methodology for conducting cost-benefit research, the existence of unmeasured benefits and costs, the  absence of good cost data, and insufficient economic commitment. Deficiencies in cost-benefit analysis appear to be minimized when the analysis is directed at the internal operation of programs. It is in this direction that cost-benefit analysis particularly needs to be developed. (Author/AG)",

Data were analyzed in order to make recommendations for program improvement and to determine if  the course content was suited to the needs of beginning vocational education teachers. Results indicated that: (1) Treated groups rated their own performance higher; (2) The procedures taught in the course were utilized by program participants; (3) The relevance and effectiveness of the program increased the participants' teaching effectiveness, according to the administrators employing them; and (4) Priorities varied widely among various professional groups. Various tables present the data. The program proposal, budgeting, scheduling, and the evaluation instruments are appended. (AG)",

A 3-part questionnaire was developed, which dealt with policy, curriculum, and personnel abilities of the State vocational agriculture programs. Usable instruments in a random stratified sample that included six counties in Mississippi were returned from 11 principals, six school administrators, 28 school board members, 11 vocational agriculture teachers,  and 101 of the students at the secondary level. Analysis of results indicated that local attitudes are important for implementing program objectives. The vocational agriculture curriculum was seen as adequate, though the agribusiness component was least sufficient of those rated. Suggestions for program improvement and generalizations which were inferred from the data concerning program attitudes are included. (AG)",

The primary hypothesis that the NYC programs studied had helped enrollees achieve satisfactory adjustment to life and to the world of work was not confirmed, and an early conclusion that the NYC seemed to be most effective with Negro women was not supported by later data. Although there was no clear evidence that the NYC effectively enhanced the employability of the average enrollee, there was evidence that some program components were having a significant effect. Formal skill training, work sites with training and employment opportunities, job development, and job placement assistance  appeared to be associated with increased post-NYC employment. Some other major findings were: (1) The NYC is reaching seriously disadvantaged youth with major employability problems, (2) Enrollees, on the whole, gave a good report of the usefulness of the NYC program and the helpfulness of work supervisors and counselors, and (3) The attitudes of enrollees are associated with their employability. These and other findings and implications are provided in this report. (SB)",

Positive results achieved by using &quot;job banks&quot; are detailed, and the program itself is delineated. Major program benefits include the introduction of computer technology to manpower service delivery, with its potential for computerized job-matching. Optimizing the &quot;job bank&quot; and its functions is suggested, rather than viewing the whole system as transitional and therefore  dismissing its major problems. The impact of local &quot;job banks&quot; on Employment Service goals, Employment Service staff, and on the local community are discussed, noting improvements in managing the Employment Services and other human relations aspects, such as better service to the job-seeker.

One of a number of programs and/or services coming under the umbrella of industrial education, industrial arts is taught in high school and classified as a general education or pre-vocational education program emphasizing the development of manipulative skills, while industrial arts education is a college level program which prepares individuals to become teachers of industrial arts. The conflict in industrial arts and industrial arts education stems not from the definition  of terms nor the separation of programs but, rather, from a desire to fuse all terms and all programs under the industrial education umbrella. The lack of clearly delineated roles and goals under this umbrella further confounds the situation. The intrusion of a trade and industrial or technical education program in the industrial arts program is damaging to the students, teachers, and the program. Industrial arts and industrial arts education needs to confine its role and product to education and not to industry or engineering. (SN)",

Some general findings were: (1) Most projects were housed in public schools (Grades 9-12) serving large rural or urban communities, (2) Most targeted populations were &quot;regular&quot; students, but disadvantaged and handicapped students were represented, (3) Research, curriculum development, and training programs were the major face of most projects, (4) Impact in educational practices tended to be limited to local geographic areas, (5) Local vocational education advisory councils were little used, but when used, they proved to be effective,  (6) Most trainees were white, with blacks accounting for 7.5 percent of all trainees, and (7) Adequacy of RCU funding, external and internal influences, and assistance received had the strongest influences on outcomes among all project. Based on these results, it was suggested that directors better utilize internal sources of influence (parents, students, advisory councils, and others) and that the role of the RCU be expanded, in terms of greater interaction with projects during and after funding.

Procedures to project the annual cost of replacing obsolete instructional equipment are discussed in Chapter 3, while evaluation of programs through cost effectiveness analysis and suggestions for conducting follow-up studies of graduates are described in Chapter 4. In Chapter 5, the rationale for federal aid for vocational education and alternative apportionment  formulas are examined, and Chapter 6 examines the problem of apportioning categorical aid funds for vocational education among local schools. Some recommendations pertaining to the administration of federal and state funds are: (1) Specific guidelines should be established for prorating indirect costs among instructional programs, (2) State education agencies should establish standards for acquiring, maintaining, and replacing instructional equipment, and (3) National goals for vocational education should be established with sufficient precision so that the cost of attaining them can be estimated.

Enrollees were drawn from 42 states, Puerto Rico, and Washington, D.C. Two-thirds of the enrollees represented law enforcement services, with the rest from alcohol safety programs, state agencies, and universities. This report contains information and materials about institute planning, enrollee selection, and institute conduct and evaluation. Lesson outlines used by instructors at each of the five institutes are included in the appendixes. Evaluation  indicated that 96 percent of the enrollees found the institutes to be quite valuable or exceptionally valuable to them as instructors. Course-related instructor training covering teaching techniques required by the curriculum package was appreciated. The report recommends the funding of similar institutes for other highway safety courses. (MF)",

        "description":"The second interim report of the Watertown, South Dakota, public schools career development project covers the year ending September 13, 1972. This second year continued program development and implementation and began dissemination of project information. Individual development was emphasized in the elementary and junior high programs, with specific decision-making situations explored during the senior high school years. Occupational information centers in the junior and senior high school provided information and counseling services. Career counseling for school-alienated youth, with work experience and similar programs at the secondary level, helped these students to evaluate their future. Acceptance of career education concepts in the schools carried over into the community.  Included in this document is the evaluation team report on the project with detailed appraisals of each project objective. Among the recommendations the committee recommended that the various counseling activities be combined in one counseling center, eliminating the distinction between \"career\" counseling and \"academic\" counseling.

Vocational education trends in enrollments, expenditures, and teacher employment are given separately, including the United States and outlying areas. This statistical information, derived from annual reports published by the Division of Vocational and Technical Education and unpublished data from state annual reports and state plan projections, will prove useful for those interested in the nature and scope of vocational education in the United States, especially program administrators. Projected data are  provided for fiscal year 1976, and changes and adjustments from previous reporting methods are explained. The data show significant growth in vocational education, such as curriculum improvements, expanded enrollment, and increased expenditures. In addition, new facilities and equipment and better reporting techniques also reflect the impact of the Vocational Education Acts of 1963 and 1968, although their influence is not fully apparent until fiscal year 1971.

A &quot;curricular priority matrix&quot; and a geographic allocation formula would prove less costly than extensive cost-effectiveness analysis for purposes of program evaluation. In order to determine financial allocations for each curriculum, a modified synthesis of two funding approaches is suggested. For the &quot;training related openings strategy&quot;, the planner funds priority curriculums only as justified by the projected number of job openings in occupations related to their vocational training.  An alternative plan, the &quot;labor market success strategy,&quot; utilizes job satisfaction information in conjunction with student course preferences as major determiners of program funding levels. This second approach is suggested for local planning, especially when considering the scarcity of adequate labor market data. The importance of institutional flexibility for effecting necessary changes is emphasized. (AG)",

Participating in this national survey were 55 federal agencies, of which over half of their individual responding subunits were already using the International System of Units called the SI measurement units or SI-based engineering standards. In spite of the substantial costs involved during a conversion period, 48 of the 50 affected expect long-term advantages to outweigh disadvantages for them, and 39 agencies support a coordinated national effort to increase use of the metric system in  the United States, with only one agency in opposition to the idea. The areas of federal responsibility already seriously affected by the current national level of metric system use are: (1) automobile safety, caused by the influx of metric-dimensioned foreign vehicles and components, and (2) the shipbuilding functions of the U.S. Coast Guard. Increased problems in the &quot;area of national responsibility&quot; are expected by over a third of the 57 responding agencies if a &quot;laissez faire&quot; government policy continues. Extensive resource materials are appended, including a glossary, responses to survey questionnaires, and legal problems attendant on national conversion to SI units. (AG)",

        "description":"Life-long education, in which the learning process is continuous and unbroken, for the professional is discussed from the standpoint of obsolescence, its symptoms and causes, and present efforts to cope with it. The concept of half-life is used to describe a professional's competence, and it is stated that the two factors that are most prominent in hastening professional obsolescence are the rate of change and the addition of new data and knowledge. Two examples of coping with teacher obsolescence, in Japan and Great Britain, are briefly described. It is believed that psychologists possess specific skills by which they can contribute to continuing education and, at the same time, they may benefit by new employment opportunities in this field. These skills relate to: motivation,  adult learning, measuring and assessing professional competence, the development and use of educational technology, counseling adults (mid-career change and interpersonal competence, external degree programs, and post-graduate residential programs for professionals), research in continuing education (learning, adult development, communications, and organizational behavior), innovative human service programs, group behavior and laboratory practice in group leadership, individual behavior, the psychology of learning, and learning theory. Four major national priorities for continuing education to which psychologists can make significant contributions are: program planning, leadership development, research development and high-priority items (child development, disadvantaged minorities, urban  development, population explosion, alcohol and drug abuse, delinquency, violence, improved delivery of human services, and worker training).

A principal determinant of motivation is said to be achievement motivation; a professional must be highly motivated in order to maintain competence throughout his career. It is stated that achievement motivation can be developed in persons as well as built into jobs. Organizational climate is defined as organizational and management practices that arouse motivation, condition attitudes, and shape behavior on the part of its members. A high organizational climate is seen as emphasizing the following characteristics: achievement, concern for excellence, emphasis on problem solving, high reputation for work  performance, appropriate training, supportive and friendly atmosphere, and initial job orientation. The relationship between supervisor and subordinate is seen as crucial in the professional development of the subordinate. Three types of supervisors are identified: the innovator, the administrator, and the inactive supervisor. On-the-job learning is considered an important variable of organizational climate, as is the stimulation provided by peer interactions as well as interaction with superiors and subordinates. It is believed that a company should have a written policy that requires updating for its employees. (DB)",

This act committed federal support at the 75 percent level to institutions of higher education for community service and continuing education programs to the attainment of these two objectives: (1) To help solve community problems; and (2) To strengthen and improve community service and continuing education programs of institutions of higher education. The evaluation team found that there have been several sources of confusion in interpreting the Title I Act. A widespread agreement was found that the Act itself contains a lack of clarity concerning what kinds of activities are appropriately fundable with Title I funds. In Chapter I, similarities and differences that have been identified between what seems  to be the intent of the act and each of the following are presented: (1) the agricultural extension model, (2) community development, (3) community services in community college, and (4) public service in higher education institutions in general. The analysis of the evaluative data led to the inductive identification of the following alternative involvement models: (1) the Faculty Involvement Model, (2) the Student Involvement Model, (3) the Agency Involvement Model, (4) the Target Population Involvement Model, (5) the Transactive Involvement Model, and (6) the Comprehensive Involvement Model. The evaluative data generally indicate that the achievement of positive effects from local Title I projects was facilitated by the role played by the State agency. (Author/CK)",

The three major forces--the university, the professional association and the employer--are frequently completely separate and unrelated to each other. Brief description is given of the Adult Basic Education Professional Staff Development Program in the southeastern states and administered by the Southern Regional  Education Board. There were two main elements of the program plan: (a) a major role for higher education institutions and (b) a leadership role within each state for the state director of each state and for members of his staff.

These problems are basically problems of communication caused by the apartness of these groups from the dominant society. The communication process is defined as involving an exchange of meaning between the sender (Encoder) of a message and the receiver (Decoder). In three studies, researchers set out to identify personality traits common to culturally different groups and to describe relationships between them and the dominant society. Bases of difference include different value systems and attitudes springing from social, economic and other forces operating in the environment. Other impediments to communication arise from  differences in language. Some implications of these communication problems for the adult educator are: (1) The adult educator must involve these groups in the program planning process; (2) He must learn to respect the difference in language; and (3) The adult educator must enlist the aid of sophisticated members of the different groups in the planning process of any program.

        "description":"This handbook is focused directly on training possibilities to meet the dollar needs of older persons. Part I consists of a course of study designed specifically for persons seeking a supplemental income through a small, possibly home-based, business enterprise. Part II suggests a cooperative plan with local agencies or groups, particularly the State Employment Service, for the training of older workers for jobs geared to existing local labor shortages. It includes three suggested courses of study including: 1. A Refresher Course in Stenography and Typewriting (for older women), 2. Home Companion Training, and 3. Streamlined Housekeeping (for Job Training). Each of these courses is complete with (1) suggestions to the director for organizing each course as a part of the adult  education program, (2) suggestions to the leader who is employed by the school to conduct the course, and (3) a course of study with suggested methodology, bibliography, etc. (Author/DB)",

As a result of the study, it was found that social education is confronted with various new problems due to such social changes as progress in industrialization, the increase in middle- and old-aged population, the concentration of the population in urban areas, the growing tendency toward the nuclearization of the family, the increase in the educational standard, etc. Roles and problems that social education should  deal with in the future are said to be the following: (1) broadening the concept of Social Education; (2) systematization of Social Education from the viewpoint of life-long education; (3) improvement of educational content and methods for meeting the variety of demands; (4) promotion of organized activities and voluntary activities; and (5) increased emphasis on Social Education administration. Annex I, Statistical Data, provides, in tables, data concerning social changes; content of learning, learning activities, etc.; social education facilities; personnel (including professional staff) in social education; and social education expenditures.

The course, offered during the Fall 1971 and Spring 1972 semesters at Syracuse University, comprised approximately 30 undergraduates from the university and 30 members of the Greater Syracuse community. The program was conducted with a two-hour meeting once a week, each meeting being devoted to one of the public policy issues of the program: education, housing, unemployment, and police-community relations. One or more role-playing exercises or structured simulation exercises were conducted for each issue. In each class session, the staff explained the game, and asked class members to take certain roles.  Following each exercise, a full-group discussion was conducted on the issues presented, pro and con arguments, the quality of role playing, problems presented, and how close the exercises were to the actual situations. In some instances, the role playing was video-taped and played back to the class for critique and analysis. This follow-up was considered important in determining what participants learned during the game sessions. During the sessions on each topic, some time was usually devoted to a presentation by a local authority on the topic. Class presentations were made before community groups on nine occasions. Appendixes present two examples of exercises employed in the program. Samples of the communications form, war form, and petition form are provided. (DB)",

Power and climate perceptions were investigated as a function of three dimensions of organizational environment. The 2 x 2 x 3 (level of participation, profit or service orientation, and position level, respectively) design (N = 120) was carried out in a laboratory setting. Five dimensions of power and 4 dimensions of climate were assessed as dependent variables. Climate and power perceptions were not strongly related to each other. Level of participation is the main contributor to self-perceived power both as a main effect and in interaction with profit/service orientation and position level. Profit/service orientation is the main contributor to climate  perceptions, generally in interaction with one or the other of the environmental variables but also as a main effect. Two strong findings were that participative decision making seems to result in decreased self-perceived power for occupants of higher positions and that a service orientation combined with participative decision making leads to positive climate perceptions. Implications for change toward increased participation in organizations are discussed. (Author)",

        "description":"The fourth force in American education is considered to be adults \"beyond school age\" who are participating in educational experiences. This is described by the following: education for the foreign born, life-long learning, basic education, community development, extension education, continuing education, community school, permanent education, or adult education. These terms reflect a gamut of educational experiences which \"out-of-school\" learners take part in through public education, proprietary schools, religious schools, and clubs. The National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago estimated that nearly 30 million adults were engaged in AE and predicted that the actual adult education audience would increase faster than the population in general. Subjects  discussed relating to this general topic include Adult Education Responsibilities and Adult Education Programs. The estimate of the number of participants in AE will almost double between 1970 and 1976. The principal increase will probably be in programs conducted by business, government, unions, military services, correspondence schools, community organizations, and instructional TV. It is pointed out that since the ultimate goal of adult education is the improvement of self and community living, the curriculum and the methods by which adult education is taught should be functional to daily living--functional to the improvement of self and the community.

Four predictions are made concerning the future of Extension in the university: (1) within the next 20 years or so, the turning over to the established units of the university the part-time credit, extended university, open university activity; (2) the expanded development of continuing professional education as a major line of Extension work; (3) an expanded development of general cultural education; and (4) the development of compulsory adult education. The present day is said to be a time of change similar to that which prevailed in the Renaissance, in the 15th and early 16th century. The heritage of the university is described by quotations from Thomas More's &quot;Utopia,&quot; by descriptions of university life in the  15th century, and by descriptions of 11th and 12th century cathedral schools and cloisters of Italy. These descriptions point up the fact that at its beginning, the university was primarily an action program in adult and continuing education, the first students being mature people in search of knowledge to develop solutions to social problems. The next dimension in universities is seen as the development of post-professional, post-degree continuing education for mature men and women, with roots that go back to the beginning of universities.

The system designed to accomplish the program goals included two major functions: personnel training and system design. Personnel training was effected through a national advanced training seminar to train selected individuals for leadership and instructional roles and through seven regional seminars conducted to train selected persons in the basic use of systems approach  to instruction of adult basic education in corrections. Two areas of activity were carried out in the system design function: (1) evaluation of the conceptual model of adult basic education in corrections, and (2) design of models for instructional delivery systems. Phase III resulted in advanced training of 37 individuals, basic training of 110 persons in systems approach to instruction of adult basic education in corrections, and design of 49 models of instructional delivery systems.

        "description":"An investigation was conducted in order to make a comparison of grade-point averages, earned by military-dependent students in Overseas Dependent Schools, with the grade-point averages of a comparable non-mobile student society with whom they graduated in the United States. Data was derived from the permanent record cards of 2,173 graduated students over a period of five graduating classes, in Marin County, California. Students were designated as A) military-dependent or B) non-military. The results indicated that there was no significant difference in mean grade-point average of the two groups. In conclusion, it was recommended that similar studies be conducted in school districts that have a transient military-dependent student body from overseas. To validate the findings of  this investigation it was additionally suggested that additional variables, comparable to both groups, be added to measure achievement as proof that mobility affects achievement.

During individual meetings with experienced female interviewers, students were asked to relate sources which were most influential in providing information about marihuana at the following stages: (1) awareness; (2) interest; (3) evaluation; (4) trial; and (5) adoption. Sources were categorized by the experimentors as either personal (e.g. parents or friends); impersonal (e.g. television or newspapers); control (e.g. pamphlets or teachers) or noncontrol (e.g. friends or music). The sources of information mentioned most frequently by all students were parents, television, and friends. A number of other findings are presented, among  them being a significant shift in types of sources reported as students grew older. Most interesting was the finding that two-thirds of all students surveyed at all grade levels were not actively interested in marihuana. (Author/BW)",

Also discussed in this paper are topics such as (1) what is it? (2) motivation, (3) students need motivating, and (4) a new method. The latter part of the paper is concerned with a year long behavior project in an elementary school setting. Thirty three students whose behavior most frequently disrupted learning in the classroom were selected to serve as target children. During the first two workshop sessions, baseline data was collected on the children. The third session was devoted to response acquisition, and the fourth session dealt with extinction. It was concluded that operant methods coupled with mediation training produced behavioral changes for the  better. A number of specific changes are described, among them being that immediately after initiation of the training methods, the frequency of office referrals dropped sharply. (Author/BW)",

        "description":"It has been suggested that for women, success in competitive achievement situations may produce negative social sanctions, resulting in a motive to avoid success, which inhibits high performance in these situations. 120 college women, 60 exhibiting fear of success and 60 exhibiting no fear of success, based upon results of a projective measure, were subjects. Half of each group worked on a task described as masculine, and half performed the same task described, however, as feminine. In addition, part of each group competed against a man, part competed against a woman, and part worked alone. The results indicated that the current instrument for assessing the motive to avoid success is sex-role biased. Further, it was suggested that women perform best on tasks and against  competitors who are preceived as compatible with their manifest sex-role orientation. Performance is depressed when these conditions are not met, due to the engagement of the motive to avoid success. (Author/BW)",

In addition, the purpose of this study was to explore the interaction among eight college student subcultures and sex and race for psychological anomie and existential frustration. The eight subcultures of college students consisted of eight student types distinguishable in terms of their dominent value commitment. The subject sample consisted of 1306 students drawn from 89 colleges and universities. The eight subcultures were grouped as follows: (1) vocationalists, (2) professionalists, (3) collegiates, (4) ritualists, (5) academics, (6) intellectuals, (7) left activists, and (8) hippies. The results  indicated that each of the subcultures studied exhibited some form of psychological anomie. It was suggested that belonging to a vocational or academic subculture might, in itself, reflect purposeful alienation from the institution. A number of implications, emphasizing the difficulty in dealing with alienation, are presented. (Author/BW)",

This project was designed to implement and observe an educational program design for resident drug addicts in an attempt to reduce recidivism and to prepare them for productive living. The investigators conducted a planning study involving residents of a residential drug therapeutic community which was followed by a pilot project and a pilot program which is described in this report. A total of 260 residents were studied in the three phase project. Several conclusions and recommendations are presented. Among them are that the data indicated a much lower split rate among the educationally-involved residents. This  led to the recommendation that drug agencies should consider training programs (academic and vocational) as staples in the therapeutic structure. There was little doubt that educational involvement exerts a holding power on residents. (Author/BW)",

Based on the analysis of experimental and control student scores, the dimension of student achievement appears to have been differentially affected by the IPI program. The findings of this study suggested six recommendations: (1) the IPI program should be continued; (2) a study  should be made on the time demanded; (3) a committee should conduct a study on the demand for services; (4) techniques for community involvement should be continued; (5) expanding the program should be considered; and (6) a program for gifted children should be developed.

Lectures and discussion sessions focused on issues such as cultural background of minorities, crisis intervention, assessment, and helping relationships. Students also participated in small group encounters and in counselor-counselee role playing experiences. Several conclusions were drawn from the program. First, students and instructors agreed on which students would be the best counselors.  Second, specific skills were viewed by students as favorable counselor attributes.

The variables, linearity and meaningfulness of the presentation, were studied using a 2 x 2 design with outside control. The five conditions were administered to 95 fifth graders. The synthetic responses were measured with three tasks. Task I consisted of a Similarities Judgment task, Task II was a Sorting task, and Task III consisted of a questionnaire about the presentation. An ANOVA performed on the data from the Similarity Judgment and Sorting tasks showed no significance. A chi-square performed on the questionnaire did show significance on some questions, but these results were too isolated to accurately interpret. Descriptive analysis of the data, however, showed slight  trends which would suggest that a multi-media format does facilitate synthetic responses. (Author)",

Ninety-six sixth graders from a rural Wisconsin Middle School served as subjects. Subjects in the experimental condition initially read an advance organizer describing an occupational hierarchy which was structurally isomorphic to the ecological hierarchy described in the experimental passage. One control condition received an irrelevant advance organizer containing significant terms from the job description embedded in a story. The second  control condition received no advance organizer. Results of the study showed no significant effects of the advance organizer.

To see whether the objectives of the program could be fulfilled in the classroom setting (Phase II), three schools implemented the goal-setting conferences in reading or mathematics. It was found that the teachers were able to implement the procedures described in the motivation package and apply motivational techniques in the conferences. The pupils gained significantly in number of skills attained weekly over the eight-week conference period.  Furthermore, with discontinuation of the program, none of the pupils' mean weekly rates of skill attainment regressed to that of the preconference baseline period. (Author)",

Those Ss who voluntarily produced haptic activity reached criterion in a repeated exposure-test recognition task in fewer trials than Ss who produced no activity. There was a tendency for the effect of haptic activity to decrease with age. In Experiment 2, 4-year olds were trained in haptic exploration and then assigned to predetermined experimental conditions defined by the presence or absence of haptic activity. Again, visual recognition was enhanced by haptic exploration. These experiments are compared with previous studies which failed to demonstrate  haptic facilitation of visual recognition, and possible explanations for haptic facilitation are discussed.

Three studies were carried out to test derivations from conflict theory. The first study tested the effectiveness of a balance sheet or tallying procedure used to induce a sample of high school students to think carefully about considerations relevant to college choice. The second study dealt with a commitment warning procedure designed to inhibit the tendency to use superficial and past decision making in everyday decisions. The third study was concerned with the conflict theory hypothesis that preferences for supportive and utilitarian information are related to the stage of  the decision process at which the student is located. Results of the three studies tend to support the derivations from the conflict theory, but in addition to their theoretical significance, may be of value to counselors and teachers who are concerned with developing sound principles of decision making in their students.

Those who scored below 2.0 on the Stanford were recommended for informal testing. The same two tests were given as posttests either upon the completion of  the program or at the end of the period of time when the children were no longer able to participate because of summer vacation. The statistical results indicated that the program did not bring each participating child up to the third grade level. Twenty-five children did not make substantial progress on either the formal or the informal tests. It was recommended that further tests of the reading program be conducted outside the Minneapolis public schools. (Author/WR)",

        "description":"In the Learning Research and Development Center (LRDC) Beginning Reading Program, vowels are color-coded so that different spellings, representing a single vowel sound, maintain some feature in common. Such color-coding imposes a structure which effectively reduces the uncertainty in associating visually different stimuli with a similar oral response. The program consists of two sets of twelve children's books with color-coding used systematically through Book 8 or 11. Words are color-coded according to rules applying to each set of two stories that follow the introduction of a new phoneme-to-grapheme association, with the amount of color prompting reduced in the alternate set of readers. In the second story of the first set of readers, only words which have not previously  appeared at least five times in color in prior stories are color-coded. In the alternate set of readers, only words which have never appeared before in prior stories are color-coded. During 1969-70 several studies were made to determine the effectiveness of color-coding: a testing program to prove pupil achievement, a study to investigate the question of how much color prompting benefits the pupils, and a test to determine how well individual elements were learned by the same children.

The causes of reading difficulties are discussed to show that physical and psychological as well as social and instructional interferences may be involved. Interest and motivation play key roles in the energy a child brings to reading and thus should be searched out by the parent and the teacher to take best advantage of the kinds of books that will appeal to the existing drives of the child. The book also treats the very practical concerns of the parents' role--how early reading instruction should begin, successful methods some parents have used to teach children to read, facts about  decoding, facts about comprehension, and ways that parents can help with reading instruction in school through the PTA or on their own. The articles also suggest ways in which teachers and administrators can encourage parents to participate in helping their children learn to read. (Author/TO)",

An ANOVA and post-hoc pair-wise comparisons  revealed the group answering questions in both passages scored significantly higher on both STR and LTR than controls, indicating a facilitative effect of adjunct questions.

A second sentence was read aloud with a slot indicated for the position of the derived form of the target word. Subjects were asked to select one of four alternatives, depicted orally or visually depending upon cell, to correctly occupy the indicated slot. A pattern was revealed, suggesting that good readers can more ably recognize the underlying forms of words than poor readers. When surface structures are related, these differences between good and poor readers diminish. (Author/WR)",

After a single presentation of a list of words, the children first recalled as many of the words as they could. Following free recall, children in each grade were given either conceptual (category names for words on the input lists) or acoustic (words which rhymed with words on the list) retrieval cues for the words missed in free recall. For all students conceptual cues were more effective than acoustic cues. For sixth-grade students both types of cues were more effective than could be expected on the basis of guessing. Second graders performed less well than sixth graders with both types of cues. While conceptual cues produced above-chance performance at the second-grade level,  acoustic cues did not. Results are discussed in terms of developmental changes in memory attributes. (Author)",

        "description":"To find how well children learn letter-sound correspondences when an orthography is highly regular, and how this ability relates to socioeconomic status (SES) and to reading ability, 240 Finnish children were tested for letter-sound generalizations. The test consisted of 25 synthetic words, constructed to look like Finnish words and to contain the full range of correspondences which occur in Finnish orthography. Children from Grades 1 through 3, stratified by sex and by SES, were tested individually on the word list, with the pronunciation of each word being scored either right or wrong. An analysis of variance on the raw scores showed a significant grade effect at the .01 level, but no SES or sex effect. Mean correct, however, was almost 80% in Grade 1, indicating a surprisingly  high level of letter-sound mastery. But the correlations of letter-sound ability with reading ability were only moderately high, ranging from .528 (Grade 2) to .487 (Grade 3). This result indicates that the ability to generalize letter-sound correspondences does not guarantee high ability in reading. (Author)",

Control subjects did not receive picture and token training. There were no significant differences between the experimental and control subjects on training or transfer lists. This failure to replicate was discussed in terms of age of subjects, possible differences between American and Soviet children, and time spent during training.

Each test included five synthetic words (e.g., cipe, acim, bice, cib, ocet) for each generalization. Children responded individually to the test items by attempting to pronounce each one aloud. The long and short pronunciations of \"a\" ([e] and [ae]) and the [k] pronunciation of \"c\" were learned to a high degree of accuracy. They showed no significant differences across grade levels, but did differ significantly across ability groups. For \"c\" pronounced as [s], however, learning was extremely low at all grade levels and reached only 45% correct by the end of grade 3.  Initial \"c\" as [s] was learned more slowly than medial \"c\" as [s], indicating an interaction between letter pattern and word position. The failure to acquire the \"c\" pronounced as [s] pattern, especially in word-initial position, appears to result primarily from the failure of most beginning reading texts to include a sufficient sampling of words which begin with \"c\" before \"e,\"\"i,\" or \"y.\" (Author/HS)",

Objectives were identified for both the conference leaders (direct target group) and the pupils participating in conferences (indirect target group). The conference leaders, after using film, handbook, and user's manual included in the package, were assessed both by a paper-and-pencil test and by observation during the conferences. In all but one school, conference leaders were considered to have achieved an adequate level of knowledge and skill in conducting conferences.  Conference leaders' responses to a questionnaire and their extension of the conference technique to other subject-matter areas indicated that they perceived the program as usable and effective. Students in Grades 2-6 participated in the conferences. Significant gains in number of books read during an eight-week period were observed at all grades. A positive change in attitude toward reading was observed at all grades, with a significant change in Grades 4-6. Children participating in the conferences showed significant gains in reading skills.

Linguists, on the other hand, view the language of subculture groups as fully developed, highly structured, rule governed systems which are simply different from standard English. Given this latter view, the resulting conceptual model for the speech therapist should include an ability to diagnose the speech characteristics of culturally different students, an understanding of their cultural backgrounds, and instructional procedures which make maximal use of the student's first language. This latter view  also holds significant implications for the field of speech pathology: (1) it would seem more logical to change the professional title \"speech therapist\" to \"speech specialist\" in order to de-emphasize the remediation bias the title now carries; (2) work needs to be relevant to the language of the community being served; (3) new approaches are needed for the training of students in speech pathology; and (4) a vigorous program of recruitment of people from culturally different backgrounds needs to be established.

The author argues that reality for Stevens is divided between the physical world of objects and the spiritual world which is known through the imagination. External reality is illusive because man's perceptual senses are limited; man therefore has to depend on his imagination to interpret physical reality. Using an existentialist point of view, the author interprets Stevens' attempt to confront and find meaning in the absurdity of human existence. Rather than becoming cynical or even nihilistic, Stevens believes that illusion should be celebrated, not lamented, because it is a means of creating beauty. This optimism makes his achievement unique in the literature of the absurd. The author suggests that  his study proposes to be instructive--both as a guide to interpreting Stevens' poetry and for the suggestions it may offer for further study of similar attitudes in other modern American poets.

(see ED 041 903), whose principal purpose was to investigate methods of teaching dramatic literature; additional information was obtained on the practical problems involved in educational research and the utilization of some basic aspects of multivariate fractional factorial design. Disagreement between English teachers and professional theatre personnel about the best methods of preparing students to attend dramatic productions led to a 6-month study that involved 52 teachers and more than 1,300 students. Study materials were supplied to students in conjunction with their classroom discussions and the viewing of two plays. Independent variables considered for each play were (1) intensity of study of the  background, (2) intensity of study of the text, (3) timing of the classroom treatment, (4) content of the classroom treatment. Fifteen dependent variables were used. Generally, the relatively few significant effects confirmed the supposition that English teachers preferred arrangements yielding the highest scores on the cognitive tasks; and the actors preferred arrangements maximizing scores in appreciation and affective response. Extensive discussion is presented on the research design, and appendices include sample tests and tables of results. (Author/DI)",

Fifteen specific guidelines for the selection of educational textbooks, guidelines for the selection of supplemental materials, and suggestions for the local staff all center on the belief that curriculum  development determines textbook selection; textbooks should not determine the curriculum.

        "description":"This paper examines possible interchanges between cognitive and language processes with particular attention given to concept formation and semantic language development. Aspects of psychological and contemporary linguistic theories are discussed as a way to interrelate the functions of thought and language. The author concludes that while language is subordinate to fundamental thought processes, language ought not be regarded as a passive instrument operating on behalf of the intellect. Through correct application of linguistic rules, concepts seem to be fully expressed when words are joined in sentences. However, the ability to encode and decode words in sentences depends ultimately on seeing single words as concept labels. Language and concept formation are so interwoven that  their precise interrelationships are difficult to define. Because of the similarities between the two, it is proposed that the acquisition and development of word meaning be reformulated in verbal concept learning terms, while the relationship governing words be treated in the framework of language development.

Language samples were collected from 180 children (grades K-3, 5, and 7) by having the children view two silently-run cartoons, and then narrate and answer questions about the film in a recorded interview. Third-, fifth-, and seventh-graders were also asked to write the stories and answers. The typescripts of the responses were analyzed using Hunt's T-units. Principal conclusions were: (1) as grade level increased, so did the word length of total responses to a situation; (2) the most frequent significant increments from grade to  grade were in the use of particular complex constructions; (3) deletion transformations may indicate students' growth in manipulating syntax better than subordinate clauses; (4) oral expression appeared to progress most rapidly between kindergarten and the end of first grade, and between the ends of the fifth and seventh grades; (5) in the higher grades, written development in control of syntax surpassed spoken development.

Behaviors should be written using &quot;action&quot; verbs so one can more clearly describe what behavior is being considered.

Recorded samples of oral English from each subject were segmented by oral intonation patterns and syntactic units, and were analyzed yearly in terms of 21 oral language problems or deviations from standard spoken English. Progress in resolving these difficulties was then plotted for four groups-Caucasians with high and low language proficiency, Negroes with low language proficiency, and a random sample. Results indicated that the most persistent difficulties for those children not handicapped by social dialect are not in usage but in developing coherence and organization and that individual  instruction in this area is much more helpful than drill in usage. On the other hand, the most persistent problems for Negro children are those of usage, particularly compound verbs and the verb \"to be.\" Oral drill based on expressing ideas, attitudes, and values of concern to the learners is more effective instruction than workbook drill.

        "description":"This paper discusses the behavioral science approach to speech communication education. The focus of a fundamentals course in communication processes is based upon receiver activity. Studying people as receivers and senders of messages includes emphasis on: (1) intra-personal communication--the individual and his/her internalization of his/her communicative apparatus; (2) inter-personal communication--persons in intimate and small-group situations; and (3) public communication--persons in mass public situations where communication is influencing many directly and indirectly through radio, television, film and public meetings. The author concludes that if the ability to interact and communicate more effectively is to be developed, it is the instructor's responsibility to devise a  program that enables students to define, design, and determine their own learning goals. The author illustrates how to realistically apply communication behavioral research in the classroom to achieve a learning environment of this type. (Author/LG)",

His two main reservations involve the deprivation and validity of value sets themselves and the potential dangers encounterable in using values as a guide to intercultural communication. Firstly, the non-scientific methods employed in compiling and categorizing value systems themselves, and the difficulty of determining the cause of particular values that are also constantly changing, contribute to the questionable validity of value systems which are externally and/or politically derived. Secondly, reliance on preconceived value sets as intercultural communication variables or guides may result in desensitization of the communicator who uses them and creation of an  environment for self-fulfilling prophecy based on false interpretation. The author examines value set categorizations of Mexican-Americans in light of value system theory and intercultural communication. (Author/LG)",

The author traces the early development of communication and law as closely related disciplines, with emphasis on the contributions of Aristotle, Cicero, and Quintilian. He discusses the decline of both rhetoric and law during the middle ages because of church influence and the feudal society and then summarizes the two legal forms that then emerged and influence law today: the British common-law system and the European civil code system. The author discusses current attempts to revive the relationship between rhetoric and law, with particular emphasis on  the writings of the Belgian scholar Chaim Perelman. He outlines methods by which concepts of justice, once determined, can be made effective in terms of communication operating on four levels of legal activity: the lawyer-client relationship, the process of negotiation, the trial situation, and the judicial opinion. He concludes that law schools in America ignore the study of communication and makes recommendations for increased emphasis on legal communication as an essential part of the training of attorneys.

In the second section, the author presents the form itself which consists of 29 items or questions classified into four categories: script; reader selection, placement, and interpretation techniques; lighting; and non-vocal sound. The judges have forced-choice selection ranging from \"satisfactory to  excellent\" or \"needs improvement or change\" on each item, and is asked to make more specific comments. The author presents the procedures and results of two tests of the form, concluding that they were satisfactory. In the final section, she suggests methods of adaptation and future testing of the form. (RN)",

Part 2 begins at a very basic systems level, i.e. the notion of wholes as compared with aggregates and relations. It continues with a  discussion of open systems principles such as: equifinality, dynamic homeostatasis or the steady state, entrophy and ectrophy and Prigogine's equation.

In this booklet, the author examines the effects of development politics on the processes and responsibilities of educational planning. He argues that the political nature of education plans in developing nations places the planner in a dilemma. According to the author, if a planner adheres strictly to the ideals of education as a means for developing social equality and human potential, he becomes politically ineffective. On the other hand, the author  contends, the planner without ideals can find himself used mainly as a propagandist and a technician by the government of the day. The author feels that the task facing planners is that of balancing what is best with educational standards that are suited to the social and economic needs of the country in keeping with what is possible at the time and with the resources available.

        "description":"The educational priorities of 90 key decisionmakers -- school administrators, teachers, and community members -- from school districts representing three economic levels, were investigated to determine: (1) the types of educational objectives preferred by each group, (2) the agreements within and among the three groups of decisionmakers in these school districts of varying economic levels, and (3) the relationship between the priorities as assigned in a Q-sort and as practiced in the classroom. One hundred behavioral objectives representing the categories low-cognitive, high-cognitive, tool-skill, affective-personal, and affective-interactive were put into a Q-sort. Each person's Q-sort was subjected to an analysis of variance. Comparisons were made within and among groups of  decisionmakers for different types of districts, and teachers' Q-sort preferences were correlated with their classroom practices. Two main findings emerged: (1) decisionmakers generally assign high priority to high-cognitive and affective-personal categories regardless of the group or district to which they belong and (2) teachers' classroom practices reflect heavy emphasis on tool-skill objectives rather than the categories of high preference.

For the first two years, the savings would be $51 per pupil over the construction of a new building. Although the particular all year school plan analyzed in this situation was the 45-15 program, other specific plans with other pupil attendance arrangements could be analyzed by use of the model.

The report provides a detailed breakdown of this reduction in cost.

Such an environment is the manifested difference between those buildings designed for learning and those designed for teaching, which becomes evident by the measure of flexibility of the facility itself and of the people within it. This new environment will succeed if designers recognize that flexibility requires (1) product awareness, both of building materials and furnishings; (2) openness that can be closed; (3) utilization of both horizontal and vertical space dimensions; (4) recognition that a school, if it is to serve the community, must be planned for more functions than merely that of housing a particular group of grade levels; and (5) recognition that, with individualization as  the key, the unique purpose of the special new environment in school facilities is to create a climate and a facility for self-motivation.

Seventeen different school districts participated in systems programs, and 20 new schools and additions were completed during the 1968-69 school year. Evaluative studies of these schools by members of the Schoolhouse Systems Project indicate an agreement on the superiority of these buildings. Some of the improvements include a better learning environment, more functional space, and space that has a higher degree of future adaptability. In addition, systems construction costs were no more than those of conventionally designed buildings. Construction time was reduced significantly for systems  schools--20 conventionally designed elementary schools took 14 percent longer to build than the 14 systems elementaries; eight conventionally designed secondary schools took 60.5 percent longer to build than the eight systems secondaries. Problems associated with the systems approach and recommendations for future building programs are discussed. Five appendixes contain a clarification of terms a list of all systems projects, the cost data for each school, the construction cost data, and a proposed construction program for 1970-73.

Shortages occurred in industrial arts, special education, trade-industrial-vocational courses, mathematics, remedial reading, speech, and in distributive education.

Two classes of loss discussed are (1) accidental -- injury/loss resulting from unintended events; and (2) purposeful -- losses rising out of criminal activity such as arson, vandalism, theft, riots, etc. Insurance is seen as a last resort in risk management, since insurance covers only direct loss and indirect losses are at least four times as great. A 3-phase safety and security program is described that emphasizes (1) prevention of the event (e.g., accident or criminal activity); (2) mitigation of consequences (minimize injury/loss resulting from  accident/criminal activity); and (3) maximization of salvage (emergency medical treatment, cleanup, and return to normalcy).

In addition, an administrator can prepare alternative budgets at the teletype by modifying factors such as the salary base of the salary schedule. Analyses of data and observational notes indicate the need to incorporate this system more directly into the budget planning cycle by providing information regularly to administrators and to delete the interactive (teletype) capability. Administrators making planning decisions can  readily tolerate several days' delay in obtaining the results of those decisions. (Author/DN)",

As a result of the effort, a new Federal education policy with respect to school-age pregnant students and young families was developed and disseminated. This and other information was shared with educational officials on both Federal and regional levels, and mechanisms for ongoing communication and consultation were developed. On a State level, chief State school officers were reached through their own meetings. In addition, southern State education officials were reached through a special conference focused  solely on pregnant students. Background materials and information were distributed to all. Finally, useful pamphlets and booklets (appendixes to this report) were prepared that will enable the projects and Federal, regional, and State education officials to aid more effectively those who wish to establish comprehensive continuing education programs for school-age pregnant girls.

Addressed primarily to organizational researchers, it deals with the relation between educational innovation and the organizational structure of schools. Three assumptions made widely in previous studies relating technology to structure are questioned, and suggestions for their modification are made. The assumptions of homogeneity of technology and social structure, rationality of organizational participants, and concensus among participants on the task and the technology employed are questioned. However, the authors, while acknowledging the effect of technological factors on organizational structure, argue that such factors are both more complex and subtle in their  operation than previous analyses have suggested. Specifically, it is argued that (1) not one but many technologies associated with many structures may be present in an organization; (2) organizational participants may hold differing conceptions of the nature of the technology employed; (3) different task conceptions can lead to different sets of preferences for work arrangements; and (4) nonrational factors may also enter into the formation of task conceptions and into the establishment of work arrangements.

At the federal level, unconditional grants might be appropriate, similar to the 50-percent of operating costs grants now used for post-secondary education; a federal value-added tax could be enacted for distribution to provinces or municipalities on a population or enrollment basis; and the Federal Government could absorb the costs of social welfare programs now financed at municipal levels. At the provincial level, the most likely alternative to local property taxes for education is the complete absorption of education expenditures along the lines of the New Brunswick  experiment. At the local level, incremental tax sources, such as municipal income and sales taxes, could be administered at the provincial level and rebated to municipalities (if and when Alberta joins the other nine provinces in levying a general sales tax.) From a revenue and equity point of view, the province may also want to reconsider the death and estate tax as a source of revenue since the Federal Government has withdrawn from this tax field.

School systems in the first group surveyed reported any existing merit pay plans, any such plans being considered for the future, or any abandonment of such plans. The second group of school systems described their plans. Results of the survey revealed that not one district contacted has a currently operational merit pay plan. The author concludes that the larger the school district, the less likely it is to have a merit pay plan. However, depending on the definition of merit pay, many school systems have some salary provisions that would fit isolated definitions of merit  pay.

A school district needs to develop a system that allows for the most effective working relationship between the school and the community, that facilitates the solution of problems, and that nurtures the growth of new ways to assist students. Such a system requires (1) the dissemination of information about the schools and the individual student, (2) the personnel to facilitate conflict resolution, and (3) the involvement of the community in the decision making process within the legal structure of the school district. The entire community and each ethnic group should become involved in the care of its children. (Author)",

This report documents a 3-year pilot project, from the summer of 1968 through the 1970-71 school year, in which some juniors and seniors from public and nonpublic schools were transported to facilities in the central downtown areas for special courses under the umbrella of an Educational Park. The courses taught in the Educational Park met one or more of three criteria: (1) the course carried such low enrollment that it could not be offered at the base school, (2) the course facilities were too expensive to be  available at all schools, and (3) the course required teachers whose skills and training were in short supply. A school for pregnant teenagers also operated within this program. The report includes data on students' perceptions of the effect on their academic and social lives of attending these classes; the perceptions of the faculty of the effects on students; the actual effects on participation in cocurricular activities of students; and perceptions held by parents of the effects on their children.

The author cites research that establishes the adverse effect of malnutrition on the learning process, outlines basic concepts for nutrition education, and presents arguments for and against the proposed universal free lunch program. Examples of how some school systems have coped with the bookkeeping involved in protecting the privacy of recipients of free or reduced-price meals are provided in several case studies. Also presented are some of the imaginative innovations that modern technology has produced that enable lunch to be served at old schools lacking kitchen facilities.  Among these innovations are (1) &quot;satelliting&quot; -- the preparing of food (usually preportioned) in a central plant; frozen efficiency foods; the cup-can system -- a prepackaged main course that is heated at the school; and contract feeding -- the farming out of the school system's food business to private corporations. Suggestions are offered for establishing and improving school food programs. (MLF)",

Peer interaction rate per minute, per child was computed during six types of class activity in each classroom: teacher led activity, aide led activity, student led activity, leaderless group work, independent seat work, and transition periods.  Results showed a consistent increase in peer interaction rate between teacher led and seat activity and between seatwork and transition periods in all classrooms (mean rates .19, .46, .97 respectively). Average peer interactions per 10 minutes were: five in I, two to three in II, four in III. II showed high rates during transition.

Explained in basic terms are the behavior theories related to why a child becomes oppositional and how to change his behavior through the technique of differential reinforcement. Parents are taught to attend only to desirable behavior of the child (positive reinforcement) and to ignore undesirable behavior (withdrawal of positive reinforcement). Special instructions are given for handling dangerous or very destructive behavior which cannot be totally ignored. The pamphlet also contains instructions to technicians (other previously trained  parents) for guiding the new parents through the periods of baseline, intervention, reversal, return to intervention, and eventual fading of positive reinforcement to an intermittent schedule of reinforcement.

After such sets were identified, discriminable plastic symbols of the three types were combined in six pseudomaps which varied through two conditions of spacing between symbols (.090 inch and .150 inch) and through three conditions of relief (all symbols the same height, linear and point symbols higher than areal symbols but the same height, and point symbols higher than linear symbols and linear symbols  higher than areal symbols). The maps were used to study how to combine such symbols. Tactual map reading behavior was analyzed using one of the pseudomaps. It was found that tactual perception, symbol legibility, map design, and map user training were closely interrelated and all played critical roles in a blind person's ability to use tactual maps.

All groups were reported to be equal on a verbal recognition memory test, but the deaf trained in the combined method showed poorer recall on the same test. The Noun Pairs Memory test showed all groups equal on the number correct and on most error categories, except that both hearing groups and the oral group imported more incorrect words from outside the test to complete the sentences. The  orally trained deaf were reported to be more like both hearing groups in their comprehension of multi-meaning words and in their control over distracting associations when questions on meaning were asked. The orally trained deaf were also found to be similar to the hearing in their ability to select meaning and in choosing fewer associations when the multi-meaning words were presented in sentences.

Ss also worked with a computer system which monitored speech sound characteristics and provided feedback on the accuracy of responses. Each S was described in terms of sex, age, previous treatment indication, and stuttering frequency prior to program participation. Reported were significant pre- and post-treatment differences in Ss on measures of disfluent word frequencies. A newly derived objective index of stuttering severity was said to correlate  significantly with global ratings of severity made by a speech pathologist. Post-treatment measures on the Perceptions of Stuttering Inventory made on the average of 4 months after the program were found to be significantly lower than the pre-treatment measures. Followup data collected 2 years after the program showed that significant gains in speech fluency had been retained for seven out of 10 Ss. (Author/GW)",

Therapeutic strategies were developed on the basis of observed parent maintenance of stuttering behaviors. Children were found to generalize their increased fluency, acquired with a therapist, to their respective parents. Positive changes in parental verbal behavior were observed. The feasibility of employing the therapy program in a school setting was tested with 13 children. The program was found to be successful in managing stuttering and  feasible from the viewpoint of school administrators. Categorization of parent child interactions into 35 thematic content categories was thought to provide crucial information relating to possible maintenance factors of stuttering. It was found that parents of stutterers consistently yielded more negative profiles on the basis of the categories than did parents of nonstutterers. (Author/GW)",

The IMCP Ss were compared with 15 conventionally trained (CT) Ss on three basic dimensions of behavioral competence: functional movements, socialization, and cognitive functioning. Data indicated that  the CT Ss had higher initial scores on the functional movement variables and registered significantly greater gains on several of them, whereas ICMP Ss evidenced some regression on functional movement variables. On socialization variables the IMCP Ss were comparable to the CT Ss on their initial scores and registered significantly greater gains on two of the seven measures. On cognitive measures the CT Ss had higher initial scores, but both groups made comparable gains. (For related information, see also EC 050 503 through EC 050 505.) (Author/GW)",

The programs are accompanied by classroom discussion. Three methods were used to test the effectiveness of &quot;Inside/Out&quot;. They were 1) a specially designed classroom observation system (used by trained observers) for measuring relevant categories of teacher and student discussion following the program viewing; 2) teacher and observer questionnaires dealing with teacher and student reaction to programs and discussion; and 3) in depth interviews with small groups of school children who had viewed programs in the series but not participated in classroom discussion.  The first programs presented dramatic situations on the themes of expressing emotion, death, prejudice, amount of responsibility children were given. This volume of the evaluation presents summaries of results from observers' and teachers' questionnaires; the relation of teacher ratings of their classes' ability and socio-economic level to student understanding and appreciation of the programs; teacher attitudes toward affective learning; their reactions to the programs; and the effect of teacher participation in discussion on student participation in discussion.

A more rapid feedback system was tried in 14 seventh grade classrooms. The key factor of this feedback system was that the test results be compiled quickly, preferably within three days, and analyzed sufficiently to give the classroom teacher a useful corrective tool. The feedback strategy was based on the students' previously determined learning performance and designed specifically to overcome the inflexibility of existing semi-annual achievement tests. The basic measuring instrument was the multiple choice test constructed to cover seven mathematical and four social studies concepts. The drafting of questions, the most  difficult chore of the experiment, required several pretests to establish the most appropriate questions. The investigators found the severe space limitation of the television screen detrimental, the timing of the questions crucial, and that the collection of test results required a high level of organization and a considerable number of people and vehicles.

Teachers' opinions, rather than tests on students, were the basis of the ratings. Judging from the ratings, most of the cassettes appear suitable for use with educationally disadvantaged youth and were in keeping with the intent of Title I guidelines. Also the general quality and content of the tapes were rated good. Cassette tapes recorded from radio broadcasts or purchased from other school districts were not as good for use with poor readers as those tapes purchased from commercial sources or produced at the cassette center. Commercial tapes were better technically, but center tapes were better for use with poor readers and also  provided more &quot;settling down&quot; time for students at the start of the tapes. Since two-thirds of the tapes were rated more suitable for intermediate than primary grade children, more emphasis may need to be placed on making tapes for the lower grades. Cassette materials were judged by 70% of the raters to be more effective than other instructional materials for teaching the subject to disabled readers. A list of rated tapes, along with recommendations and evaluations, is included. (Author/JK)",

From the managerial viewpoint the cost of instruction can be determined by using basic design models which reflect the actual situation. By applying Tracey's Project MINERVA Model with its clearly described five instructional stages, the manager can cross reference each of the stages against his four general cost categories: salaries; supplies and materials; space; equipment. Implementation of this type of cost analysis will enable the manager to predict the cost of future projects, justify organizational changes, facilitate the formulation of institutional budgets and  grant proposals, and testify to support needed from separate entities (federal government, institution, etc.).

Both the telephone company and broadcast equipment manufacturers have made great improvements in the field of audio which may be used to improve television sound. However, television receiver manufacturers are hesitant to make changes in the aural portions of the receiver because the extra cost could not be justified to set buyers. However, one of the Network Transmission Committees has drawn up specifications for a system that would combine audio and video. These specifications (the parameters of which are included here) would cause a great improvement in sound. Tests of other systems by the telephone  company, by the British Broadcasting Corporation, and by Japan's public broadcasting system also promise great improvement. (JK)",

Although designs for two-way systems exist, no major two-way system has yet been built. Such systems will present problems such as noise and signal  intrusion. Tests that are now scheduled for several sites across the country should solve these problems. Then educators, cable operators, government, and foundations will have to determine the cost benefits of using cables for education.

This issue still has not been resolved. Nevertheless, PBS, CPB (Corporation for Public Broadcasting), and NPR (National Public Radio) have filed comments supportive of the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) position, especially with regard to the system objectives. They also filed recommendations for future  requirements, particularly for the use of spot beams, frequency bands at 2.5, 7, and 12 GHz, and link parameters for dual service for more economical use of the satellite system. Currently joint requirements are being developed with the major networks, specifically in regard to technical specifications and the number of satellite channels and ground terminals.

A prototype Training Effectiveness and Cost Effectiveness Prediction (TECEP) model was developed and tested. The model was a method for optimization of training media allocation on the basis of fixed training effectiveness and minimum cost. To test its feasibility, this model was applied to the TA-4 aircraft training system. A training analysis of the TA-4 training program was conducted to determine possible media substitutions. In conjunction with A-4 pilots, a mix of training media was selected for each task from possible media alternatives, such as classroom, cockpit procedures training, aircraft plus instructor, and actual carrier  landing. Substitutions which the computer would be permitted to make among the various media were determined. Cost factors were developed for the TA-4 aircraft and training media. A comparison of costs between the existing system and the system developed chosen by the linear system showed the model was feasible and saved money. Further development and refinement of the model are discussed. (Author/JK)",

A discussion of copyright laws examines both the law now in effect and the revision to it currently pending before Congress. It is concluded that the laws will present serious difficulties to those who design educational communications systems. If they wish to disseminate materials copyrighted by others, they must first obtain the prior consent of the copyright holder (invariably the publisher) on whatever terms and conditions the holder imposes.  The revisions before Congress by and large expand the right of the holder. Further study should examine other alternatives to the present and proposed laws. Some that have been proposed include compulsory licensing requirements, creation of a centralized educational licensing authority, and the like. (Author/JK)",

        "description":"The use of a mathematical model supported by empirical findings had developed a method of cost effectiveness that can be used in evaluations between educational objectives and goals. Educational time allocation can be studied and developed into a micro-level economic theory of decision. Learning has been defined as increments which can be quantified by successive criterion tests of cognitive achievement. Using an input-output concept of the educational process, a marginal cost model was developed. A programing model was devised based on a multistep approach of learning, specifically using the Swedish IMU (Swedish acronym) Mathematics System for 7th Grade. The most important contribution of the programing model to an economic theory of education seems to be the identification of  marginal product of student time with learning rate and a shadow pricing of this time resource that makes price proportional to learning rate, hence inversely proportional to time spent in learning.

Some cable franchise holders believe that regulations should be promulgated solely at the federal level, rather than some at the state and some at the local level, but he said for now, at least, this three-tiered procedure will continue. The Commissioner's other opinions are that rate regulation is  unsuitable for the cable industry at this crucial stage of its development, that municipalities do not have the expertise to be and are in other ways improper cable franchisees, that cables should pay reasonable copyright premiums, and that these payments should be arranged by the parties involved rather than dictated by the government.

The advisor's role is not only one of dealing with attitudes to research methodology and the consequences of inadequate methods, but also to further the methodological education of the client. Preventative measures must be taken to keep researchers in education and psychology from slowly dividing themselves into two  non-communicating camps depending on the knowledge of mathematics and statistics.

This paper not only studies the way in which the student teacher perceives and evaluates his behavior, but also discusses a systematic examination of the dyadic confrontation process in the traditional tutoring situation. Using a group of 96 female Grade 4 through Grade 6 student teachers a three factor design experiment was constructed with a six dimensional assessment schedule developed by the author. These were categorized into ego-ego, ego-pupil, ego-non-personal object (NPO), pupil-ego, pupil-pupil and pupil-NPO relations.  The data were analyzed using the statistical analysis-of-variance treatment. The results show that experimental conditions have not on the whole led to main effects that are significant on a chosen level of significance. This means that there are no deviations in the objectivity of the student teacher's self-assessment as a consequence of either traditional tutoring or externally mediated self-confrontation via closed-circuit television.

Using 125 logic derivation problems, the responses of 23 students, enrolled in the Stanford Logic-Instructional System, were evaluated to determine the amount of variation occurring in the structure of their proofs. By assigning the student proofs to equivalence classes the investigation indicated that there was relatively little variability in the earliest problems and considerable variability in the latter. Regression analysis revealed that the structural complexity of the problems were a good predictor of the amount of variation in the proofs. In general, the author concluded, the most significant kinds of variability depend on the number and type of rules that are  available when the proof is done.

Two large programs, collectively called TASKTEACH, were developed and tested. These programs combined simulation and gaming techniques. The dialog with the student is sustained without using a computer-assisted instruction (CAI) language. These programs were tested to identify features needing further refinement and to test student acceptance. A second part of the research was concerned with assembling and analyzing studies in the literature bearing on theoretical issues in CAI. Topics included motivating students in training environments, specifying training objectives, evaluating effectiveness of CAI, and  recent developments in learning theory and cognitive psychology. Abstracts of technical reports on these subjects are included, along with a summary of a report on TASKTEACH. (JK)",

This paper offers a proposal in response which considers federal and non-federal funds, incentives, provisions for practical system growth and development, the designation of appropriate accountability, and the requirement for program reassessment prior to proceeding to the next time period. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting Basic Support Fund, the Station Operational Support Fund and the Station Facilities Support Fund are the basic parts of the proposal for which the diverse funding and responsibilities are  illustrated.

The proportion of women employees (22 percent) did not change between 1971 and 1972. At the same time employment at the 609 stations rose by about one percent. In 1972, 22.5 percent of the stations reported no full time minority employees. Thirty-four percent had no minority group employees in upper level positions, and 77 percent had none in management. Although almost all stations reported that they had women among their full time employees, 75 percent of the women were engaged in office and clerical jobs.  Eighteen percent of the stations indicated that they had no women in upper level positions. Over half had no women in management. Many stations show little or no response to the Federal Communications Commission-mandated priority of providing equal employment opportunities. Some have reduced the proportion of their staffs which are drawn from among minority group members and women. (Author/JK)",

The participants included students, instructors, administrative, and maintenance personnel. An acceptance profiling technique was developed that appeared to be highly diagnostic of the reasons for acceptance or rejection of particular trainers. It was evident that both highly accepted and seriously rejected trainers were represented in the sample. Methods for increasing trainer  acceptance were outlined in terms of improvement in specific areas of simulation; improved software; greater qualifications for instructors; improved evaluations of performance; and improved understanding of the purpose, capabilities, and limitations of trainers by the users.

Criteria included post-test scores on a specially constructed achievement test, final examination grades, final grades, and a student rating of progress on their personal goals. Attitudes and learning preferences were inferred from a specially constructed student survey. Judged on the basis of academic achievement, telephone classes and on-campus classes were equally successful. Using progress on student goals as a criterion, five pairs of telephone and on-campus classes obtained similar results, while for the other pair the telephone  classes had a significant advantage. Successful students, regardless of method of criteria, were more motivated and responsible than their less successful counterparts. However, successful telephone students were more self-reliant and independent than successful on-campus students. (Author/JY)",

The first report, \"Computational Linguistics and Linguistics,\" helps to establish definitions and an understanding of the scope of computational linguistics. \"Integrated Computer Systems for Language\" and \"Computer-Oriented Grammars and Parsing\" deal with technical issues and immediate concerns for research. \"Machines and Speech\" reports on a topic of emerging relevance in the field; lengthy consideration is given to reading machines for the blind and speech understanding systems, among other topics. \"Language Performance (Psycholinguistics and Dialectology)\" describes another fairly new application for computational linguistics. The last two  reports, \"Social Implications of Automatic Language Processing\" and \"Professional Ethics, Standards, and Education,\" involve issues related to the potential impact and implications of computational linguistics and its concerns.

A discussion of the negative and positive results of placing these students in faster, regular classes is provided. The program evaluation advocates personal contact with the students, a continuation of the individualization of instruction through the use of tutors, and a constant review of materials, methods, and the general program.

One approach, called the &quot;Implicit Method,&quot; is based on the audiolingual habit theory of language learning. Grammar is taught inductively through the reading of dialogues and practice with carefully structured pattern drills. The other approach, called the &quot;Explicit Method,&quot; is based on the cognitive code-learning theory of language acquisition. Students are given explicit explanations of the grammatical problem before they are given the opportunity to practice the language. The general conclusion drawn from the experiments is that adult students acquire foreign language grammar better by using a cognitive method than by using a method based  exclusively on habit-forming principles. Procedures and experimental results are described in this report. (Author/RL)",

A set of premises is proposed for a new scheme for the teaching of German based on these findings, namely, that comprehension precedes production, that language material is stored in short-term memory as chunks of seven plus two units, that pronunciation is best avoided until syntax and semantics are well learned, that the native language (English) interferes with the learning of the foreign language (German), and that language learning takes place optimally when the student is solving problems rather than memorizing by rote. The report presented here raises questions for continuing research on these  theories. The explanatory paper, included with the report, establishes the premises mentioned above and describes their practical application through the use of a teaching machine. (Author/VM)",

The central mission of this evaluation project was to determine to what extent the selection, funding, and implementation of Title I projects in California during the past 5 years have been successful in achieving the national, state, and local objectives set for Title I. The evaluation team found that the Title I Act contains a lack of clarity concerning what kinds of activities are  appropriately and legally fundable under Title I. Four major recommendations are made by the evaluation team for developing: (1) more adequate communication between Title I project personnel; (2) more longevity of service for those who have professional expertise in conceptualizing and implementing broad-aim community-oriented educational programs; (3) more effective interinstitutional and intrainstitutional consortial arrangements for Title I programming; and (4) more adequate reporting of the extensive, imputed and verifiable consequences of Title I projects.

The formula is used in this study to determine the value of the basic income unit for Ontario universities for academic year 1968-69 by projecting additional needs of the universities from the 1967-68 data. By projecting the number of fulltime equivalent professors and students at the individual universities, the basic income unit can be derived. The formula pertains, in this report, only to those universities that have been well established and have been in operation long enough to make accurate projections. A separate formula has been derived for the newer emerging universities. (HS)",

The State of North Carolina has, since 1969, supported experiential learning programs, known as service-learning programs, through the North Carolina Internship Office (NCIO). To provide a sound learning context, service-learning requires of any internship that: (1) there be a task whose meaning is clear to the students; (2) the student receive in his placement careful support from his educational institution; and (3) reciprocal learning among the student and his work directors to be assumed.  Thus, within this context, NCIO embarked on a strategy from the fall of 1969 to the present that includes: (1) development of regional service-learning programs in Appalachian North Carolina; (2) assistance with urban university model programs in Charlotte and Winston-Salem; (3) liaison with existing and newly created student internship programs and their managers; (4) development of issue-focused internship programs in planning, health, law, and the environment; and (5) sustained planning, advocacy, and evaluative review.

In a highly industrialized society such as the United States, the interaction between technology and public policy is continual and complex.

Technology assessment has been advanced as a way of enabling decisionmakers to better understand and anticipate the societal impacts of technological developments. The purpose of the research reported in the present report was to carry out an empirical investigation of the quality of the Federal process  for planning and evaluating technological programs. It was found that Federal executive agencies, have, within the last 5 to 10 years, improved and broadened the process through which they plan and evaluate technological projects and programs. However, Congress is demanding from public administrators more soundly grounded information about the possible consequences of governmental actions that decisionmaking on the national level might be even more improved.

The type of level of college in which students were enrolled were found to be  related to the major background factors: public vocational students were more likely to enroll at CUNY; public vocational graduates were more likely to be enrolled in a CUNY 2-year college; students with lower averages were more likely to attend a 2-year college than a 4-year college; family income was related to variation in full-time college attendance; family income, high school grades, and ethnic identification were all found to be interrelated; and student choice of institution was directly related to income.

Students must master not only tremendously expanded bodies of scientific knowledge, but must also understand the behavioral components of health and illness, and complexities of health care as an institutional process, the variety of settings in which a physician may choose to practice, and the methods of bringing about social changes that will strike at the roots of medical problems. Thus, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development sponsored four conferences on  Behavioral Sciences to define specific contributions the behavioral sciences can and should make to medical education in the areas of knowledge, attitudes, skill and research. They discussed the educational process and the most effective ways of integrating behavioral science material into medical education. They identified major behavioral science components of medical education, and they examined the various administrative structures through which the behavioral sciences are currently offered in the medical schools.

Part I discusses the recognition and understanding of the importance of integrity groups and the strength obtained from peer groups in the habilitation and rehabilitation of the severely disabled from poverty areas, addictive categories, spinal cord injuries, deafness, and blindness, with special reference to the younger disabled on junior high school levels. Part II  discusses the use of the workshop or center as an appropriate environment and an essential partner of the campus and the university or college with whom it has signed an agreement. Part III takes into consideration responsiveness to multiple approaches to the education and training of rehabilitation facility personnel such as classroom instruction, orientation of university and college faculty to the rehabilitation process, fieldwork or clinical experiences, research undertakings, and the orientation of business and industry to responsibility in educational involvement with the placement process.

The program provides the background, skills and knowledge necessary for college work through a 12-week, 5-day-per-week schedule in which the emphasis is on basic communication skills such as reading, writing, speaking and understanding English and mathematics. The purpose of this study was to obtain data that systematically describes the characteristics of the students enrolled in VSEP. More specifically, the objectives were: (1) to assess  selected personal and social adjustment characteristics found among a group of educationally disadvantaged veterans enrolled in the program; (2) to identify the perceived personal problems of the veterans in selected areas; (3) to assess selected aspects of the life-style characteristics of the veterans enrolled in the program; (4) to determine the degree to which the veterans desired or felt an openness to counseling; and (5) to provide participants with an opportunity to improve their counseling and curricular programs.

He feels that only by black people owning their own businesses, thereby becoming producers as well as consumers, can the black people as a race have a hand in the future of the country. He emphasizes that it will be hard, but it is something that must be done. Further, the author protests the eminent danger that TSU is in as it is faced with closing its doors or merging with the other state universities in Tennessee.

Demands began to pour in for higher student/faculty ratios in order to cut back the educational costs. Despite arguments that such action would decrease the quality of higher education, many colleges and universities increased their class size. The results, as found by a Carnegie Commission study group, indicate that the number of students sitting before a faculty member in a classroom has little to do directly with the quality of the educational results achieved. Educational quality depends upon the availability to topnotch students and teachers, and the use of excellent instructional methods; upon the efforts and interests of students; and upon the constant interaction of  students and faculty members.

A year later, on July 15, 1967, the number of unfilled positions reached 661 or 7.7% of all authorized positions in the system. To make matters worse, a freeze on all jobs was in effect for employees of the State, including academic positions, for 3 months during 1967. At the last minute, the ban on hiring for academic positions was lifted after an announcement was made that formal restrictions on the numbers of students who could be accepted for the 1967-68 school year had been devised because of a lack of professors. Somehow, by September 1967, most of the faculty vacancies had been filled. This study was designed to answer questions  surrounding this issue. Included in the objectives of the study were: (1) From what sources and by what means did the colleges secure large numbers of faculty at the last minute? (2) What are the characteristics of those who were appointed, in terms of academic preparation, previous experience, and other qualifications, and what patterns exist given the nature of these characteristics and the period in which the individual was appointed? (3) On the academic departmental level, what are seen as the principal factors affecting their ability to secure qualified new faculty members? (HS)",

When the student and an agency supervisor have reached agreement, the student is placed on the payroll.

It was found that Ontario and the Western Provinces have been ahead of Quebec in the graduate degrees/labor force ratio for several years. In Quebec itself, the French universities produce more master's degrees than the English universities, but McGill surpasses all of the French universities in the output of  doctorates. As for the catching-up policy set for the French universities, it seems that they have not yet attained the breadth of research and scientific training that doctoral level programs should include.

        "description":"This study traces the academic performance of the entering freshmen class of 1959 at the University of Arizona for 10 years. The objectives were to ascertain how many students succeeded in attaining a college degree at the University and elsewhere and to determine some of the relationships between various measures of scholastic performance and college attrition. Stated briefly, 23% graduated from the University in 4 years, and 3% graduated elsewhere in the same time. Another 18% of the total class graduated from the University within the next 6 years along with 8% who graduated elsewhere. An additional 2% were enrolled at the time the study was completed. In other words, 54% of the class received a baccalaureate degree within 10 years or were about to. A consistent trend was the  positive relationship between measures of scholastic performance and college success. The probability of graduation was low for those students with poor scholastic records and high for those with strong records. Expressed in terms of high school class rank, the chances of graduating were more than twice as great for people from the top fifth of their high school classes as for those from the bottom fifth.

Alumni from the classes of 1965 and 1966 were asked why they attended the college and to provide information about experiences they had at the college and their life since graduation. No general differences in college experiences were found for alumni who did or did not attend graduate school, for alumni who did or did not hold a job related to their major, for alumni in various occupations, and for alumni at different income levels. The college environment did, however, provide distinctly different experiences for different types of students. Students who attended the college  because they liked its smallness placed greater emphasis on liberal social goals. They were more socially active as students, and continued this trend after graduation through greater participation in community activities. Students who attended the college because they liked its Christian environment placed greater emphasis on conservative social goals and participated more in the formal education process. Results indicate that different students tend to seek out experiences that reinforce their already existing beliefs and interests. (Author)",

The purpose of this paper is to review the recommendations of the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education, the Assembly on University Goals and Governance of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the HEW Task Force on Higher Education, and the Commission on Human Resources and Advanced Education. Running throughout the reports of the various commissions and task forces is a deep and pervasive concern with the future of  higher education in this country. A combination of crises has convinced many educational leaders and spokesmen that higher education as it existed in the sixties is no longer adequate for the changing demands of the seventies and eighties.

In this document, the author points out the necessary elements for such a living-learning institution to survive. The author feels that the campus environment grows out of the chemistry of three elements: people, space and events. There is a need for a full and continuing analysis of people participating or served in the college, and there should be a large mix of people with a varied spectrum of interests. Space should be flexible and open in order to enhance creativity, and the more persons that are  utilizing an area of space at one time, the better for increased communication and activity. Events are the result of a proper mix of people and density of space. Events should normally be kept small, using large events as punctuation only. Programs should be planned so that various persons might be involved and should be flexible enough to have room for improvement. (HS)",

Data collected from the completion of pilot and research instruments was obtained from the faculty members in 72 academic departments in 12 Pacific Northwest institutions. A principal component factor analysis identifies 6 domains that pervaded the organizational climate of the academic departments sampled. Factor analysis of the subtest scores for the 6 domains allowed for a 3-factor solution to be accepted for the analysis at the departmental level. To analyze the departments' climates, double standardized subtest scores were calculated. The  scores of selected departments within each group were used to describe the organizational climates that provided models for the identified climate. The findings of this investigation were that: (1) the OCDQ-HE is a valid instrument to assess the organizational climate of academic departments; and (2) the consolidation in this investigation in higher education of the same factors found in the original study was shown.

The major hypothesis of the research was that there would be a significant positive relationship between student ratings of faculty effectiveness and certain aspects of perceptual organization. The subjects were 32 junior college instructors. Two student ratings were administered to students of all the instructors participating in the study. The first instrument was the Purdue Instructor Performance Indicator (PIPI), a forced-choice rating scale in which the student is required to make a series of choices from blocks of descriptive behavioral items. The second instrument was a self-anchoring scale of teacher effectiveness called  the Teacher Rating Scale (TRS). Multiple stepwise regression correlations computed between the six perceptual dimensions using ratings inferred from TAT protocols and PIPI student ratings indicates that four of the dimensions produced a multiple R of .70 and accounted for 49 percent of the variation found in the criterion. In specific terms of teaching excellence at the junior college level, effective teaching becomes a matter of working through the environment, in essence, providing the student with greater freedom to explore and discover his maximum potential.

        "description":"The Sixth Annual Report on the characteristics of newly appointed full-time faculty in California Community Colleges for the academic year 1972-73 provides relevant data from 94 public and 10 private community colleges. The size of the faculties in these institutions vary from 3 to 557 full-time faculty, both new and continuing, for a total of 14,343. Adding the part-time faculties, the total is around 20,000 faculty members for 876,000 students. During the academic year, 827 new full-time faculty were hired, 440 of these being replacements. Comparisons with figures of the previous three years shows a steady drop in full-time faculty. Reasons for this drop are given: (1) a high retention rate of old faculty, (2) the larger number of part-time faculty and staff, (3) an increase in  class size from 25-28 to 33-35, and (4) an increase in teaching, counseling, and housekeeping activities for full-time instructors. The characteristics of the newly hired full-time faculty are reported as follows: (1) 58% males, 42% females; (2) 78% Caucasian, 8% black, 9% Chicano, 3% Asian, 1% Native American, 1% other; (3) majority ranged in age from 26-42 years; (4) 24% had non-teaching experience; (5) 3% new instructors had no prior teaching experience; (6) 1% had been Research Assistants; 3% had practice teaching, private teaching or tutoring; 9% had been Teaching Assistants; 17% had secondary school experience; 26% were experienced community college faculty; and 15.1% had 4-year college or university experience; (6) 9% had less than a BA degree and 17% had less than an MA; 7% had  PhD's; (7) 13% were in Health Services field, 7% in English, 9% in Trade-Technical, 6% in Public Personnel Services; (8) new counselors employed was 5.5%.

        "description":"Current literature on the three-year B.A. degree is reviewed as to its history, recent background, and anticipated problems (curriculum, finance, quality, and role of community colleges). The three-year degree dates back to 1640, when it was awarded at Harvard until about 1655. Three-year B.A. degrees received new impetus during the late 19th and early 20th century at Johns Hopkins, Columbia, Chicago, and Yale, as well as many other American colleges and universities. Recent interest in reducing the undergraduate program to three years is in programs that not only cut costs but also accelerate the educational process without loss of quality or content. Two programs that have proven most popular in attempts to shorten the length of the undergraduate program are the College  Advanced Placement Program and the College Level Examination Program of the College Entrance Examination Board. The problem of curriculum is discussed from the viewpoints of educators and students. The extent to which three-year degree programs would alleviate the financial crisis in higher education remains to be determined. It appears that unless not only the degree requirements but also the over all enrollment are reduced financial savings will not be realized. As to the quality of education in a shortened program, it is felt that any three-year degree program that emphasizes further cutbacks in general education will widen the communications gap brought about by training in minute specialties. The suggestion that community colleges offer three-year degrees is said to have little  merit, as such a program would change these institutions from their original purpose of meeting the educational needs of the community. It is concluded that thoughts of a three-year degree should be abandoned. (DB)",

        "description":"In this study of the extensiveness of impact, as measured by number of academic courses terminated, of selected self-related factors on student attrition, 1802 subjects, 1142 males and 660 females, comprised the sample. The factors investigated were: within-district/out-of-district residence; part-time/full-time enrollment status; and sex. Each factor was used as an independent criterion measure for classifying students according to the variable response categories (male/female, part-time/full-time, within-district/out-of-district), and an evaluation was made as to empirical variation between factor subgroups. The criterion measure of attrition used was a statistical tabulation of curriculum course withdrawals during the Fall Semester 1972 by the entire sample of students who  enrolled during the Fall Semester 1971. Five statistical analyses were conducted. Results of the study show that there are significant differences in attrition rates for students classified according to place of residence relative to the number of courses terminated. It was also found that student attrition is higher among part-time as compared with full-time students. The majority of female students (79%) terminated only one or two courses prior to institutional withdrawal, whereas 59% of the male students exhibited a similar tendency. It was also found that enrollment status does affect the sex factor in student attrition. Although women exhibit a lower tendency than men to terminate their entire program prior to institutional withdrawal, enrollment status is an intervening factor.  Finally, it was found that 36% of the total student population did not return. Tables present the statistical data. (DB)",

Data collected and tabulated related to (1) institutional sex ratios, (2) sex distribution in curriculum programs, (3) sex distribution on non-college occupational program advisory committees, (4) sex membership and participation in student activities organizations, (5) salary range ascription by sex  for occupational and transfer program graduates, (6) sex distribution of non-academic Metropolitan Junior College District personnel, (7) patterns of promotion of non-academic personnel, (8) sex distribution of academic Metropolitan Junior College District administrative personnel, (9) patterns of promotion of administrative personnel, (10) sex distribution of district member college faculty, and (11) sex distribution for membership of district-wide and member college organizational committees. The study population consisted of 9,282 persons. Data, analyzed by use of a basic comparison (by inspection) method, show that the status of women in higher education and the professions is predetermined as a function of early childhood socialization. The findings relevant to the status of women in  the Metropolitan Junior College District provide documentary evidence of imbalanced sex distribution in higher education.

The major potential bargaining representatives (faculty senate, AAUP, NEA, and AFT) are examined, and the conclusion is reached that, since the few differences between them are growing smaller, it does not matter which is chosen as bargaining representative. Fifteen issues involving working conditions and educational policies are listed as examples of the problems over which faculties must decide who has authority. The second paper, by  G. W. Angell, presents in outline form: (1) objectives of the public employees' fair employment laws; (2) analysis of 1972 (spring) working conditions for faculties in New York State Community colleges; (3) current bargaining issues (teaching load, office hours, leaves with pay, tenure, special expenses, insurance, and retirement provision); (4) areas of concern (questions concerning the college's ability to retain its integrity in the face of internal and societal pressures); (5) common goals (possibly trends); and (6) obstacles.

A study of the economic conditions in each county further indicates that in certain areas there can be no anticipation of local support for even the most basic of library services; i.e., books and a place to shelve them. The only alternative is to provide service either from a regional center, the Library Commission, or continue to let these &quot;worked out&quot; areas remain unserved. Thus the State Agency must be the vanguard to develop new and imaginative programs to move existing libraries  forward, and at the same time, go back to the basics of providing the deprived communities, at the least, with books and facilities for use.

The chief new component of the Five-Year Program presented is the development of ways to reach those who are not now library users at the same time that services to the current patrons are improved and strengthened. This particularly refers to those who have not sought out libraries because they have lacked advantages in a variety of ways. The program calls for a continuance and strengthening of the five Interrelated Library Systems and the Statewide library networks already established. The new efforts delineated in this five-year program are: (1) selective acquisition, (2) special services to pre-school children, (3) a statewide network  of services to the homebound, (4) library services for economic advancement, (5) libraries as a focus of continuing education and (6) the training of para-professionals for work in libraries.

The FWL (Far West Laboratory) Library Classification System is designed to meet these criteria. For instance, a letter classification is used because it is more concise (26 letters vs. 10 digits) which allows related materials to be more adequately classified in (sometimes) an easily remembered combination. Since logic is important, it is not sacrificed to mnemonic considerations. A letter system also allows more room for expansion and flexibility. In general single letters are devoted to categories basic to  education and educational research (for instance; C--the child, E--education, and K--curriculum). These categories are grouped both logically and mnemonically and sub-divided largely mnemonically when this method is not too illogical. (Author/NH)",

Ninety-six college undergraduates were given three trials to learn the characteristics of ships from a text. Attributes of each ship were clustered together (name organization), or sentences describing one attribute for all ships (e.g., their speeds) were clustered together (attribute organization). It was found that organization affected (1) level of recall, (2) subjective organization of recall, and (3) apprehension of certain relationships. Subjects tested for attribute organization, who had errorless recall, had difficulty answering questions that required combining information about each ship. Attribute organization  produced the lowest free recall and caused subjects to impose a new order on sentences within clusters. The position of names and attributes was varied in the text sentences and learning objectives given to subjects. It was also found that the number of sentences incorrectly recalled increased if position was in some way incompatible with text organization. (Author/DI)",

She discusses the initiation motif as a suggested frame of reference for this study, devoting the major portion of her paper to a discussion of how William Faulkner's \"Go Down, Moses\" and Ralph Ellison's \"Invisible Man\" can be used to illustrate this theme as it relates to racial interaction in American society. The author also suggests some other American novels dealing with minority groups that can be taught in thematic units. These include \"The Adventures of Augie March\" by  Saul Bellow, \"The Learning Tree\" by Gordon Parks, and \"Pocho\" by Jose Villareal, and other novels which suggest the value fiction can have in presenting complex social problems in subtle and vivid ways.

Sixteen black and eight Puerto Rican male fifth graders were the subjects of a test of this hypothesis. Four variables were examined: language proficiency, physical aggression, verbal aggression, and total aggression. Conclusions indicated that (1) Puerto Rican subjects had significantly lower scores than black subjects on total language proficiency, and (2) both verbal and total aggression results for the Puerto Rican group were significantly greater than those for the blacks. (The physical aggression scores for the Puerto Ricans were also higher than those for the blacks, but not significantly.)  The authors state that the findings were limited by the size of the sample, the fact that females were present (as observers) in one group, and the fact that the results relate only to proficiency in Standard English as measured by one test.

To facilitate this approach to learning, the guide is not organized into traditional subject matter divisions, nor is it arranged by grade levels. Rather the guide contains ten subject matter \"strands\": language, listening, speaking, literature, critical thinking, reading, writing, media, spelling, and imagination. The authors suggest two methods for using the guide. In the first method the teacher finds an objective he thinks will challenge his students and then works forward in the guide as far as his students are capable of  going. Each strand is subdivided according to a particular division of the subject and contains an objective to be learned and suggested procedures for accomplishing that objective. In the second suggested method for using the guide, the teacher selects a particular subject matter and uses only those parts of the guide containing material on that subject. The guide also includes three model lessons, an index, a glossary, and a list of multi-media resources. (Author/DI)",

The writer states that too much emphasis has been placed on the means by which certification is achieved while too little emphasis has been placed on the goal of certification. To correct this overemphasis it is proposed that a competency-based and field-centered program be established which explicitly and publicly states the required competencies, provides for their assessment, establishes performance standards, and allows for their modification. Three major changes in certification policy and procedure are recommended: (1) the Division of Teacher Education and Certification will cease evaluating  individual credentials; this task should be performed by each preparatory program; (2) within five years a teacher with a provisional certificate should complete a masters degree or 30 semester hours of graduate study; and (3) periodic assessment should be made of newly certified teachers. The author also argues that continuing education programs for teachers need to be improved. (Author/DI)",

In Experiment 2, 100 items were chosen to form a subtest, and the subtest was cross validated on a new sample of subjects. The test in Experiments 1 and 2 were scored using signal-detection measures. The primary criterion, SAT (verbal) scores, correlated approximately .60 with the test scores. In Experiment 3 subjects scaled the words and nonwords for four psychological attributes. These were submitted to a stepwise regression analysis with the confidence ratings from  Experiment 1 as the dependent variable. It was concluded that associability, frequency, orthography, and pronounceability all may be components of word recognition. However, only frequency was found to be a significant predictor of the confidence of recognition of nonwords. (Author)",

Experiment 1 (Sentence Recall) attempted to answer three questions: (1) What are some of the developmental differences between standard and nonstandard speech? (2) To what extent are these differences sex and social class bound? (3) To what extent is the nonstandard variant racially bound? Experiment 2 (Interaction-Communication) investigated the developmental differences in the use of standard and nonstandard English in a situation utilizing stimulus variation. Results revealed that socioeconomic status, race, age, and sex were not equally robust. Sex was found to be the least important variable, while race and age were found to be most important. The recall task  showed that blacks performed better than whites in terms of percentages correct when given stimulus sentences in nonstandard dialect, and that whites performed better than blacks when standard dialect was used. It was further found that blacks used standard and nonstandard expressions to the same degree in the language comprehension and production study. No racial differences were found with regard to listening comprehension. For both blacks and whites a positive correlation was found between the number of standard forms repeated correctly and the number of spontaneously produced standard structures. (Author/HS)",

Specific objectives were: (1) to represent semantically the structural meaning of English discourse by a well-defined semantic model; (2) to develop a way of using the semantic representation of a text as a structural model for scoring a subject's acquired knowledge; (3) to develop a process model for discourse comprehension; and (4) to investigate hypotheses about the effects of certain contextual conditions, designed to induce inferences about text content, on knowledge acquired from a text. Written reconstructions of knowledge acquired from a text were used in three experimental contexts: \"arbitrary,\"\"problem solving,\" and an incidental memory condition.  Basic data consisted of the relative frequencies of classes of response from a semantic analysis of recall procedures. Results were consistent with a model of comprehension consisting primarily of \"generative\" rather than purely \"interpretive\" processes. Sources of individual differences were also studied. Part 2 contains a detailed development of a semantic structural model of English discourse and a technique for measuring semantic information acquired from discourse. (Author/DI)",

Taking issue with the assumption of a non-problematic relationship between reality and theory testing, he analyzes the static-state view of reality in contrast to an in-flux reality view. He suggests that the explanation and understanding of events (in-flux) may be a more attainable goal than prediction and control (static state) in relation to determining the effects of mass media communication on the public.

Self-report measures include a variety of rating scales, interest and attitude scales, Krugman's \"number of 'connections,'\" and program audience analyzers. Operant behavioral techniques evolve from the conditioning paradigm of Skinner and include response accumulators, tachtiscopic studies, and \"shadowing.\" The psychophysiological measures are connected to attention by the Sokolov theory of the neuronal model. The author discusses these measures in terms of recent studies, methodological pitfalls, and future opportunities for those engaged in communications research and the specific  variable of attention. Finally, he develops a mathematical model of attention, based on McPhee's survival theory. The model is constructed on the premise that the brain is a random system and that it is the attentional process that establishes the cognitions from which language and other social behaviors evolve.

Too little research and insufficient attention to operationalization of independent variables, such as measurement of the humor of humorous material, coupled with a dearth of valid measurement procedures are seen as other contributing factors. The author makes several suggestions for the improvement of humor research, emphasizing the need for development of very clear theory about humor. Among the possible study directions he mentions are the use of humor in affecting ethos, humor's  unifying effect upon audiences, and making use of certain psychological theories of humor to examine how humor may be produced.

Between 1875 and 1890 he reviewed several productions in Boston, New York, London, and Paris for &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; and other periodicals. The reviews are of interest because of James' high standards regarding acting and his often devasting comments about famous actors. James held three basic principles about acting: it is an art, its realism should be tempered with style, and it should be vocally effective. Among the actors whom he criticized were Ellen Terry and Henry Irving, whom he denounced as amateurs, and Sarah Bernhardt, whom he condemned as a professional of the worst kind--not an artist but a publicist.

A pilot study was first conducted to determine representative time limits for a specific task. The major study involved 220 undergraduates randomly assigned to 28 groups of five members each. These groups were assigned to one of four time limit conditions (short, medium, long, and none) and were asked to establish a ranking of a priority list of items recommended for survival on the moon. Each member was then asked to complete satisfaction  measures following the decision.

The author proposes a cybernetic model which will allow for the exact specification of the rules and structures of the elements in the whole system. In support of this approach, the author notes that interpersonal, small group, organizational, and mass communication can be viewed productively as systems utilizing the cybernetic model.

Finally, once the student profiles and the instructional objectives have both been established, the appropriate \"instructional  mix\" for each student can be determined. The authors also discuss the purpose of computer assisted instruction within the computer managed system, the role of the system in the college's relationship with media professionals, and possibilities for research utilizing the computer managed instruction system.

        "description":"The author contends that man as a receiver of information is largely manipulated by the information sources. He proposes a system of substantive rhetoric, whereby we could perceive how past assumptive reasoning processes have allowed us to be manipulated and how these processes have originated outside rather than within ourselves. The author suggests the dimensions of the proposed substantive rhetoric be viewed through three factors: reality as fantasized by man; reality as perceived; and reality as it exists, or what the author terms reality infinity. He contends that man tends to view true reality through fantasy rather than through his true perception, and he hopes through his substantive rhetoric process that man can view reality infinity through perceptive reality. It is the  purpose of the author's proposals to provide a system that will allow man to bring about a \"self-Change.\" To accomplish this, he must be shown that (1) what he is doing in relation to receiving new external stimuli is right, and (2) the new information he receives as external stimuli is not threatening.

        "description":"This paper outlines a program of planned change designed to produce a more satisfying and meaningful set of skill objectives for undergraduate instruction in communication. As a philosophy of communication education, interpersonal competence is based on two key assumptions: (1) that every human being is motivated to interact effectively with his environment, to produce effects on or to influence his world; and (2) that individuals learn social effectiveness throughout life. Interpersonal competence is defined as the individual's ability to give and receive descriptive feedback, to own and help others to own to their values and feelings, to experiment with new values and behaviors, and to invest and take risks with new attitudes and ideas. The challenge facing the communication  educator is that of creating classroom conditions which facilitate the development of these skills. (LG)",

They discuss the role of communication as one of the several strategies leading to conflict and as a potential strategy leading to conflict resolution. First, there is tacit communication, wherein the participants are engaged not in face-to-face interactions but in achieving a mutual goal; agreement, or success, is dependent on the interacting factors of culture and knowledge of the other's probable response. Second, there is implicit communication, the expression of intent to perform some act and the subsequent bargaining, which involves three methods of influence: persuasion, inducement, and constraint; the variables associated with conflict resolution include trust, defection, agreement,  negotiation, and commitment. Finally, there is ideal explicit communication, showing confidence between the participants and correct interpretation of acts among the participants, and imperfect explicit communication, with attitudes of distrust and misinterpretations of acts among the participants. All three forms of communication interact with one another in almost every conflict situation. (RN)",

One goal of the women's liberation movement is to persuade women that they live in a state of oppression and, bringing them to this realization, to provide them with the means of breaking out of their psychological bondage. The consciousness-raising group, essentially small group discussion, is the most vital instrument by which the movement hopes to realize these goals. Bringing their lifetime experiences as women to the group, individuals interact through oral communication and exchange personal accounts and feelings. After participating in this communicative experience, the author argues, the women often become more aware of one another as people, learn to value themselves, and  learn to view their role in the economic, social, and political arenas with new awareness. The language used in consciousness-raising is the language of oppression and dissatisfaction with the status-quo. A number of key terms in the vocabulary of consciousness-raising are analyzed. (LG)",

He must also have a broad background in communication skills, especially since theories are not the core of employee training programs. As much as possible, he must tailor the program or course design for individual needs, examining personnel records, if necessary, to determine overall backgrounds. His teaching methods must be structured on an open approach, providing many opportunities for discussion, questioning, and feedback. Finally, he must begin at  the outset, especially if he is a college professor, to develop a feeling of trust and rapport with students who are not college-oriented. If a training program proves successful, then the consultant is quite likely to be considered for organizational research problems. (Author/RN)",

In his discussion of the theories which ascribe meaning to vocal utterance--the two imitative theories, the onomatopoeic and the gestural, and the theories of synaesthesia and kinaesthesia--he describes and demonstrates how the various kinds of speech symbolism are found in individual words and in poetic lines and passages. Taking issue with Samuel Johnson's treatment of a passage from Pope's \"Odyssey,\" the author criticizes Johnson's failure to discern the part played by phonetic symbolism in relation to the poem's meaning and rhythm.

(2) Can humor external to and contiguous with a persuasive message increase its persuasiveness? The research on the first question attempted to determine intervening variables responsible for prior failure to find effects of humor on persuasion. The initial opinions and verbal ability of the subjects were factors expected to interact significantly with the humor factor. Though the results did not support the verbal ability factor, subjects were found to react more favorably to humorous than to serious appeals. The research addressing the second question analyzed the message context--humorous or serious--in relation to subjects'  moods. The results did indicate a positive correlation between the humorous context and happier subject mood, but did not reveal any difference in persuasive effect. The author concludes that humor's effects on persuasion may occur through mediating processes not investigated in this study and suggests further investigation of humor's effects on source credibility and attention.

        "description":"This study focuses upon the rock concert as a ceremonial or epideictic rhetoric. A major function of rhetoric, Kenneth Burke suggests, is to achieve a symbolic transcendence of the sense of division among men. Rock music, the author contends, fulfills this Burkean definition and serves the dual function of identification and unification for the youth subculture. The rock concert is described as a kind of modern ritual. Associated with rock are prescribed standards of dress, behavior, and performance. A life-style, generally challenging the &quot;official&quot; morality, is established. Messages about human relationships and societal norms are conveyed by the song lyrics of the music and by the progression of the concert itself. These messages are not didactically communicated to the  listener, but are open to individual adaptation and interpretation. Thus the music becomes a ritual of self-confirmation. Through the process of sharing the music, youth culture unification is established. (Author/LG)",

The author concludes by outlining clues to future developments or trends: closer interaction between sales and management training; increased study of nonverbal communication; intercultural approaches to communications problems; effects of emotion on organizational operations; and increased requests for assistance to business  from the academic world.

The comprehension of political events in dramatic terms is the burden of the author's thesis in this paper. \"Drama\" is a form of organizing and understanding material; the \"theatrical\" is what has attracted us to the material in the first place. The television series about the William C. Loud family of Santa Barbara is cited as an example to illustrate how the media fix human events in a situation which is amenable to description. Disposed to want drama and to want theatricality, our culture is prepared to sponsor the enormous economic  and technical organization required for film and television. Having developed these media, we are influenced by them autonomously, and their requirements affect our politics ever more profoundly. (EE)",

Specialists in many educational areas were asked to identify the characteristics of educational structure in relation to the achievement of established goals that would be essential to provide necessary and desirable programs. After having assessed the available research, reviewed the literature, and secured the empirical judgment of knowledgeable leaders and administrators in their respective fields of specialization, these specialists submitted 54 position papers to the Great Plains School District Organization Project. Fifteen of these papers have been reproduced in  this publication. It is hoped that these contributions will be used as starting points for further study, analysis, and utilization by those who seek to develop a system of school organization that will make possible comprehensive and equitable educational opportunities for all children, particularly those in the State of Nebraska.

The 45-15 plan, which divides students into four groups and gives each group a three week vacation after every 45 class days, is modeled after the Valley View 45-15 Plan. The plan was initiated after increased enrollments and the failure of several district bond and tax elections had made increased use of existing facilities imperative. The first part of the document describes the historical beginnings of the problem -- bond issue defeats, enrollment trends, voter opinion, and alternative methods studied. The document then describes (1) the formation, activities, and recommendations of an advisory committee set up to help develop and  implement a year-round program; and (2) school board action on the advisory committee recommendations. In the last two sections of the document can be found a school calendar, some information letters and sheets, and various newspaper articles about the program.

Projections resulting from this research suggest that relatively more resources will probably go to the prekindergarten and elementary levels in the year 2000; many students will earn high school and college diplomas through instructional television and computer-assisted instruction; and college degrees will be earned with an average of 2 years' work after high school. This report also investigates the effects of population growth -- 2-child versus 3-child families -- on the cost of future schooling. The investigation also led  to the conclusion that more rapid growth rate will lead to about 45 percent higher educational spending in the year 2000 and to relatively more spending at the prekindergarten and elementary levels. However, educational expenditures are deemed unlikely to rise as rapidly in relation to the gross national product (GNP) as they did between 1960 and 1970. (Author)",

        "description":"These models are based on the concept that school district decisionmakers seek an optimum balance between education program levels and tax burdens imposed on the community, subject to a budget constraint. A model is derived in which spending depends positively on community income and lump-sum grants and negatively on the relative price of educational inputs, the pupil/household ratio, and the local share of matching grants. Extensions take account of nonschool taxes, the composition of the property tax base (residential vs. business property), equalization features of State aid formulas, categorical grants, and enrollment growth. Since the models include lump-sum aid, matching aid, and interactions between them, they are potentially useful for selecting optimal aid formulas for  accomplishing a grantor's objectives. Explicit functional forms of the expenditure relationships are developed and variants of the model that can be tested with different data bases are described. (Author)",

        "description":"Educational planning involves both the notions of ordering any unordered educational system and that of replanning an institutional and policy framework according to new criteria. Planning refers to that situation where there are relatively few or no constraints on the planning process from existing educational institutions or current policy process. There is always a tension between the emergence and definition of new educational goals in answer to certain problems and the existing institutions and practices. One of the major tasks of educational planners is to try to resolve this tension. Educational replanning, on the other hand, is that educational planning necessitated by new, often unanticipated demands--demands subject to various kinds of economic, political, and social  constraints as well as the constraints presented by previous planning decisions. When replanning sets or helps to set new goals and objectives for the educational process, it is innovative; and when criteria, methods, and policies are revised in order to achieve accepted goals and objectives in the light of changing circumstances, it is reconstructive. The techniques of the committee and the ingenuity and strategem of the lone thinker are two models that have been of prime importance in ensuring effective educational planning. (Author)",

The intervention focuses on work roles and relationships; job function, authority, and communication patterns; and on reviewing group progress and problems. One objective of the strategy is to superimpose complementary collective decision structures over the existing authority structure of the school. An experimental design was employed in the study to evaluate the effects of the intervention on teacher attitudes toward important aspects of their work environment and on faculty perceptions of collective decision processes in the schools. To assess the impact of the intervention, 24 schools in northern Illinois were assigned  randomly to four treatment conditions: (1) SF-PS, which incorporates teacher collective decision structures; (2) survey feedback only; (3) pretest-posttest controls; and (4) posttest only controls. Elected faculty members were trained to lead the SF-PS sessions, provided a standardized attitude survey questionnaire for feedback, and assisted in establishing collective structural configurations in the full treatment schools. Questionnaire data indicated that the intervention brought about significant favorable changes in faculty attitudes in the experimental schools. (Figure 4.1 on page 37a may reproduce poorly.)

The existing program is outlined, ways in which the definition of &quot;disadvantaged&quot; is of critical importance to the functioning of the program are discussed, and adoption of the Social Security Administration's poverty line is proposed. The existing and proposed improvements in calculating the level of compensatory expenditure per eligible child allocatable to each State are discussed. It is suggested that State payments be adjusted to reflect  teacher costs. The grant specification section considers the advantages of a matching program as well as the incentive structure of the present program. Finally, an alternative proposal is evaluated. (Author/MLF)",

An administrator's leadership style develops in proportion to his adaptation to organizational structure, his personality and value system, his concept of personal success, experiences both in and out of his managerial capacity, and the role expectations as perceived by others. The resulting style, in turn, greatly influences the school and its personnel. Research indicates that administrators must be subordinate-centered and that, given the problem-oriented nature of modern school organizations, they must be adaptive. Documents cited in this review examine in detail the determinants and influences of managerial style. The review concludes with specific  recommendations of particular management styles.

On the basis of the experiences gained from the five general workshops and the field trials, the project principals developed a package of instruments and procedures they believed to be of significant value to all school principals and administrators. This document describes the development of the package and evaluates the success of the project. Topics considered in the package include leading effective meetings, communicating with others, organizational style, establishing objectives, time stewardship, and problem solving using force field  analysis. The learning package for principals is included in the appendix. (Author/DN)",

Returns were received from 771 teachers and 76 administrators out of a random sample of 1,075 Kansas certified school employees.

The authors contend that educational policy based merely on modifications -- extrapolations or refinements -- of existing programs will prove totally inadequate to meet the challenge. The paper describes those educational trends and broader societal patterns which seem likely to emerge and have profound implications for the assumptions and direction of education. It concludes with several possible initiatives that planners in the U. S.

Following this section is tabulated data from a survey analysis of educational practices in all 67 Florida school districts. The data reveal that Florida education appears to be most relevant for whites, is  lodged in the larger community's values and beliefs, and that nonconventional outcomes of education (delinquency, divorce, illegitimacy) have their origins in the community rather than in the schools.

        "description":"The aim of this project was to set up a building that completely fulfilled the educational requirements for a cost-level of semi-permanent (at least 20 years) school buildings. Because of factors that made forecasting the exact future function of this school difficult, and also because building and activities were expected to change continuously, it was decided to construct an experimental building. The building was to (1) have higher educational and functional qualities than the traditional semi-permanent school buildings, (2) be suited for repetition in other parts of the Netherlands, (3) be adaptable to the permanent and changing educational situations; and (4) have the same cost-level as that of traditional semi-permanent buildings. This document describes how the facility  was planned in consultation with teachers and pupils to meet structural and educational needs and presents comparative cost aspects. Floor plans and cost analysis tables accompany the text. (Photographs may reproduce poorly.) (Author/MLF)",

        "description":"This speech begins with a discussion of broad social and political patterns and trends that are currently developing and continues to the specific unresolved social issues which will affect the nature and structure of educational systems. Those issues seen by the author is most likely to produce the greatest amount of activity are integration, the urban fiscal crisis, the puralistic society vs the &quot;meltingpot&quot; concept, urban-suburban mandated court decisions, and students' quests for relevant educational experiences. The author focuses on the key issues of the social expectations for education and the political interpretations of these expectations. He contends that, to rectify the situation in which each school is made the focal point for the fulfillment of an unmanageable  amount of social expectations and demands, three alternatives are possible. These alternatives are to (1) increase governmental funding to provide necessary resources to meet the expectations; (2) eliminate some expectations; and (3) retain the expectations but recognize that a single school cannot meet them and combine a central school with satellite specialized schools that offer varied academic, social, and pedagogical orientation. The paper focuses much of its comment on the state of and expectations for education in Massachusetts. (Author/MLF)",

One of these issues, the financing of public education, was selected, and an investigation was launched to ascertain how written communications about educational finance could be custom tailored to particular social groups and whether such tailoring would pay off in communication benefits. The experiment targeted in on four socioeconomic groups in Dayton, Ohio -- low income blacks, low income whites, upper income blacks, and upper income whites. Fifty individuals were selected from each group to read and react to a basic document entitled, &quot;Paying for Our Schools.&quot; (See EA 005 106.) On the basis of reader  reaction, the basic document was customized for each audience. (See EA 005 107-111.) Study results demonstrated that people are relatively responsive to communication efforts on the part of the educational profession and that they prefer communication styles reflective of those to which they are habituated. This document details the rationale that led to the survey, describes the survey procedures, and presents the results of the survey for each group analyzed. An extensive bibliography on school finance is included. A related document is ED 070 188. (EA)",

Data indicated that the S steadily progressed through the instructional system in the order of visual perception, thinking activities, and language development. Thinking activity filmstrips were found to be especially helpful in indicating specific weaknesses in memory skill which were remedied by having the S repeat aloud the information indicated on given memory frames. It was reported that the S increased her vocabulary by a known quantity of 158 words,  acquired new confidence, and learned to assemble new words into sentences. S' response to the Project LIFE program was said to be very positive and enthusiastic. The S' parents recommended that Project LIFE be used in the home by parents of learning disabled children to accelerate and complement classroom instruction. (GW)",

Research on the visual perception of deaf persons was reviewed and found to support the following conclusions: there appears to be a relationship between hearing loss and deficient visual perceptual abilities; decreased visual perception skills have a positive relationship with poor reading abilities; remedial training in perceptual skills can enhance reading abilities; and the theoretical framework proposed to explain these effects involves a breakdown in sensory integration between the visual and auditory sensory mode. It was explained how visual perceptual skills form an important part  of a language development program. Data for each filmstrip was tabulated to indicate the number of students (3- to 13-years-old) on which the data was tabulated, the mean number of errors, the standard deviation of errors, and the range of errors. Other data indicated the percentage of 6-year-old children making specific number of errors and the cumulative percentages by units and sections of the LIFE program. Appendixes included outlines of field test filmstrips, the perceptual training contents of the field test filmstrips, examples of association frames in visual perceptual areas, field test filmstrips, examples of association frames in visual perceptual areas, field test reporting forms, revisions made on the visual perceptual filmstrips following field evaluation, and a comparison of  the field test filmstrip identification and the General Electric/LIFE filmstrip identification.

        "description":"Vocabulary used in the Language Improvement to Facilitate Education (LIFE) program is compared with the vocabulary used in A Functional Basic Word Listing for Special Pupils (FBWLSP). The vocabulary of the LIFE program is said to have been chosen on the basis of several language curriculum guides from schools for the deaf, the E. Thorndike and I. Lorge word list, the Dolch Basic Sight Vocabulary, and many consultants. The FBWLSP is said to consist of 2,483 words divided into elementary, intermediate, and advanced levels of difficulty. The combined total match of the Project LIFE vocabulary words with the special listing of vocabulary for special students on the three levels of LIFE materials was reported to be 90%. Words included in the Project LIFE materials which do not appear  in the basic word list are thought to be those referring to important components of the child's everyday activities at home and at school. The differences between the two lists are said to reflect the fact that the LIFE materials are designed to teach functional language, while the basic word list is more directed toward the child's reading of already developed materials. Appendixes include listings of references for language planning, language grids from Project LIFE, and an alphabetical listing of Project LIFE vocabulary. (GW)",

The team conducted a community wide project designed to establish contact with and evaluate the developmental progress of all preschool children in a low income rural school district. The initial contacts were home visits by paraprofessionals who evaluated the developmental level of all preschool children through the use of rating scales. Parents and children then attended a Community Clinic staffed by the multidiscipline team which screened children for developmental disabilities or special education needs. Of the 18 preschool children for whom educational intervention was recommended, 14 children were eventually  enrolled in either Head Start or Special Education classes. (Author)",

Approximately 20 pages of self-evaluative applications follow each section to determine whether the objectives have been met.

Explained in the section on prerequisite skills are using the test battery, recording test data, profiling prerequisite skills test  scores, and interpreting and prescribing in the area of prerequisite skills. Diagnosis, prescription, and examples of instructional objectives are given in the second section on the basic school subjects of reading, mathematics, writing, and spelling. Behavioral factors are considered in the third section which describes the PPP behavior profile, the L-J sociometric test, the self appraisal inventory, and the PPP school sentence form.

The identification of exceptional children is discussed in the second section which includes a paper on increasing the lead time for the preschool aged handicapped child, and a paper on the type of teacher who can effectively teach the  exceptional young child. The third section considers program models and resource materials in papers on the following topics: implications of research with disadvantaged children, training of parents in the early education of the handicapped, an early childhood education center with a developmental approach, a child development/day care resources project, and planning and evaluation. Three papers on the training of personnel consider training in a day care system, a handbook for training facilitators, and the need for an integrated approach to training, respectively. In the final section on initiating and implementing change are discussed public involvement in early childhood education in Illinois and the psychology of planned change. (DB)",

Common areas of concern of many of the authors include the following: the separation of the regular and special education systems is not educationally sound; traditional ways of labeling handicapped children are of limited educational value; evaluation of outcomes of educational intervention is a public concern; the team approach to diagnosis and treatment has not been as effective as anticipated; and much of the child's learning takes place outside the school. The first section on programs training service strategists presents a paper each on the following five models: statistician, learning problems, consulting teacher, diagnostic prescriptive teacher, and classroom  specialist. Resource systems are discussed in four papers of the second section which present precision teaching at both the elementary and secondary levels, a resource system for the educable mentally handicapped, and a general special education resource teacher model. Considered in the third section on structural change approaches are structural reform in an elementary school, structural reform in a total school district, preparing handicapped children for regular class participation, and clarifying sub-system service responsibilities.

An experiment on receptive communication which attempted to determine whether tactual information could be acquired simultaneously by several fingers indicated that superior performance resulted when patterns were scanned by one finger on each of two hands. A second experiment on receptive communication investigated the relative effectiveness of three alternative symbol systems which varied the geometric similarity of symbol and referent. Results showed the greatest learning occurred when symbol and object were similar. Also reported was the construction of two prototype systems that are intended to provide a means of expressive communication for two cerebral  palsied persons, one child and one adult. The system contained three functionally separate components: interface to the subject, code converter, and output display of symbols. Plans for the development of this system were said to include research on the selection of input codes, and arrangements for manufacture and distribution. (GW)",

Anticipations were analyzed according to the students' sex, academic major, age, hours in special education courses, and experience with EMR children. Data indicated that all groups of college students anticipated the nonretarded children's responses at a reasonable level of accuracy (mean of 13.2 correct answers out of a possible 24), but that none of the groups correctly anticipated responses of EMR Ss at any level of proficiency (mean of 5.5 correct answers out of 24). However, special education majors, students in special education  courses, students who had had experience with EMR children, oldest students, and females were better than their counterparts in anticipating responses of the EMR group. It was found that graduate special education majors did not anticipate more accurately than undergraduate majors, and that students who had taken two or three special education courses anticipated EMR responses as poorly as students with no special education background. Findings were thought to show that students are oversensitized to the differences between EMR and nonretarded children to such an extent that their anticipations of EMR responses are as poor as those of students without special training.

        "description":"Eye movements of 18 male and seven female dyslexic children and 10 normal children were evaluated to determine if eye movement disorders may be the cause of some of the symptoms associated with dyslexia. Data on eye movements were collected while Ss moved their eyes from one fixation point to another in a nonreading situation. Errors in vertical eye movements significantly differentiated between normal and dyslexic children. Within the dyslexic group, children who showed large vertical eye movement errors were also the ones whose reading problems included skipping or repeating lines and losing the place. It is concluded that eye movement disorders are probably the cause of reading problems for a subgroup of dyslexic children. (Author/DB)",

Two experiments were reported on the identification of stimuli varying in either one, two, or three dimensions. Retardates did not perform as well as normals of equal chronological or mental age. Multidimensionally varying stimuli were easier to identify than those varying undimensionally. In three experiments efficiency in identification and discrimination tasks was evaluated. The effects of dimensional combination and stimulus distinctiveness were similar both in normal adults and retarded children. Success was reported in increasing the efficiency of retardate performance by first  presenting a less demanding memory task (discrimination) and moving to a more demanding task (match-to-sample identification). Three experiments evaluated short term memory coding. Memory effects were found in all studies in which delay between stimulus presentation and response was varied. Explicit coding was not found to be effective at very short presentation times when the code was in octal form. The coding involved in remembering word-like material as opposed to non-word-like material was effective at even ten milliseconds presentation time. The rapid coding appeared to be under the subject's conscious control. (Author/DB)",

Two comparison groups were selected from a large sample on the basis of \"self-esteem,\" a variable hypothesized to be closely related to mass media usage. These groups responded to a questionnaire on television viewing habits and family background variables. They also took part in an experiment in which they viewed \"fantasy\" and \"realistic\" violence in films, after which they were interviewed on their responses. One result was that  high-esteem males preferred factual shows to fantasies, whereas low-esteem males preferred fantasy shows with male protagonists. Females preferred fantasy shows with female protagonists, and low-esteem females preferred them more than do high-esteem ones. High-esteem males viewed realistic violence more objectively, on the whole, than did other groups. (JK)",

This fact inevitably creates a great difference in the two, but not nearly so great as the confusion of this moment makes it seem. In an effort to reconcile the two media four concerns--naturalism, surface, a respect for the properties of the medium, and motion--appear to be important. These things do not represent goals--these are creation and expressiveness--but they do represent the ways one tries to reach goals. Video has almost no aesthetic history of its own, only the aesthetics of other media. In a sense it's too new for an aesthetic to be formed about it, but any art form that's a living, vibrant art form is always too new for an aesthetic about it to be formed. If it stops being too new, then it's an historical  phenomenon and is probably no longer being done. That's true of painting, as well as video. (Author/MC)",

One hundred and seven institutions were surveyed by questionnaire. The data indicated that 30% operated VHF television channels, 19% UHF channels, and over two-thirds had closed circuit television systems. The survey also revealed that 84% had radio channels and 90% had university owned production facilities. The survey presented statistics on the instructional uses of the systems and their sources of funds and programing. The author concluded that in spite of the widespread availability of telecommunication systems, more innovation and creative uses of the facilities and equipment should be made. (MC)",

Though some stations are still groping to overcome problems, others have moved steadily toward the goal of wider and better service for the community. The relationships between parent institutions and stations have become much stronger as the institutions realize the potential of the stations. Local community needs have gained priority in programing, and because of this, new sources of financing are being revealed. The Subsidiary Communications Authorizations of the Federal Communications Commission is being utilized for simultaneous broadcasting and community cable systems  are being encouraged.

As expected, the subjects with half of the objectives performed better than their counterparts without objectives on the posttest items referenced by their objectives (relevant learning) and less well on the items not covered by their objectives (incidental learning).

The two methods of remediation were equivalent overall, but there was some indication that low ability students found teacher remediation more supportive.

Secondly, the motion picture as an art form has become an object of study in the high school curriculum. Though film does not supplant the standard English literature courses, it has been offered as a viable option in the requirements for high school graduation. And finally, filmmaking itself has been incorporated into the curricula of both high schools and elementary schools. The implications of these developments are wide  ranging.

        "description":"The failures of instructional technology to meet the expectations of the society cannot be attributed to the inadequacies of the field alone. Although educational technology has promised more than it has delivered and has expected more from the schools than it reasonably should have, the threatening social conditions of America must be considered in evaluating the failure of oureducational technological hopes. In general, the failure is a result of the lack of an integrated system of social goals and objectives. What exactly is instructional technology supposed to do? To answer this question generates more penetrating questions into the ambiguous areas of sociology, American values, modern psychological theory, and eventually into media theory. It is here, in media theory, where  we begin to find, via McLuhan, an explanation of the systematic relationships that exist in media: we can see the need for the systems concept based on a sense of mission. The future of instructional technology is in the development, promulgation, and application of the systems concept. We have learned from our mistakes and are now ready to proceed into successful instructional technology. (MC)",

Over 200 elementary school teachers participated in the series which consisted of six half-hour televised lessons. The evaluation design analyzed teacher comprehension of the behaviors, their attitudes toward them, their use of the behaviors in the classroom, and the students' attitudes toward teacher-student interaction. The evaluation was conducted by questionnaire. The results of the evaluation showed that the series had demonstrated its ability to change teachers' understanding of the enabling behaviors as  well as to significantly increase the frequency with which four of the seven behaviors were used in the classroom.

Previous batch-process information retrieval systems for use with the ERIC data base have been extremely slow, and thus expensive of computer time. Gandalf uses the user request to produce a list of addresses within the overall data base, so that only a small subset of the material is selected, and processing of unreferenced material is avoided. Furthermore, since GANDALF was designed to be used by persons with little or no computer experience, an attempt has been made to make the request statements as simple to use as possible. In  comparisons runs, GANDALF was from ten to forty times as fast as QUERY (the currently available ERIC search system) in real time, and four to 77 times as fast in computer time. (Author/RH)",

However, managers felt that there was too little specialized target audience programing and a need to find new directions for public affairs such as &quot;weekly for-the-record program.&quot; Generally, managers slightly approved of a national instructional television service, indicated a  trend toward more air time, evidenced a minimum number of formal relationships with cable systems, and evaluated the usefulness of the Service Category System. Additionally, hope was expressed for the maintenance of the current proportions in the &quot;modified real time&quot; service, little interest was shown in the development of a second interconnection systems, and the PBS staff was perceived as being helpful.

Other aspects of the Reform included extensive teacher retraining, curriculum revision, and extensive building of new schoolrooms, among other things. The cost of the reform through 1973 will total roughly $30 million, of which about $7.3 million will pay for ITV. Tests show that students in Reform classrooms learned about 20% more (as measured by end-of-year tests) than did those in non-Reform classrooms. However, classes with all aspects of the Reform (including ITV) evidenced only slightly higher learning gains than did classes with all aspects of the Reform except ITV. Thus the role of ITV in improving achievement is inconclusive.  Students hold highly positive attitudes towards the use of ITV in their classrooms, although they were slightly less enthusiastic in 1971 than they had been in 1969. (JK)",

In conjugate reinforcement, the duration of the stimulus varies directly and immediately with the subject's rate of response. In this process, the subject must demonstrate his attention continuously by pressing a small key at a required rate to maintain the presentation of the stimulus. This paper provides a brief introduction to the techniques. It discusses the background of the reinforcement system, defines the concept, and describes a series of procedures in which it has been used.

Resources used included curriculum design and evaluation materials, reference  and other materials, and professional preparation. A list of 15 facilitating and 15 inhibiting influences was compiled. The former included: available, occurs frequently, efficient, see them often, and understandable. The latter included: confusing, costly, and inaccessible.

A review of some concepts related to statistical text compression is followed by a detailed description of a practical text compression algorithm. A simulation of the algorithm was programed and used to obtain compression ratios for a small sample of both traditional frame-structured CAI material and a new type of information-structured CAI material. The resulting compression ratios are to 1.5: 1 for both types of material. The simulation program was modified to apply the algorithm to the lesson files of a particular frame-structured CAI subsystem used in the Air Force Phase II Base Level System. The compression in this case was found to be 1.3: 1  because some uncompressible, frame-formating bytes were present in the lesson file. The modified simulation program was also used to take letter occurrence statistics on the text being compressed. From these, a theoretical compression was calculated using a probalistic model of the compression algorithm. Theoretical compression was within two percent of measured compression, thus verifying the model's applicability. (Author)",

Consumer behavior with its associated attitudes and purchasing behavior are discussed in regard to the choices of specific brands within major product categories. The relationship between advertising and the structure of markets is considered by presenting a review of the theories and evidence of the economic effects in this field. Finally, the variety of social issues that arise from concerns about advertising's impact on public values and attitudes are discussed with particular emphasis on the nature of persuasion, taste, and information versus deception. Of particular interest is a section on the effect of advertising on children. (MC)",

The report was prepared mostly from the transcripts of the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) hearings on Modern Advertising Practices. The basic structure of the industry as well as its role in marketing strategy is reviewed and some interesting insights are exposed. The report is primarily concerned with investigating the current state of the art, being prompted mainly by the increased consumer awareness of the nation and the FTC's own inability to set firm guidelines for effectively and consistently dealing with the industry. The report points out how advertising does its job, and how it employs sophisticated motivational research and communications methods to reach the wide  variety of audiences available. The case of self-regulation is presented with recommendations that the FTC be particularly harsh in applying evaluation criteria to children's advertising. The report was prepared by an outside consulting firm. (MC)",

First, advertisers must expect that network station audiences and average station audiences will become smaller, and thus it will become more and more difficult to achieve exposure with large segments of the population. Secondly, and most importantly, local stations and cable television networks will become more important than the current national television network. (Author/RH)",

The structural crisis in the university reflects the general social crisis in which society is pressured by opposing forces leading it toward either historical modernization or evolutionary acceleration. Historical modernization is the force that has been active, perpetuating social stratification and neocolonial dependency. Evolutionary acceleration is exemplified in North America, Japan, Germany, and socialist countries, where there is intentional movement toward the restructuring of society from its roots with the objective of organizing it to serve itself and not others. Acceleration leads people to leap from one historical era to  another, creating a new socio-economic formation with the capability of controlling its own destiny. (VM)",

The great formative factors, as seen by the Kibbutz, are communal living in the school in equal importance with courses of instruction. To encourage self reliance, for example, the student community is obligated to be self-governing in all but the areas of health, finance, and instruction. Competition in the form of tests and a grading system is basically absent from the learning process. The goal of the school is to instruct the learner in basic principles and to equip him with concepts and theories which make independent  study possible. Instruction in the arts and music, mathematics, and foreign languages, primarily English and Arabic, are also important elements in the curriculum. In the last several years the instruction centers on current problems with a special independent project for each student. (RS)",

        "description":"The designation of the Japanese word class \"joshi\" (in English known as particles, post-positional case markers, or relationals) by the term te-ni-wo-ha can be traced to the early superimposition of the Chinese writing system on Japanese speech. Because of the structural differences between the two languages and the existence of elements in Japanese not covered by the Chinese writing system, the Japanese developed a notational chart of dots to be added to the Chinese characters. Such a dot-code system was used to express relationships of the joshi and was designated te-ni-wo-ha by combining the names of the particles at the four corners of the chart. The term te-ni-wo-ha remains today even though the original dot-code system no longer exists and the Chinese characters used for  writing Japanese are phonological representations containing no graphic, inherently syntactic indication of meaning.

First-year students learning these languages, unless well-versed in linguistics or literature, probably do not need to receive such explanations for learning purposes.

Muscular coordination, as it relates to writing, is stressed in the workbook to give children the practice needed for cursive writing which is taught as an integral part of the reading program. The workbook contains 10 illustrated lessons. (Author/SK)",

In the classroom, the teacher dealing with varieties of language dialects and styles among his pupils must be aware that all children's languages are equally sacred to them, that dialects are expressions of \"in\" and \"out\" groups, that some dialects are more useful for the operation of individuals in their wider society, and that dialects and styles have assets and liabilities, elaborations and deficits. Co-lingualism  designates the attitude of the teacher who is aware of these points and who devises a teaching method and course to deal with them. Compensatory language programs should acknowledge the principle of the non-violation of linguistic emotions through understanding the social, cultural, and personal role of language as expressed in anthrolinguistics.

Present Australian English is closely akin to the blended, popular colloquial London English, spoken by the largest group of Australia's first settlers. This pronunciation differed greatly from the more restricted standard form which was growing in importance in England at the same time for social reasons. British English and Australian English now appear to be drawing closer together because in the former more and more &quot;low-class&quot; forms of colloquial eighteenth century speech are filtering through to respectability; such forms already exist in Australian pronunciation.

The rule of negative transportation allows the shifting of a negative, under certain conditions, from a lower clause into a higher one. The discussion centers around the occurrence of tag-questions which can be attached to a statement. Lakoff claims that, with certain exceptions, it is normal for the tag-question to show opposite polarity, as far as negation is concerned, to the sentence on which it is formed. The author refutes this explanation and argues that contrasting tag-questions indicate that the main sentence or host clause is to be taken to be the point of view of the speaker; matching tag-questions indicate  that it is not.

Such research has been plagued by misunderstanding and poor communication between linguists and the remaining informants. Much of the previous research, because of funding policies, has been conducted by trainee linguists. While work in phonology and morphology has been adequate, work in syntax has been scanty. Although syntactic research may improve in future studies, there is the danger of producing a grammar based on a model fashionable at the moment, rather than a grammar which presents basic data and which could later be adapted to a particular model. Research in the aboriginal languages is worthwile for the study of  language and culture in general and also for discoveries in dialect studies in language typology, classification, and development.

Such a view acknowledges the independence of speech and writing, the possibility of translation in either direction, the possible untranslatability and ambiguity of some elements, and correspondence with patterns observed in translation between languages. After a discussion of the translation theory, the author describes translation systems used in natural languages throughout the world. These include simultaneous but discrete translation of phonological features, context-based transcription, phonology-based transcription, syllable-based transcription, transcription based on a  fully syllabic script, transcription based on alphabetic syllabaries, and mixed transcription. Concluding remarks concern the work of linguists in devising transcription systems for various language problems. (VM)",

        "description":"This report describes the nature and scope of a national survey of language and area programs in the United States of America in 1968-69. An analysis of the various programs or a typology of programs was developed by taking each of the characteristics of the overall program--its area and language courses, and its faculty--and cross-tabulating them with factors such as the university setting, size and location of the program, a general qualitative ranking reflected in the annual competition for funds and fellowships, and measures of effectiveness in terms of written product, output of students in various disciplines, at various levels, and with various degrees of language competence. Language or area courses were also treated separately from their institutional setting. Grouped by  discipline, they were combined into a national sample to give a cross-sectional look at the nature of language and the area instruction available for various kinds of specialization. The area studies in the report are classified into seven categories: (1) Africa south of the Sahara, (2) East Asia, (3) Eastern Europe, (4) Latin America, (5) Near and Middle East, (6) South Asia, and (7) Southeast Asia. The report discusses the plan of the study and the collection of the data, the analysis of the data and distribution of the study, and future plans. The data on which the study is based are stored on magnetic tape at the University of Pennsylvania and at the Institute of International Studies at the Office of Education. (RL)",

According to the author, successful programs require adequate societal information; a clear understanding between school, home, and community; a satisfactory statement of basic program philosophy, rationale, goals, and objectives; a sound program design; provision for research; and a clear description and evaluation of the program at each stage for the benefit of other interested communities. Part 2 explores the field of early childhood, especially ages two to five, and finds implications for innovative bilingual-bicultural education. The paper points to evidence that in these early years children have a great though often untapped potential for  learning in such areas as language, culture, art, music, literature, numbers, nature study, and human relations. It concludes that the best way to achieve a significant new advance in bilingual-bicultural education is to take full advantage of the prodigious learning potential of children between birth and age five.

In August 1970, Title 1 ESEA funds were allocated to cover the cost of the program, and the children involved received other Title 1 services as well. All staff members, including 112 teachers, 33 aides, a social worker, and a guidance counselor, are fluent in both English and Spanish. An orientation course in Puerto Rican culture and history is offered at all Title 1 schools by a floating teacher/aide team.

All citizens have equal rights to education, and secondary and higher education are accessible to all citizens of the Soviet Union regardless of property, social status, nationality, sex, religion, or political convictions. Such democratization of education leads inevitably to certain problems, especially the problem of space and funds for quality education for all who might desire a higher education. Thus, careful planning is needed to anticipate the numbers of students who will wish to enroll in the higher education institutions of the Soviet Union. This document presents some guidelines and principles of educational planning as are used in Russia, and a  description of the types of institutions that are now in existence and their various functions both in terms of serving students and in terms of research.

Such features as enrollment on a part-time basis, flexible course hours, short term courses, counseling seminars for adults, financial aid for part-time study, more flexible residence requirements removal of age restrictions, liberal transfer of course credits, curriculum geared to adult experiences, credit by examination, refresher courses, reorientation courses, child care facilities,  relaxation of time requirements for degrees and job placement assistance for nontraditional professions particularly benefit women. Some of these features are incorporated into most colleges and universities, but they must be expanded as the needs of women become of equal importance to those of men in planning programs. Change is often a threatening, sometimes painful process, but if approached in a constructive manner, the modification caused by the women's movement will be advantageous to women, men and higher education.

Specifically, the study asks not only if communities possessing a college send larger proportions of their high school graduates to college than do communities lacking a local college, but also whether these proportions are differentially affected by different kinds of local postsecondary institutions. Since attention is focused on the variant behavior of different types of individuals as defined by sex, ability, and socio-economic background, college accessibility as defined here is not merely an ecological variable but is considered to be a distribution of educational opportunity over socio-economic  space.

The project was conceived out of the conviction that if in the future students are to enter practice immediately following receipt of the baccalaureate degree, the curriculum for such students should explicitly prepare them for practice in addition to providing a general education consistent with emerging patterns of liberal arts education. Since professional curricula should logically start with a clear description of the role performance expected of the practitioner, the first phase of the project consisted of an attempt to find answers to the questions (1) What can a baccalaureate worker do well in a social work  agency? and (2) What are the typical assignments given to baccalaureate workers?

These results indicate that planners must attend to individual differences much greater than those encountered in typical on-campus settings. (Author)",

The program, called the University Without Walls (UWW), is designed to provide mature students with new learning opportunities in higher education outside of the traditional educational mainstream. One of the proposed offerings at Roger Williams is an Urban Studies Program that will attempt to integrate classroom work with field experiences and research assistantships. The structure of the Urban Studies Program will differ from the main body in that the organizational focus will revolve around a small cluster of faculty and students who will design and develop the curriculum. The staff of the UWW believes  that the Urban Studies Program, built upon the student-facilitator cluster, will be a positive addition to the organization and philosophy of the open university.

Specifically, the study suggests that for those women with focused involvement and peripheral sex role orientation, the likely career pattern is continuation until Ph.D. completion and the most relevant variable set in decisions is academic experience. For those with divertible involvement and peripheral sex role orientation, the career pattern is likely to be early termination or termination upon MA or ABD achievement and the most relevant variable is achievement motivation. For those women students with divertible involvement and central sex role orientation, the career pattern is variable and the most relevant variable set  in decisions is female role considerations. In sum, the study uncovers the ways in which sets of determining variables act over time upon various types of women to produce a series of decisions which, in the aggregate, define the careers of graduate student women.

Necessarily, the opposite is true for men. The data do not provide an answer to why \"the higher, the fewer\" relationship holds so pervasively. However, they do indicate that in those departments that have Ph.D.'s on their faculties, the percentage of women with Ph.D.'s exceeds the percentage of men by almost 25%. Hence, although women are concentrated at the lower ranks, they may be more highly trained on the average than their male colleagues.  (Author/HS)",
