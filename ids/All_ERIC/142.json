        "description":"Stimulated by the ineffectiveness of the English department's teacher preparation program that remained remote from the actual classroom situation and was conducted by a single methods teacher who had not been in a public school teaching situation for at least ten years, the department chairman at the University of Utah attempted to make his group more aware of public school instruction and to involve more of them in the actual training program. In order to achieve his objectives, he initiated a fellowship program under which a competitively selected junior or senior high school teacher joined the department for a year to teach methods courses, work with prospective teachers, and continue his studies. Furthermore, he hired new faculty with interest in public schooling; created  relevant new training courses; and tried to interest more of his staff in teaching these courses. In order to have first-hand acquaintance with the public school classroom, he chose to teach poetry to successive levels of students in an inner city junior high school. Although his experience appeared inconclusive, he reflected on pacing, discipline, teacher and student response, teacher relationships, the need for variety, textbook insufficiencies, and successful teaching techniques.

A second phase of the program involved only verbal praise as a reinforcer. Behavior observations of two boys and one girl were recorded on the Spaulding Coping Scales. The two boys showed positive behavioral changes but the girl moved in the direction of more intensified negativism. Further application of this technique appears fruitful but should be preceded by careful consideration of the behavioral  dynamics of specific children. Problems of behavior management in classes for the disadvantaged might be helped by these reinforcement techniques. (NH)",

Moreover, neighborhood school attendance rules tend to perpetuate segregation.

The present study also sought to determine if the experimental boy's listening test (BoLT) is applicable to other ethnic and income level groups. The Bolt, a questionnaire, and two currently used standardized tests of aptitude and listening were administered to 182 low income Negroes, 132 middle income Negroes, 110 low income whites, and 192 middle income whites. Findings show that BoLT is not statistically unique as a measure of educational potential in the low income group. However, the two Negro groups preferred the test while the two white groups did not. Furthermore, there seemed to be  no support for the hypothesis that the effect of disadvantagement is associated more with the development of reading proficiency than with verbal proficiency in general. It is concluded that BoLT is an important addition to the area of testing verbal ability and listening comprehension among low income Negro boys. (NH)",

Three courses were developed to introduce and provide experience in utilizing industrial concepts, involve students in the flow of activities and events in industry, and provide for individual study and problem solving experience. The evaluation domains of ingredients, processes, and products were identified. Major findings related to student outcomes were: (1) 36-week courses produced more significant results than shorter courses, (2) Response patterns on attitude measures favored the American Industry students  when significant differences were obtained, (3) Attitudes toward industry and occupational behaviors were influenced most strongly, (4) The study of American Industry increased student perspectives of jobs available and their interest in seeking employment in one of them, and (5) 75 percent of the students in both the control and American Industry group were aware of the changing nature of jobs in industry.

Four demonstration programs, located in low-income housing projects in four U.S. cities, are designed to determine the feasibility of locating on-site rehabilitation agencies in low-income housing projects in order to render rehabilitation services to disabled residents. Following discussions of the four demonstration projects, the concept of dependency, and outlines of its dimensions, three conceptual models are presented for analyzing the influences that individual clients, their families, and their housing project neighborhoods may have upon the goal of rehabilitation. Complementing this approach to the rehabilitation process  is a discussion of the elements of the vocational rehabilitation system, the related social welfare agencies, and the larger community.

The review begins with a discussion of relevant psychoanalytic, learning, developmental, and sociocultural theories since behavioral manifestations of dependency differ and are related to factors in the particular milieu which precipitates them. Expressions of dependency are grouped in five categories: social, emotional, financial, institutional, and psychomedical. Methodological procedures for the study and measurement of dependency include self-report measures such as the Edwards Personal Preference Schedule, projective techniques such as the Thematic Apperception Test, and ratings through observation. The types of handicaps with  which dependency is associated are physical disability, emotional disorders, chronic illness, and social disability. It was observed that while expressions of dependency are related and similar, they must be dealt with by differing interventive techniques on the part of the rehabilitation personnel.

        "description":"A 3-year demonstration project focused on the vocational rehabilitation rehabilitation of selective service rejectees in a five-county area in Central South Carolina. In 1962, over 50 percent of South Carolina's young men who were examined for military service were rejected for failure to meet physical and/or mental requirements. Of 1,450 selective service rejectees, 347 received further evaluation by the project staff and 112 were accepted for vocational rehabilitation services. Clients with physical impairments were further examined to determine whether surgery and/or treatment might correct or substantially reduce the impairment. Clients who had no marketable skill and were trainable were provided vocational training in on-the-job situations. Final results indicate that 95  clients accepted for rehabilitation services were placed in competitive employment. Also, in more than half of the cases (52.7 percent) the cost of all services provided for rejectee-clients totaled $100 or less. The study tends to verify beliefs that for a small outlay of funds and through vocational rehabilitation efforts, military rejectees can become contributing members of a competitive society. (CH)",

The 109 adult trainees met the following selection criteria: (1) head of 2 family or household, (2) unemployed or underemployed, (3) a resident of the State of Alabama, and (4) evidence of 2 years of employment some time in the past. The trainees were also characterized by: (1) low literacy, less than an 8th grade education, (2) low income, an annual family income of less than $3,000 with high levels of unemployment and underemployment, and (3) cultural limitations, life styles, thought forms, and institutional participation patterns which have been narrowly  restricted. Counseling of trainees was devised as a feature of the research program and material presented in the report addresses the concerns of counselors who deal with comparable populations.

The three most widely used tests--auto mechanics, cosmetology, and machine shop--were selected for investigation and further revision. Several statistical approaches were employed to test reliability of the written tests. Some findings were: (1) The mean difficulty of items was within the range considered acceptable, (2) The mean point biserial was lower for all tests than generally recommended, (3) The variability of difficulty levels was extremely high. On performance tests, comparison between judges rating applicants on performance showed a high relationship and  intercorrelations among sub-scores were high. Qualified individuals were used to determine whether items reflect the important aspects of knowledge or skill the tests were designed to measure, and the relationship between examination scores and actual experience in the occupation was examined. Recommendations included: (1) pooling test data from all parts of the state, and (2) a plan for systematic review and updating. (JK)",

The sample consisted of 45 community college students enrolled in automotive courses. Initially, all students received a presentation on ignition principles, and the Otis Mental Ability Test was administered to establish a covariate. Individuals were then assigned to treatment groups in equipment oriented instruction, textbook oriented instruction, or programed instruction. Following the treatments each student completed an attitude inventory, knowledge test, and a troubleshooting performance test. Analysis of covariance solutions indicated no significant differences existed in troubleshooting knowledge or attitude toward  instruction. The equipment oriented treatment group required the shortest instructional time and its troubleshooting performance was significantly (.01 level) better than the other two groups. It was concluded that programed or text oriented methods were most effective for knowledge learning and equipment oriented methods were most effective for performance learning. Sample instructional materials and the instruments are appended. (EM)",

        "description":"A 3-year curriculum to be offered by a comprehensive high school to prepare graduates for a wide range of occupations growing out of the knowledge and skills of home economics was designed and implemented. The following curriculum was developed: (1) sophomore year--English, American history, biology, mathematics, orientation to the working world and introduction to clothing construction, typing, and physical education, (2) junior year--English, problems of democracy, recordkeeping and institutional housekeeping, food preparation and quantity foods, clothing workshops, and physical education, and (3) senior year--English, world cultures, health (elective), work experience in two areas, and physical education. Thirty-seven students participated in the program the first year, 81 the  second year, and 81 the third year, and changes resulting from evaluation were incorporated each year. It was concluded that boys and girls with varying levels of ability can be trained in occupations growing out of home economics knowledges and skills and that a 2- or 3-year curriculum can be implemented in the comprehensive high school.

The specific objectives were to determine: (1) the most important competencies, (2) the influence of geographic location and size of business upon needed competencies, (3) occupational information for students, and (4) the effect of geographic location and size of business upon length of work week and hourly wages. Analyses of variance and t-test were used in the analysis. The most important competencies were identified in areas of: (1) Identifying Ornamental Plants, (2) Work Relations, (3) Nursery Crop Production, (4) Controlling Plant Insects and Diseases, (5)  Merchandising Horticultural Plants and Supplies, (6) Plant Growing Media, and (7) Constructing, Maintaining, and Using Plant Growing Structures. Significant differences existed in the degrees of importance assigned to these seven competency areas among nursery men in the five areas of Texas studied. Persons choosing horticulture as an occupational field must be prepared to work long hours at low wages for a considerable period of time before they can hope to obtain managerial positions. (DM)",

On-the-job training was used as a demonstration of the practical use of academic, social, and vocational skills learned in the classroom. Classroom work was individualized to the work experience of the student in order to develop skills and attitudes necessary for a successul employment, good citizenship, and worthwhile use of leisure time. Work experience programs 1 to 2 hours of each school day were provided within the public school setting for students below the age of 16. Upon reaching the age of 16 students were placed in the community and worked from  3 to 4 hours per day. Findings indicate that the I.Q. score by itself was inadequate as an indicator of job capabilities. The performance area of the psychological examination proved to be more reliable in this respect than did the verbal area in the overall I.Q. score. During the 3-years of operation, job placement was accomplished for 12, 18, and 19 students respectively. Information on types of occupations and project dropouts is appended. (CH)",

Individuals nominated four or more times by their peers as sources of advice and information were identified in 11 areas of the vocational agriculture program and were considered to be opinion leaders. Twenty-one of the 51 opinion leaders identified were influential in more than one area of the vocational agriculture program; 72 percent of the opinion leaders selected other  opinion leaders as their source of advice and information; 35 percent of vocational agriculture teachers selected other teachers as the source from which they got advice and information. The personal and social characteristics of opinion leaders found to be significant indicated that they tended to be older, had taught longer, had attained a higher educational level, had a higher salary and held a greater number of educational offices than their fellow teachers.

It specifically concerned the implications of using rehabilitation aides, definitions of the roles and functions of rehabilitation aides, qualification requirements and selection procedures, development of a training program, and examination of implication that the role of rehabilitation aide may have for future development in quality of the service program and for career patterns. Data were collected by questionnaire from 58 state agencies of vocational rehabilitation. Findings of the study indicate a number of advantages in the use of rehabilitation aides. For the client, the counselor who is  relieved of routine activities can devote more time to problem solving. For the counselor, the opportunity to practice his unique skills will raise the level of professional functioning and increase efficiency. For the agency, the use of rehabilitation aides will allow them to serve clients in greater numbers and with greater ranges of problems. For the community, use of indigenous workers in greater numbers may increase agency-community understanding and rapport. (CH)",

Recent instructional trends are incorporated, and provision is made for the development of a particular school's philosophy of education regarding program objectives, teaching activities, and learning activities, as a preliminary step in the development of facility requirements. Two important factors which influence facility requirements are (1) modes of learning which include action, reaction and interaction learning, and (2) specialized versus multi-use space for which lecture/demonstration areas, seminar areas and laboratories must be considered.

More than 50 administrative and technical personnel within the Federal library community were interviewed, and information was compiled on 28 libraries and information centers among eight of the Executive Departments and four Independent Agencies. Pictures of both the technical and administrative sides of library operation were built up. These pictures were used to form a composite overview of technological movements within the Federal Government toward library automation, and the forces acting as constraints on  such movements. Few strongly cohesive trends in automation were found among the library and information activities of specific agencies. But, in spite of this, it appeared that generic automated systems with broad parametric application to both technical and administrative considerations could be devised. Appended to the report are (1) supplemental materials on methodology and (2) data summaries, backing up the discussions on data reduction and analysis. Some fourteen Case Reports prepared during the study are published as separate volumes. (JH)",

        "description":"A comprehensive program for elementary and secondary health education is presented. The program is structured to promote affective as well as cognitive learning and centers on (1) understanding the human body and learning how to care for it, (2) understanding what it means to be man or woman, and (3) understanding the forces in the physical and social environment that influence behavior. Thus, sex education and mental hygiene are included as &quot;normal&quot; parts of the health program. The term &quot;health and sex education&quot; is used in reference to the program only to emphasize that sex education is not excluded or minimized. There are three basic parts to the program, corresponding roughly to the three educational stages: primary, intermediate, and secondary. Part I is for kindergarten and  grades 1 through 4 and is designed to be taught by the self-contained classroom teacher who may use each lesson in connection with appropriate classroom activities. Teaching the program should require no extra time and no changes in scheduling or staff assignments. Part II for grades 5 through 8 follows the departmentalized approach and is designed to be integrated with existing programs in language arts, physical education, science, and social studies. (The distribution of lessons among these four subjects is presented.) The high school program (Part III) is presented as an independent course of study to be taught by specialized health educators. It is written in textbook, rather than teaching manual format, allowing the teacher to decide on methodology and form of presentation. Certain  recommendations are included in the preface of the document to enable teachers to use the program effectively. (JH)",

Work during this period was concerned with the planning of the Laboratory and its development according to plan. The planning resulted in definition of initial topics within librarianship to be supported by the Laboratory in relation to the educational needs of the field. This, in turn, led to the development of computer programs for on-line interrogation and search and data files upon which to \"exercise\" these techniques, as well as other Laboratory elements. The Phase I work included assembling and checking out these initial pieces of the Laboratory; however, no true  operational activities were undertaken in the sense of students using the Laboratory on a regular basis. The Laboratory was designed to include capabilities relating both to intellectual access (e.g., associate searching, automatic indexing, automatic abstracting) and to more traditional course content (e.g., subject cataloging). Future directions and plans for the Laboratory were included in the Phase I report. (JH)",

This report documents the continuing progress of the project in substantial technical detail, reflecting both accomplishments and problems. An initial objective of BALLOTS was to create an operational acquisition system compatible with Library of Congress Machine-Readable Cataloging (MARC) records. Specifications are included in the report for converting MARC records into a special input format for BALLOTS and for the creation of a local on-line MARC file. Other activities are  in process for the utilization of MARC. Supportive functions of the prototype acquisition system are searching, ordering, receiving, and accounting, and, for the most part, access to its files are with on-line terminals. Limited on-line search service is currently available at Stanford. (Successful remote on-line demonstrations have been conducted at several institutions.) A reference manual for communicating with the Stanford retrieval system is included in the report. Access is provided through the Stanford Terminal Processor (MILTEN) using an IBM 2741 Terminal (other terminals to be considered later) to communicate with an IBM 360/67 Computer located in the Stanford Computation Center. This facility plans to obtain 500,000 bytes of additional high speed (750 nano-second) core to  support full-scale system functioning during all hours of normal computer center operation.

Data were collected via questionnaires, standardized tests, and interview schedules from a 1/3 random sample of students (305 persisters and 116 dropouts) and 77 teachers and teacher aides. Student gains in grade level scores were significant; nearly 3/4 stayed in the program; they were satisfied with the program; and staff were generally satisfied with student progress. Factors which seemed to favor achievement were being middle aged, having  had no prior school experience, and being of rural residence. Dropouts were likely to be young, with no family responsibilities, and not too committed to a particular line of work. Staff characteristics differences between &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; achieving centers were slight but it seemed that a disproportionate share of &quot;high&quot; center teachers expressed concern for the problem of individualization.

        "description":"An evaluation study of the Family Service Program of the Essex County (New York) Division of Home Economics is focused on the third series of lessons; the purposes of the study were to describe the socioeconomic characteristics of the indigenous program aides and the participants and to show the influence of training for teaching this series of lessons. It was found that aides had higher income, participation scores, and educational levels than participants, but both groups were low in comparison to the country's total population in level of husband's occupation, net family income, and years of school completed. Both aides and participants made significant gains from the pre- to posttest while aides showed slightly higher scores in both testing situations. Participants listed  problems of cooking and planning meals, housekeeping, and money management, while aides identified participant problems of care and discipline of children, and health. Among implications are that indigenous women make effective teachers of home economics; both participants in study groups and those taught alone make significant progress; and closer supervision of teaching and attendance would improve the program.

Lecturers addressed themselves to the PTA story, leadership and communications, processes helping and hindering communications, communication across generations and cultures, communication and attitude change, and the problems created by the evergrowing population in California of Mexican Americans, many of them migrants. Service committees reported on mechanical aspects of running the workshop. Study groups gave reports of their discussions of leadership and  communication between parents and preschool and school age children, problems and needs in parent education, use of community resources, effective communication in the PTA unit and the community, and family life education. Appended is the full text of a speech by Eugene Gonzales on understanding the Mexican American--problems of the bilingual child, myths that should be exploded, the 60-80,000 migrant children in California, and education as the means to break out of the barrios.

The Public Evaluation Committee conducted thorough investigations and submitted a preliminary report to the Secretary of Commerce. Forty-six states received matching grants for annual programs to provide such technical services as field counseling, reference and referral services, and educational programs; 20 Special Merit Programs, of regional or national significance, were funded.

A series of television programs was combined with 160 small study discussion groups. University Extension recruited and briefed discussion leaders; and, in conclusion, held a day long conference, attended by 150 persons--1/3 interested citizens and 2/3 public officials and professional persons. A total of 2500 participants in the program was recorded; only 12% returned the questionnaire, likely because of lack of followup. Lack of time for personal contact, recruitment, and followup was felt  to cause many of the weaknesses of the program. Television reporting was difficult because of the lack of a central information source and of the narrow specializations of many resource people; its major value lay in the presentation of opinions of experts and visual examples of planning concepts. Advertising provided by the Sacramento \"Bee\" newspaper was very effective. (eb)",

They were found to be in sociological and economic patterns similar to those of their parents; both groups were school dropouts from rural areas and both were undereducated, economically depressed persons with large families. The great majority had a minimum of 20 to 30 potentially productive years before retirement age. Presently they were employed in public assistance type programs; most had been either unwilling or unable to relocate in other areas. They were participating in the program to get a job or a better job, to obtain a high school equivalency diploma, or to learn to read and write better. Most had no  problems in attendance, such as lack of time or transportation, or domestic problems; and most were pleased with course. It was recommended that more centers and programs be established, more persons recruited, guest speakers and resource persons be used, transportation be provided when necessary, night high schools or summer high schools be initiated, vocational training programs also be provided, and counselors, social workers, and placement personnel be added.

Visual acuity and hearing decline during adult years and there is a general slowing down process of most bodily activities. Teachers should be aware of the need for good illumination, adequate seating arrangements, maintenance of comfortable physical surroundings, and a slower pace for the adult student. Reports show that although the power to learn is retained in maturing adults, there is a slowing up in the rate at which one can learn. Retention and recall, then, may decline with years, although interest and motivations may be heightened. Teachers of adults should attempt to adjust lessons to the learners'  pace capacity; include summaries often; relate activities to the varied life experiences of the students; and be aware of the adult students' length of attention span.

Many states cooperated with the State Office of Civil Defense in community shelter planning and in the home fallout protection survey; in many states the RCD leader developed and conducted training programs for county defense boards. An increasing number of extension subject matter specialists incorporated segments of RCD into their programs, as in the 4-H TV Action Club series and the Home Economics Lesson series. Special  activities included an Emergency Preparedness Week, Atomic Easter Egg Hunt, and Builders Short Course. Also used were news releases, radio and TV broadcasts, newsletters, motion pictures, and meetings. Special emphasis was given to engineering aspects of civil defense as it pertains to rural areas.

Papers were presented on: information needs of an urbanizing post-industrial society; minimum necessary elements to enable the university to meet the challenge; overcoming the constraints of the present university system; the role of the universities; strategies for involving the public; and strategic choices confronting the university. After seminar \"second thoughts\" included a discussion of the role of the university as a resource not as an activist; of the turbulence of society caused by group politics, the failure of political control, and the malfunctioning of public opinion; of the need for colleges of agriculture to add a major human resource emphasis and become in effect  Colleges of Rural-Urban Environments; and of the concept of the community as the client, which may provide for extension a base for a new blend of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research, teaching, and off-campus work. This can make the modern university and its public services more relevant to the problems of contemporary society. (se)",

The sample comprised New York State 4-H Division Leaders in 55 countries. Of the 55 leaders polled, 46 returned usable questionnaires. Based on a review of literature on delegation, 20 administrative factors were selected to elicit 4-H Division Leaders' propensity toward delegating responsibility. In addition, 18 tasks of leader identification and selection tasks that incorporated planning, executing, and  evaluating on a county-wide and local or area basis, were developed. Data revealed that (1) leaders were the most highly involved of all positional groups in tasks of leader identification and selection, and (2) the respondents perceived themselves and 4-H agents to be more highly involved than subprofessionals and voluntary leaders in these tasks. Findings indicated that 12 of the factors used in the study appeared to be significantly associated with the dependent variable, 4-H Division Leaders' propensity to delegate. (author/nl)",

An openended questionnaire was administered in a one hour interview. Cluster analysis was used to cross check reliability and coding validity. Results are reported in tabular form. It was found that less interest in attending continuing education program was shown in  Northern California, less positive support existed in Northern California because of greater consciousness of budgeting and difficulties associated with staff absences; Northern executives were more likely to screen notices of training programs and nominate specific people to attend; and more concern was expressed in the North for agency and program needs, while the South was concerned with personnel development.

Characteristics, experiences, and attitudes of engineers who had transferred from defense to commercial work in recent years were stressed. These were among the major findings; (1) no important barriers to transfer were detected relating to age, marital status, or family status; (2) engineers saw managers' attitudes, greater commercial cost consciousness, and differing specialty and manpower requirements as possible barriers to transfer; (3) motivational  and attitudinal factors tend to support rather than oppose transfer to commercial industry; (4) on the job training and other inhouse programs were favored as means of retaining; (5) managers were more optimistic about transferability of skills and attitudes than about availability of openings; (6) defense engineers entering commercial industry would probably be best suited to research and development, new design, advanced engineering, and analytical areas.

For the linguist interested in child language development, the paper repeats earlier suggestions (Ferguson 1964) that the notion of simplicity may be a useful one in accounting for the development of grammar in the child, repeats the point that baby talk is largely initiated by adults on the basis of existing patterns, and suggests further that the telegraphic style used by young children may in part be based on the fact that adults in their attempt to simplify their speech (i.e. use baby talk) tend  to omit items such as the copula, prepositions, articles, and inflectional endings. For the linguist interested in pidgins and creoles, the most important suggestion of the paper is probably the view that the foreigner talk of a speech community may serve as an incipient pidgin. This view asserts that the initial source of the grammatical structure of a pidgin is the more or less systematic simplification of the lexical source language which occurs in the foreigner talk register of its speakers rather than the grammatical structure of the language(s) of the other users of the pidgin.

        "description":"Teaching writing is the frustrating part of teaching English as a second language, yet a secondary-school level student who is literate in his own language can be guided into writing a simple paragraph in English soon after he can read one. Guided writing limits the variety of errors a student can make, gives repeated practice in using a selected sentence pattern correctly, prepares a student to write freely with a manageable number of errors, and allows him to write confidently with no fear of unpleasant surprises. Transformation, insertion, completion, and change-in-point-of-view oral exercises can easily be adapted to guided writing. Copying, generally recommended as the first step in writing English, may be skipped if the student can already write in the Roman alphabet.  Dictation, the next step, may begin with the teacher reading a very short sentence which the students repeat aloud and then write. (The teacher then rereads it.) This is followed by \"standard paragraph dictation,\" which the student hears four times. A writing teacher should (1) work on one structure at a time, (2) substitute oral practice for grammatical explanations, (3) assign one or more guided exercises which practice the structure, (4) assign a topic which makes the use of the structure likely, and (5) provide the topic sentence until the student can do so on his own.

An adequate knowledge of these areas is essential to good classroom practices; every bad practice is evidence of some weakness in understanding these areas. That linguists seem currently more concerned with formulating questions than with proposing answers indicates the likelihood of major new advance, rather than decay and dissolution. Regardless of the state of linguistics, however, there are still certain things students have to learn if they are to speak the second language. Classroom practices should follow some kind of \"middle road\" in which the natural  contexts of language are used to prompt language use, with an awareness of the language structures to be mastered. A teacher cannot rely on any one single, narrow, pedagogical approach, but must respond to the different learning patterns of different students, and their different motives and inclinations. This involves the use of examples, variety, and context-oriented work. The student's gradual development as a person who controls a second language is more important than his apparent mastery of certain patterns. A discussion of the differences between approach, method, and technique concludes the paper. (AMM)",

The Pattern Drills Program aims to develop bidialectism in non-standard English speakers by teaching standard English as a foreign language. The Drills reinforce and provide for &quot;eventual automatic control of the standard pattern&quot; by substitution practice. The contemporary psychophysics approach, described by Galanter in 1962 in terms of &quot;detection,&quot;&quot;recognition,&quot;&quot;discrimination,&quot; and &quot;scaling,&quot; can be used in testing for language development or for teaching language development. One reason for failure in teaching &quot;correct standard English&quot; is  inappropriate measures. If a child cannot speak standard English at the appropriate time, we need to know whether it is because he cannot hear the difference, cannot mimic the difference, does not know the difference between different situations, or whether, although he has acquired all these &quot;components,&quot; he just cannot combine them. Knowledge of this information would definitely have an effect on how we teach. (AMM)",

Twenty subjects (tenth-grade students, well above average academically, from an English high school in Montreal) were used in each of the six learning conditions. The most effective condition was a concurrent procedure which presented contrasting items in sequences of glosses in such a way that the subjects were alerted to the cue which differentiated the vocabularies.

The novel speech sounds used were two voiceless fricatives which are consonant phonemes in Arabic but which are completely foreign to monolingual English-speaking Americans. The sounds were presented in the context of one- and two- syllable Arabic words (target words). There were four target words, and each word was associated with a small plastic form of a common object. This approach simulated some elements of actual language learning. The objects were used to elicit identification responses from the subjects. This paper reports results for two male  subjects who participated in seven half-hour training sessions given within a period of twelve days. One subject was five years old; the other was 21. Reproduction responses were judged by two adult listeners who are native speakers of Lebanese Arabic. Spectral analyses and amplitude-frequency cross-sections of the fricative portion were also made. Results do not provide any evidence that children are better than adults in acquiring novel speech sounds. (DO)",

A modified version of the Visible Speech Translator developed by Bell Telephone Laboratories was used in the study. The subjects participating consisted of ten young adult males and ten children, males and females, between the ages of four and five years old.

All subjects showed evidence of learning in the context of the experiment.

The analysis is based on the colloquial, spontaneous speech of educated natives of Rio de Janeiro and is divided into four chapters: Phonology (pp. 6-29), Morphophonemics (pp. 30-49), Morphology (pp. 50-86), and Verbal Categories (pp. 87-132). The first two chapters provide the background for the chapter on morphology, the nucleus of the paper. In her phonological description the author eliminates two phonomes (&quot;-lh&quot; and &quot;-nh&quot;) which occur in earlier analyses (M. Lemle and Mattoso Camera) and presents a new interpretation of certain other features. The chapter on morphophonemics establishes morphophonemes reflecting phonological conditioning of  several alternative verb forms, thus simplifying the morphological description. The final chapters describe in detail the verb flexional system and present a classification of verbs according to their grade of irregularity. Verbal categories of mood, time, aspect, person, and number are expressed as a function of the system of categorical oppositions. Since a morpheme may represent more than one category, cases of neutralization are frequent in which one or the other category is null. Cumulative morphemes are postulated when necessary. (JD)",

These are the only public bilingual schools in the country serving the Indian population, a majority of whom do not speak Spanish as their first language. Although public education is now available to some 80 percent of all children, the school completion rates in rural, monolingual-Spanish schools are less than ten percent. In the Summer Institute of Linguistics schools, the teacher is always bilingual and of the same tribe or region. Typically, the student first learns to read in his native language while studying Spanish orally. After learning to read Spanish as well, the student transfers to the second grade of a monolingual-Spanish school. Evaluation of the  efficiency of bilingual schools depends on the criteria used (religious, political, social) and the evaluators (missionaries, government officials, teachers). Objective evaluation is also hampered by the lack of local or national statistics. Preliminary findings based on the achievement of children from bilingual schools transferring to monolingual schools indicates that they have a higher rate of achievement. The author concludes that foreign language learning and second language learning may be much more dissimilar psychological experiences than we have previously supposed them to be. Further interdisciplinary research and cooperation is essential. (JD)",

Three counselor-subjects were assigned to a contingent reinforcement treatment, and three to a noncontingent reinforcement treatment. An A-B-A \"own control\" design was employed with some modification. In the operant level phase, each counselor subject conducted a 45 minute interview without reinforcement or instructions. A two-part acquistion phase was used: (1) vicarious reinforcement in which the experimenter, sitting with the counselor  subject, signalled to a counselor confederate when he emitted approved responses and later asked the subjects to emulate the confederate's behavior, and (2) three direct reinforcement interviews in which approved counselor subject behaviors were reinforced. Contingent, noncontingent, and vicarious reinforcement affected changes in total response frequency and in frequency rate of target cells when accompanied by attempts to maximize expectancy effects and experimenter effects.

The practices having the greatest value for these teachers include: (1) using cumulative record information, (2) identifying exceptional children, (3) helping children explore the world of work, (4) helping children with learning and adjustment problems, (5) helping to develop special interests and aptitudes, (6) taking care of physical deficiencies, and (7) helping pupils examine their attitudes and feelings toward themselves.

The urban scene is made up of a number of groups, or subcultures, which have parallel structures along socio-economic, and nationality-color-ethnic lines. These groups act as if they had a structured plan. It is shown how this plan is formulated, maintained, and passed on. An analysis of the Negroes as a group emphasizes their lack of deep feelings as being members of a Black group. They had defined an essential part of their beings in terms of what they are not. Militancy results because Black is not merely being non-white and such a position splinters the possibility of in group feelings.

The scale was given to two groups of children, 249 fifth and sixth grade students in an inner-city school serving mostly lower class Negro students, and 211 fifth and sixth grade students in a large urban university laboratory school. Significant statistical differences were found by school (representing social class), sex, and grade. Because the social class difference was considered socially significant, findings  were discussed in terms of differences in content of anxiety, and speculations were made about the practical implications of the normative basis for determining maladjustment.

For the game to have value in developing vocational awareness, the decision-making exercise should be structured around a model of real life vocational decisions. The gaming experience aims toward helping the player clarify his own values pertient to the real world of work and to conceptualize kinds of decisions to be made. The elements of the game are players, goals, rules, and choices. The relationship between the elements and the sequencing of decisions are depicted by the model. The extent of the model (basic structure) depends on how much realism should be built in. Gaming by itself does not yield a maximum benefit but should be part of a  total program which includes readings, lectures, the games, and critiques. (Author/KP)",

Results showed that Negro freshmen differ from white freshmen in several educationally relevant ways; in socioeconomic background, career orientations, perceived purposes of college, educational plans, attitudes, and in level of performance on standard admissions variables. It was also found that despite such differences, forecasts of freshmen year academic performance are likely to be at least as  accurate for black students as for their classmates. Further research is necessary to examine Negro academic performance beyond the freshman level.

Complementary relationships of the mother and father within the family: i.e., the bringing together of both the mothering attitude and the expectation of \"growing up\", contribute to the individual's maturation.

They see the patient as being triangularly related and recognize that the therapeutic relationship affects and is affected by the homeostatic family relationships. This had led to the following trends in analytic psychotherapy: (1) successful use of a \"therapeutic couple\" (male and female  co-therapists) within a group to treat unhappy married couples, (2) increased application of interpersonal interactions and group processes in analytic group therapy, (3) use of analytic psychotherapy of the family as a whole, and (4) use of group, milieu, family, and community dynamics in treatment of mental hospital patients.

This study involves 138 college students in an experimental group who have taken student-initiated courses through the Committee for Participant Education (CPE) and 159 Control group student enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley. The data suggests four orientations in which the groups are differentiated: (1) CPE students are less concerned with vocational and professional training, (2) they are more concerned with affecting social change, (3) they are more aesthetically oriented, and (4) they are more  concerned with interpersonal relationships. The two groups differ regarding their perceptions of what the function of the University is and should be. The CPE group tends toward changing the environment, rather than their own orientation. Further research should try to discover whether students learn more when actively involved in curricular change. (AE)",

If the goal of counseling is the discovering and internalizing of problem-solving processes, is it possible to create \".....a machine environment such than an individual within this environment can be said to have been counseled?\" The authors respond with an example of such an environment--the Information System for Vocational Decisions Project (ISVD). ISVD is a working model of a computer-based information system that could become part of the vocational and educational guidance efforts of schools, employment agencies and industry. The goal is to present career data which the individual must transform  into usable information. By so doing, he develops decision making abilities important to career choice. The authors admit that although the ISVD is not an ideal response to the original question, it offers a fresh look at counseling goals and how machines, with identical goals, can enter the counseling process.

The difference in reading and artistic experience backgrounds was insignificant. The small sizes of the observed differences suggest that in terms of pre-college experiences students receiving financial aid and those not receiving aid have  similar backgrounds.

The first program was an educational experiment which sought to make freshman psychology courses more meaningful, as well as to increase student participation in the college environment. These aims were accomplished by involving volunteer freshmen participants in peer orientation and T-groups with upper class and graduate psychology students, and by organizing a core curriculum revolving around the psychology course. The second program, involving minority groups, grew out of student violence in 1967. The counseling center undertook to bring minority problems out into the open,  and to encourage small group confrontations where participants of all races might explore their racial feelings. Counselor involvement has been heavy in the cause of the minority students, perhaps to the detriment of more scholarly activities, and it is too soon to establish the boundaries of ultimate counselor concern. However, it is felt that in these stressful times, there is more danger in inertia than in experimentation. (CJ)",

The reaction of others is frequently to the implied stereotype, rather than to young human beings. The life styles of youth involve questioning the Establishment and its goals, seeking to define the good life and working to create a better America. In doing so, many adopt life styles which differ from that accepted by the ordinary American middle class. Adult society calls attention to the drug scene, particularly in the legal sense, while continuing to overlook adult usage of other drugs having comparable effects. Sexual mores of young people are decried while older generations practice illegal sexual behavior. The radicalism ascribed to youth is actually a characteristic of a  small percentage, the mood of most being apathetic. The institutions of society will have to become responsive to the individuality of young people and to allow the influence of youth to be a real force. Youth needs encouragement in seeking a sense of identity. They need to be met honestly in their search for answers to life-meaning for themselves and society. (AE)",

The reinforcers which influence the child must be discovered by observation. A positive reinforcement schedule is then employed, rewarding the desired behavior in various ways. Shaping may be used, in which partial or approximate behaviors are rewarded until the actual desired behavior occurs. Decreasing undesirable behavior occurs when an incompatible desirable behavior is shaped by: (1) securing the desired response, (2) shaping small  segments of the desired behavior, (3) using a high reinforcement ratio, and (4) gradually decreasing the reinforcement.

Evolvement of an orientation philosophy is discussed, together with the pressures acting against successful programs in the area of intellectual orientation.

Specific hypotheses tested were: (1) the level of cognitive functioning of Negro students differs significantly from that of white students in similar socioeconomic conditions, (2) white students score significantly higher than Negroes on measures of creativity, (3) creativity scores provide an understanding of students in addition to that proved by the traditional tests of intelligence, and (4) sex differences exist in both cognitive and creative ability. A one-way analysis of variance was  used to obtain differences in creativity and cognitive ability for sex and race. The first hypothesis was supported. The second indicated that whereas white students were better able to verbalize than Negroes, the latter scored higher on figural elaboration. Sex differences were insignificant. Implications are inconclusive, but suggest that a deeper understanding of creativity coupled with improved educational practices to enhance creative expression might provide more meaningful educational experiences to the disadvantaged child.

        "description":"Current freshman orientation practices among U.S. colleges and universities are described and comments upon the degree of concurrence between these practices and an evolving philosophy of freshman orientation are made. Letters requesting copies of orientation programs were sent to a random sample of 160 colleges and universities, divided equally among eight specific categories. Responses were received from 135, of which 110 were usable. These 110 programs were analyzed: (1) to determine the procedures employed to orient new students to those institutions, and (2) in terms of the number of activities in each program classified as \"informational,\"\"social,\"\"intellectual,\" and \"mechanical.\" Comparisons were made among the categories of institutions to determine the significance of  observed differences in frequencies of the various categories of activities scheduled on the orientation programs. More than 82% of activities (other than registration and testing) are either informational or social, while intellectual activities account for about 18% of the total number of activities. A summary list indicates differences between categories of institutions in the proportionate emphasis upon information, social, or intellectual activities in orientation. (Author/CJ)",

Matching was done on the basis of grade, sex, and intelligence for EH and SA; of grade and sex for the siblings. No significant differences were found between the experimental and control group in distribution of older and younger siblings, ordinal position in the family, socio-economic status, or fathers' occupations. Parental interviews, reading tests and academic histories of parents; psychological, educational, medical, and neurological  evaluations of the children, and behavior ratings of the children were used. Examiners were unaware of the classification of the child as EH or SA. Preliminary findings include: (1) significant differences in favor of EH on the Performance Scale of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, (2) impaired ability of EH and EH sibs in numerical computation, sequencing, and fine-perceptual-motor-hand-eye coordination and memory, and (3) lower achievement of EH in reading and spelling. Neurological impairment was significant in several areas for EH, and some medical-history facts were distinguishing. (AE)",

It is first assumed that the competetive nature of the American educational system must produce some failures, and that these failures adversely affect the self-concept of some persons, and in turn limit those persons' adult creativity. Human Potential Seminars were initiated in 1967, composed of 10 to 15 persons, with goals of: (1) self-affirmation, (2) self-determination, (3) self-motivation, and (4) creation of emphathetic persons. Persons who have attained the above goals are said to have a positive self-concept; the attainment of the latter is assumed as a legitimate educational goal. Phases in the Seminar include unfolding experiences and learning to listen to others, acknowledging achievements and  satisfaction experiences, immediate goal-setting, strength acknowledging, identifying personal values, discovering areas of potential, and establishing long-range goals. Results of a questionnaire indicate that the Seminar experience continues to be an effective force for those who were involved after a year's interval. New efforts are being made to spread positive, humanizing methods throughout the college. (AE)",

The conviction is held that something is right with the participants; motivation focuses on individual discovery and group reinforcement of strengths, capabilities, and success factors of each individual. Three techniques used are: (1) strength bombardment, in which the individual reveals his concept of his own strengths, the group indicates further strengths seen in the person, and there is discussion regarding causes that are preventing usage of these strengths; (2) success bombardment, in which successful and unsuccessful experiences are analyzed  by the group for each participant; and (3) goal-setting activities, using student values, the goals set being achievable and believable. Behavioral objectives are increases in: (1) self-motivation, (2) self-determination, and (3) affirmation of self-worth. The Seminars are considered educational, not therapeutic; participation is voluntary, and grouping is heterogeneous. Results are encouraging, though difficult to measure. (AE)",

The main goal is to assist the individual in building a positive concept of self and therefore respect for self. Methods of student recruitment are discussed, those students admitted demonstrate some indication of college potential but are judged unable to attempt college without this program. The summer program, including the \"bridge\" summer between high school and college is explained, with a list of  specific activities included. The follow-up during the freshman year in college is discussed, with an explanation of study centers and their function. Evaluation of the program shows that the vast majority go on to college from Upward Bound for the first year, and 76% return for a sophomore year. Hopefully secondary schools and colleges will begin to implement some aspects of this program to benefit all students. A list of recommendations concludes this report. (CJ)",

Practical suggestions are included with each role discussion. The second part of this paper presents a new approach to dealing with drug abuse. A written contract, signed by student and parents would set up a \"Plan for Therapy\" for both student and  parent. Specific methods for carrying out the contract are included, as well as alternatives if the contract is broken. This plan has the salutory effect of combining joint responsibility of parents, community, school, and student in a positive approach with more realistic therapeutic results than present plans.

Philosophically, he argues, there is no deep support for bias against the machine, since, in any guidance situation, exact measurement must be taken by whatever means available. Computers can respond if there is insistence upon behavioral data rather than data concerning internal states, and operational definitions instead of idealistic ones. Empirically, the computer has proven itself valuable in many statistical demonstrations done by groups working independently of one another. The central  linguistic problem appears to be in the area of transformational grammar or the relating of one statement to some transformed equivalent. Much work is currently being done in the area of approaches to meanings in the field of computational linguistics. Since counselors serve as information processors, and are presumably operating under \"as-yet dimly-understood rules,\" the author feels that they can begin to make some practical use of the computer in language analysis.

Demographic information on the campers and aptitude test data were obtained from the University. Questionnaires were completed by campers in such areas as educational goals and attitudes. Personality inventories were available for some of the campers. Hanson's (1968) program for coding the Minnesota Counseling Inventory was used in some analyses, and chi square was used to test the significance of differences. Two norm groups  were selected from the 1968 Liberal Arts freshman class. Tables represent the variety of ways in which freshmen campers differ from the freshman class as a whole. Results of this study indicate that services designed to orient new students cannot be based on generalizations about characteristics of entering freshmen.

The 32 members of the Institute, practicing counselors in the public schools in the upper-midwest, were divided into four groups so that each group contained the same proportion of elementary and secondary counselors. Each group met four times a week for two hours under experienced group work leaders. Two weekly sessions were video taped, leaving two sessions for group review of the previous day's recording. Each group member filled out an opinionnaire after the review sessions. All groups were deprived of the use of  the tape equipment for a period of two weeks and the effects of this deprivation were studied via a second opinionnaire. Generally, the groups took a positive view of their counseling sessions and were not much bothered by the presence of the video equipment. The counseling sessions seemingly increased in effectiveness as the eight weeks passed, with progressively deeper involvement of the group members emerging with time.

The learning-teaching modes of team teaching utilize large group, small group, and individual instruction. Most existing school buildings can be adapted to this variability of instruction, but new structures should be designed for maximum flexibility of room size to cope with changing demands and situations. The typical team organization contains a team  leader, senior teachers, and regular teachers. The leader assumes major responsibility, with senior teachers being responsible for curriculum content.

Aspects of open-end education discussed briefly include a definition of the term (it incorporates nongrading, team teaching, and flexible scheduling), problems with graded schools, use of teacher aides, curriculum patterns, and class and teacher arrangements. A comprehensive proposal for elementary school organization recommends self-contained classes for pupils from kindergarten through the second year level, all-subject-areas teaching teams for pupils in third and fourth year levels, and related-subject-areas teaching teams for  pupils in the fifth through eighth year levels. Separate-subject-areas teaching teams are recommended for pupils at the senior high level. A bibliography of 22 items published between 1961 and 1967 is appended.

In such organizations, authority is justified on a \"rational-legal\" basis, and the general pattern of control is through bureaucratic rules. As bearers of authority, rules structure relationships and channel action into conformity with the organizational goals. In addition, rules serve as a means of communication. The directional and boundary functions of rules may become dysfunctional if they are interpreted as minimum standards of performance. Also, rules may cause a means-ends inversion for the organization, leading to unsatisfactory relationships and inflexibility. The  means of control are inextricably associated with the structure of the organization. Improvements in organizational effectiveness and need-fulfillment of its members depend upon alterations in the structure of the organization that will facilitate change in the means of control.

Proliferation of bureaucratic rules is directly related to the size of the school, but inversely related to socioeconomic status of the students. Also, as the proportion of female teachers in a department rises, the number of rules increases, even though more female teachers have tenure than males, and females have more teaching experience than males. Proliferation of rules is greatest in schools having a disparity between the socioeconomic status of the teachers and that of the students; rules are used in these schools to protect the organization from outside influences as well as to provide security for teachers and administrators. Bureaucratic rules are only one of several methods of control  available to an organization. The history of the organization, the nature of the profession, the expectations of professionals, and their training may all play a part. It is strongly suggested that the use and acceptance of rules to control and coordinate actions may be peculiar to certain professions. (Author/DE)",

Special attention needs to be given to the development of curriculums for the culturally disadvantaged, to  the discovery of ways to motivate learning, to determining ways to develop talents and interests largely neglected (e.g., artistic), and to improve articulation between the educational choices of high school students and their later lives.

The writings of Franklin Bobbitt, appearing in the 1920's, were particularly significant in establishing curriculum-making as a distinct field of study. Early curriculum specialists were inclined toward a simplistic mode of thought, regarding complex problems as solvable by such easy means as observing, measuring, or consensus. Curriculum criteria included the social utility of the courses offered, as well as two distinct dichotomies, one distinguishing school subjects as academic or practical and one distinguishing  school populations as college preparatory or noncollege preparatory. A critical reexamination of the curriculum field's literary and practical inheritance is crucial if it is to become an increasingly meaningful field of study in its second half-century. (JK)",

Respondents rated the importance of 82 concepts contained in the questionnaire and specified which of four descriptions best indicated the meaning of each concept. When translated into value orientation types suggested by England, the responses indicate that school administrators as a group have primarily an ethical-moralistic personal value orientation, and, secondarily, a pragmatic orientation. These findings represent a reversal of England's findings  for managers. Little or no relationship was found between value orientation classifications and selected personal characteristics of administrators. The reliability and validity data for the instrument indicate that further refinement and study of the instrument are needed before it can be used with confidence as a research or assessment tool.

The taxonomy approach currently in use expresses objectives in terms that are evidenced by pupil behavior. This approach deals with objectives that relate to three separate domains of learning: Cognitive, affective, and psychomotor. Although the domains are analytically separate, in reality they work together. Curriculum guides indicate that the majority of schools fall between an all-inclusive approach and a highly specific approach to stating objectives. The literature also contains groupings of objectives as ultimate and immediate, or as general and specific. Several sources state that curriculum theory is limited by the functions  educational objectives perform. Too many objectives attempt to prescribe and predetermine the behavior of the next generation. Teachers perform a more specific role, administrators a more general role, in relation to objectives. Belief in a particular learning theory does affect the process of stating objectives. (MLF)",

        "description":"Planning, Programming, Budgeting Systems (PPBS) provide a new approach to the optimum use of limited school system resources in improving the learning process. In conjunction with Management Information Systems (MIS), PPBS is a tool which school officials can use to communicate to taxpayers the necessity for current school programs and the manner in which tax dollars are being allocated. PPBS requires that general educational goals, based on perception of the needs of the community, be translated into specific, quantifiable objectives to be carried out in specified time periods. Programs for carrying out these objectives are then specified and compared for expected effectiveness and cost. Approved longrun and shortrun programs are budgeted and put into operation. The various  program operations are evaluated by a previously established criterion for fulfillment of the specified objectives. To estimate, evaluate, and report on operating systems within the multiyear PPBS framework, certain MIS data are required. The five major categories of MIS data are pupil data, program data, personnel data, facilities data, and financial data. On the basis of this data the school administration makes its decisions regarding programs and budgets. (DE)",

Survey data are reported in three sections. Sections 1 and 2 distinguish 11 categories of responses from vocational and instructional consultants, including sources of requests, individuals and groups with whom consultants work, frequency of consultant activities, and evaluation of consultant activities. Section 3 reports responses for all respondents to four categories of open-ended interview data: Satisfying  experiences, dissatisfying incidents, drawbacks, and dreams and projections. Findings of the study indicate that the two modus operandi of the instructional and vocational consultants are distinct but that both kinds of consultants consider themselves as change agents and find their work satisfying when they are able to effect change.

The rational approach focuses on characteristics that are bureaucratic and relate to the hierarchical exercise of authority. The natural-system approach focuses on the social structure and attempts to identify the power structure through analyses of interaction, communication, and reliance patterns. A number of studies are reviewed to help clarify basic concepts of the two approaches and determine sources of influence upon the behavior of teachers. Subjects covered in the review include characteristics of influentials, the identification of subgroups for the general communication structure and the informal socializing structure, characteristics of subgroup members, the relationship  between influence structure and innovation, bureaucracy as a unitary or multidimensional concept, and dimensions of authority and expertise. To meet the demands of current and future educational practices, organizational structures must be designed that are based upon these and other conceptualizations of particular relevance to schools and school systems.

Management of educational improvements in a school system requires organization of these diverse processes. Three suggestions for promoting an innovative climate are as follows: (1) Coordination, the steering and development of innovative processes, is necessary. (2) Structures to manage innovative processes can be created and existing ones utilized (seven types of structures are described). (3) Climate, a diffuse  concept in educational literature, can be replaced by the well-defined, social-psychological concept of group norm, which specifies organizational conditions promoting innovativeness. The necessary elements of a norm are a group, interaction time among the group, specific ideas of desirable or undesirable behavior, and sanction. Empirical data on innovativeness norms and nine different strategies for changing norms are presented. (MLF)",

It is argued that an urgent task of education and, therefore, of the Center, is to promote desirable changes in deeply rooted beliefs, values, attitudes, and behavior patterns. (2) Individuals and institutions will continue to be subjected to stresses from technological and social change. This necessitates that education prepare individuals for the future and help determine what that future society may be  like. (3) The nation has the material and technological resources to implement the national goal of well-being for the individual. National goals are repeated which stress the balance of educational systems between the roles of serving a socializing function and aiding individual self-fulfillment.

The existing system of education employs primarily one form of the uniformity approach and leaves the bulk of human resources undeveloped.

To satisfy future requirements for educated persons, the education system must be viewed as an instrument for the attainment of human goals, and planning must determine how many persons must learn what and how well. Because the existing system will constrain both the targets set and the direction of future changes in the system itself, the first step in planning is an assessment of this system. Assessment includes a \"mapping\" of the education system on a disaggregated basis with a break-down into operationally useful divisions. Trends in influence of private institutions must be anticipated since these are less manageable from the  public sphere. Complete data in such relevant categories as capacity, efficiency, effectiveness, and cost are to be gathered. Targets are set and are linked to specific educational institutions by working backward from the targets to the inputs required.

        "description":"The constitutionally erected wall of separation between church and state is the only viable foundation for maintaining religious freedom and for preserving our public school system. The patchwork of recent court decisions and State and Federal legislation concerning aid to parochial schools threatens to erode that wall. Justifications for such aid are based on (1) separability of religious and secular functions of parochial schools, (2) provision of proper public welfare assistance to all students, even when they are not enrolled in public schools, (3) cries of discrimination against religion, or (4) saving of taxpayers' money. Some of these justifications are couched in fallacious reasoning and all become unimportant in the face of constitutional principle. Current aid to  parochial schools is establishing the precedent for future demands for aid by more religious groups who desire to segregate their children from the public schools, which have been of vital importance as a great cultural \"melting pot\" for national unity.

Criteria for evaluating the adequacy of the problem-formulation product were developed, including outcomes desired, values underlying outcomes, kinds of evidence for outcomes, present conditions, solution possibilities, and immediate action alternatives. Three group problem-defining techniques were compared experimentally, each differing on two dimensions: (1) Whether or not the formulation was structured to obtain the elements listed above, and (2) whether or not the inquiry was  directed by an experienced outside formulator. Eighteen three-member groups of educators were used in all. The problem definition produced by each group was evaluated independently by two other educators from the same district. Results indicated that directed groups tended to produce superior problem definitions, and suggest the need for carefully designed problem-formulation training for educators. (Author/JH)",

Both movements began as revolutions designed to gain equality and power for disenfranchised minorities. Although the issues disputed by labor-management differ in many respects from the demands of student rights. Basic similarities in the social and political environments surrounding the emergence of both movements include: (1) Lack of support from the established political parties, (2) presence of some support from the intellectual community, and (3) generally hostile public reactions to the movements. The labor movement eventually achieved the right to bargain  collectively as equals in return for their pledge to support the established American political and economic system. The analogy suggests that resolution of the student revolt will require both a recognition of equality among the participants and a communication process similar to collective bargaining. (JH)",

All children selected had been recommended by their kindergarten teachers as their brightest students. Both groups were given the Metropolitan Achievement Test, Primary I Battery in the fall and Primary II Battery in the spring. Students in the interage condition performed at a higher level on all achievement scales; group means were significant on word discrimination and arithmetic (p .01). Students selected as evidencing initial adjustment problems showed greater gains than their controls on all four scales. However, they achieved  significantly lower scores on the California Test of Personality. The parents of children in both conditions responded favorably to questions concerning their children's reactions to school, their adjustments in and out of school, and their interest in reading. The parents of children in the interage program provided significantly higher ratings on the richness and variety of classroom experiences and the motivations provided to challenge the child to make use of his talents. The California Test of Personality revealed no significant differences in social adjustment of interage as opposed to straight grade classes. (Author/BB)",

Group one consisted of 24 children meeting the criterion for entrance, group two consisted of 24 children not meeting the criterion, while group three consisted of 8 children from group one who obtained a mental age of 7 years or higher. Conclusions were that high I.Q. did not assure school success under regular classroom conditions, early admission produced educational, social and emotional impairment in many children, greater advantages  would have accrued if eligible children would not have entered school early, and girls were less adversely affected by early entrance.

A significant change in the positive direction was noted in the subjects' concept of the magnitude of their problems in reading, health, and personal adjustment; their knowledge of natural science also showed a significant gain.

They taught basic reading skills to functional non-readers in grades 3 through 6; and focused on reading skills with less remediation of perceptual-motor deficiencies in two elementary classes and three secondary classes. Two 10-week in-service courses presented the theory and methods of remediation. Visitors and participants answered questionnaires and indicated that their involvement with the Learning Center  was valuable; all classes but one made progress at the .05 level of significance in all areas of reading and spelling; and structured teacher ratings showed few changes in student attitudes and behavior. Informal comments of teachers and aides, parent questionnaire responses, and student interviews, however, indicated positive changes in the students' attitudes toward school and learning. An outline of the instructional methods and materials is included. [Not available in hard copy due to marginal legibility of original document.] (LE)",

During the 5-year project, over 5,000 adolescents were referred; 1,800 or 40% of whom were in the school project; more than 1,000 or 55% were accepted for treatment, and the other 45% were being processed. Compared to clients in the traditional program, clients in the school project were younger, with about half 14 and 15 years old. All received diagnostic services. The most frequent disability was found to be emotional disturbance; the next most frequent were orthopedic impairments and mental retardation. Special treatment facilities offered included a college program, a  day care program at a private mental hospital, community workshops for retarded clients, a group therapy program for emotionally disturbed clients and their parents, and a camp for emotionally disturbed clients. Interviews evaluating the project indicated that the DVR counselor played the crucial role in its functioning; ratings of the counselors indicated that the DVR counselor's relationship with the school guidance counselor was important. Of a sample of 91 active clients, most had been referred at age 14 or 15 for psychological problems. Of nearly 2,300 cases closed during the project, only about half were employed and half were closed after referral. (JD)",

Results of the intelligibility study showed that the dysarthrics could be categorized according to their responses into four groups. The results also indicated that certain words presented more difficulty for some types of dysarthria than others. It was concluded that the 50 word list is an efficient and accurate means of testing dysarthrics before and after speech therapy.

        "description":"To evaluate the effectiveness of an engineered classroom design, 54 educationally handicapped children were placed in six classrooms, each with a teacher and an aide. Each classroom was set up with three major centers: mastery-achievement, exploratory-social, and attention-response-order. Children were assigned tasks at centers in keeping with their individual problems and were awarded check marks every fifteen minutes for behavior and work according to behavior modification principles. Achievement was tested three times over the year; daily task attention was recorded by two observers who clocked the number of seconds each child's eyes were on an assigned task during 5-minute samples taken five times daily. Children in the experimental classroom utilizing the engineered design  enjoyed a five to twenty per cent task attention advantage over children in the control classrooms not using the check mark system and all aspects of the design. Experimental classes which abruptly withdrew the design at mid-year showed no decrease in task attention, in fact they improved. While reading and spelling gains were not significantly different between experimental and control conditions, gains in arithmetic fundamentals were significantly correlated with the presence of the engineered design.

As a group, the subjects were not successful in their school careers after leaving ASP. They received poor ratings by current teachers in both academic and social behavior. Among subjects over 16, 43% were known to have dropped out of school. Other measures of adjustment, such as grade point average, police records, and school suspension or exclusion indicated poor adjustment by former ASP students. Variables measured prior to ASP  entrance that were related to the highest number of criteria of successful later adjustment included a rating on stability of the subject's family, age of ASP entrance, and whether the subject's behavior was categorized as acting out or withdrawn. Other variables related to adjustment criteria included IQ, academic retardation, retention prior to ASP, and a history of mental health treatment. Information is included on the subjects' and the program's characteristics. (Author/JD)",

Following discussions of the need for comprehensive planning and the responsibility of the state education agency for educational planning, a functional description is presented of the planning process and its structure in state education agencies. Capabilities necessary for effective planning are identified, and illustrative state planning activities are presented in the appendix.

        "description":"Theatrical revolution symbolized by the open stage is discussed. The mere absence of the proscenium arch can insure no more than an architectural modification. Any genuine and lasting artistic liberation must come with the attitudes guiding the use of the stage. The only valid principles are those which can point gently toward contemporary dramatic satisfaction while leaving room for the necessary continuing innovation in the future. Sense staging becomes a part of the play itself. It is more than a setting and a background--it is an environment that sometimes mingles with the meaning of the play itself. This approach means that the director and the designer work well as a team. They must be able to agree upon the varying emphasis that all these factors should receive in each  separate production. Some plays will need only the simplest scenic touches. Others use effects that result in the technical director's having a direct relationship with the actors themselves. (RK)",

The campuses involved were Davis, Los Angeles, Riverside, and Santa Barbara. A summary of the tabulated information appears in sections 4 and 5. The questionnaire further gave an opportunity to obtain useful information about student living habits and student opinions about their living quarters. In planning the student room, consideration must be given not only to the qualitative adaptability of  furniture but also a quantitative adaptability so that the student may add or subtract storage furnishings as needed to accommodate his possessions. There appears to be a need for furnishings which can further permit each student to personalize his room by allowing the storage of possessions according to his own preference. In developing storage, the primary focus should be on possessions which are frequently used and must, therefore, be immediately accessible. (RK)",

In 1948 the United States Air Force sought a new way of housing large radar antennae planned for the arctic. As an outcome of their search, Birdair Structures, Inc., which is now one of several companies selling such structures, was founded. Early experiences with air structures for schools in Litchfield, Connecticut, were disappointing. The subsequent erection of two more bubbles was evidence that satisfaction was eventually achieved. Cost estimates of $2.14 per square foot compare favorably with wood-domed fieldhouses at $6.53 per square foot or geodesic fieldhouses at $8.34 per square foot. Costs for swimming pool use are estimated at  $9.38 per square foot as compared to $26.00 and $32.00. Ease of heating is also emphasized. Installation time is approximately one day. There is no danger of suffocation in case of deflation because the process is slow and the material can easily be lifted should one find it necessary to get out under such conditions. There is no fire danger. Because of high reflection surface, lightning problems are minimal. This document previously announced as ED 018 924. (RH)",

Six new universities were constructed as a result with an emphasis on design. The design was developed to help solve the dilemma of &quot;belonging&quot; at large institutions. This was done by development of the concept of a continuous teaching environment. This concept describes a physical form that preserves communication and contact between all parts of the institution while allowing external accretion and internal change. Its essential features are geared to--(1) conformity with educational philosophy of maximum interdisciplinary contact, (2) integration of living and working areas, (3) separation of  vehicular and pedestrian ways, (4) largely self-sufficient urban community, (5) optimum contrast between development and surrounding site, (6) a 24-hour university, and (7) opportunity of limitless expansion.

        "description":"Generalized academic simulation programs (GASP) is school scheduling by computer. The publication compares the manual method of developing a school schedule with the new method of computer programing. A major advantage of computer programing is that it relieves the administrator of this busy work so that he can devote his energies and time to more important educational problems. To convert to computer scheduling, a school principal will have to become acquainted with computer language or employ a programer in a data process center. A major advantage to computer programing is that it can facilitate flexible scheduling of pupils, heretofore stymied by human shortcoming and inadequacy. Computer scheduling allows considerable leeway in setting the parameters for the scheduling of  subjects. GASP should not be viewed as limited cybernetically to the scheduling of pupils. Once an administrator understands its language and its potential, the computer can be used to answer \"what if\" questions and \"educational assumptions\" which without the computer the administrator could only imagine but never implement for lack of computer programing and the knowledge of outcomes.

Students learn as much from television as from conventional instruction when the programs are viewed for academic credit. Experiments at Pennsylvania State University (1954; 1956-57) showed that it is difficult to assess the value of such telecasts. Faculty and students felt that large classes (over 200), and a desire for the best teaching available, encourage television, while a lack of student-teacher feedback discourages it. In 1955, programs were introduced in the public schools which led to the National Program. This was intended to determine the feasibility of television instruction as a major resource, to teach larger classes with fewer teachers and classrooms, at the  same time raising the quality of instruction. Maximum class sizes were 175 in elementary schools, and 500 at the junior and senior high levels. The television students performed better than conventional students over the two-year test period. Television, though subject to imperfections, provided, by and large, many advantages over conventional teaching. Its imperfections emphasized that the technique is not a panacea, but a tool whose effectiveness resides mainly in the resourcefulness of the user--in this case, the teacher. (TI/GO)",

Individually prescribed instruction (with clearly defined goals) might be a legitimate strategy. Regional educational laboratories and a national organization for educational development could help systematize and distribute information on innovations in learning techniques. To be effective these institutions must be willing to  try unfamiliar approaches and to continually review the accepted methods and standards.

The comparison was also based on the hypotheses that color television would prove superior to black and white television in a case such as this where color is vital to identification and diagnosis, and that color television would be more effective than color films because its \"live\" character would heighten the drama  of the subject matter. After three years of testing, the conclusion was that there were no significant differences in learning among the four groups of students tested, and that, to decide whether or not to use television or film in the classroom, considerations other than those of teaching effectiveness must prevail.

Naval trainees viewed several different motion pictures, each teaching basic information about knot-tying, but each varying from others on one of the three variables. After the instruction the trainees were tested on the perceptual-motor tasks, namely the tying of three difficult knots. The experiment showed that a moderate amount of verbal description of the task  aided learning while too much talk hindered it. Statements using the imperative mood or the second person active were more effective (in this military group) than those using the third person passive. Finally, a \"leading\" commentary helped trainees more than a \"lagging\" commentary. (BB)",

In mathematics, the strand program breaks the subject area down to 14 heads (counting, vertical addition, horizontal addition, etc.) and tackles them one at a time. The reading program is linear, and consists of five parallel strands: letter identification, sight-word recognition, phonics, spelling patterns, and word meaning. The report describes the first year  logic and algebra program, and tabulates a course outline for the second year. The second year Russian is reported (the course was first offered in 1967-8 at Stanford) and, in this, 74% of the computer-based students performed better than the best student in the conventional class. Activities planned for the next reporting period are detailed, and a list of publications and lectures is appended. (GO)",

Cities grow in population very rapidly; motor vehicles grow in number even more rapidly; both citcumstances raise problems--traffic congestion, economic loss, air pollution, urban planning--which necessitate information gathering, prediction, evaluation, and decision making. The computer comes into its own, not only in these areas, but also in some of the research planning. A good example is the San Jose traffic control system. Technology has brought prodigious productive efficiency to agriculture, where the problems are even more complex, more urgent, and the options numerous. The computer plays a big role here, too. In Art,  technology has always played a part--in the manufacture of materials. Nowadays that part has been expanded, and even the computer is sometimes used in the process of creation in the visual arts and in music; although in literature the computer's role is as yet vestigial. An introduction to computers and computer programing using the FORTRAN language is also given in this guide as part of a course in cybernetics. A bibliography brings to an end this concluding half of a two-part report. (Part I is EM006096). (GO)",

Earlier studies had demonstrated, through comparison of attitude and performance test results from program-instructed and control-group medical students, that programed texts are more effective than conventional methods in teaching clinical patient management. The strategy of the workshops involved placing professional, teaching physicians in the role of students learning through the use of programed materials, with the expectation that they would be better prepared to develop programed materials with the learners' problems in mind. It was especially important to show that  programed instruction courses should have realistically limited objectives and that medical students can be quite adept at writing and evaluating such materials. Those workshop participants who wanted more experience in writing programed texts were invited to spend a full week doing so at the Medical College of Georgia. Appendices include, among other items, lists of workshop dates and participants, complete transcripts of questionnaire responses for two workshops, and the full 124-page course workbook &quot;Programed Instruction in Teaching Patient Management.&quot; (RM)",

        "description":"Investigating the costs of instructional media systems necessitated that those systems be identified and analyzed, and that a methodology be formulated for estimating their costs, with reference to their area of operation: local, city, metropolitan, state, or regional school areas. Costs are broken down into cost per student per year, according to production costs, distribution costs, reception costs, and total cost for each instructional medium examined. These media are: airborne television, Instructional Television Fixed Service, satellite television, UHF (ultra high frequency) television, closed-circuit television, videtape recordings, film, radio, language laboratories, and dial access systems. A distinction is made between capital and operating costs, and a further breakdown  of costs lists them according to whether the media are high quality, minimal, or derive from a national programing source. A significant pattern emerges: cost per student dips sharply as the area widens and the number of students increases for all media (videotape recording costs are in any case prohibitive). This pattern is a key factor in the recommendations for cost savings which postulate widespread use of media, improvement of production quality by the use of improved technology, reorganization of educational systems in terms of the new technology.

Despite its potential however, high costs and prejudice have delayed acceptance by educators. An effort, therefore, must be made to overcome misunderstandings which obscure the benefits of computers in education. Computers can aid rather than replace the teacher, not only by handling the enormous amounts of paperwork involved in registration, keeping records, scheduling, and administrative tasks, but also by serving as a library for data retrieval and by aiding in counseling and grading papers. By relieving teachers of paperwork, computers could allow more time for planning classwork  and for individual sessions with students. The high cost of instructional programs is a major factor in inhibiting innovation, but linkups with regional computer networks could make it possible to share costs as well as benefits. Such linkups could make it possible for even the poorer schools to provide flexible, individualized instruction and offer courses which would otherwise be unavailable to their students. (RM)",

A version of the PLANIT system was modified so that a human tutor could be used to make instructional decisions in response to students' constructed answers to questions presented by PLANIT, and the resulting interactions used as examples of the breadth of language that the language processor eventually must straddle. The project is based on two interdependent assumptions yet untested: that the model will be effective as a teaching instrument (it demands from the student greater subject mastery); and that it can be constructed as a working computer system. The automated model is  fed with a correct answer which is just sufficient to satisfy the query--the canonical answer (CA). The model then takes the student response (SR) and compares it with the CA. There are five possible relationships between the CA and the SR, ranging from equipollent, through partially irrelevant, to totally irrelevant, and the model directs the student accordingly. The automated tutor is still in its infancy, and a great deal of work is foreseen before it becomes a useful system. (GO)",

Experiments carried out on instructional history variables in teaching a mirror image, oblique line discrimination, showed that the most successful procedures were to present the stimulus successively rather than simultaneously with short inter-trial intervals. In evaluating a computer assisted laboratory in statistical inference, it was found that positive attitudinal shifts toward computers resulted from working on a computer terminal. SKOOLBOL-I, a programing language used in psychological experimentation, was evaluated and modified, and basic design work  on a second generation language was initiated. An analysis was compled of instructional strategies in terms of automata theory and linguistic models.

A team, comprised of the regular foreign language teacher and a number of volunteer advanced students, could (1) present listening comprehension materials, (2) evaluate pronunciation and intonation, and (3) aid in activating extemporaneous speaking skills. By incorporating the team approach once, or preferably twice, a week into the lesson plan, the foreign language teacher could develop a more varied and creative presentation, more highly motivated students, and an improved teaching program generally.

Major attention is given to the suggestion offered by research findings that language aptitude depends upon a somewhat different set of abilities (primarily differences in learning rate, from those articles required to master other subject matter. An explanation of the Modern Language Aptitude Test's ability to measure, predict, and identify such distinctive foreign language learning traits as (1) phonetic coding ability, (2) grammatical sensitivity, (3) rote learning ability for meanings of foreign language words and expressions, and (4) deductive  learning ability, precedes a discussion of the Test's use for selection, guidance, and diagnosis. More briefly examined are how the factors of age, length of study, and motivation influence the learning of a foreign language. Concluding remarks concern the proper aims for language instruction and the teaching methods appropriate for achieving these goals. For related documents see FL 001 222 and FL 001 223. (AF)",

The predominant feature of the research was the systematic observation and rating of the classroom behavior of the teachers by recording four 15-minute class segments over a period of five months. By means of specially constructed criterion tests, student and teacher questionnaires, the Modern Language Association Proficiency Tests for Teachers, and the observation of  classroom procedures, data were gathered that yielded 40 variables. An analysis of the intercorrelation matrix of the 40 variables showed that a series of interrelated teacher behaviors and characteristics correlated significantly with student achievement. The two research hypotheses formulated focused on the linguistically definable and pedagogical aspects of the teachers's classroom behavior. The major recommendations emerging from the study concerned teacher training innovations and further research needs. (Author/AF)",

The first paper focuses on variables that will be used to measure institutional environments, and possible approaches to determine how these variables affect student performance. The second paper deals with relevant criteria for assessing student development, and describes student input data already collected from freshmen for subsequent evaluation of grade point averages in major fields of study, overall college achievement, and  performances on achievement tests. The hope is to evaluate changes in student values, attitudes, personality, educational aspirations, and vocational choice, and to relate these to college experience and to student behavior in society at large after graduation. The third paper discusses how results of research on data collected on students and their institutions may contribute to the matching of college-bound students and colleges. It also considers how to present data on a multiplicity of input, outcome, and environmental variables so that they may be of maximum utility in decision-making by students, counselors, and admission officers.

The center also treats patients suffering from alcoholism, oral cancer, and periodontal or  gum diseases, and collects data for further study on the causes and cures for these illnesses. At least 10 projects on air pollution and 7 on water pollution were conducted in 1966. Social programs concentrate on poverty, slums, juvenile delinquency, and racial discrimination. The report also discusses how some studies have contributed to the improvement of public education, government finances, and teaching methods for public administrators at both city and state levels. Others examine reapportionment, criminal justice, and individual rights. In 1965 and 1966, these projects involved more than 900 faculty members and 1,100 graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and technical assistants, at a total cost of $34,000,000. (WM)",

        "description":"The greatest weakness of US liberal education is that students are not encouraged to learn outside the rigidly structured system of courses, credits, grades, and frequent tests. Some criticisms of liberal education concern professors who are more devoted to their disciplines than to their students, and the lack of diversification of curricula for students of differing talents and temperments. Educational methods emphasize formal quantitative standards which direct students' motivation toward meeting the requirements and away from genuine learning. On the matter of university governance, 5 internal groups are competing for influence and power: the governing board, the administration, faculty, students, and non-academic staff. The last 3 groups are clamoring for increasing  authority in decision making. One possible solution would be to have each group, except the governing board, represented on an advisory council which would submit its decisions to the governing board for review. In this way the various groups in the university would function through discussion and persuasion, not coercion, and final authority would still rest with the president of the university. There are important values in the present system of governance, but it should be an instrument of educational reform. Faculty members and administrators should adapt liberal education to the twentieth century in order to promote a better education for today's undergraduates. (WM)",

        "description":"Contemporary issues in campus governance are part of a long chain of history. Our ways of perceiving the environment create trained incapacities which make it very difficult for us to see the world in any other way. Administrators, faculty and students all operate on the principle of \"self-fulfilling prophecy\"--or, according to their \"perceptual set.\" There are various alternative patterns of governance but faculty and administrators will have to alter their perceptual sets if they are to be put into practice. One is the notion of a central committee consisting of faculty, student and administration representatives and some trustee representation; another pattern is the joint long-range planning committee composed of the same groups. The questions of what criteria should be used  to justify participation in governance and how to define the limits of the university community must be faced. Despite the growth of huge organizations, there is a strong move toward decentralization; breaking up large campuses into small units has been suggested. Some argue that administrators be given more power, and, perhaps, a clear allocation of responsibility would be desirable. The pattern of governance an institution adopts will depend upon its size, complexity of organization, amount of faculty commitment to campus and discipline, extent to which a clearly identified institutional purpose exists and role of internal and external organizations in decision making. Structure should flow from functions. (JS)",

The ACE directory was also used in measuring the size of the financial aid program, type and level of instruction and source of control.

The Urban Corps had 3 purposes: to get needed work done; to be an internship for the students; to expose City agencies to fresh ideas. To determine what proportion of the program was a success, investigators visited the agencies, conducted group interviews, and administered questionnaires to approximately 600 interns and their supervisors. A look at a few of the individual interns and their experiences is followed by a composite picture of the interns and their agencies. The report discusses:  administration of the program, what kind of people the interns were; what kind of jobs they had; what factors made the job good or bad; the interns who changed; and good and poor agencies. It was found that: exceptional students participated in the program; the Urban Corps was generally a success from the interns' and supervisors' points of view; and factors of satisfaction, effectiveness, and change were highly interrelated. Another successful aspect was the extent to which the program was studied by insiders and outsiders and the way in which findings modified administration of the Urban Corps. (JS)",

Generally, the trial planning process that was developed for Colgate University involved a 1-week session to discuss institutional objectives and to define strategies for long-term development. The institutional data collected during an interim period were indexed and analyzed, and a second 1-week session  concentrated on the analysis of these data to identify significant internal trends of the university and their relationship to environmental influences. Planning \"gaps\" were identified, alternate courses of action were broken down into specific programs, and a planning guide for future comprehensive planning was developed. This process, which has also been tested at Franklin and Marshall College, compresses the amount of time required for planning but provides a coordinated approach to the development of a practical, flexible, and feasible plan to serve as a broad frame of reference for individual institutions.

Criteria for the courses stipulate that they: cross departmental lines, provide a mechanism for making higher education relevant to society, possess a high degree of intellectual challenge, be innovative in format and subject material, and be constructed and run by students and instructors in a close working relationship. By 1968, this joint faculty-student-administration committee had offered 10 courses for credit to over 600 students, and almost as many auditors, who were permitted to enroll without regard to major, year, or grade point average. Each course is granted Academic Senate  approval by the Council for Educational Development, and the instructors are relieved from 50% of their normal duties through a financial arrangement between their departments and the administration. Some course topics were Alienation, Corruption, The Black Man in a Changing American Context, and The Future of Disarmament. CSES estimates that $3000 per course would provide students with a truly innovative educational experience, and is requesting $18,000 for 6 courses to be offered during the 1969-1970 academic year. Appended to the request are a complete summary of 8 courses, a list of criteria for, and evaluation of, courses and instructors, and a breakdown of enrollment. (WM)",

To be effective, forms of representation must be personalized and demonstrably linked to humane goals. One possible governance arrangement conceives of the central administration as analogous to the federal executive, and the Faculty Senate  and Student Assembly as upper and lower houses of the legislature. Service in the Assembly would be tied to special related academic programs and awarded academic credit. To ensure that the Assembly was truly representative, the student body would be divided into \"districts\" of about 100-200 members who would elect a representative to the Assembly. Districts would be organized around common ideological interests. Judicial functions could be exercised in a variety of ways, involving, perhaps, distinctive trial courts and appellate tribunals.

Both groups  were influenced by low cost and a chance to live away from home. USC students' fifth major influence involved friends who attended USC, while the national norms showed the role of the high school teacher or counselor as a major influence. Data on 1967 and 1968 USC freshmen revealed no change in the ranking of the 5 most frequently mentioned major influences in 2 years, and while reasons for selecting USC remained stable and in the same order of preference, a larger percentage of the 1968 freshmen selected this institution because of its academic reputation.

The firm conviction of \"new left\" activists --the third generation of radical, militant students-- is that they must do something about social problems that alienate human beings, such as poverty, racism, militarism, urbanization, and war. Believing themselves to be vitally affected by university policies and practices, students are claiming a democratic right to participate in institutional decision making. But within the university, each of the many communities should decide its own affairs, and conditions necessary for democracy do not exist. However, 3  areas in which just student demands could be met involve (1) voting on non-academic policy such as the right to control their private and social lives on campus, (2) voting on non-academic questions that concern the entire university community, such as allowing cars on campus, and (3) an effective voice in certain academic areas such as curriculum, effective teaching, examinations, and grading, on which they would not vote but could be consulted and, when possible, accommodated. The principle of consultation and accommodation would help to resolve the problem of student participation in decision making, make constructive use of students' energies, and protect colleges and universities from outside forces.

Analysis of variance was used to discover differences in scores on each 3-point influence scale between 8 groups of 55 students each: Upper and Lower Michigan residents, males and females, and those who graduated in upper and lower halves of their high school classes. Most of the differences found among the groups were small. The more  academically able students --particularly females-- from lower socioeconomic groups in Upper Michigan emphasized practical matters such as cost and distance, but not students from upper socioeconomic families in Lower Michigan who were lower achievers yet had expected to go to college. Practicality seemed to be correlated with first semester academic performance, since students in the Lower Michigan group who were most influenced by this factor tended to achieve more academically than others who were not. Social factors were only slightly more important to Lower Michigan students. Both groups stressed intellectual factors but not the advice of others, and females emphasized intellectual considerations more than males. (WM)",

This study compared the persistence and academic performance of 91 students who completed the program in the summers of 1966 and 1967 with a comparable group of students entering the university in the fall of both years. The criterion of achievement was the grade point average (GPA), and persistence was measured by enrollments in semesters following summer sessions or initial semesters. Early Entry students earned higher GPAs during the summer programs than those earned by fall entrants in their first  semesters (fall) but had lower GPAs for fall and spring semesters than the fall entrants. 1966 Early Entry students had more persistence when it was measured in terms of completion of 2, 3, or 4 semesters; but when persistence was measured by the number of semesters completed following initial enrollment, no significant difference was found. The high mean GPAs of Early Entry students in the summer sessions dropped in the fall and spring semesters to a level not greatly different from those of fall entrants. It was concluded that the influence of the Institute on academic performance was not greater than that of regular fall programs, but that a similar special program may be more successful if extended over a longer period of time.

NMU students who lived off campus approved of the faculty and administration much more than those who lived on campus, and NMU males were less satisfied with  faculty than males in the norm group. NMU students, particularly the males, were more negative toward administrative authority over student behavior than the norm group. Scores lower than those for both NMU females and the norm group were obtained for NMU males concerning satisfaction with major fields, and NMU students took a less favorable view of their peers than students at norm group institutions. More recent norms may have revealed less differences between the 2 groups.

Today's student unrest already indicates that a new order is emerging. Moderates seek change through reform and militants seek it through revolution, but both groups embrace the ideology of relevance and want colleges and universities to respond more aggressively to current social issues. If the demand for relevance in education is a demand for responsiveness, then institutions of higher learning must change from within and assume a leadership role, boldly asserting themselves as catalysts to set new directions, clarify vital issues, develop new knowledge, and devise new techniques to  transform disorder into order. Higher education in the US may be characterized today as the \"disaster area\" of the social order. To remove this image and to make the institutional structure more appropriate for life during and after the seventies, educators could change the process of determining who has access to higher learning, renew the learning environment, remove barriers between campus and community, and reevaluate the whole apparatus of courses, grades, and credit hours. Modern students will take over the post-modern US one day, not by revolution but by inheritance, and the impact of higher education upon society today will determine the character of the society that is turned over to them.

        "description":"Following a pilot study between 1965 and 1967, the Counseling Center at Kansas State University initiated a 3-year mental health project to identify integrative experiences --those that lead toward more creative and fully functioning individuals-- of college students, and to communicate interpretative reports on the data collected to the academic community, parents, and the counseling profession. Staff members of the Center met weekly with groups of students to discuss the significance of the week's experiences, and material derived from each meeting was summarized, recorded, coded, and crossfiled by group, individual, and topics of discussion. By the end of 1968, 192 students had participated in the weekly sessions and the project had expanded to include individual interviews,  psychometric assessments, and a study of the physiological aspects of human development. The first half of this report relates the project to other phases of student personnel work and reviews the pilot study phase, with emphasis upon emerging trends in data collected up to 1969. The second half focuses on contacts with faculty, students, parents, and the community at large, and discusses the project's contributions to the training of student personnel workers in higher education.

        "description":"The task of administrative decision makers at diverse and complex institutions has been made more difficult with student confrontations, and there is an expressed need for improved tools to assess student attitudes and characteristics. The Campus Environment Scale (CES), a data-gathering tool, contains 150 statements that deal comprehensively with college life to which students' reactions may range from strong agreement to strong disagreement. The CES was used in a pilot study to assess campus environments in the Kansas City, Missouri region, and the resulting tables and charts presented in the report offer administrators in the participating institutions a basis for comparative analysis of their institutions with other campuses. Improved instrumentation of the CES for trend  analysis, rather than comparative analysis, would offer increased effectiveness in administrative decision making, since trend analysis also detects whether areas of strength are deteriorating or whether a negative situation has undergone improvement, and provides an almost instantaneous informational feedback. The use of a computerized item sampling technique, in which students respond to a fraction of the CES questions, has refined the CES to the point where processing time from student response to feedback is only about 2 hours. This facilitates an ongoing trend assessment of student attitudes and characteristics for effective administrative decision making. (WM)",

A distinguishing feature of SEEK is its close working relationship with community agencies which help to recruit students. The agencies are encouraged to stay in touch with accepted applicants and follow their progress in the program. Constant communication between the program and agencies is necessary to maintain interest and involvement. To gather information about the community agencies and their activities and experiences concerning the SEEK  program, a questionnaire was mailed in February 1969 to approximately 1200 agencies. Questions were asked about a variety of areas, including the volume of referrals made and anticipated, community attitude toward SEEK, and satisfaction with SEEK among agencies, communities, and students. The results from the 30% that responded indicated that: while hundreds of agencies had referred applicants to SEEK, hundreds of others had not; referral activity was generally on a small scale (less than 10 per agency in most cases); and the great majority of agencies that made referrals were satisfied with the program and reported satisfaction on the part of their communities and students.

Because of steady improvement in educational quality, a constantly broadening spectrum of liberal and professional education, and meaningful contributions to the community, these institutions are attracting growing numbers of black and white students despite an increase in higher education opportunities at predominantly white institutions. State appropriations provide 50% of their income, 12% comes from tuition and student fees, and auxiliary enterprises account for 25%; the federal government provides 10%, and  private gifts and grants account for 1%, 50% of which come from foundations. Public Negro institutions, which award approximately 10,300 bachelor's and 1,400 master's degrees annually, had a 1968-1969 student enrollment of 93,470, including one third of all black students in US higher education. The fact book discusses the history of these institutions, their students, academic and public service programs, alumni, faculty, finances, and facilities. It also lists the 34 institutions, each with mailing address and other data.

To determine whether the requirements of Illustration 3, which deal with the professional competency of faculty members, were being met by southern institutions, data were collected in the spring of 1967 from 8,492 faculty members at 141 public and private 2-year colleges and 51,411 faculty members at 329 public and private 4-year colleges and universities. Among other findings, it was revealed that all faculty members at  both types of institutions do not hold advanced degrees. Seventy-three percent of the 2-year colleges have 40% or more teaching faculty members with 2 years of advanced study beyond the bachelor's degree, but only 3.1% of the 4-year institutions reported on teaching staff who were so prepared. In 150 of the 4-year colleges, the doctorate is held by 30% or more of the faculty, but 14 colleges reported no teachers holding doctor's degrees. Competency certification (as an endorsement of equivalent preparation) is more common among 2-year colleges than among 4-year institutions. It was concluded that although compliance varies among institutions, Illustration 3 is not being met successfully by any of the institutions studied. (WM)",

NC replaced both D and F of the old system, and grade point averages were abolished, in an effort to encourage students to register in more difficult courses. This study, conducted 4 years after the new grading system was put into effect, sought to determine the number of hours taken and passed, and the number of easy, moderate, and hard courses taken and passed by students under each system. Participating students were the Classes of 1965 (under old grading system), 1967 (4 semesters under each system), and 1969 (under new grading system). With each succeeding class, students  attempted more hours per semester, but passed fewer courses under the new system. If the D grades under the old system were not included this result could have been different, since NC includes the traditional D but is not entered into the students' records. The general pattern was that students registered in fewer easy and difficult courses, but took and passed a larger number of moderate courses. This trend would seem to represent changed student perceptions of courses over the years and not a change in registration patterns or a direct influence of the grading systems. (WM)",

Courses in the undergraduate curriculum for the disadvantaged should be built around the identified needs and characteristics of the students and of the surrounding society. The college curriculum has always been designed to make learning an interesting, exciting experience, and to generate intellectual curiosity, a love of knowledge, and an open mind. Since the characteristics of the student population are changing, the curriculum, which has always been geared to meet the needs of students, must also change to provide the same benefits for today's less affluent youth. In educating students  for tomorrow's world, cooperative education programs should be adopted on more campuses to train students for supervisory, mid-managerial, and junior executive positions in business and government. Admission and degree requirements should not be lessened, but additional remedial courses will be needed to strengthen the disadvantaged student's ability to cope with regular college work. Ethnic studies that are part of the curriculum should deal with human experience as it complements the study of other cultures, and not offered as isolated educational experiences. With this background of understandings, skills, and attitudes, students will adjust, participate, and contribute to society. (WM)",

To ensure the health of a college, interinstitutional research and intrainstitutional research must go hand in hand. The Left-Right Continuum is a socio-cultural, multidimensional yardstick that measures segments from the extreme left (activists who revolt against all institutional authority) to the extreme right (people off campus who fear any form of change that may take place on campus). Between these 2 groups are students and faculty members (the undistributed middle) who are not concerned with politics or institutional  changes but whose unrecognized needs, hopes, and frustrations are sources of possible conflict. The college itself is likened to the Freudian model of personality. The ego is a combination of faculty and administration, the id is the undistributed middle, and the superego is the charter of the college, which causes guilt about unrealized institutional goals; the college is in a constant state of neurosis. When the id, which is usually repressed by the ego, comes to the surface during a period of conflict, the institutional researcher is provided with the best view of the real internal dynamics of the institution for analysis, and can suggest the kind of adjustments that are necessary for the health of the college.

But many of these freshmen are \"latent terminal\" students with poor to average high school grades and low SCAT or ACT scores who fail in their chosen curriculum and leave college between the first and second semesters. The Educational and Cultural Development (ECD) Program, which began in the fall of 1965, is a broad, integrated, 1-year general education curriculum that is structured to provide a successful and productive educational experience in a highly personalized environment. ECD students enroll in 5 courses, on a block schedule basis: social science, natural science, communications,  humanities, and orientation. A larger number of students in 2 groups that successfully completed the ECD Program have earned more credits and higher grades in a shorter length of time than a comparison group of regular liberal arts students and those who persisted into their second year continued to achieve ahead of the liberal arts group. This report presents the theoretical structure and description of the ECD Program, the rationale on which it is based, faculty team reports on the 5 areas of study, and a detailed evaluation.

Data were obtained from records of the Health Service and Registrar's Office. Answers were sought to 3 questions: Did increased enrollment affect the proportion of the student body using the health service? Did differences occur in the use of the health service by male and female students in proportion to their membership in the student body? Were there differences in the use of the student health service by male and female students within medical classifications? It was found that student use of the health service over the 6-year period was not significantly different from  the rate of enrollment. Approximately 63% availed themselves of health services. Males and females tended to use the health service at a ratio similar to their proportion in the enrollment. The only exception was in the use of the health service for medical purposes: females used this service at a rate that was significantly higher than their ratio to males in the student population. Additional research is recommended on the image of the Health service, the type of services offered, and the effect of student housing on use of the health service. Tables are included. (JS)",

The purpose of this technical report is to respond to the question: How can management information systems be developed which will respond to the unique needs of the individual institutions and at the same time be sufficiently compatible to permit valid interinstitutional information comparisons? WICHE MIS program  objectives involve the development of exchange formulas and models, beginning with models that will facilitate the interinstitutional exchange of various types of unit cost data. These models will be used to identify data elements to be specified in a standard data element dictionary. A supplementary objective is to develop standard codes, field formats, and file structures for data storage, and present them in manuals that will explain how a total information system should be developed, so that small institutions with limited analytical research and computer capabilities may develop management information systems.

        "description":"College and university response to the sense of anomie experienced by students --especially those attending large, complex institutions-- has been to implement several plans for reducing the students' feelings of impersonality and estrangement. In one of these plans, based on the \"ombudsman\" concept, students register complaints to 1 individual, who conducts an impartial investigation, reports to the appropriate authority, and makes other efforts to achieve desired results. An informal survey of Western colleges and universities was made in August, 1968 to ascertain to what extent this kind of plan has been utilized. Twenty-nine of the responding institutions had studied the concept, 24 had not, 9 had rejected it, and only 7 had some form of ombudsman program. Student and staff  reactions to the program ranged from neutral to positive. Of the 29 institutions that had studied the concept, 20 had student bodies of more than 5,000 FTE (Full-Time Equivalent), and 16 of the 24 that had not considered such a program had student bodies of less than 5,000 FTE.

        "description":"An informal survey of colleges and universities was conducted in the Summer of 1967 to ascertain what positions they had taken with regard to the use of drugs by students. All of the institutions involved reported that they were aware of an urgent need to develop approaches for dealing with the problem, and were attempting to acquaint students with the problems involved in illegal drug use. Nine institutions had an established policy concerning the use of drugs, 10 were developing statements, and 14 did not yet have a policy. Those colleges and universities with policies had apparently assumed their positions because of the increasing use of drugs by students, community pressures, and concern for students involved in illicit drug use. Summarized, these policies state that: the  university regards drug use as a serious problem and strives, through professional means, to bring the facts about drugs and their use to the attention of the campus community; students using drugs should seek aid from the Dean of Students or from the Student Health Center; the university will uphold state and federal laws with respect to drugs; and the possession, distribution, or sale of drugs could result in disciplinary action by the university. Abstracts of the 9 statements are presented, as well as a list of institutions that were either developing policies or had not yet established a position on drug use when this report was written.

        "description":"Listening, the most efficient means of learning in the early grades, is replaced by reading as an efficient method for learning after the seventh grade. For an investigation of the effectiveness with which college students may be taught listening, lesson plans were developed from a programed instruction book --Principles of Selective Listening-- that was written in 1968 under the direction of John W. Blythe. A sample of 132 students at East Texas University was drawn from students who were enrolled in a Personality Foundations course. Each student was given a hearing test to determine his ability to hear, the Otis Quick-Scoring Mental Ability Tests, Form Fm to ascertain his intelligence quotient, and the Brown-Carlsen Listening Comprehension Test, Form Am as a pre- and post-test.  Pre-test and mental ability scores made it possible to equate groups of students. From the total sample, 2 classes were designated as control, and 2 as experimental groups, and the 4 classes met 3 days a week for 1 hour and 20 minutes. It was concluded that listening ability can be measured objectively, but that a person's ability to listen cannot be increased regardless of his mental ability. The null hypothesis --that there was no significant difference between students who were taught effective listening habits and those who were not-- was accepted. The report contains recommendations for future research on the value of the teaching of listening. (WM)",

The purpose of this study was to examine systematically and empirically the BED curriculum--the student and faculty initiated courses sponsored by the Board. It was found that of the 36 courses given from Winter Quarter 1967 through Summer Quarter 1968, almost 60% were initiated by students. Wide variation in class size was noted. Broad social problems dominated the content of the BED curriculum with the emphasis favoring a theoretical orientation over specific application of theory. There were no significantly peculiar patterns of course enrollment size  in terms of the 3 course initiator groups--the Center for Participant Education (a student group), faculty, and students. Neither class size nor course load (estimated in terms of unit credit per course) significantly affected grades. Higher grades were earned in student initiated courses. BED courses showed significantly higher grade point indices than comparable undergraduate courses across campus, but in terms of course initiators and broad academic fields, the grade point indices of BED courses were not significantly different. Appendices contain course descriptions and tables. (JS)",

About 500,000 poor people live in the area, 95% of whom are Negro or Puerto Rican, and almost 50% of these have only a ninth grade education. This new kind of college would educate people, provide park and recreation space, cultural facilities, and low-rise, low-cost housing. It would function in new buildings, architecturally designed to mix with existing structures and filling in vacant lots or replacing deteriorating buildings. The college would be community-operated, open 12 months a year, 6 days a week, days and nights, for all community dwellers who  either have high school diplomas or can pass a set of special tests built around the college's curriculum. The college experience would provide (1) a skills studio for practice and instruction in verbal and mathematical skills, (2) an internship program that combines study and work in particular fields, (3) a liberal studies core that relates economics, psychology, science, and other traditional subjects to basic social and human problems as they are seen by the college's students and faculty, and (4) a professional studies core, for concentration on skills in a chosen profession. The report also contains a blueprint that illustrates the design of the proposed facility. (WM)",

A college education, once a matter of free choice, is now a twentieth-century imperative for social and economic mobility. Modern students, frustrated by the inescapability of the college experience, observe such anomalies as poverty amidst wealth; war-related activities of a university that denounces war; the ugly reality of racism and professional rhetoric about human unity and dignity; and professors for whom students are not a primary concern, and have decided that middle-aged adults are the culpable parties for the current state of affairs. The use of repressive administrative power should be replaced with more  patience, firmness, decisiveness, and participatory campus democracy to establish a cohesive institutional climate that is not conducive to student unrest. Teaching arrangements are needed which provide a sense of intimacy and shared purpose for students and faculty, such as short-term, problem-oriented interdisciplinary institutes. Students would then be able to alternate periods of learning and independent study, and professors could alternate intensive teaching and the study, research, and consulting demanded of them by contemporary society.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to determine the usefulness of 2 measures of student quality, high school percentile ranks and ACT composite standard scores, in predicting the first-year academic success of freshmen entering Wisconsin State University (WSU) at Stevens Point. The average high school percentile rank for the 2,172 entering freshmen in the fall of 1968 was 61.3. The 424 students who were dropped for academic failure after 2 semesters had an average high school percentile rank of 43.7; students remaining in college had an average percentile of 65.6. ACT standard scores were available for 2,068 of the freshmen; the average ACT score was 21.28. Students suspended for academic reasons after 2 semesters averaged 19.40, and those remaining averaged 21.72. It was concluded  that the high school percentile rank is closely related to college success and is a good predictor of student quality, but that ACT scores are limited predictors (1 student with an ACT score of 7 survived) and should not be used as a single criterion for entrance to WSU. These findings were compared with others on WSU graduates in 1968 (582) and 1969 (609). The average high school percentile rank for the 1968 graduates was 69.4, and ACT scores ranged from 11 to 30, with a mean of 21.84; nearly 81.1% of the 1969 graduate ranked in the upper half of their high school class, and available ACT scores ranged from 8 to 30, with a mean of 22.10. These findings seem to support the conclusions of the study. (WM)",

The CLEP examinations were taken in the fall of 1968 by 333 University of Washington juniors, all but 2 of whom had previously taken the Washington Pre-College Test (WPC). Three CLEP scores (in the areas of social science-history, natural science, and humanities) and 11 WPC scores were intercorrelated and factor analyzed --using a computer program described by Kaiser in 1959-- to reveal whether CLEP scores increase the factorial complexity of the WPC battery. Study results revealed  that while the CLEP General Examinations are valid indicators of educational achievement, they do not measure anything uniquely different from that measured by the WPC battery and should be used with caution for evaluating liberal arts curricula. Students who score well on pre-college tests may achieve better in the liberal arts areas covered by the CLEP examinations, since they may be more intellectually curious and highly motivated. However, the CLEP natural science examination scores for this sample of juniors is just as predictable as scores for vocabulary or reading comprehension tests taken 3 years earlier. (WM)",

The predominant policy combines music and academic requirements, but some institutions have separate music --or only academic-- requirements for freshmen who have chosen music as a professional career. Admission criteria range from an open door policy at most state institutions to selective evaluation and personal scrutiny at private colleges. The institutions surveyed included junior, tax-supported, and private colleges, private and tax-supported universities, and a theological seminary. The names used in the study for music settings within an  institution were Department, School, Conservatory, or Division of Music, but responses indicate that there are 6 other titles also in use. Recommendations to improve current music admission practices include the use of standardized titles for music settings, the inclusion of comprehensive music questions in the College Entrance Examination Board Test for all students, the shifting of responsibility for counseling musically-oriented high school students from counselors to music educators, less rigid academic admission standards for talented music students, and the establishment of admission policies that coincide with institutional philosophy and objectives.

The data suggest three generalizations: (1) the students tend to do what they say they will do, or something closely  related to it, during their first year; (2) lack of follow-through may be caused by a change of mind by the student, a change of policy or opportunity presented by the college, or a change in the choice of college or goals; and (3) when appropriately evaluated, SPS data can help colleges plan for, as well as counsel, entering students.

In 1962, eight regions were surveyed to determine job opportunities, on-the-job training facilities, and the probable degree of industry cooperation.

General studies requirements vary  greatly among the colleges, although all require English and physical education. In the business area, math is required by most, followed by advertising and sales. In the technical programs, all but one require a basic course in food production. The Council of Hotel, Restaurant and Institutional Education committee recommends academic credit for internship only in the transfer program (six hours), while the colleges allow as much as 18 credit hours for on-the-job experience.

Homogeneity was found on the measure of Adaptive-Flexibility--subjects scored more in the middle range on this measure than populations of normally functioning adults who had taken the test in earlier studies. On the Omnibus Personality Inventory, the  patterns of response showed high impulse expression and low cognitive orientation. Standard deviations of mean scores on this instrument were lower than those of comparison groups. Generally, the kinds of data obtained from this investigation do not suggest the quality of heterogeneity usually ascribed to junior college students. Further research is suggested to determine the degree of heterogeneity or homogeneity, and on what variables.

        "description":"A review of pertinent materials showed American junior college presidents seldom assume the responsibilities of educational leaders, but rather merely function in the capacity of educational administrators. To further investigate this problem, a 10% random sample of 912 colleges listed in the 1968 \"Junior College Directory\" was selected; the sample was stratified by enrollment size and source of control. Documents, including statements of policy produced by boards of trustees, job descriptions of college presidents, and presidents' annual reports to boards, faculties, and/or students were examined. Findings indicated that at most junior colleges there was no formal definition of the president's responsibilities; there were no written statements of official board policies;  presidents did not periodically report to trustees, faculty, or students; and, typically, presidents were not responsible for, or address themselves formally to, matters of educational leadership. Ten steps board of trustees can follow to develop their presidents into educational leaders were suggested: provide a job description for president; require him to relate all expenditures to student learning; seek out new people for president's position; rotate office holders; allow president to delegate authority for fiscal management; allow educational experimentation by president; let him take articulation initiative; let him upgrade his education; support institutional research; and ask the president pertinent questions.

Holland (\"The Psychology of Vocational Choice,\" 1966) proposed an a priori occupational classification of six categories: realistic, intellectual, artistic, social, enterprising, and conventional. These classes were defined in terms of the six Vocational Preference Inventory (VPI) scales having the same names. Holland calculated a profile of VPI means for 4-year college students with specified occupational plans. An occupation's coded profile defined an occupation's place in the classification. In developing this revised classification, 20,313 2-year college students were added to Holland's sample of 4-year college students; data for some employed adults were also  included. In contrast to Holland's classification, in which the arrangements of subgroups within a major class had no special meaning, here the major classes and subclasses were arranged according to a hexagonal model that indicated inter- and intra-class relationships. Student occupational aspirations were arranged within the model according to their psychological relatedness. The classification has potential applications for vocational guidance, industrial personnel work, and for research in education, psychology, and sociology. (MB)",

The study included data on the 48 foreign students who have attended or are attending Kapiolani Community College from September 1964 to the present. The students were required by the college to show English proficiency by an interview with the registrar, by taking the School and College Aptitude Test (SCAT), or by submitting a Report of Proficiency in English. The percentage of academic failures (withdrawals or dismissals from college) for the two groups of  students was 16.7% and 35.0% respectively. Findings included: the degree of English proficiency was closely related to academic success; the majority of temporary visitors had their visa status changed to that of student; and the three measures of English proficiency used by the college yielded similar results. It was recommended that, if the college maintains an open door for foreign students, it must provide a sophisticated remedial English program; if a relatively closed door is to be maintained, then a better measuring device is needed to select those who will attend. In either case, some action is necessary to assure these students of academic success. (MB)",

Further work to attain the Doctor of Arts in College Teaching would include an academic year of full-time teaching followed by participation in a post-teaching evaluation seminar, consisting of a critical evaluation of a written log and terminal report, and an oral doctoral examination by the candidate's doctoral committee.

Criteria included students' first-year-college GPA and a community college survey relating to students' educational plans and experiences. The students came from a group of 687 who entered three Washington State community colleges in fall 1967 after completing the CGP and WPC batteries; 44% were females and the mean age was 18. First-year-college GPA's were collected for 631 students, and 354 students completed the survey. Interest measures from the CGP battery were  combined with high school GPA's and aptitude scores (WPC) to predict first-year-college GPA's and responses to the survey. Findings included: traditional aptitude and achievement measures predicted academic performance as accurately for 2-year as for 4-year college students; performance in vocational and academic courses could be predicted by the same measures; nonintellective criteria appeared to be unrelated to intellectual criteria and predictors; and nonintellective criteria could be predicted where there was an obvious link between the criteria and the predictors. The unpredictability of college experiences was attributed to the lack of appropriate predictors rather than unreliability of the items. (MB)",

Factors related to the successful use of computers in industry and having relevance for colleges included: extensive executive involvement; a positive environment for change created by the chief executive; the application of computer systems to a broad range of problems; and an adequate staff to support the system. Factors inhibiting success in both industry and education included: duplication of existing manual systems rather than analyzing total information needs; an underestimation of  computer costs by the chief executive; and a lack of awareness, and therefore a sympathy, among personnel for total organization needs. The success of computer systems at junior colleges depends upon administrators: actively participating in the creation and development of the system; realistically appraising the cost of the system, including the computer itself and supporting staff; and critically assessing the benefit in terms of expenditure. To meet these tasks there is a pressing need for college administrators to develop a stronger understanding and appreciation of computers, their costs, capabilities, and potentials. (MB)",

The criteria show how close he has come to the program's objectives and the ranking of individual performance. Vocational education programs susceptible to evaluation are listed and relevant evaluative techniques discussed. Graduate interviews concerning job, school, or other plans, can relate the question closely to the program. Career follow-up studies, going beyond mere placement to identifiable changes in the trainee's work life, can reveal a program's success or failure. Seven basic achievement tests (Ohio Trade and Industrial Supervisors Workshop 1958), on different trades, are simple but useful tools. Official licensing exams are less so, for they assess the student's total  education, not a specific program. Industry advisory committees, properly interested in successful programs, are quick to recommend improvements. A systems approach requires breaking goals into analyzable units, to aid both definition and solution of problems. Geared specifically to student vocational needs, accreditation helps maintain program standards. Self-initiated evaluation is most pertinent to local program study. Changes in the trainee's self-image and motivation demonstrate a program's effectiveness. Evaluation criteria apply to structure, process, or product; on-going evaluation allows quick adjustment of facilities/funds to any program's objectives.

The suggested plan was comprised of the following steps: isolate and discredit SDS leaders before they establish a following; alert students in advance of expected attempts to disrupt instruction; take a &quot;hard line&quot; with demonstrators; initiate reform in the area of faculty-student-community relationships; develop an imaginative and interesting community service program; provide  a relevant curriculum; and listen to potential supporters of SDS and accede to reasonable demands. The report also included a series of documents pertinent to the problem of campus disruption. [Not available in hard copy due to marginal legibility of original document.] (MB)",

        "description":"This report presents a rationale for the individualization of instruction, an examination of applications of these methods in elementary and secondary schools, and some implications for individualization within junior colleges. Innovative techniques used by elementary and secondary education and junior colleges were found quite similar; the following were common to all: programmed instruction, learning centers, team teaching, and audio-tutorial techniques. Within elementary and secondary education, however, the philosophy of individually prescribed instruction is emerging, providing for each student lessons based on his own needs and talents. The technique includes: a sensitive and complete battery of diagnostic tests, placement on a learning continuum on the basis of these  tests, and personal prescription of assignments according to behavioral objectives theory. The result is student growth in terms of learning and sense of individual participation and worth. Junior colleges share with elementary and secondary education the concept of the \"open door\" and the accompanying problem of how to provide for all who present themselves for education. The achievement spread of students at junior colleges is greater than that found at any of the preceding grades; therefore, so is the need for individually prescribed instruction.

(An exception is the Vocational Education Act, which provides some personnel funding.) The need for auxiliary technical and teaching personnel is also evident in the teacher's burden of routine work. Depending on background and ability, the aide could take over housekeeping, clerical, data processing, and mechanical chores, operate audiovisual equipment and produce its materials, and even have some interaction with students, as in testing and interviewing. It appears that the use of auxiliary personnel could improve both instruction and research in the junior college. The benefits cannot be accurately predicted--the aides must be  appropriately trained and their use evaluated. Their employment would be worth considering as an innovation in itself, and would give the teacher time to be innovative in other areas, to redesign curricula, and generally to pursue academic excellence.

The administrator must (1) plan for change, (2) stimulate faculty into taking initiative, (3) involve faculty in planning and implementing innovation, (4) grant released time, (5) provide funds, (6) emphasize evalualtion of new projects, (7) provide supportive equipment and personnel, (8) continue to support instructors even if their new ideas fail, (9) require faculty to plan their projects and to  submit progress reports, (10) foster an innovative climate in the college, and (11) see how the organizational structure influences the innovative spirit. Each college must plan, develop, implement, and evaluate its own innovative practices; for mutual stimulation, it should also work with other colleges where possible.

Student politics no longer retain only their traditional liberalism, but include many philosophies--idealism, revolution, conservatism, reaction, etc. Four traits shared by the activists were a desire to master frustration rather than conform, a will to change society, a tendency to introspection, and a willingness to risk future success for immediate ideals. The author relates the history and goals of several of the more radical groups, their activities on the campus, and their nationwide impact. As they extend their influence from the university to the junior college, administrators must prepare for them by understanding the reasons for their demands and adopting policies to prevent violence.  Clear grievance procedures and recognition of due process would head off most disruption. Of possible reactions by a governing board--confrontation, confusion, and confidence--only the last could treat the problem with reason and judgment, being open-minded to honest dissension and condemning anarchy. The author concluded that administration must (1) learn more about the student's academic and private life, (2) appreciate non-cognitive and non-verbal behavior, (3) drop its authority in loco parentis, (4) cultivate trust in the student, and (5) grant him more say in planning his educational future.

Programs using students to recruit the disadvantaged at the elementary and junior high school, high school, and community levels were reviewed. Student-to-student programs in the area of retention included the following: recruitment/retention (programs which not only recruit but also retain by providing work in basic skills), tutoring, counseling, financial aids, curriculum advising, and extracurricular activities. Follow-up programs focused on job placement or dropouts. In establishing student-to-student programs, the following questions should be considered: what types of student should be encouraged to participate; should the programs be  organized by the administration, faculty, or students; should participation in the tutoring and counseling programs be on a paid or voluntary basis; and should students be included on advisory committees or merely participate in student-to-student situations. Other factors deserving consideration include: (1) some programs, especially extracurricular activities, must be conducted subtly to be effective; and (2) programs to assist disadvantaged students heighten the awareness of these students of their problems and the college's commitment to help them.

During the summer of 1968, letters requesting information relevant to the objectives stated above were sent to the chief administrators of 624 colleges having enrollments of at least 500 full-time students and to 52 officials representing state junior college agencies and associations. Responses indicated a workshop for new deans of instruction would be desirable. Suggestions relating to the content of the workshop  included: an assessment of the problem of improving instruction; the need for more adequate guidelines to coordinate instructional programs and promote learning; workshop sessions should not take a \"nuts and bolts\" approach; lectures and visits to college facilities were not considered particularly functional; a combination of structured discussion, case, and in-basket items should be planned; and participants should provide in-basket items that reflect critical problems at their institution.

Individual members had to know education laws or where to find them and were not to make binding decisions outside the board. Among the favorable opinions were that lay boards are representative and responsive, are outside party politics and the spoils system, provide program continuity and management economy, and operate  openly and responsibly. Principal objections were that they are involved only part-time and are subject to pressure from special-interest groups. Recommendations for improving their composition and function included (1) higher qualification for membership, (2) broader membership, (3) outside advisors and other information resources for the board, (4) closer communication with professional educators, (5) more contact with state and federal lawmakers and professional groups, and (6) more community support, service, and funds to offset members' part-time operation and permit them to enlarge their activities beyond regular board meetings.

Among the findings of those interviews were: five of the eight colleges felt their advisory committees were effective; five out of eight students in these programs felt the work experience helped them more than regular classes; students felt the work could be more effectively planned; and work experience (not necessarily through  junior college programs) was positively related to academic achievement at the 4-year college. It was concluded that these programs provide a great service to the community and there is a trend among junior colleges to continue and expand them. Recommendations included: only work stations relevant to student objectives should be selected; advisory committees should be encouraged to participate more actively; counselors should prevent students from entering programs without interest in the occupation; and coordinators of college programs should obtain feedback from high school programs.

A case for  changing the purposes, methods, and criteria of faculty assessment was presented in part two. It was suggested that faculty evaluation, as a tool to improve instruction, must relate to instruction as a discipline with the focus placed on the effects of instruction, an approach that may result in the development of team teaching techniques and evaluation among instructors on the basis of teaching effectiveness alone. The problems in specifying criteria for assessing teacher effectiveness, a rational for using student achievement of learning objectives as the main criteria of teacher effect, suggested designs for assessing instructors, and a scheme for supervising instruction were presented.

Not only is it required for most students, but there are few, if any, automated aids for composition instruction or theme grading. This scarcity can be met most logically by use of paraprofessional aides, able to do more than handle materials, machinery, or clerical work. They could arrange field trips and small-group projects, tutor individuals, and (as lay readers) grade themes and confer with teacher and student about them. Students who teach and help other students generally improve their own school work. Such aides, perhaps degree holders or junior college graduates, can perform extended duties, e.g., counseling, even more important in college than in high school. The author offers a program for  developing these aides. English departments should: recruit them from the total community (even eliminating the obstacle of certification); capitalize on the energy released by relating learning to teaching; encourage the self-scrutiny induced by helping others; urge the aide to work into the professional rank; appreciate the special relationship between student and aide; provide such opportunities as in-service training for the aide's career advancement; adjust professional roles as the aide's responsibilities increase; use the teacher's creative time thus released; recognize the creative student energy released by the new program.

Pertinent literature indicated that evaluation, to be meaningful, must be integrated into the development of the course. Requisites for evaluation included: stating course objectives in terms of specific student behavior; evaluation of objectives in terms of student relevance; and determining measurable behavioral changes students would exhibit. Since, because of its loose structure, a rigorous  evaluation plan could not be applied to this course, the new plan allowed for course revision as well as evaluation. The plan was comprised of the following developmental stages: stimulate staff to take action by preparing pertinent curriculum data; formulate specific behavioral objectives; establish a way to account for specific behavior of students; delineate teaching techniques that provide motivation, outlining goals, organizing instruction, and grading assignments against an established criterion; develop a pre- and post-test instrument tied to the objectives; and design a student evaluation tool.

Besides department and course objectives, college and instructional goals, student characteristics, administrative procedures, etc., the new faculty member wants to know the norms assigned to his role and expected by his group in this subsystem of higher education. A faculty recruited from so many backgrounds tests the college's ability to correct deficiencies or to delete or change values contrary to its image. To do this, the college must make its norms known, provide both rationale and motive for any change, and confine its  concern to students, college, and community. Values are ranked as: primary--those the college must impress on new members; secondary, not shared by all the staff, perhaps even contentious; tertiary, possibly antithetical, certainly without general support. Factors shaping these values are: group interaction, a ranking member of the system, continual reinforcement and support of the value, encouragement rather than mandate, exposure of both sides of the issue, arousal and satisfaction of a need, points of agreement rather than difference, and credibility of information source (whether peer group or superior). Essential to success of the process, of course, is cooperation of incumbent faculty. (HH)",

For the past two years, counselor assistants and student tutors have helped the regular faculty. In 1968, student tutors were assigned to help students, both regular and developmental, in English, math, and life sciences. The director of research, asked to evaluate both programs to see if tutoring should replace remediation, made it a joint effort with a psychology instructor, who had been asked to assess the tutoring program. Questionnaires were sent to students, student tutors, and instructors in the remedial program, and to students tutored in regular English classes. Despite rather sketchy data, these conclusions seemed  warranted: students, student tutors, and instructors all felt the developmental program was helpful and should be kept; the tutoring program cannot be evaluated at present, but the tutored students felt benefited; GPAs tend to drop in the first semester but to increase in the second semester after development work. Recommendations included: continuation of tutoring in both remedial and regular programs; further evaluation of tutoring in the regular courses; retention of developmental studies, with four changes in admission procedures; initiation of small-group discussions in the remedial program to aid self-development.

Overall results are given here; other results will appear later. By 1960, the many observations included: 54% valued their courses most highly; 35% valued their counseling; 4% found no experience outstanding; most looked back with favor. In 1966, other points were noted: 61% said college had and 36% said it had not helped them reach their goal; 34% said they would change course if they started again; 66% said they would not change. Of the dropouts, 42% said they had felt uncertain of or dissatisfied with their progress. The report discusses many other points, such as  persistence, academic achievement, degrees taken, careers pursued, average income, attitude change or otherwise. Most of the men saw college as an essential step to a vocation, status, and income; the women were less ambitious. Although many of the men had changed their career objectives, 72% were satisfied with their current jobs. The principal conclusion was that instruction and counseling, though good, must become even better. This includes stimulating student motivation, constant evaluation and revision of courses, and continued feedback from current and former students. (HH)",

Following a review of the unsatisfactory status of present curricula, a rationale and proposal for providing more adequately for students' total needs were presented. Desired changes within general education offerings include opportunities for students to become acquainted with the requirements of their future employers; to participate in on-the-job training programs; to develop cognitive skill, attitudes, and self-concept during in- and out-of-classroom activities; to become acquainted with aesthetic, literary, and  intellectual areas; and to develop community awareness. In addition to the evaluation and modification of course offerings to insure up-to-date, relevant curricula, other aspects of the total college environment that require attention and change include: the physical plant, the nonclassroom environment, the attitudes and procedures of the counseling, teaching, and service personnel, and classroom structures. Desirable outcomes that may result from these innovations were discussed. (MB)",

Each of the 76 participating students was assigned five addresses within an integrated, middle-class community. The interview questionnaire that they administered consisted of personal background items and attitudinal items that related to the topics of race relation, civil rights in general, civil rights leaders or movements, and civil rights  legislation. In advance of the interviews, a letter was sent to the residents of the selected addresses informing them of the project. Evaluation of the project indicated that the project was worthwhile for the students; in addition to enjoying the interviews, they found the experience of participating in an actual social research project enlightening and rewarding. It was concluded that the project was a useful teaching instrument and served to enhance the introductory sociology course. (MB)",

The personality characteristics of presidents of campus organizations affiliated with one of four distinguishable student subcultures, identified by previous research as vocational, academic, collegiate, and nonconformist, were measured by the Stern Activities Index. The index contains items to measure 12 factors of personality: self-assertion, audacity-timidity, intellectual interests, motivation, applied interests, orderliness, closeness, submissiveness, sensuousness, friendliness, expressiveness-constraint, and egoism-diffidence. Student leaders of the nonconformist subculture groups were omitted from the analysis because of the low frequency of response. Comparisons among  the remaining groups were made for each of the factor means by the use of &quot;t&quot; tests. The significant differences found among the leaders were: (1) collegiate leaders scored higher on closeness and friendliness than the vocational or academic leaders; (2) on expressiveness-restraint, collegiate leaders scored higher than vocational leaders; (3) vocational leaders scored higher on applied interest than academic leaders; and, (4) academic leaders scored higher on motivation than collegiate leaders.

Whether caused by inaccurate counseling or by poor self-descriptions from the college, these cause student dissatisfaction or failure. This study, to see if admission officers' perceptions of campus climate as presented to the school counselor accurately represent the college environment, asked if (1) differences existed between the college press as seen by students and faculty and as presented to high school counselors by admission officers and (2) differences perceived by admission officers are intellectual or non-intellectual. From a 2-year and a 4-year college, 43 students, 39 faculty, and 10 admission officers were randomly selected. They were tested by the  College Characteristic Index of Stern and Pace on items of policy, impression, procedure, attitude, and activity. The perception of college environment by the officers differed greatly from that of students and faculty, on both non-intellectual and intellectual items. The admission officer, tending to stress the college's positive attributes, may be partly responsible for the misconceptions held by counselors and high school seniors. A repeat of this study by officers on their own campuses could lessen the misunderstanding and increase the accuracy of their presentation. Future studies could examine the officer's personality, academic training, length of service, and whether campus experience narrows perceptual differences. (HH)",

Legislation, resulting from current social dissatisfaction, calls for publicizing postsecondary, real-world education. Teachers and students can fill this need by educating the public on the value and nature of offerings at community colleges. Two research designs were presented. The first, for developing a public relations program using college staff, students, curriculum, and facilities, proposed that the college establish local instructional TV and radio networks that include both broadcasting stations and learning centers to draw the college and community closer together and educate the public in the skills of community development. The faculty and students of  the education, political science, and work experience departments would coordinate the effort although the total college and curriculum would be involved. An 8-step plan to implement the program, with responsibilities and objectives outlined for each step, was provided. The second research design presented a way to analyze public knowledge, attitudes, and interests regarding adult education and training via a survey questionnaire, with sample included. The survey would help to publicize adult education to appropriate groups and the findings would guide the design or revision of course offerings. (MB)",

A questionnaire was used to help develop a model to predict attrition within the first term of enrollment. The junior college student has been shown to be generally lower in academic ability, less committed to abstraction, and from a wider socioeconomic range. The final persistence model was to be evaluated against this complexity. Data on factors influencing withdrawal were sought among academic, environmental, and social personal items. The academic included high school record, scholastic ability, and first-year college grades. Environmental factors  comprised peer pressures and social interests, and the college cultural climate. Social personal factors included age and time of entry to college, sex, socioeconomic status and degree of family support, family values as shown by occupation and education, personality traits and human relations, and such personal items as motivation, marriage plans, conflict of goals, and family attitudes. These data indicated three possible directions for Phase II of NORCAL: (I) discontinue it; (II) continue to emphasize attrition prediction, using these data combined with earlier research; (III) continue, with any of several possible new emphases. A combination of II and III seemed most likely at time of writing. (HH)",

The literature indicated no common definition of adult education except that it involves lifelong learning. One source identified five forces causing adults to seek further education. They are: basic education, degree objective, occupational training, homemaking education, and avocation and geriatric courses. Unfortunately, development of adult education programs at community colleges is often frustrated by such factors as resistance by those presently controlling evening adult schools, apathy resulting from the usually limited offerings of vocational or college credit courses, and the problem of defining the community's needs. There is considerable variation in the offerings of adult  education programs at community colleges; some offer only regular, credit courses while others offer non-credit, short and/or special-interest courses as well. One aspect of these programs currently being developed is community service, which attempts to solve problems of both persons and organizations by involving both college and community resources. It was concluded that, while the community college is the institution best suited to meet the challenge of adult education, most colleges are primarily concerned with the transfer function, and thereby prevented from developing their unique and innovative role in the lifelong learning of the community.

The experimental group was chosen from those required to take the 8-week program before admittance to the college; the control group, from regular students whose academic load was limited to four courses. The pairs were matched by college board scores within plus or minus 20 points. After the summer session, students from the experimental group were enrolled in the regular session. At the end of the first semester, GPA's for both groups were analyzed by a t-test. The analysis showed that  the experimental group surpassed the regular group in academic achievement, though not to a significant degree. The author concludes that the summer program is therefore worthwhile. He recommends (1) that the developmental program be continued, (2) that a follow-up study be made at the end of five years to see if the difference between the groups remains the same, and (3) that similar studies of wider scope be made to confirm or refute these findings.

Articulation with high schools, contacts with other agencies, and the mass media were of little help. The idea of a central, off-campus counseling center was abandoned in favor of the Mobile Counseling Center. It began operating in 1967. Its aims were to provide service for dropouts, whatever the cause; extended counseling service for the community; stronger connections with other agencies; easy access to material on educational programs, upgrading courses, financial aid, career planning; a decrease of frustration by working with the client in his own environment; individual and group counseling to foster valid  decisions; a better college image; and recruitment of students. Staffed by a counselor-driver and clerk, the van is limited to the area where most of the disadvantaged live; it works as an extension of the regular college counseling service. Other agencies welcomed the unit. It did not duplicate their work, but removed a specific service from their load. A modified therapeutic approach helps the client first identify his need (job, school, or both) and choose from several ways of filling it. The author discusses referrals, interviews, client characteristics, and how to orient to a career those who live amid unemployment. The author's evaluation and the response to a questionnaire show a high degree of success for the center. (HH)",

The students themselves have exposed certain shortcomings of higher education, and taxpayers have become reluctant to support it. Activists of all races have not yet announced limits to their militancy; nor have authorities set limits to their reaction. For some time, the confrontation produced an escalating compromise of demand and concession, but lately, as the demands become harsher, authorities become less patient, and the public condemns both. Matters on which students question society at large include the imposition of prolonged adolescence, the widening gulf between the educated and the uneducated,  repression (contrary to all civil rights laws) of the Black community, the presence of ghettos and barrios, the acceptance of war as a political tool, and a nationwide atmosphere of hypocrisy and immorality. Most important is the Black revolution, with its new sense of pride and expectation of social and economic fulfillment. The speaker reminds the graduates that, since it is they who have fomented these revolutionary activities, it is they who must suppress, accommodate, or surrender to them. Such criticisms acknowledge the importance of education and the probability that improvement will follow from a belief in legal equality, civil rights, open-door colleges, and the efficacy of an aroused social conscience.

It was designed to see if the GATB would predict GPA for first-semester freshmen in transfer and in vocational programs. Three hypotheses were tested on 203 transfer and 88 vocational-technical students. Details of the sampling and data analysis are given. Two pertinent findings were: (1) certain aptitudes from the complete battery are fair predictors of academic success for freshmen entering a transfer program; (2) they are less successful predictors for the entering vocational-technical students. One implication is that, when two aptitudes are combined for the transfer student, a respectable  predictive validity results. It is a useful counseling tool, especially as it takes less than 15 minutes to administer both subtests. Others should duplicate this research to find predictive validities of special use to their own colleges. Validities for the vocational-technical student were low; using an overall category to predict GPA's would not contribute to the accuracy of prediction for either group. Further research is needed for the technical student to isolate the more homogeneous career fields if the GATB is to be helpful to him. (HH)",

In a college of 1500 students. In a college of 1500 students (51% in vocational programs, 49% in transfer), 50 were randomly selected from each group. All 30 transfer faculty, 27 vocational faculty, and 12 administrators were included. The test used was Pace's College and University Environment Scales, with 150 true-false statements on all aspects of college life. Its five scales describe a college climate: Practicality, Community, Awareness, Propriety, Scholarship. All possible between-group comparisons were made on each scale, except for comparing academic and vocational faculty with each other's  students. Among the many findings were: Awareness was ranked highest by four groups and second only by the vocational students; for all groups, Practicality, Awareness, and Scholarship were highest and Propriety lowest; Community was Lowest for all except administrators; academic and vocational students differed greatly only on Practicality; Practicality ranked second in three groups, first in one, and third in another. After discussing their implications, the author suggested two ways to use the findings: (1) to achieve a more harmonious campus, after analysis by faculty, administration, and students; and (2) to enable high school students to select the college most appropriate for them.

The significance of this discovery is that purchasers can avoid paper manufactured in such a way as to be auto-destructive. This investigation explores the collective use of color spot tests to distinguish stable from unstable book and record papers currently being manufactured in the United States. The value of this type of testing is derived from its ability to separate quickly good from poor quality paper from the standpoint of useful longevity. These test results are qualitative, not quantitative, in nature. Thus, for example, while the acidity spot test will indicate the presence of acidity, it will not determine the exact amount. The spot tests  for groundwood, acidity, alum and rosin can be applied to papers quickly by anyone without special equipment or training, with due caution in regard to handling the chemicals and interpreting the results. These tests only require small areas of a paper sheet, thus eliminating damage to large quantities of paper. A summary of instructions for using these tests is given. (Author/RM)",

Phase I is concerned with the materials of a library as individual records (or documents) and as representations of certain works by certain authors--that is, with descriptive, or bibliographic, cataloging. Discussed in the report are (1) the history, role, function, and objectives of the author-and-title catalog; (2) problems and principles of descriptive cataloging, including the use and function of \"main entry\", the principle of authorship, and the process and problems of cataloging print and nonprint materials; (3) organization of the catalog; and (4) potentialities of automation. The considerations inherent in bibliographic cataloging, such as the distinction between the\"book\" and the \"work,\" are said to be so elemental that they are essential not only to the effective control of library's materials but also to that of the information contained in the materials. Because of the special concern with information, the author includes a discussion of the \"Bibliographic Dimensions of Information Control,\" prepared in collaboration with Robert M. Hayes, which also appears in \"American Documentation,\" Vol.20, July 1969, p. 247-252. (JW)",

The CRT used was a low-cost entertainment-quality television tube, and hence had a very poor deflection band width. Settling time for the CRT system was about 10 microseconds. A technique was developed and made operational which displayed a whole dot-matrix character in a time which was less than one settling time of the display system. It is an application of the existing technique called sinusoidal scan to the display of dot-matrix characters. A data compression technique was also invented and implemented. It allows up to a 75 percent reduction in the  size of the stored character tables which are normally associated with dot-matrix displays. The technique involves a digital algorithm which fills in dots between given dots in a matrix. This technique proved quite effective in producing good quality characters, and is economically attractive. (Author/RM)",

Learning tasks were designed to facilitate the child's grasp of concepts critical to mastery of the perceptual-cognitive dimensions of beginning reading. The tasks were also designed to generate both analytic and synthesizing perceptual-cognitive styles to acquire basic structural dimensions. Children were pretested and posttested on word recognition, word generalization, and comprehension in sentence and paragraph reading. Of 63 children who completed the program, 46 learners scored 96 percent on the  unit recognition test of reading competence. On word recognition, the total group recognized a mean of 95 percent of all words used. On word generalization, the total group scored a mean of 84 percent. A mean of 93 percent was obtained on sentence reading; and in paragraph reading, means of 92 percent and 81 percent were scored on word recognition and comprehension, respectively. The high word generalizing and comprehension levels suggest the effective involvement of cognitive processes through the analytic-structural approach. (DO)",

        "description":"The ethological approach may become an important methodology in the developmental studies of children. The ethological approach takes into consideration the total world of the child, social and cognitive, when the child's development in that world is analyzed. Information can be obtained both from studies of other primates (for example, the study of the social behavior of monkeys) and from the study of the behavior of children. Examples of the latter include (1) a study of hierarchization in first grade boys, in which it was found that the boys could structure social relations earlier than physical relations; (2) a study of the staring encounter in nursery school and first grade boys, which showed that the nursery school boys did not have a concept of a dominance hierarchy but  that the first grade boys did; and (3) a study in cooperative picture drawing, which demonstrated that boys in the first grade would more often integrate their efforts while girls at that age would either imitate each other or draw independently. In this last study, there appeared no sex differences in the way the drawings were done by nursery school children; all were primarily individual efforts. (WD)",

Testing at the end of the first year of this study showed the control group scoring significantly higher on academic tests than the experimental group, this result being expected because of the extra year of formal education received by the control group. Test results after the second year showed no significant differences between the two groups, but the experimental group children appeared to have the faster growth rate. At the end  of 3 years, testing again resulted in no significant differences between the two groups.

The subjects were 137 mother-child pairs of Negroes, who ranged in SES from middle class to lower-lower class. The mother was observed during a structured interaction (with her child), in which the mother attempted to teach her child a block sorting task. For purposes of data collection, the task was divided into sections or \"situations.\" It was found that the degree of informational specificity in the mothers' communications varied both with social status and with the sections of the task. The middle class  mothers generally scored highest on specificity. Sharp differences in the amount of meaningful activity between mother and child were found for (1) stimulating or enriching activity, (2) complex or abstract activity, and (3) teaching desired behavior, rather than just eliminating undesired behavior. The data favored the higher SES mothers. (WD)",

The observation form called for an observation about every 5 minutes, about 36 observations per visit. Although all the data on the American babies have not been completely analyzed, some results are available. The early environments of the Dutch and American babies were different. The Dutch babies were kept in a cool room and dressed more heavily than the American babies, who were kept in warmer rooms. The Dutch mothers spent less time responding to their babies than American mothers but did tend to respond to boys more than girls. The feeding schedule for Dutch babies was more rigidly structured and the  feeding time was shorter than for the American babies. It was found that those babies in the Dutch sample whose mothers performed the most actions towards them tended to do less negative vocalizing. U.S. babies tended to make more pleasant vocalizations than Dutch babies. The Dutch babies sucked their thumbs more than U.S. babies. The relatively infrequent interaction of Dutch mothers with their babies and the lack of visual stimulation in the babies' environments do not appear to produce any damage in the Dutch children, however, contrary to the predictions of some theorists.

Is this discrepancy due to a lack of learning proficiency on the part of Negro children or to a lack of learning opportunity? In an attempt to answer this question, 48 lower class Negro children and 48 upper-middle class white children from kindergarten, first, and third grade were given (1) a paired-associate (P-A) task, (2) the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, and (3) the Raven Progressive Matrices test. The latter two tests are used to measure intelligence, while the P-A task measures learning proficiency. The test results showed that the white children performed  significantly better than the Negro children on tests (2) and (3). The P-A data showed a small discrepancy between the two groups (diminishing in magnitude with increasing grade level) which suggested that the tested Negro children should have learned as well as the white group. Lack of skill in learning tactics appears to be the main handicap of these children as they continued to improve on P-A tasks with practice while the other group did not. Instructional programs that are concrete, explicit, and specific offer the most to lower class children who need skill mastery. Tests to measure learning proficiency must also be developed. (WD)",

Part II of the study was divided into two conditions: (1) the child named five  objects, and (2) no names were given. Eight new objects were added to the five and the child was asked to find the original five. The results indicated that (1) the sorting processes of the 8-year-olds were more homogeneous than those of the 6-year-olds, (2) the older children used more groups and recalled sorting better, (3) naming objects improved recall of the objects for 6-year-olds, but did not specifically help the 8-year-olds, and (4) categorization induced the 6-year-olds to notice new aspects of an object but to ignore previously noticed attributes of the objects, while 8-year-olds simply ignored the attributes of the objects.

It was hypothesized that (I) bilinguals would perform better than monolinguals on all three tasks, and (II), that for  all subjects, task (1) would be easier than (2) which would be easier than (3). Both hypotheses were supported by the gross data. It was found that bilinguals, although better at using names in relational statements, were not better than monolinguals in the use of common names alone nor nonsense names alone. Also, bilinguals performed consistently better than monolinguals where nonverbal pointing responses were required, but not where spoken responses were required.

        "description":"An educational issue today concerns the quality of teaching in preschools. Many additional preschool teachers will be required in the next few years to meet the increased enrollments in preschool programs. Not only must proper training programs for future teachers be designed, but it has been noted that most people now teaching preschool children have not had proper training for the job. Personnel and training crises are currently relieved by: (1) federally funded institutes and fellowship programs, (2) the Regional Training Office for Head Start programs, (3) technical consultants who visit classrooms, and (4) itinerant trainers who are experienced preschool educators traveling through remote communities demonstrating techniques and skills. However, programs that provide  inservice education unfortunately provide only minimal contact with classrooms. Evidence reveals that new teachers need help in their classrooms from trainers who can answer concrete \"how to\" questions. Emphasis should be transposed from inservice training to inservice helping. Colleges, universities, professional associations of preschool teachers, etc., should explore and refine inservice helping strategies. Expansion and strengthening of the Regional Training Office of Head Start would increase the inservice helping resources already available. (WD)",

It was assumed that the effects of social, cultural, and economic factors on a preschool child are mediated in a large part through adults closely involved with the child's life. One hundred sixty Negro mothers and their 4-year-old children, representing four social status levels, were selected as subjects. Observations of the subjects and questionnaire data showed that maternal behavior and physical environment do influence the child's early cognitive and academic development. Children were affected by (1) degree of crowding in the living quarters, (2) use of home resources by the mother to aid the child's cognitive growth, (3) amount of time a mother  reads to a child, (4) mother's participation in outside activities, (5) mother's feelings of effectiveness in dealing with life, (6) regulation of behavior strategies used by the mother, (7) maternal teaching style when attempting to show the child how to do something, (8) mother's affective behavior, and (9) to some extent, the mother's own language facility. To the extent that these factors affect the child's cognitive development, they appear to include the motivational and other abilities involved in learning to read. (WD)",

Preliminary evaluation of the data from the observations indicated a marked heterogeneity in the subjects with regard to verbal facility, cognitive development, and quality and nature of object relationships. Poor correlation was found between degree of verbal facility and level of cognitive development. The children fell into three groups: (1) probable future academic achievers, (2) probable non-achievers, and (3) difficult-to-predict. Group (1) showed concern over state-appropriate developmental issues, a minimum of conflict regarding earlier stages, and a capacity to move toward an integrative resolution, and showed superior cognitive differentiation. Group (2)  manifested minimal concern over development, substantial conflicts regarding earlier stages, and disintergration. Group (3) showed varying degrees to both good and bad characteristics. There is wide variation in the individual personality development of the disadvantaged. Explanations of underachievement, measured only by cognitive and/or language factors, is adequate. There is a great need for study on the relationship of the socialization process during the first four years of life to later academic achievement. (WD)",

Group III were given the same task as I and II, but received no feedback. Group IV did not have any task practice between testing sessions. All children were pre- and posttested with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, and given a transfer test, the Edwards Multiple Categorization Test, after the training period. The results showed that although Group II happened to have a higher mental age than Group I, the performance of the two groups on the concept identification task was not significantly  different. The performance of Group I on the transfer test was superior to that of all other groups. Although the population was small, and the program content was insufficiently challenging to provide definitive results, it appears that preschool children are able to look at feedback as information and to profit from such guidance in concept identification.

These findings indicated that adjusted children in kindergarten exhibited greater conditionality on a simple discrimination learning task than maladjusted pupils under a process of continuous mild verbal punishment for every undesirable response. Of the 224 children randomly selected with stratification for sex, 30 were chosen for each group (adjusted and maladjusted) on the basis of extreme scores on three personality scales, the Problem Checklist, the Behavior Checklist, and the Minnesota Scale. The experimental task itself involved a choice between a picture of a human and a picture of a toy with a verbal &quot;that's bad&quot; from the  examiner contingent on each toy choice. A subject's score was his increase in human choices from his first to his fourth block of 25 trials. The influence of several intervening variables was evaluated: verbal reinforcement as an effective punishment (significant and cummulative in effect); correlation of mental age, as reasured by the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, to task score (insignificant); examiner effects (insigificant); and correlation of task score to socioeconomic status (insignificant). A reevaluation of the data after the study partially supported the main hypothesis. (MH)",

Five groups of approximately 30 preschool children each were tested three times with a battery of instruments. The instrument package, broken down into seven subsets, was designed to test a variety of developmental tasks. The appendixes describe the instruments used. Disadvantaged groups of children performed at lower levels in all measured areas of cognitive functioning, contrary to the investigators' expectations. Therefore, areas of serious deficit must be identified and tasks designed to build and improve  these areas. The effects attributable to Head Start seem to be those changes which occur during the first weeks of any formal school program. Improvement in self-concept occurred in two of the five groups, which may be attributed to the integration of disadvantaged with advantaged children in those groups. Advantaged children are currently excluded from needed programs. Economic criteria provide an inaccurate basis for the allocation of funds to equalize educational opportunity, thus funding should be allocated according to the needs of diverse groups. (DR)",

The experimental group performed significantly better than the control group, especially in the Auditory-Vocal Association and the Vocal Encoding subtests. The subjects were randomly distributed (control and experimental groups together) into first grade classes for training in the Ginn Basic Reader.

Factors examined were the educational, job-skill, and housing needs which affect the natives; their bush culture which includes sharing and consumption ethics and a derogatory attitude toward status seeking; and heavy drinking, a predominant problem among the natives. Some recommendations were: (1) an adult education program stressing the value systems of town life should be established; (2) the Trappers Association should be  revived to provide equipment and encouragement to natives more suited to trapping than town life; and (3) a summer's work program should be instituted for teenage native males.

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine the reasons for variable success in relocating Eskimo families from rural areas of the northern territories of Canada to southern centers of industrial employment (railways, mining centers). The data were collected by interviewing 105 Eskimos, both male and female, married and single, who had migrated south. The findings revealed that Eskimo men were considered valuable workers by their employers, but because both men and women lacked comprehension of informal rules governing behavior in southern communities, they had difficulty in adjusting to community life styles. This sometimes resulted in excessive drinking by both sexes, deviations from &quot;normative&quot; behavior, and a desire to return to northern home settlements. Inadequate housing and kin  obligations were found to be other reasons for returning home. Some of the suggestions made to help the Eskimo assimilate were: (1) provide instruction in proper behavior in realistic terms; (2) provide adequate housing; (3) implement a seasonal employment scheme in view of long-term benefits; and (4) to permit self-sufficient Eskimos to phase from their special status as ward of the government to the regular status of a Candian worker.

Twenty i.t.a. demonstration classes representing various socioeconomic levels were established in the Stockton Unified School District and Tracy Public Schools in California allowing educators to observe the program. The second objective was accomplished by establishing 18 i.t.a. experimental classes and 20 Traditional Orthography (T.O) control classes. The same basal readers were used by both groups and both were administered the same array of tests. Results of the experimental  i.t.a. group showed achievement significantly above the T.O. control group. However, it was concluded that it was to early to make any definitive conclusions regarding the use of i.t.a. with bilingual disadvantaged children and that a second year of the project should provide more definitive information.

This library was set up as a demonstration center for small, rural schools throughout the nation. Included in the surveys conducted were: (1) an inventory of present instructional materials in Deer School Library and in 4 school districts in the county; (2) an investigation to determine what would be an adequate collection of instructional materials to meet needs of Deer School's educational programs; (3) an evaluation of Deer School  Library's present library services, and (4) a comparative table of course offerings in the county's high schools, grades 7-12. Among the conclusions drawn from first-hand investigations and observations of other schools throughout the U. S. were (1) not all schools visited were providing exemplary library service; (2) the personality of the librarian and staff appeared to be more important than the materials available, and (3) libraries were over-crowded, and, in most instances, additional space was being planned. The concept of a Saturated School Library was found to be one which provided guidance to a multi-media program of instruction which pervades all activities within the educational program. The services and materials of the Model Saturated School Library are discussed.  (CM)",

A parental sample of 1096 households and a sample of 738 students were independently drawn. The two samples provided 66 instances of overlap response from heads of households and high school students from the same family. It was hypothesized that a youth subculture or \"contra-culture\" serves as a more important socializing agent in forming attitudes of students toward minority groups than does parental attitude and influence. Chi-square and correlational techniques were utilized in analyzing the obtained data. Results indicated that there  was little evidence of \"contra-culture\" influence and that student attitudes toward minority groups were in general the same as those held by the adults. It was concluded that strong family influence on children's attitudes toward minority groups still existed in these 2 rural areas. Related information is contained in ED 024 514. (EV)",

A two-day conference was then held, during which recommendations were made as to future direction in migrant education. Major strengths of the observed programs included a high percentage of bilingual staffs, assimilation of migrant children into school activities, and good vocational programs. Major weaknesses included a shortage of qualified teachers, a lack of an adequate definition of the migrant child, and generally inadequate materials. It was also observed that methods of recruitment of migrant school-aged children into schools varied both within and between states. In addition, very few examples  of curriculum modification were observed, resulting in teachers relying primarily upon relating textbook materials to experiences of the migrant child. Recommendations included an improvement in transfer records, the development of multi-county projects in migrant education, the initiation of continuous inservice training programs for teachers, and an increase in supplemental services especially at the Federal level.

Data were obtained from a sample of 388 ninth and tenth graders and their parents selected from 10 schools in 3 geographical areas (East, Middle, and West) in Tennessee. The students were selected on the basis of rural residence and residence in the same dwelling as both parents. The interviewing procedure involved 3 questionnaires for the sample. It was found that expected length of schooling was significantly associated with level of living (LOL) for Tennessee boys and girls and their mothers and fathers. The financial help expected by  boys and the expectation of parents for giving financial help to sons and daughters for schooling was also related to LOL. However, boys from all levels tended to expect more financial help than parents expected to give (girls anticipated less). More youths in the high LOL group expected to graduate from college and to continue professional study; their parents encouraged this expectation. The data of the study indicate the imporatnce of level of living as related to the educational and vocational plan of rural youth in Tennessee.

        "description":"The research concerned differences within a basically rural low-income population on changes for social mobility. Mobility potential referred to differential chances for moving from a status of economic dependency to one of self-sufficiency. Two aspects of mobility potential, individual and situational, were conceptualized as influencing movement through mobility channels. Socioeconomic, demographic, and attitudinal data were collected in structured interviews with 231 female AFDC (Aid For Dependent Children) recipients selected from welfare roles in 2 Mississippi counties. Correlational analysis was used to compare the interview data with scores on a five-item index of mobility potential. Comparisons indicated that the AFDC population was generally homogeneous in socioeconomic  status and life styles. However, differences between high and low mobility potential groups were found on the following psychological characteristics: (1) individuals with high mobility potential were not adjusted to their present life situation, showed a desire toward conformity to general societal norms and values, and had greater feelings of isolation than those with low mobility potential; and (2) individuals with low mobility potential were adjusted to their life situation and placed great value upon security.

Their achievements are indices of the degree to which they have acquired essential skills for employment, social adjustment, and self-fulfillment. A questionnaire and interview guide were used to assess whether or not the graduates (384 interviewed) had entered and completed continuing education programs, and to examine other characteristics of the sample. Three out of four graduates continued academic or vocational programs after high school and, out of those, 2/3 completed their programs. Only 7% of the graduates finished college, while 44% completed vocational-technical programs. At the time of  the interview, more than six years from the time of high school graduation, 2/3 of the females and 3/4 of the males investigated were gainfully employed in occupations ranging from clerical and service occupations to craftsman and professional positions. Of those who left continuing education programs, inadequate finances, military service, marriage and pregnancy were cited as the most common reasons. Graduates also answered questions on factors and forces influencing them in high school that encouraged or discouraged continuing education. Overall, it was noted that language problems, rigid curriculums, and cultural differences prevent the Indian from making an even more effective adjustment to modern society. The questionnaire and interview guide used are included in the appendices. A  related document is ED 026 195. (RT)",

Both tribes presently have trust funds derived from the sale of land, and use the monies for the benefit of their tribes. The State is responsible for the basic education of the Indian children and provides 3 reservation schools through the fifth grade; from the sixth grade Indian children are sent to the nearest municipally operated grade school, and tuition is paid for students at any high school within the State. Exceptional students may have their college tuition paid by the State. The tribes also qualify for  certain state and federal welfare programs. There is little governmental power vested in various elected tribal officials since the tribes do not possess any real type of municipal organization, but additional responsibilities have been delegated to them since 1963. The tribes are confronted with employment problems and receive continued State assistance to improve their conditions and opportunities. (DB)",

Emphasis is placed on reading from left to right, training in letter-sound correspondence, training in sound discrimination, and training in blending; in short, emphasis is on decoding procedures. Hearing sounds accurately is important in producing the sounds orally or in writing. Critical ingredients of clinical management of dyslexics pointed out are one-to-one instruction, a multisensory approach, and highly structured material. Instructors who carry on the tutorial work do not need to be  highly trained, and there is no need for additional equipment such as machines and special games.

A second study using high school students found that visual perception and intelligence test scores were highly correlated, indicating overlap of behavior tapped. Results of these and other studies led to the conclusions that, since correlations existed between visual perception and intelligence test measures, visual perception training might raise intelligence test scores  but not necessarily reading scores.

        "description":"A total of 339 pupils from 99 first-grade classes were tested over a 2-year period to determine whether they could pronounce words presented singly, out of context, equally well when they were printed with all capital letters, first letter only capitalized, or all lower case orthography. The Isolated Word Recognition test of the Standard Reading Inventory was used. The scores were significantly in favor of higher achievement on words presented in all lower case orthography. The findings supported the contention that configuration may be important in recognizing words. This support was inferential only in that the data did not refute the idea of configuration; a refutation would have been made if performance in both forms had been equal. The findings gave a mixed interpretation  for the usefulness of modified or augmented alphabetic systems, since the moving from lower case orthography to capital orthography might be viewed as a problem of transfer. There was an average achievement difference of about 25 percent, favoring better performance with lower case orthography. References and tables are included. (Author/MD)",

Examples of these pitfalls are given, along with suggestions for avoiding them. The conclusion is reached that an eclectic approach to phonics should be taken by teachers in order to provide individual children with  the particular help they need in whatever way they can best learn.

Three socioeconomic groups (upper-middle class (UM), upper-lower class (UL), and lower-lower (LL) class) of 20 subjects each were administered the Wepman Auditory Discrimination Test and nonphonemic auditory discrimination tests of intensity, frequency, and pattern. The socioeconomic status of all Caucasian students within six first-grade classes was determined by ratings on the Index of Status Characteristics. A table of random numbers was used to assign the subjects to each of the socioeconomic groups. On the Wepman test the UM group and the UL group performed significantly better than the LL group. On the nonphonemic auditory discrimination  tests, the UM group performed significantly better than did the UL or the LL groups on seven of 12 measures. On no measure was a lower socioeconomic group significantly better than a higher socioeconomic group. Correlations between error scores on the Wepman test and error scores on the nonphonemic auditory discrimination tests seem to indicate that the phonemic and nonphonemic tests measure somewhat different abilities, and the use of combined results is recommended.

The experiences involved the equivalence relation \"the same length as\" and the two order relations \"shorter than\" and \"longer than.\" The subjects were 51 four and five year old children in the Suder Elementary School, Jonesboro, Georgia. Students' verbal maturity, intelligence, and social class ranges were measured by the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Stanford Binet Intelligence Scale, Form L-M, and the Hollingshead Two Factor Index of Social Position, respectively. All children received instruction in establishing length relations between two curves, conserving length relations, and conserving length. The  conclusions drawn from an 18 item conservation of length relations test support Piaget's Theory that experience is necessary, but not sufficient for the development of logical thought. The data suggest that the ability to use the reflexive property is different from and precedes the ability to use the non-reflexive property. Finally, there appears to be little, if any, relation between the student variables, Verbal Maturity, I.Q., Age, and Social Class, and scores earned by four and five year old children on conservation of length items involving the reflexive or non-reflexive property.

Principles which have been assumed in this development are (1) since mathematics is abstract, the process of abstracting mathematics must be well prepared, (2) since mathematics deals with generalities, the variables involved in structures to be learned must be varied as much as possible to encourage generalization, (3) the necessity to take into account the difficulties in passing from the pre-operational to the operational stage. This involves a radical re-thinking of the way of presenting many classical parts of mathematics to young children, and (4) the need to follow the logical mathematical build-up of  natural number and the other number systems in designing the curriculum.

Evidence is given which indicates that the programs may have improved the student's problem solving ability; however, no statistical significance between means for the methods was found. Evidence is also given which indicates that the difficulty that students encountered in solving problems might be due to reading difficulties. (BC)",

        "description":"The Reciprocal Category System (RCS) is an observational system used to record and assess teacher-student classroom verbal interaction. The RCS is composed of nine verbal categories which are applicable to either the student or teacher (and as such are numbered differently, thus producing 18 categories) and one additional category--silence or confusion. The observer records the classroom verbal behavior not less than every three seconds by placing the number assigned to any of the 19 categories (such as number 1 for &quot;'warms' the climate&quot; or number 5 for &quot;responds&quot;) on a tally sheet. The columns of raw data on the sheet are then bracketed into pairs and plotted on a 19 by 19 matrix for a visual representation of behavior patterns and the frequency of their occurrence. The matrix  is also used to determine percentage relationships among patterns, flexibility of classroom behavior, and the occurrence of behaviors in any of the four submatrices--teacher-teacher, teacher-student, student-teacher, and student-student talk. As a research tool, the RCS permits the conceptualization and measurement of many verbal behaviors; as a training tool which sensitizes teachers to subtle and uncommon verbal behaviors, it aids in producing teachers who are able to control or plan verbal behavior and who can use the RCS for feedback in their own classrooms.

Three successive methods of individualizing instruction for large groups of students which were developed by the University over the last decade are capsuled: student completion of a battery of University-developed personality tests, the use of the results of these tests in counseling sessions, and the individual assignment of student teachers to cooperating teachers with characteristics similar to their own. A case history of the development of a junior year secondary  education major who enrolled in a year-long experimental program (with six weeks of pre student teaching classroom experience, pre- and postprogram personality and attitude tests, assessment feedback counseling, and pre- and postclassroom experience video taped teaching sessions with feedback counseling) is presented in the major portion of the document as an example of current methods in practice.

Although recruitment began late, more teachers and principals than were expected volunteered in equal numbers from each race. One of the major goals of the program was to improve both the attitudes and knowledge these professionals had about each other and about children from different cultural backgrounds. Each three-week institute (one in July and one in August) discussed characteristics of the rural Duplin County, problems of desegregation from a Negro child's point of view, and teacher-teacher and teacher-adult relationships. The 161 participants were asked to complete  25 &quot;think&quot; questions during the third week regarding their opinions on racial situations, a feedback questionnaire on the last day which assessed the institute and what they had learned, and a followup questionnaire in December (as part of a two-day review session). Answers revealed that 95 percent of the respondents believed that the institute had helped desegregation proceed more smoothly, and they requested another in 1969; it was also found that participants had known very little about each other as members of the opposite race prior to the institute. The institute was unique in its local character; future ones need to include parents and more extensive followups.

The evaluation is more than a comparison of pupil progress in nongraded and graded classes; other variables are also correlated in the areas of school organization, beliefs and performances of teachers and principals, and influences on pupil progress by grade placement and demographic and community characteristics (as well as by school and educator characteristics). The extensive section on the methodology of comparing students and schools includes a discussion of three evaluation instruments which were developed for the study and which are used to assess the knowledge and acceptance by educators  of nongraded principles (Education Opinion Inventory), the extent to which teachers recognize and accommodate student differences through classroom organization and materials (Nongraded Primaries in Action), and principals' perceptions of their responsibilities and nongraded principles (Principal Interview Guide). Correlations of all variables between graded and nongraded classes yielded insignificant values almost without exception. Conclusions emphasize that differences between nongraded and graded schools are thus not a matter of school organization or certain beliefs and performances of educators, rather greater student involvement and control in monitoring and guiding their own development would characterize a truly nongraded class.

It was hypothesized that there would be no difference in teaching behaviors for those skills developed in the course between student teachers receiving the entire course and a similar group receiving the course except for videotape feedback and microteaching. Subjects were 33 elementary education students beginning practice teaching. Each student was videotaped for 15 minutes before and after the course was administered; pre- and  posttape evaluation scores were tabulated, t ratios computed, and analysis of covariance completed. The microteaching group made significant gains in the desired behaviors on five of the 11 scores as compared to four significant gains for the other group; the hypothesis was not rejected. It was concluded that the minicourse does change behavior of student teachers in their methods of developing questions and conducting discussion, but that the value of the microteaching and videotape feedback does not appear to be sufficient to be needed when the participant is a student teacher.

In most cases supervisory and inservice training needs of  the nonprofessional enveloped most of the professional time and energy that might have been utilized in giving increased service. Three central dilemmas relative to the professional role will require more intensive study: (1) dual demand on the professional to deliver more high-quality service and simultaneously become skilled in the art of supervising the nonprofessional; (2) formulation of inservice training policy that arises from the needs of indigenous workers for intensive training and the needs of professionals for retaining; (3) maintenance and/or enhancement of quality of service and also response to the ever-increasing demand for social coverage.

Operated by the University of Ohio in cooperation with local schools and communities, the project begins with two 5-week summer sessions, during which 150-200 trainees share activities with 25-50 prospective teachers from the university. The major thrust of the project is to motivate deprived teenagers who are enthusiastic about working with children to go to college; however, motivating education majors to teacher in deprived areas and encouraging local school systems to train teacher aides are also important goals. During the  first summer session, trainees are instructed in the objectives and nature of the activities they will be performing during their senior year, when they will spend 1 hour each day with young children as well as 3 additional hours each week in related learning experiences. The activities are in the areas of child development, language arts and number concepts, music and recreation, science, and art and audiovisual materials. The second summer session is spent in Head Start centers under the supervision of center staffs and visiting university teams. The project will be evaluated by a staff psychologist, project director, and research director. (LP)",

The Edwards Personal Preference Schedule and the Rokeach Dogmatism Scale were administered to 16 male and 32 female elementary school teachers before they took the minicourse. Teaching behavior was measured while each teacher taught a 20-minute videotaped lesson in his regular classroom before and after the minicourse. Videotapes were scored by trained raters on six behaviors. Seventeen personality variables  were correlated with the six teaching behaviors before and after the minicourse. For females the number of statistically significant correlations was not more than would be expected by chance alone, but for males there were 23 before the minicourse and nine after. Implications are that personality has relatively little effect on the teaching behavior of females but that it has a relatively strong effect on that of males and that training programs such as the minicourse may reduce individual differences in style, thereby partially cancelling out the effect of personality dispositions.

In phase one, objectives for instruction in linear mathematical equations were specified for first-grade students and special instructional materials were prepared. Tutorial skills were identified with these specific objectives and materials (using an evaluation-revision strategy) and were formulated into tutoring techniques in phase two. Phase three of the study was concerned with a number of tests of the validity of the identified tutoring techniques. In one test, 16 first graders who had scored low on a pretest were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups, the tutors of one group having been trained  and the tutors of the other having received no training. Both groups used the same instructional materials and were allotted the same amount of time. Results from a posttest indicated that the effectiveness of trained student tutors was greater than that of untrained tutors. These findings were similar in two further tests. It is hoped that further tutor training will be approached empirically and that appropriate, generalizable tutorial skills will be identified and validated. (A five-item bibliography is included.)

From a sample of 128 elementary school student teachers, those who scored in the upper 25 percent and those who scored in the lower 25 percent on the Dogmatism Scale (Form E) were identified as the study population. Each subject taught for 8 weeks and then rated himself and his supervising teacher on teaching effectiveness with the Teaching Inventory Form, described himself with the Teacher Personal Characteristics Inventory (TPCI), and selected from the TPCI the five characteristics most essential to effective teaching. Analysis of data significantly supported the  hypotheses that closed-minded (more dogmatic) student teachers would rate themselves higher and their supervisors lower on teaching effectiveness and would describe themselves in more positive terms and with less variability than would open-minded (less dogmatic) student teachers. Evidence also supported the hypothesis that open- and closed-minded student teachers would not differ significantly in their selection of essential teaching characteristics. The results indicate that ratings of self and superordinates are, in some respects, a function of the perceptual-cognitive style of the rater. (LP)",

To measure the effectiveness of tutoring on the progress of pupils needing remedial reading instruction, postremediation performances of pupils receiving teacher-plus-tutor remedial instruction and of pupils receiving only teacher remedial instruction were compared in eight schools. Pupils who were tutored scored significantly higher on the postremediation tests, and pupils who were reading close to the acceptable level on initial tests were helped more by teacher-plus-tutor instruction than by a teacher  alone (possibly because a teacher without a tutor must concentrate on the most deficient pupils). In addition, tutored pupils outperformed untutored pupils on a mid-term test on 14 out of 15 items. Modifications have been made in the tutoring program on the basis of finding that some pupils were not receiving all of the practice exercises and that tutors needed more training in certain skills. A final report will contain detailed accounts of tutor training procedures and program installation procedures as well as final pupil reports. (LP)",

A section on \"Descriptive Analysis\" presents a series of guidelines (questions indicating the kind of information to be obtained) for analyzing three basic categories of contents in curriculum documents: (1) decisions and recommendations, (2) justification for decisions, and (3) forms of presentation of decisions and recommendations. Separate guidelines are listed for the general (school, department) and specific (course, unit, daily activity) levels of planning. A section on the \"Evaluative  Approach\" is a description of three sources of criteria for judging the quality of curriculum plans: (1) a view of curriculum planning as an organizational process; (2) a theory or point of view about learning and instruction; and (3) models or rationales which identify the types of curricular decisions, the relationships among these decisions, and the bases on which decisions should be made.

During the project's first year (1967-68), television lessons, which had been planned during the summer by committees of teachers, were broadcast once a week to teachers in participating schools in the fields of science, mathematics, and social sciences. (Language arts skills permeated all the lessons as the &quot;interweave&quot; tool.) The lessons illustrated an inquiry approach to teaching, and their viewings in each school were followed by seminars led primarily by members of the planning committees. The planning committee for social  studies also developed four instructional tools, including a simulation game in economics for primary pupils. Alterations have been made for the second year of the project in scheduling and lesson format. For example, subject matter lessons now use an interdisciplinary approach, and other lessons are available on innovative practices such as nongrading. The effectiveness of the inservice project will be determined through systematic observation and reports by principals. Difficulty has been experienced in finding tests which will measure pupil growth under the new teaching methods. (LP)",

One of the nine models, designed by a consortium of Ohio state universities, is directed at six target groups because of the encompassing impact of change in education. The groups--inservice teachers, preschool and elementary preservice teachers, teacher educators, and administrative and supportive personnel--are trained by the college and public schools to work with multiunit, multicultural elementary schools which employ techniques of team teaching and individualized instruction. The training medium is the specification, which is a printed (and computerized) page of instructions about the treatment, materials, and evaluation to be used to train  the teacher in one or more of the program's 2,123 behavioral objectives. The latter are organized according to particular topics and subject areas with five \"contexts\" of the training program--instructional organization, educational technology, contemporary learning-teaching process, societal factors, and research. For example, the behavioral objective of listing factors to be considered in individualizing reading instruction is ordered under Instructional Organization (context), Necessary Training for Instruction (subject), and Academic Disciplines and Skills-Methodology Reading (topic). Progress through the program is determined individually. The model also provides for continuous and systematic evaluation. (ED 025 456-7 are related documents.) (LP)",

A model which would produce knowledge necessary for the understanding and control of teacher behavior, without assuming that there is one behavior pattern for all may be derived from an empirical study of teacher-learner interactions. The results would provide the teacher with information on the probability of various responses  occurring in a given situation; yet this general frame of reference could be altered to accommodate the particular strengths of teachers and learning styles of students.

        "description":"This study investigated the relationship between the syntactical language development of first grade children and their socio-ethnic status. From a random selection of 160 first grade children, 19 Caucasians with highly developed language abilities were selected from a high socioeconomic stratum to be compared with 19 Negroes with low language abilities from a low socioeconomic stratum. When test scores were compared on syntactical items familiar to both groups, the \"high\" group turned in nearly error-free work and contrasted sharply with the \"low\" group in the number of errors. The low group deviated from the high group most strikingly in errors in subject-verb agreement, especially in the third person singular. However, on three test items unfamiliar to both groups, no  significant differences existed in the number of errors made. These findings indicated the need for the culturally disadvantaged to practice the use of standard English as a second dialect to develop their control over grammatical contrasts. (JB)",

Using as a case in point Roger K. Applebee's article, \"National Study of High School English Programs: A Record of English Teaching Today\" (\"English Journal,\" March 1966), the author suggests that false conceptions and stereotypes are perpetuated by the following questionable research procedures: (1) using a tone of rhetorical appeal in presentation, (2) selecting a population too small to qualify as good random sampling, (3) including only one representative point of view in English education, (4) not clearly defining vocabulary terms which have multiple meanings nor indicating  measurement instruments used in the study, and (5) making misleading inferences and conclusions based on insufficient data. The essay then calls upon English teachers who are intersted in undertaking research projects or experiments in their classrooms to follow established scientific procedures so that their findings can be trusted and accepted.

The following factors, by rank, seemed to influence readers: ideas expressed, grammar, punctuation, spelling, handwriting, organization, analysis, wording, phrasing, and \"flavor.\" These factors reduced to \"general merit\" and \"mechanics,\" in addition to three possible ratings of \"high,\"\"medium,\" or \"low,\" were used to grade monthly test papers of English pupils in 17 high schools for 1 year. From this trial period, a means of measuring student growth in writing ability  was developed.

But, most textbooks give more space to six other language arts areas than to speech or listening activities. The following conclusions about the specific content of speech and listening lessons can be made: (1) Those speech activities emphasized most, in order of rank, are giving talks,  conversation and discussion, dramatization, storytelling, social amenities, articulation, enunciation, pronunciation, and telephoning. (2) In listening content, teaching listening directly ranked highest in allotted space. (3) Creativity, spontaneity, and the use of bodily action in speaking were generally neglected.

Archy, a frustrated artist and self-styled revolutionary muses elaborately on his own fate and comments on the peculiarities and pretenses of his fellow creatures. Archy's messages are heavy with literary and historical allusions. His writings range from angry outbursts on poverty through practical comments on the art-versus-utility theme to satirical references on middle-aged mothers of today.

Specialists in Language Arts and Speech Education planned a program that would begin in first grade and concentrate on three target areas--oral language, linguistically-based reading instruction, and literature. Oral language was chosen because of the view that competency in oral language should take precedence over other language skills. Considered as almost parallel in importance was a beginning reading program that emphasized reading as a decoding process and that used a linguistic reader series. For the third target area, the appreciation of literature, an elementary  literature program modeled on the one developed by the Curriculum Center of the University of Nebraska was planned, using both core and supplementary books. A basal reader program was also instituted to supplement the literature program and to improve essential reading skills. Methods of providing communication about the new curriculum and in-service teacher training were developed. This transitional program will be in effect until the Hawaii Curriculum Center completes materials for state-wide use. (JM)",

At the center of the projected curriculum is the theory that a school should be a microcosm of the world of knowledge and that the curriculum of the school should be a deliberately selected set of disciplines to be mastered. Also fundamental to this curriculum is the concept of private man and public man and the roles of language and literature in shaping man's relationship to himself, society, and the world. Other concepts that affect the curriculum design are a  definition of English as consisting of language and literature, the belief that a student should be able to account for himself in the symbol system he has inherited, a high regard for individuality, and a belief that the child must recognize his responsibilities for shaping the quality of learning. Plans for teacher preparation and in-service education to utilize the new curriculum are being developed through experiences with university courses, NDEA institutes, workshops, and on-school-time training.

The battery of tests was to consist of four parts covering knowledge of language, knowledge and attitude in written composition, knowledge and skill in literature, and knowledge and skill in the teaching of English. The researchers determined content and developed a pool of items for each test. With the help of experts in English, English education, and testing, preliminary drafts of the tests were written, revised, edited, and supplemented with a test administrator's manual.

Field test results and the suggestions of 50 national experts in English and in teaching high school English were used to revise the tests again. The resulting instrument was the &quot;Illinois Tests in the Teaching of High School English.&quot; The researchers concluded that the tests and manual, after further national testing and standardization, would be effective in measuring the degree of preparation of prospective high school English teachers.

Questionnaires were mailed to 2004 randomly selected secondary school members of the National Council of Teachers of English. Results from a 60% response indicated that (1) a large majority of teachers in the sample felt a need for teaching reading in high school and accepted this responsibility, (2) most teachers who gave reading instruction felt inadequately prepared to teach reading, (3) teachers' preparation for teaching reading has not significantly improved in recent years, and (4) better prepared teachers used more recommended reading practices and noted their own  effectiveness in teaching reading more favorably than did those less well-prepared.

An experimental group of 36 future English teachers at DePaul University was compared with a control group of 36 similar students at Loyola University, a school with a parallel English Education program. The independent variable was the special composition course taught at DePaul. The two test instruments developed to measure the effect of the special course were the &quot;Examination in English Composition for Secondary School English Teachers&quot; and the &quot;Scale for Rating Teaching of English Composition.&quot; Although the tests revealed no statistically significant performance differences between the two groups, the  expeimental group, which was below the control group in English grade point total, did as well as its counterpart. The equal test scores apparently resulted from the small sample involved and the complexities of administrative arrangements for the experiment. Since the experimental group improved more than the control group, the inference is that a special course on teaching English composition in the high school classroom would be beneficial for the prospective English teacher.

Information on teaching conditions included the following points: (1) Classes are too large, median daily pupil contact being between 126 and 145. (2) The median  number of English classes per day is five with an average of 29 students per class. (3) The median number of essays written by students per year is 16 to 20.

The acquisition of this grammatical concept was examined using 80 inner-city Negro fifth-graders. Results indicated that (1) learning the sound differences between instances and non-instances of the concept had no effect on subjects learning to effectively use instances of the concept orally; (2) learning to verbalize the grammatical rule which governs the concept did not facilitate concept formation; (3) training on the application of the verbalized rules strongly facilitated the acquisition of the  ability to produce instances of the concept (p .001). The application training was superior to rule learning for low IQ but not for high IQ subjects. The ability to produce instances of the concept did not affect the ability to produce sentences containing instances of the concept. (Author/LH)",

Teachers' written comments on censorship and a list of books, together with the specific objections to the books, were obtained. Implications drawn from the survey were (1) censorship  definitely exists as a problem in junior high schools, but most books were defensible; (2) too few junior high schools have written policies for handling censorship; (3) many teachers fell that administrators would not support them in censorship cases; and (4) most junior high school English teachers are aware of censorship dangers but tend to believe that censorship happens only to others.

Hopefully, pupils would identify with their groups and strive competitively for greater proficiency in the English language. School personnel and facilities, available class hours, the means of grouping, and the emotional reactions of the students were considered preparatory to the development of guidelines for grouping. It was determined that students would be placed in particular groups on the basis of final grades in previous courses. Also, teachers agreed that it was important for the students to maintain a balance between self-confidence and awareness of weaknesses in language. The  results of the experiment, however, were largely unfavorable. Homogeneous grouping appeared to be profitable with advanced groups; but, with less advanced groups, the morale of the teachers and the students was negatively affected and learning was retarded. Perhaps the use of both heterogeneous and homogeneous grouping techniques would effect a better learning situation. (LK)",

The second part explains one formulation of a behavioral perspective--the \"field approach\"--which conceives of the individual as a biological and human entity existing within social and cultural environments. The third part suggests how the field approach can make the political behavior of the American citizen more intelligible by emphasizing the relevance of four factors: political  culture, sociology, psychology, and socialization.

Seven participants at a 3-week workshop in composition held at Kansas State Teachers College in the summer of 1968 took part in a brief, intensive composition course at a level commensurate with their ability and experience. Their completed works were performed by competent players and discussed by the workshop director, the students, and two composers. Evaluation sessions about the values of the composition study were held at the end of the workshop, and the following February, each  participant completed a questionnaire rating his own growth, as a result of the workshop, in 10 specified musical areas. These discussions and questionnaire replies supported the original hypothesis, especially in the areas of understanding the essential nature of music and the creative process. Opinion was divided on making composition a requirement in the music curriculum: some participants recommended removing present requirements to accomodate a composition course, while others felt the course should remain optional.

From this frame of reference the conceptual changes in mathematics, the sciences, and esthetics are reviewed. The paper also discusses the implications of this change for the psychology of human thinking and for children's thinking in particular. Two processes are postulated: \"the expression of possibilities\" and \"the analysis of implications.\" Each process, moreover, involves very different attitudes toward error. Children who are skilled in the analysis of implications but poor in expressing conceptual possibilities have an overly severe attitude toward their own errors and, therefore, may avoid risk-taking, potentially innovative, activities. The\"hardware revolution\" in education--instruction by teaching machines and computers--not only stultifies the process of expressing possibilities but will inevitably lead to increased stress on a curriculum that can be taught by machines. This may in fact lead education back to an overly rationalistic view of thinking processes. (NH)",

Briefly discussed are the experiments and the research design of the other phases of the project--dealing with parents of low achieving students, and with the effects of counseling on such students. Experiment B sought to determine whether positive evaluations of low achieving students by a so-called &quot;expert&quot; (the experimenter) could significantly change self concept of ability in the students and whether such change would show up later in change in school achievement. Analysis of data shows that  there was not significant proportion of changers in either self concept or grade point average.

Data were sought on whether high test anxiety (HTA) children would have lower aspiration levels than low test anxiety (LTA) children. Also studied were the effect on each group of social reinforcement. Another purpose of this research was to ascertain whether there were correlations between anxiety and academic performance (as measured by report cards), and test anxiety and measures of achievement motivation. The research design and the experimental manipulations are described and the statistical correlations are presented. Major finding s show that: (1) success in pretraining raised Ss  initial aspiration level slightly and failure substantially lowered it; (2) aspiration level increased sharply following social reinforcement but remained stable under non-reinforcement; and (3) girls showed a higher overall increase in level of aspiration than boys.

Most crucial is the broadening of attendance areas to promote effective school desegregation. Also important are such remedies for educational improvement as team teaching, a nongraded system, flexible scheduling, independent study, a continuous progress curriculum, and flexible facilities.

It was hypothesized that: (1) L-group subjects (Ss) would have lower self concept than M-group Ss; (2) the greater the discrepancy between actual and ideal self, the greater possibility of low self concept; (3) L-group Ss would tend to be more creative; and (4) those who are more fluent, flexible, original, and elaborate are also likely to be more creative. Forty Ss were given the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking, Figural Form A, and a specially developed Self-Referent questionnaire. The major finding of the study is that the L-group scored higher on all aspects of creativity than the M-group. One possible explanation is that middle class children live in a more  highly structured milieu than do lower class children. Therefore, the lower class child has the opportunity to develop his creativity through the nature of his unstructured play. (NH)",

        "description":"The New York City teachers' strike in 1968 over the issue of the removal of some teachers in Ocean Hill-Brownsville created an opportunity for a study of the effect of the strike on children's political values and beliefs. Drawing upon a sample of Jewish boys and their parents from an almost exclusively Jewish community, two hypotheses were tested: (1) the boys (aged eight to 12) would have more positive evaluations of Major Lindsay than of Albert Shanker, the union president; and (2) Lindsay would be judged right and Shanker wrong. The hypotheses are predicated on the assumption that children have positive attitudes toward elected, authoritative figures. However, the data disproved both hypotheses. During a crisis the traditional patterns of political socialization are  apparently altered. In this instance there occurred a reversal of the usual way in which children apply learned symbols--there appeared to be a tendency (among the younger boys) to ascribe legitimacy to the illegitimate use of power.

A random sample of third graders was asked to tell stories in response to four pictures. The stories were tape recorded and then transcribed. Cloze exercises were made from passages in the child-developed stories and the textbook, and then given to all 79 third grade students in the school. When scores on the two cloze tests were compared, it was found that 70 subjects scored higher on the child generated passages, thus supporting the hypothesis.

In sum, plans for desegregation ordered by Alabama courts were less effective than those submitted in compliance with Title VI. Orders requiring faculty integration within a school will incur greater reluctance, if not outright resistance, than pupil transfers.

This study typifies the teenage labor force member as being enrolled in school, and seeking part-year and/or part-time work which will yield some income and some work experience. The claims on his time and energy generally  do not permit him to seriously compete for jobs on a promotion ladder. Considerably more information is needed concerning the absolute and relative advantages of significant investment in job counseling services, in placing increased emphasis on vocational education, or in establishing youth placement bureaus closely allied to the school.

The study was designed to help answer questions about the effects of factory and related technological change in displacing workers, in creating recruitment and training needs, and in altering the skills required of persons working on or in connection with industrial equipment during the period from 1962 to 1966. Of the situations studied, 15 involved the installation or modification of automatic production lines; 39 the addition of instrumentation to equipment; 105 metalworking and related equipment; 35 mechanical material handling and moving equipment; 20 packaging and related equipment; 29 assembly and related equipment; and  47 other equipment. Some jobs were eliminated in 259 of the 281 cases studied, with 4,542 workers being affected; however, the survey found that while the replacement of one type of machine by another was accompanied by upward skill changes in some cases and by downward changes in others, the number of no-change cases was numerically most important.

Part I, &quot;General Concepts,&quot; contains an outline of leprosy in general, common disabilities, deformities, and general orientation in rehabilitation. Part II, &quot;Techniques,&quot; is  devoted to a discussion of fundamental techniques which are commonly used in leprosy rehabilitation. Although the educational background for physical therapy aides may vary among nations, it is suggested that they should have completed at least grade 9 and preferably high school.

A series of exploratory studies, using student interviews, questionnaires, and Crites' Vocational Development Inventory (1965) which was administered to a total of 1,285 eighth grade boys and girls and 1,294 ninth grade boys and girls, indicated that the vocational readiness of vocational-technical students was questionable. The study then conducted a series of investigations with high school freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors and focused  on choice-related attitudinal changes, work values, changes in vocational preference, achievement, and the relative effectiveness of the General Aptitude Test Battery at the ninth grade level. Proposed curricular revisions recommended broad exploratory opportunities in junior high school, narrowed exploration in the first year cluster program and specialized preparation during remaining high school and post-high school years.

A discussion of the scope and development of distribution precedes the definition and discussion of several competency models. One author, in presenting a conceptual framework for distributive curriculums, identified four areas of necessarily broad competencies: marketing, social, basic skill, and technological competencies. Data for the study were obtained by questionnaires submitted to secondary and postsecondary distributive educators to identify desired competencies and levels of proficiency, that is, mastery  or acquaintance. Findings of the study indicate that the transition from the secondary level of distributive education to the postsecondary level is in need of considerably more coordination. One basis for this conclusion was the finding that for 12 basic competencies, the high school required a mastery level of proficiency, while the community college required only an acquaintance level. A 70-item bibliography of books, periodicals, and theses is appended. (CH)",

        "description":"Stereotypes about work-bound youth in vocational and comprehensive high schools were examined, using the students' own perceptions of on-going experiences in these two types of schools. Essentially two related stereotypes account for the wide-spread misconception about vocational and comprehensive high schools: (1) Vocational schools are seen as a &quot;dumping ground&quot; for lazy students and slow learners, and (2) Comprehensive high school education is seen as superior to vocational high school education for work-bound youth. Data were collected by self-administered questionnaires from 3,060 students (1,981 boys; 1,079 girls) attending six vocational high schools in as many states and from 1,827 students (890 boys; 937 girls) attending three comprehensive high schools in New England  states. Also data were collected from 2,331 Danish vocational students in 14 schools in order to make comparisons with American vocational students. The findings of the study do not support the &quot;dumping-ground&quot; stereotype for this sample of specialized vocational high school students. Also, the findings suggest that American specialized vocational high school students fare as well in their views of themselves and of the education they are receiving as Danish vocational students who live in a country where vocational education is not considered degrading.

A second phase involved developing inventories of attitudes toward food service employment and administering them to high school juniors and seniors, food service program enrollees, and 300 adults in middle and low socioeconomic segments. In the third phase, short courses were given to two experimental groups of 78 school lunch employees. In the fourth phase, instruments were developed to evaluate training through assessing the quality of service and food. Some findings were: (1) About 5 percent of restaurant and custodial home food service managers and 15 percent  of nursing home food service managers had formal training, while 69 percent of hospital food service managers had training and 25 percent were qualified dieticians, (2) Among a sample of food service program enrollees, statements concerning relations with people obtained frequent favorable responses, and (3) Adults with some food service experience had significantly higher scores on all attitude inventories than those without experience.

Local employment service office managers and area supervisors assisted in designing the goals and purposes of the project, and in deriving the methods of operation and functional position of labor mobility. Of 793 persons eligible for relocation assistance, 282 were successfully physically relocated: 220 intrastate relations and 62 interstate relocations. Only 38 relocations were unsuccessful, 30 intrastate and 8  interstate. Organization and staffing, operations, and the relocation process are discussed in detail.

        "description":"This research study began as an attempt to discover the extent of professionalism and variables (individual, community, school, etc.) related to it among public school teachers. Preliminary analysis of survey data gathered from 3189 undergraduate college students and 9688 public school teachers indicated few relationships of any of the independent study variables to professionalism, and weak interrelations among the different aspects of professionalism. (Most of the related negative results are not presented in the report. The data-gathering instruments and a list of variables derived from them are included.) The principal focus of the research was therefore shifted somewhat, with primary attention devoted to an examination of such questions as: (1) the extent to which, and the  ways in which, teaching is a professional occupation; (2) why teachers are not more professional; (3) why schools are not administered in more professionalizing ways; and (4) what the prospects are of altering the situation. The main general conclusion was that teaching is not a profession, mainly because it is a predominantly feminine occupation. The primacy of family rather than work role orientations among women keeps them from being professional in outlook or behavior. School administrators behave accordingly, so that schools are run bureaucratically rather than through collegial control by professional colleague groups. The resulting atmosphere in the schools affects male teachers, through selective recruitment into teaching of men whose orientations fit the prevailing situation and  through pressures to conform. The situation is not likely to change. (Author/JH)",

That is, how can international education be most fruitfully defined or conceptualized? (2) What should be the major objectives of international education in the schools? That is, what contributions can and should the K-12 curriculum make to the international education of children and young people? (3) Given answers to these questions, what needs to be done with respect to curriculum development, basic research, and teacher education in the field of international education? (4) What intellectual talents and  resources exist for undertaking needed research and development work and how can these be effectively mobilized? To give these questions final and universally acceptable answers was not the purpose of the study. Rather, it was to selectively survey the thinking of American educators and social scientists with respect to these questions through interviews, conferences, and meetings, and hopefully in so doing to lay the foundation for a continuing and systematic examination of needs, objectives, and priorities in international education. It was hoped that the conclusions and recommendations set forth in the study would serve as stimuli and guides to a continuing dialog and exploration as well as to new research and development efforts in the field of international education.

Experience suggests that: development service degree option should be open to students in every field; as many field experience alternatives as possible should be available; core courses should be designed for the development service option; cultural studies  should be organized selectively; and opportunities to acquire practical skills appropriate for developing countries should be given.

Fisher's technique computed the pre-post scores of 108 persons in CCTI groups in Missouri, Ohio, and Hawaii. Data from Missouri and Ohio reveal several generalizations: a more homogeneous staff-participant group in Ohio than in Missouri; the Missouri Institute planned and participated in by Episcopalians, while Ohio Episcopalians only planned; and Ohio participants and staff sharing planning and execution of local change experiences more equally than in Missouri. The California Psychological Inventory revealed that both CCTI's had similar  staffs, but Ohio participants differed from their staff; Missouri participants showed lower scores on sense of well being, responsibility, tolerance and intellectual efficiency. The CCTI was effective in changing self perception of abilities, sharpening specialized analytical vocabulary and increasing aspects of the Semantic Differential Concept. It was concluded that the CCTI approach works with a selected homogeneous group. (Appendixes include the project plan and evaluation instruments. They are available from Rev.

Little evidence of application of knowledge to on the job situations was found.

The program, an institute on problems of school desegregation, provided an intensive educational experience which attempted, during an eight week period, to change cognitive and affective components of attitudes of prejudice among the participants. The study was concerned with the rational-irrational, social distance, and sympathetic identification dimensions of prejudice. Evidence has been presented supporting a fundamental  postulate of the study that attitude change is related positively to participation in an intensive adult education experience. Attitudes of the subjects changed in the predicted direction as related to participation in the institute on all dimensions of prejudice included in the study.

According to the prescribed criteria 14% of the households in Iowa were disadvantaged. The largest portion of the disadvantaged (31%) were located in the large urban areas in cities over 50,000. Fifty-nine percent of the participants were interested in more training; this desire increased with education but decreased with age. There was little difference in training desired by zones of residence; a division into occupational groups showed, however, that the professional group had the most  interest and farmers the least. Training in the areas of metal work, teaching, mechanics, electronics, and drafting were most often mentioned by the total group. Females desired training in licensed practical nursing, social work, office machines, computer programing, and accounting.

The agents were grouped on the basis of short, medium, or long tenure. Data were collected from personnel records of the state cooperative system, college transcripts, and through administration of the Adaptability Test and Strong Vocational Interest Blank. The two criterion variables (tenure and performance) were correlated against 129 independent variables. Analysis of variance was used to determine significance of differences between characteristics. No significant relationship was found between length of tenure and performance, or between adaptability, or overall academic grade point  average, and performance. There was a significant negative relationship between number of academic credit hours in education and agricultural education and the grade point average in psychology for the undergraduate curriculum and performance ratings. Extension agents have vocational interests most similar to farmers, forest service men, YMCA physical directors, and school superintendents. The psychological tests failed to discriminate between more or less effective agents. (pt)",

Major aims are to broaden opportunities for enlistment, equalize military service obligations, assure foresighted military planning, and, through Project Transition, help &quot;new standards&quot; men become productive citizens when they return to civilian life. Minimum performance standards will not be reduced; instead, if necessary, extra time and effort are extended. Project results are monitored in detail. Up to April 1968, 96,639 men had been accepted, most under the new mental standards. Results in terms of graduation rates, conduct and efficiency, promotions, and  assignment to occupational specialties having potential civilian utility have been favorable. Seminars and research have also been sponsored to enhance program success and promote information exchange among military services.

The target groups include older retired persons, youth (especially late adolescents), high school dropouts, workers facing displacement because of technological change, socially disadvantaged groups (Negroes), and the physically handicapped. MYCAC jurisdiction does not overlap with that of the county; this fact has made program coordination difficult because of a relative lack of appropriate  organizations which might naturally join community action in the area, and by the double requirement that it relate its activities downward to 31 local community action committees, and upwards to the Allegheny County community action agency.

The 113 trainees generally had positive attitudes toward people, the desire to help, and awareness of the most serious kinds of problems among families with whom they would work, but tended to lack self confidence. Training involved 40 weeks of formal instruction and supervised practice, including courses on social services, the family, cultural components of service, human growth and  development, and the helping process. As for resulting changes in knowledge, attitudes, and action, those changes relating to social perception were dominant for most trainees in terms of sense of value, and took the form of stages ranging from recognition of other points of view to validation of self with a multiple point of view. Job performance or &quot;output&quot; was generally rated either satisfactory or outstanding. (ly)",

The future viability of the Extension Service is dependent upon developing new purposes and goals. Changes must be made in the responsibilities of service personnel, and in the standardization of policy and techniques. The increased use of extension specialists in the field, and the realigning of district boundaries, would be useful. More use should be made of the tie with The Ohio State University,  particularly through the College of Agriculture and Home Economics.

Robert Theobald, presenting evidence that automation brings job displacement, suggests that we face the choice of trying to insure enough jobs, or of taking advantage of the new free time to benefit from abundance. Seen as needed is a new social philosophy which will justify a different distribution of income and a top level commission is proposed to determine what an ideal educational pattern ought to be in the context of technological reality. John W.C. Johnstone suggests that while continuing education has a role in preparing people to cope with more leisure, those who may have the most leisure (lower class) are the least  prepared to cope with it and the most reluctant to turn to educational pursuits. Jack Weinberg examines man's ambivalent attitude toward the machine and discusses the possible psychological results of the loss of work as the prime vehicle for finding meaning in life. (dm)",

The impact of the population explosion, urbanization, automation, the knowledge explosion, and the Bomb make it imperative that new concepts of work and leisure be built into the culture. The role of the university in meeting these problems remains a moot question. It seems clear that without tension generated from within and without, the university would lose its intellectuality and relevancy. The limits of involvement of the university are debated but its role should at least be training the intellect, demonstrating the importance of lifelong learning, and being a detached societal critic; and it  should avoid the role of a social agency. Within this context careful articulation of the counseling service and a cadre of curriculum specialists seem to offer promise for pushing ahead with an integrated continuing curriculum. (dm)",

A review of current practices shows the most fruitful source of part-timers to be local business and industry, professional colleagues of the full-time faculty, and graduate students. There is little evidence, however, that part-time teachers are encouraged to use their professional competence, that they are accepted as professional equals or regarded as professional assets. Few universities report any kind of training or supervision programs. There is wide variance in the practice of employing part-timers and in the way they are used. A University of Bridgeport program is used as an illustration of an experiment in taking unexperienced interns and introducing them to various  teaching methods. The basic theme of the study is that to prepare a person from another profession for teaching, such a program has to stress theory. Once the basic ideas are made explicit and their relevance discovered, it remains only for the professional to learn to pursue his discipline in an expanded framework of educational theory to become a person worthy of being a college teacher.

The financing of literacy programs, the initial question under consideration, was discussed with relation to both government and non-governmental fund sources. A final recommendation  was that, within the framework of the programme for the Second Development Decade, functional literacy should become a recognized dimension of development planning, both as a social objective and as an efficient tool.

In 1966 the Office of Education assumed full responsibility for its program, which provides reading, writing and arithmetic classes for undereducated adults. The Community Service and Continuing Education program, begun under Title 1 of the Higher Education Act of1965, is designed to strengthen the university's commitment to its community; it applies the academic expertise and resources of institutions of  higher education to the solution of community problems. Civil Defense Adult Education is a joint Federal-State enterprise entirely financed by the Federal Government.

The lack of staff and funds, however, has delayed the accomplishment of the National Advisory Council's responsibility to evaluate all federally supported extension and continuing education programs.

Precedence is given to the development of reading and writing at an early level. The disadvantaged Mexican-American lacks the necessary linguistic experiences in the English language to assure him success in school--evidenced by the large number of drop-outs among this group. Most teachers have been accustomed to \"insight building,\" which has been developed in the child at home through a healthy adult-child interaction. This approach is not applicable to the disadvantaged pupil coming from a home where there is \"limited verbal orientation.\" Because disciplines such as the social studies, science, and mathematics are traditionally taught through  the lecture method with the teacher doing most of the talking, the disadvantaged Mexican-American child is not involved in oral English communication at all. These students need to achieve as much course content as their counterparts, and at the same time overcome their linguistic obstacles so as to be able to compete on all levels of education. The content materials of these courses may be structured to utilize a variety of audiolingual techniques providing maximum opportunities for verbalization.

The primary concern of the Center has been parent involvement, with home visits to the parents by school community representatives before and after enrollment and an Open House in December. This function was well attended by community leaders and other officials, but not particularly by parents, partly, it was felt, because the parents are happy with the Program and do not feel the need to come to the school, and partly because of the expensive public transportation in Chicago. The Puerto Rican community, in which the Center is located, is enthusiastic about the Program. The Mexican community, while approving the Program, resents that a second center was not  opened in their community. Both resent the fact that the Program is limited to the poor; all the children who need it are not included. The non-Spanish-speaking community of European background is, to varying degrees, \"indifferent, resentful, or hostile,\" because bilingual centers had not been provided for their parents or grandparents, who were under pressure to acculturate. There must be, the author stresses, a total community acceptance of a new approach to the education of our Spanish-speaking students and a recognition of their community rights concerning their children's education.

Miller's utilization theory provides a model for setting up categories; Mandler's hierarchical adjustment, a model for establishing hierarchical order. The author hypothesizes a \"repositioning\" or refocusing process for using the categories. The ability to reposition our thinking permits us \"logically\" to let non-count concepts take on countability (the people of the world, the peoples of the world). After repositioning has taken place, we can then view a concept macroscopically as a category unto itself, or microscopically as a unit within a category, or as separate from other categories. Rules governing the  occurrence of \"the / a\" are reduced to: (1) Count nouns in the singular must use \"the\" or \"a\". (2) Non-count nouns and plural count nouns may use \"the\" or nothing. (3) The choice between \"the,\"\"a,\" and nothing depends on the speaker's position (the category he is working from) and his view. Within the non-specific category of \"some\" and \"any\" there are units whose relations in turn are that of general and specific. Lessons should indicate that in the affirmative sentence, we usually speak in terms of parts (I want some pencils) rather than in terms of the whole (I want any pencils). (AMM)",

        "author":["Arapoff, Nancy"],
        "description":"In the last decade an unprecedented number of college-level foreign students have appeared in the United States, competing with native speakers in schools where the only medium of instruction is English. All students at American universities have to do three kinds of sophisticated writing--summarizing in notes, writing exam essays, and writing term papers. The skill of writing, perhaps the most important on the university level, is the one in which foreign students show the least competence or training. It seems erroneous to expect these students to learn to write by learning to produce grammatically correct sentences when native speakers don't seem to learn that way. For the native speaker to become a native writer, he must begin with reading rather than with listening. Data on  the differences between spoken and written English, most discernable on the level of discourse, are essential for adequate materials for teaching writing. In the \"discover and transform\" method of teaching writing described in this paper, the students first read and compare two written models similar in content but different in form. They then analyze the models so they can understand what grammatical and semantic rules operate to transform the first model into the second. Illustrations are from the author's forthcoming \"Read, Understand, Write,\" Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Spring 1970. (AMM)",

He begins by looking at some linguistic data, with particular concern for identifying the relationships which they exhibit. That is, the emphasis is on their interrelationships rather than directly upon the items of data themselves. As he proceeds, he observes how the individual relationships are organized into larger configurations forming networks of relationships, and he finds that the types of relations and configurations of relations observable in linguistic data are also present in cognitional data. It then becomes interesting to view such linguistic and cognitive networks as models of the  knowledge, or of some of the knowledge, that a typical human being has stored in his brain.

For each student, the score on an English  proficiency test was known. Using the criterion of the direct questionnaire, no more than 20% of the students could be considered integratively motivated; and there was no significant correlation between this motivation and proficiency. The indirect questionnaire showed a third of the students to be classifiable as considering speakers of English to be a more desirable reference group.

The relationship between creativity (the basic distinction between language-like behavior and knowing a language) and redundancy has been clearly established. Knowledge of rules is the key factor in creativity and is also the principal factor in the understanding of messages with reduced redundancy. In this paper the author discusses the three techniques that have been employed to test a subject's ability to function with a second language when noise is added or when portions of a test are masked. They are the cloze, clozentropy, and the noise tests. In the cloze test, portions of a written or oral test are blanked out and the subject is  called on to provide the missing word or words. The clozentropy procedure measures a subject's performance in terms of a group norm. Thus, foreign students are scored according to the extent to which their responses agree with the normal responses of native speakers. The noise test originally consisted of a number of sentences to which noise had been added at signal to noise ratios of 1, 4, 7, 10, and 50 decibels. Recently, a multiple choice version has been prepared. The author feels that these practical studies have shown the value of language testing techniques based on redundancy. (DO)",

Only the lower class white children do not deviate from a \"Southern\" dialect. This study also examines the pronunciation characteristics of the higher and lower socio-economic classes within both the Negro and white groups. There are no significant differences between the High and Low Negro groups. However, the pronunciation of five vowels differentiate the High and Low white groups. This result supports the hypothesis of greater  dialect cleavage between socio-economic classes within the white community than in the Negro community. The Negro children shared two pronunciations with the Low white children. The High white pronunciations are \"General American,\" while the Low white and Negro groups give \"Southern\" pronunciations.

He posits the following hypotheses that go beyond Chomsky's view of competence: (1) Thought and language are distinct, and both are involved in performance. (2) Thought is central and language is a symbolic system that refers incompletely to it. (3) Immediate memory works  with utterances and texts; longer term memory works with thought. (4) If (3), then translation will show greater interference across languages than delayed recall. (5) If relating thought and language simultaneously at normal speed and under normal thought density constitutes performance, then exercises that involve such performance should increase learning and motivation in foreign language teaching.

        "description":"Presented is a brief survey of the Structural Approach as it has been introduced in the teaching of English in the non-English-medium primary and secondary schools in Malaysia and a discussion of some of the obvious problems in the implementation of the program. The author assesses the standard of written work produced by students on the various levels, with the aim of determining sensible standards of attainment. He concludes, as a result of this study, that the Structural Approach is difficult to adopt on a country-wide basis. He recommends that (1) research into teaching materials and schemes be centrally located and disseminated to all SEAMEC (Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Council) members; (2) proficiency tests in English at the primary level be oral rather than  written; (3) English teachers, and students who will attend English-medium universities, should have an intensive post-secondary school course of 6-9 months; and (4) the SEAMEC Centre should encourage a two-way flow of ideas concerning local problems in English teaching. Sample compositions by Malaysian students in English-medium primary and secondary schools, and in Malay-medium and &quot;newly conforming&quot; secondary schools, which illustrate the relative levels of attainment in English, appear in the Appendix.

The first two papers are by linguists. The essay \"Foreign Language Teaching Methods in Quasi-Foreign Language Situations\" by William A. Stewart is intended to serve as a general introduction to the problem. \"Non-Standard Negro Speech in Chicago\" by Lee A. Pederson is a summary of a partial study in depth of the Chicago situation and supplies a more detailed illustration of one specific case. The last paper, \"Some Approaches to Teaching English as a Second Language,\" is by an English teacher, Charlotte K. Brooks. Her practical concern with the teacher's attitudes toward non-standard speech and  its users becomes especially meaningful once the linguistic aspects of the situation are understood. What is especially noteworthy, however, is that all three papers express the same basic conclusion as to what should be done. Number 1 of the Language Information Series, \"Second Language Learning as a Factor in National Development in Asia, Africa, and Latin America,\" dates from 1961 and is available from the Publications Section of the Center for Applied Linguistics, 1717 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, D.

More secondary school students are selecting English as their foreign language choice; English departments in the universities are expanding rapidly; the teacher shortage is increasing. One result is a large number of &quot;improvised&quot; secondary school teachers who teach by the grammar-translation method. Their students, upon reaching university level, have problems in comprehension, conversation, and writing. In one effort to remedy this situation, the University of Cantho selects native-speaking English teachers from various English-speaking countries and uses English as the medium of exchange, exclusively. All aspects of the  program of English studies are linguistically oriented. Skills in reading and comprehension, vocabulary and writing are carried over from the spoken lessons--students learn, for example, that punctuation is a representation of the factors of stress, intonation, and juncture. Senior students receive courses in descriptive linguistics and literature. In addition to the language, the students learn about the various cultures of their English teachers. The author feels that social environment can be created around schools as an appendant to the classroom, library, and laboratory. (AMM)",

Former dropouts were used as outreach aides to: (1) contact potential dropouts in the schools, and (2) to assist the student in resolving his difficulty. The study revealed that most students dropping out of school value education and find it personally desirable. This became clear after an attempt to steer students to the Employment Opportunity Center was unsuccessful. Some proposals were: (1) get students and teachers together outside of the classroom to discuss what each of them likes, and (2) schools must pay attention to morality and values. The report is divided into three parts: (1) the Aide Training Program,  (2) the Students, and (3) the Jobs.

The OVIS and DOT relationships are grouped into cubes and subdivided into cells. The OVIS items are brief statements of activities in the cluster of jobs representing an OVIS scale.

For by attempting to alter society in terms of what they know to be the persistent needs of youth, they will make it much easier for the counseling process to be effective. Three assumptions need to be made in considering the counselor as an agent of social reconstruction: (1) a definite relationship must exist between what a counselor preaches and what he is, (2) there must be a willingness of others to listen to the arguments that the counselor can be more effective if he participates in social reconstruction, and (3) the environment in which the counselor lives and works will permit him to function as an agent of reconstruction. Evidence to  support these assumptions include: (1) the development and use of the Columbus Testing Profile, (2) the involvement of counselors with businessmen to set up a program in vocational education, and (3) work being done jointly by vocational educators and state guidance supervisors. Much work remains, however, in the areas of testing and providing quality education for all. Before reconstruction can happen, counselors must be convinced change is necessary. (Author/KJ)",

A systems approach can enable student personnel services to evaluate what they are doing to determine if counselors are making a difference in the lives of students. The characteristics of this approach are: (1) state the real needs, (2) define objectives behaviorally, (3) define constraints, (4) identify and analyze alternatives, (5) identify milestones, (6) implementation, (7) evaluation of the system, and (8) feedback and modification. Systems analysis offers several advantages among which are: (1) it focuses on process with a major emphasis on operations research, (2) it provides for adequate allocation of resources to best get the  job done, (3) it provides a systematic and rational approach to analyzing the problematic situation, (4) it forces analyzers to think through the flow of the problem, and (5) it forces a comparison of alternatives in a complex situation.

Specific problems of students in general include: (1) differences instead  of similarities are stressed, (2) unrealistic scheduling of classes, (3) inability to communicate, and (4) fear of failure. Recommendations to help these students are: (1) emphasize similarities, (2) implement strong \"compensatory\" support programs, (3) initiate pre-college programs, and (4) help students in planning and accepting long range goals.

This study was designed to compare the performance of &quot;mature&quot; students and several groups of regularly admitted freshmen on the College Qualification Test (CQT) and on the fall, spring, and accumulative grade point average. Freshmen were grouped into five subgroups, based on examination results. Findings included: (1) the mature students had the lowest mean scores on four of the five CQT subtests, and (2) the mature students had the highest fall grade point average (GPA), the second highest spring GPA, and the highest accumulative GPA of the five groups. It appears that the mature student's  higher GPA was due to their superior maturity and motivation. While the sample was too small for broad generalizations, one wonders whether the CQT can adequately predict the success of mature students with university work.

Two groups, one with 18 practicum students, and another group enrolled in practicum and also involved in Self Understanding Groups, were formed. The criterion measure for the effect of the Self Understanding Groups was Affective Sensitivity measured by a scale dealing with the feeling level responses of counselors. Evidence indicated that Self Understanding Group participation conjoint with practicum enhances affective sensitivity. Limitations were that the subjects were not assigned to groups randomly and that the sample was small and the groups nonequivalent. Subsequent research should focus on whether participation in  Self Understanding Groups enhances counselor effectiveness on the job. (Author/EK)",

The aim of the study was to determine the worth to student and taxpayer of extending higher education to those of lower-than-average college abilities. Interviews concerning academic abilities, vocational interests, and attitudes were held with participants during their stay in school. Questionnaires were mailed to those who had left. Followup letters were sent in 1966 to all 300 original participants, of whom 194 returned the requested information. A descriptive profile of the General College student emerged. Motivation is a prime factor in the success or failure of the students, calling for continual reevaluation of the curriculum  and instructional methods in order to meet student needs and interests. Students in the survey were almost equally divided among those who might be considered academic and vocational successes, and those whose goals apparently were initially too high for possible success. The author suggests that in addition to curriculum evaluation, the College staff undertake in the very near future a second long-term study of student accomplishment. (CJ)",

As a result, a short term training program for the new \"change agents\" was established. These agents were to be installed into nine selected state divisions of vocational rehabilitation under five-year demonstration grants. The program for \"change agents\" not only offers promise of facilitating much needed innovation but also brings attention to the general problem of establishing new forms of interpersonal relationships into a rather  stable, bureaucratically organized system. Conceptual questions raised in the area of vocational rehabilitation, regarding how to design a mainingful training experience, include: (1) definition of attitudes, skills, and understandings needed; (2) kind of model to be used to give greatest chance of success, and (3) areas of behavioral science to be used for theoretical guidance and training technique rationale. It is hoped that the training plan, if successful, will set a precedent for other states to follow. (Author/CJ)",

It was hoped that evaluation of current guidance programs would enable the different schools to learn from each other, and strengthen their weaknesses. Goals of the committee were to establish a task force to write guidelines for student personnel work, and to set up an evaluation group to study, through opinionnaires, the services and practices available. A modified version of the Raines--Carnegie Study of Junior College Student Personnel Services was administered to about 100 students and all full-time faculty and  student personnel workers at each college. A visiting team discussed results of the questionnaires with each campus group in hopes of identifying good and bad practices. While little questionnaire data is available as yet, it is apparent that the campus centers are taking a critical look at their own procedures. Generally, Maryland seems to be weak in placement and health services, with full-time students particularly aware and critical of the services. (Author/CJ)",

The \"involved\" and \"dissentient\" students cause the unrest. If a university is to cope successfully with the problems of student unrest, the numerous programs and resulting regulations and policies must contribute to the student's educational programs. The \"involved\" student provides \"healthy\" unrest, providing impetus for needed change.  The \"dissentient\" student provides dangerous unrest that can result in violence. The university must then act in self-defense and sever the student-institutional relationship.

Generally, both students, parents, and teachers favor the separateness of the continuation school over the classes within the high school, since smallness and flexibility are absolutely necessary for the success of the continuation program. The program  discusses the student and his lack of motivations, possible techniques and methodologies to be tried, and specific instructional guides which may assist the individual teacher in working with her group.

Undesirable behavior can be  decreased by: (1) obtaining the medical and physical history of each member, (2) discouraging borderline psychotics from participating, (3) establishing rules, (4) keeping membership below 20, and (5) having co-counselor training and participation. Assessment of gains or losses by members can be made using an autobiography, self-rating scales, or sociometry. (EK)",

College Student Questionnaires administered to students in September and again in April indicated that there is great mobility among the students in their subculture membership. The least stable of the subcultures proved to be the one designated as vocational, while the most stable was the one designated collegiate. However, over half the students remained categorized within the same subculture in April as they had been in September. Shiftings between September and April tended to validate the ideal types as defined by Trow. Examination of the  Clark-Trow subcultures promises to be a useful way for college personnel to learn more about their students. (CJ)",

Using Maslow's hierarchy of needs, this study was designed to formulate some guidelines for the vocational counseling of gifted girls and women by ascertaining their developmental need levels. Need levels were compared with those of gifted boys and men. A cross-sectional study was used to determine the developmental needs from 10 to 70 years. Data was collected from 361 gifted males and females. This data consisted of three wishes made by each subject. The wishes were used projectively to reflect the needs and valences of the individuals. Results are given in terms of valences: maturity, fantasy, physiological, safety, love, self-esteem and  self-actualization. Conclusions and implications are that the years 14 and 40 are apparently traumatic for gifted women. By 40, love needs have been satiated and the suppressed cognitive needs come to the surface. At 40, many women find resistance in fulfilling these goals due to age, fear, or other external factors. References and data tables are included. (Author/SJ)",

During the interview, the counselor is himself the means for gathering information about the client. Techniques available to the counselors are: (1) statements about self, and (2) observations of the client's behavior. Research related to these techniques of non-test and self-report data is presented. Implications for practice include: (1) counselors should be familiar with the above techniques,  (2) there is much non-test data available on college campus that counselors could use, and (3) counselors should be aware of the limitations of this data.

Too often, the individual is lost in the machinery of such a school program, and data collected becomes the end product of appraisal and assessment. Programs of student appraisal procedures should be developed around eight essential principles, including; (1) there is no single best appraisal technique or procedure to be recommended for all programs, and (2) student appraisal procedures involve study of the self in the situation--the individual in his total environment. The total process of appraisal would best be stimulated through a satisfactory initial counseling interview. The whole staff must also become involved in the appraisal program. Thus  appraisal services are viewed as an attempt to accummulate and interpret as much information as possible about the student, to provide as much information as possible to the student and to the staff, and to promote better understanding of individual needs.

A level is determined for each of the three areas for each worker function. A measure of emphasis was developed by assigning percentages to weight each factor. The level at which a worker functions in relationship with Things, Data and People together with the weights form a functional profile. In addition to the FJA Structure of Worker Functions' use for determining \"what the worker does,\" the structure effectively defines job classifications. Efforts are being made to develop career ladders to allow for orderly progression as a worker develops in his ability with Things, Data, and People. A classification  guideline can be set up with FJA and company supervisors. These guidelines can form a major factor in the evaluation of a worker. A self report questionnaire would also be used. Highlights of the use of FJA include: (1) inexperienced analysts can determine correct functional levels and weights easily, and (2) a performance appraisal instrument can be developed so ratings are made in direct relationship to functional profiles. Future directions include investigation of worker aptitudes, interests in relation to functional levels. (Author/KJ)",

However, most school-oriented practitioners do not have the time, facilities, or personnel to employ the necessary techniques. After a half day in-service training experience, 14 teachers volunteered to attend a short series of meetings to set up individual treatment programs. Examples of some of the programs are given, including method, data, and results. The behavior to be modified was mostly simple, so as to have a greater chance of success for the teacher. All teachers were able to note at least some change. It is felt operant techniques can be effective in bringing about student,  as well as teacher behavior change. In-service training in this area could prove valuable in providing teachers with effective techniques for changing classroom behavior, and thus reducing the heavy load on school psychologists.

The findings are based on information gathered from approximately 2,000 high school teachers and 300 counselors. The teachers' and counselors' perceptions of the way our high schools are run and the impact of those schools on them are the two points investigated. Davidson, in the first paper, presents a design for the study of boys in their high school environment. Methods and techniques are explained with diagrams included. In the second paper, Johnston's findings include that teachers perceive the actual influence picture in the schools to be very hierarchical with those at the top exercising most of the power. Teacher influence is only moderate and is  limited to the classroom. The third paper concludes that the large majority of high school teachers view themselves as satisfied with their career choice and job. The most satisfied also feel they have more influence than do less satisfied teachers. Rodgers notes, in the fourth paper, that administrators increase counselor satisfaction and their assessment of the quality of counseling to the extent that they are concerned with problems in their schools and are innovative in their approaches to these problems.

Subjects (267) came from a midwestern city, Hawaii, and New York. A study of identifying figures and achievement values was made by an especially developed School Attitude Research Instrument (SARI). A card sort of behavior orientations was used. A subsample was studied by the SARI, achievement and intelligence measures. Achievement was found to be related to the subjects achievement motivation, lack of nonconformity, and relative desire for peer identification. These  in turn were related to parental identification, and to achievement values of close friends. The subjects identified equally well with each parent and with close friends but less well with teachers. Implications for enhancing motivation of low achievers include working with parents, working with subjects and their close friends in groups. (Author/KJ)",

The school is staffed with one instructor to every 16 students and one counselor to every 40 students. To emphasize the developmental aspects of the educational efforts, counselors are called Development Advisors. The development advisors have three facets to their job: (1) aiding the vocational or career development of their advisees, (2) facilitating the learning activities that their advisees are undergoing, and (3) providing necessary supportive counseling in the emotional  and psychological areas. Students are encouraged to work part time at a job that has some relevance to their program. The development advisor assists students in getting these jobs. The development advisor is also responsible for: (1) understanding his advisee and his background in relation to the learning aspects of his program, (2) assessing progress so that goals are reasonable, and (3) helping the student to assess his own progress. No statistics are available now, but plans are to develop evaluative techniques for this program at WTI. (SJ)",

Included in the list of elementary school guidance objectives are (1) aiding academic development, (2) helping children develop health self-concepts, (3) aiding self-understanding, (4) aiding children with vocational development, (5) helping children to cope with complex inter-personal relationships, and (6) alleviating personal and emotional problems. Each of these objectives are explained. While guidance is a point of view, idea, and belief, it is also a function. Some of the key functions of elementary school guidance are: (1) child study, (2) early identification of children with  special needs, (3) counseling, (4) work with other significant adults, (5) career development, and (6) coordination of school and community resources for guidance. Such functions are a must if counselors are to meet obligations to children at the elementary level. (KJ)",

He also considers the functioning of the counselor in a social context, since traditional concepts of agency policy and the role of the counselor as a change agent now are undergoing rapid change. He feels that: (1) regardless of the worthiness of the goal, the means is still important, (2) social change cannot be brought about in a vacuum, (3) legitimate and workable alternatives to disruption must be provided, (4) society must work together rather than become polarized by extremist agitation, and (5) people have a right to dignity within a society which recognizes their individual differences. The author goes on to discuss  those areas where he feels the profession should direct its attention as it seeks to improve the counselor's role in society. As behavioral scientists, counselors have a moral responsibility to evaluate the ways in which their activities affect society. They must ask from whom they derive their authority and to whom should they be accountable. (CJ)",

There are five interconnected functions in counseling roles which provide one with a useful framework for thinking about counseling. These functions are: (1) teaching, (2) behavior change, (3) socio-emotional support, (4) decision-making, problem solving, planning, and (5) advocacy. Each of these functions is discussed in relation to public employment counseling, particularly experimental and demonstration experiences or projects dealing with the disadvantaged. The analysis of the above  functions has described three functions (behavior change, decision-making, and advocacy) which fall within the purview of the professional counselor, one (teaching) within the purview of the non-professional, and one (social-emotional support) within the role of the indigenous worker. Further conclusions are drawn for each of the five functions. (KJ)",

Among the conclusions were: (1) students enjoyed playing the games, (2) students talked about the games outside school, and (3) attitudes were changed as a result of their simulated environments set up in the games.

The teacher must first evaluate the game materials and the simulation model in the light of the abilities and interests of his students. The key to a successful game experience, for both teacher and student, is adequate preparation. The playing session will run more smoothly if the teacher plays the game with several students in advance. The introduction of the game should be as short as possible, conveying two points: (1) the purpose of the game, and (2) how the game operates. The teacher needs to be flexible and imaginative, answering questions on mechanical problems  of the game to insure smooth functioning. The students should discover for themselves the points of strategy. A post-game discussion of: (1) real world events, (2) strategies, and (3) values, is necessary for maximum effectiveness of any simulation game. Simulation games are easily modified to suit the abilities of the players or the objectives of the curriculum. (Author/KJ)",

Among the working aims of IPI are the development of self-directed and self-initiated learners through instructional procedures which provide for self-selection and self-evaluation. The developmental requirements to meet the objectives include the following components: (1) detailed diagnosis is made of the initial state with which a learner comes into a particular instructional situation, and (2) the adaptation of educational  alternatives to the performance profiles determined in the student population. Placement tests are given at the beginning of the year to show the relative position of the student compared to the year's end position. Pre-unit tests are also given to determine which concepts of a unit the child has already mastered. Post tests help to evaluate when the child is ready to move on. (Author/KJ)",

In one group subjects were requested to verbalize their intended behavior change. Primary objectives were to determine if the subjects showed differential improvement by treatment with respect to: (1) school anxiety, (2) severity of student behaviors as rated by subjects, (3) severity of student behaviors as rated by teachers, (4) teacher-pupil relationships as rated by teachers, and (5) teacher-pupil relationships. There  were three major conclusions: (1) counseling with or without public commitment was not found to positively influence the above five criteria, (2) certain counseling \"conditions\" appeared irrelevant to some behavioral problems, and (3) attitudes of teachers who consulted with counselors improved toward guidance while attitudes of teachers who did not consult with counselors deteriorated.

It operationalizes generic requirements for school achievement, and finds them to be derivatives of the analytic conceptual style. Many children from low income homes, however, demonstrate a relational conceptual style. Conceptual styles are found to be effective predictors of academic success when common demographic variables, native ability and general information repertoires are held constant. It is suggested that conceptual styles are developed, stimulated, and reinforced in the user's style of primary group participation. By using those variables, it is possible to predict the development of new response patterns through changes in style of primary group membership, and to explain mixed and conflicting  types of scores as well as polar response types. Conceptual styles are also used to distinguish between deprivation and culture difference, to comment on nonverbal tests of intelligence, and to identify cognitive components in the phenomena of good, poor, under and over achievement.

The assumption that these are the central references in the life space of the adolescent is widely documented in the available research. The basic research question in this study is: Who has the most influence on youth and under what conditions is this influence regulated? The study focuses on the relationship of the adolescent with his reference sets. A total of 1,500 adolescents were sent questionnaires. On the basis of responses to 15 questionnaire items subjects were divided into three groups: (1) parent oriented, (2) best friend oriented, and (3) equally oriented to parents and best friends. Results indicate that the quality of the adolescent's relationship with his parents is an important  predictor of the salience hierarchy during adolescence; the higher the quality of parent-adolescent effect, the higher the pro-parent orientations of youth. Grade level is also seen as an efficient predictor of reference set preferences. The findings also imply that adolescents do not reject parents but rather expand their influence horizons to a larger number and kind of referents. (Author/KJ)",

Attitudes, interests, values, aspirations, biographical background, leadership, and social activity were tested. Significant differences between the two groups had strong implications for their performances in the superintendency. Career bound superintendents saw themselves as more confident, optimistic, and progressive than did place bound superintendents. The decision to become a superintendent was made at an earlier age and at a lower level position by the career bound superintendent, and there was considerable  evidence of career management to reach the superintendency in this group. The decision to accept the superintendency by the place bound group was frequently reported to be the result of being in the right place at the right time. At the time of their hiring, the career bound men more often perceived their role to be action oriented than did their place bound counterparts. A related document is EA 002 420. (Author/JK)",

The study examined the rate of adoption of educational innovations, positions in the social structure of school superintendents, and reference group orientations. The data reveal that: (1) Career bound superintendents are quicker to adopt educational innovations; (2) place bound men are less involved in the social network of superintendents and have lower status among chief school officials; and (3) the reference group of place bound superintendents is formed by their  subordinates, who are not the most accurate in evaluating the superintendents' work.

The tested instrument, the Conntone Music Learning facility, utilizes headphones, has individual student call buttons, provides sustained keyboard tone and perfect pitch of all tones on all keyboards, and permits a shift to classroom ensemble use for as many as 24 students at a time. Findings of the study included a limited number of  significantly positive Spearman rank order correlations for both the third and fifth grade classes, including gain score with posttest and pretest with posttest scores. Project results included entrance into the school's instrumental music program by the majority of children participating in the project and the initiation at San Francisco State College of a teacher training program in keyboard and music fundamentals, utilizing the electronic music learning system.

Tye uses a systems model to discuss equilibrium, resistance, and strategies that facilitate change. Next, Mary M. Bentzen discusses the demands that accompany the principal's role, the conflicts he faces, and how these demands and conflicts might be channeled and resolved. Robert L. Sinclair examines the expression, requirements, and determinants of leadership behavior. Jerrold M. Novotney's chapter describes methods for achieving optimum staff  involvement and cooperation in change efforts. In the final chapter, Donald A.

The assimilation of growing numbers of uneducated, unskilled, and minority group immigrants in the face of declining physical, fiscal, and leadership resources is the basic problem confronting cities. The ghetto is populated by individuals possessing insufficient educational and occupational tools to manage in an urban setting. Although the schools are increasingly called upon to solve this problem, planning for building and staffing schools is frustrated by burgeoning and shifting enrollments. The difficulties of getting competent teachers into the ghetto aggravate the crucial problem of the concentration of large numbers of students with serious educational deficiencies.  Today we have reason to question the old assumptions that school systems should remain isolated from surrounding institutions and that lay boards of education insure reflection of the public will in school policies.

First, neighborhoods are asked to fully analyze their problems. Then they must develop a set of approaches, priorities, and goals that constitute their response to local conditions. Finally, the neighborhoods must create an administrative structure that will pull together the various elements in the community to attack problems in their full breadth. Recognition should also be given to the fact that education is not competent to move into areas which are not directly educational. However,  cooperation among all of the community's institutions is needed to solve basic problems. The schools must learn to work not only with other elements of local government, but also with the larger community in order to enhance their key role.

The interviewers used stratified random sampling procedures involving geographical distribution, race, and grade level of students living in the area in May 1968. Of the 751 parents surveyed, 84.4 percent were Negro. Findings of the survey are reported in nine sections, as follows: (1) Characteristics of parents surveyed, (2) general attitudes toward the schools, (3) student performance and achievement, (4) instructional materials and school facilities, (5) curriculum, (6) parents' involvement with the schools, (7) discipline and security, (8) discrimination and rejection  in the schools, and (9) community involvement. A series of 54 tables indicates percentage responses to major categories for individual interview items related to each section of the report. A copy of the interview schedule is appended.

The inequalities persist for a combination of both technical and political reasons. The evidence reviewed suggests that the distribution of school resources is directly related to the distribution of wealth and power among the populations being served, both among and within school districts. Ethnic minorities and the poor have traditionally been shortchanged in the provision of social resources. Only when there is a redistribution of power to these groups will there be a more equitable allocation of finances. On the basis of this assumption, community control and decentralized schools can improve the financing and  effectiveness of the inner-city schools. (Author/DE)",

Three recent trends in the behavioral and social sciences are apparent: Rationalization in the decision process, institutionalization of research in education, and the beginning of a general theory of organizational behavior. The problem posed is how to combine the decision process of cost-effectiveness with the behavioral processes of institutional decision-making. A general theory of instructional evaluation is needed to unify evaluations. Questions are raised about the specific problem area of concern, the relevant variables, and the environmental influences of the school. The openness of the school system is affected by its interactions with other systems, by the criteria used  in evaluation, and by feedback.

By the way he applies and coordinates his school's available resources, the principal determines the product of his school, the departing pupil. More effective education is becoming possible as the individual school receives more and better resources and uses more sophisticated ways to measure human potential and productivity. Although community forces are playing an increasingly active role in the area of governance and the determination of school policies and programs, resolving the issues of both governance and accountability turns most realistically on who is to be held accountable for the product of education. It  is at the level of the individual school and its principal that these two questions stand the best chance of being faced squarely and resolved fairly.

A computer-assisted menu planner was developed which generated a monthly set of menus satisfying nutritional and Federal standards, and food demand cycles. When compared to the menus actually used in the school system, the computer-planned menus offered a greater variety, had less price fluctuation, and reduced the average cost per serving by approximately 10 percent. The menu generator was then combined with a set of inventory models to determine the ordering quantities and ordering intervals which would result in the minimum cost. The results of this procedure suggest that substantial savings are possible  through the use of these models, both in reduction of direct costs and in reduction of clerical effort. (JH)",

The study's highlights included: (1) Births and birth rates declined, but total enrollments rose; (2) shortages of qualified teachers and other professional workers continued; (3) teacher strikes and sanctions continued to grow, but negotiated settlements also increased; (4) central cities continued to lose resources while their expenditures increased; (5) State tax revenues increased with new enactments or higher rates, primarily as a result of  mounting property taxes. Nonetheless, it is concluded, schools were better financed in 1967-68 than in previous years. The outlook for 1969 is good, although it is partly clouded by inflation and the Federal surtax.

        "description":"Individually Prescribed Instruction (IPI), an experimental instructional method for planning and conducting a program of studies tailored to the learning needs and characteristics of each student, has been in operation in suburban Pennsylvania's Oakleaf elementary school since 1964. Oakleaf's IPI program, which covers the subject areas of mathematics, reading, primary science, and spelling, requires no grades or basic textbooks. The program is based on specific behaviorally stated instructional objectives which are grouped into meaningful sequences representing different levels of progress. IPI allows the teacher to diagnose a child's relative progress on an individual basis and to prescribe appropriate instructional tasks which will enable the child to move on to the next  curriculum level. Limited testing and the general evaluations of teachers and administrators working in IPI schools indicate a favorable improvement in student achievement. However, evidence on the effects of IPI is still fragmentary. Three to 5 years of perfecting IPI in demonstration projects similar to Oakleaf's, as well as a retraining program for administrators and teachers, will be required prior to extensive evaluative research.

An individual designated as the &quot;county agent&quot; would act as a liaison between the State ERIC office and local educational agencies by (1) identifying local educational problems and needs, (2) transmitting problems to the State ERIC office for a comprehensive information search, (3) transmitting pertinent findings to the local educator, and  (4) instigating new research efforts where information relevant to local problems cannot be located.

The educable mentally retarded (EMR) and educationally handicapped (EH) groups were significantly superior in all tests to the trainable mentally retarded and Down's Syndrome groups, especially when vision and movement were paired. The Down's Syndrome group evidenced the most marked perceptual-motor deficiencies. EH children had poorer crawling and walking patterns than the EMR's, and these two groups functioned best during  late childhood and early adolescence. Children with Down's Syndrome made continual improvement with increased age in tracking ability, gross agility, and in body-part perception. The majority of all subjects had difficulty making left-right identifications relative to their bodies. The correlation between IQ's and total battery scores (based on 37 IQ's) was .63 while the age to total score correlation was .54. (RJ)",

A teacher training workshop presented for 10 evenings focused on the organization and use of 86 lessons in nine units for 18 weeks. Teaching methods concentrated on developing understanding through the solution of problems which originated in the classroom. Trained teachers used the prepared program with 161 retarded children; untrained teachers used the program with 58 retarded children; and  there were 132 retarded and 89 average-ability controls. The results showed that the IDES and the PUT appear to be stable and consistent measures of the arithmetic performance of mentally handicapped children, and that the teacher training program and the prepared program of arithmetic curriculum were effective. Measures of primary mental abilities and academic achievement were highly interrelated. The study supports the contention that problem solving and concept development among the mentally handicapped can be influenced by education. (LE)",

In experiments using a recall procedure there were decrements in initial performance level with decreasing age and IQ but less evidence that forgetting occurred at a faster rate in younger and less intelligent children. Recognition memory was found to be relatively constant over a wide range of age and IQ. Evidence was presented that ability to encode and organize stimulus material depended on age and IQ. Retarded children were especially poor at adopting efficient encoding strategies and seemed relatively incapable of making use of the organizational structure of a list to facilitate storage and recall.  Detailed analyses showed considerable response bias in children's recognition behavior, consistent primacy and recency effects when bias was taken into account, and evidence that memory for individual items was not all-or-none. Except for response biases and forgetting rate, recognition memory processes of normal and retarded children appeared to be identical to those of adults. (Author/RJ)",

Students in the experimental group generally performed significantly better in tests of fluency, adaptive flexibility, and originality requiring divergent production, but not in convergent production or in rate of emission of familiar cognitive responses. Attitudes toward creativity  changed in a positive direction, and experimental students indicated less fear of failure and more self confidence. Conclusions were that designing may be a more complex process than had been assumed and that an art program focusing on problem solving and creative behavior has important functions in the education of the gifted.

        "description":"Selected visible and audible features of stuttered speech were studied to determine whether these phenomena suggested a basis for differentiating among stutterers. Forty-six visible and audible phenomena of stuttering were examined in 23 stutterers, using a frame-by-frame analysis of sound motion picture film. Significant inter-subject differences were found in 11 of these variables which included the following: adaptation, number of film frames in the moment of stuttering, simultaneous suspension of jaw and lip activity, eyelid closure, eyelid movement, total visible tension, number of anatomical areas involved in the moment, and several indices of unilateral facial deviations. A factor analysis of the correlations among audible and visible variables revealed 10 factors which  accounted for 83% of the variance. Six of these factors were similar to stuttering dimensions which previously had been implied or hypothesized, but had not been empirically derived; overall stuttering severity, type of audible dysfluency, adaptation, type of unilateral deviation, tension, and stuttering differences between spontaneous speech and reading. Applications are presented of the results of this study to the differentiation and classification of stutterers. (Author/RD)",

Additional findings were that a drawing test did not differentiate, that the two creativity groups could not be distinguished according to socially accepted responses on the verbal thinking test, and that the high and low creativity groups could not be differentiated as members of a family group.

        "description":"To test the hypothesis that experimentally-induced success and failure experiences would differentially affect mentally retarded and normal children, 24 educable mentally retarded children and their matched mental age (MA) and chronological age (CA) controls were given six trials on a verbal 5-item vocabulary task. The subjects (Ss) were given, in counter-balanced design, three success trials (simple words) and three failure trials (difficult words). All Ss gave a prediction of performance estimate for each trial. The retarded Ss and their MA controls set higher estimates across trials than the older CA controls. The retarded Ss also set higher initial estimates. Results were interpreted as being contrary to the hypothesis that retardates have had a greater history of failure  experiences resulting in lower generalized expectancy of success. (Author/RJ)",

Subjects were then randomly assigned to one of three groups: no therapy, therapy for 30 minutes once a week for 9 months, or therapy for 30 minutes four times weekly for 9 months. Posttests were administered immediately after 9 months and again 3 months later. Results on picture deep test indicated that subjects who received therapy four times weekly improved significantly, whereas subjects who had therapy once a week did not. On the picture articulation test, however, no significant  differences were found between experimental groups. At the time of the second posttesting, the picture articulation improvements by the subjects who had therapy four times weekly were maintained as were the respective positions of subjects in the three groups. Significant relationships were also found between mental age and IQ and articulation improvement during therapy. (JD) [Not available in hardcopy due to marginal legibility of original document]",

From a pool of about 350 items, most of them used in testing intelligence in the sighted, a pool of 94 was selected and embossed after the manner of braille. A residual pool of 49 test and 12 training items was selected through the responses of some 500 blind children. Normative data were gathered on the responses of 961 subjects. Analyses of the data indicated the following correlations for the BLAT: internal consistency, .934; test-retest reliability over 7 months, .865; and Hayes Binet mental ages, and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children verbal ages, .89 for the 420 children for whom preceeding scores  were available. Although the BLAT was found to lose discriminative power at or near the 12-year level, it was suggested as being more valuable than the Hayes Binet or the Wechsler for younger children since it tests process rather than product behavior.

In cataloging educational media certain information will be required from the computerized process.

To facilitate information exchange between libraries and resource centers a coding system was recommended which allows for flexibility to accomodate future expansion and permits application to both manual and automated cataloging and scheduling procedures. Standards were written for an identification number incorporating a media code, storage code, year code, sequence number and a print/copy number. Other codes were developed for such elements as title, level, length, etc. (Author/JY)",

The first part of the project included a national conference on cartridged films in February 1967, and is fully documented in this report. The second part, based on the findings of the first, was concerned with an intensive investigation of the single concept film idea, namely 'a short segment of film with a small, discrete, and describable instructional content'. The problem was to develop 'practicable systems  for the selection, storage, maintenance, retrieval, distribution, and projection of film clips (single-concept, closed-loop films) from existing 16mm instructional films'.

The film versions differed with respect to six variables, designated as Verbalization, Rate of Development, Nomenclature, Errors, 'How it works', and Repetition. None of the men had ever assembled the breech block or similar mechanisms. They were grouped according to age, length of education, General Classification and Mechanical Aptitude Test Scores. Immediately after the film showing, each man was required to  attempt to assemble the parts of the dismantled breech block. Ten trials were given, and a time score obtained for each man. The most significant results were that a slow rate of development, the pointing out of errors to be avoided, and repetition of the assembly demonstration, markedly and positively contributed to the effectiveness of the film.

The first half is classified into five parts, in terms of learning principles, of some areas for research on instructional films; and the second part, the appendix, comprises a summary of the experimental projects of the Instructional Film Research Program in relation to the foregoing classification which, specifically, is: 1. Psychological learning principles and their relationship to learning from films. 2. Film characteristics and  their effect on learning. 3. Development of new equipment and procedures for testing instructional films. 4. Research on methods for utilizing films in instruction; and 5. Reviews of pertinent literature and theoretical systems.

Can a distinction be made between the consequences of students being taught by ETV and the consequences achieved by other teaching technologies? 2. Is there a systematic way in which the attitudes of college professors relate to the possibility that they may have to use ETV in their teaching; and 3. Is there a special student reaction to being taught by ETV compared with their reaction to the instructional technologies replaced by television instruction? Findings are that ETV is neither better nor worse intrinsically than the medium of  instruction it replaces in achieving results among students, and therefore does not require an educational policy decision. Professors are responsive to ETV and will use it on an individual basis. ETV will tend to cause a redundancy in professors' teaching functions, but this will be compensated by a proportionate growth in their research functions. An extensive bibliography is appended.

In comparison, traditional sequential learning may seem slow and uninteresting. Technological innovation in education would make it possible to place emphasis on student discovery through informative media, an approach which is to be preferred over two popular communications theories which place greatest importance on clear, orderly transmission of messages, or on persuading a person to display a desired terminal behavior. No single innovation will solve all the problems of educators. A variety of teaching methods will always be needed, especially if the \"dehumanization\" often expected of machine-oriented media is to be avoided. Laymen may  assume from press coverage of atypical schools and from the lipservice given technological innovation by educators that modern media are being fully utilized. In fact, educators, for reasons of prejedice or ignorance, have not made full use of them. Information services, adequate training for teachers, and prototype units for experimentation and demonstration would facilitate acceptance of new methods. Research into methods available, and studies to aid administrators in budgeting adequate funds and evaluating equipment are also needed. (RM)",

The machine relentlessly displays all the relevant facts (as far as is possible) so that the user is guided to consider them in his decision making, even if it  means doubting a preconceived purpose. The user is provided with opportunities to analyze and harmonize disconnected sections in his vocational development. The ISVD data are somewhat like ERIC abstracts.

The experiment was concerned with the establishment of criteria for the implementation of a 2x3x4 factorial matrix to study the variables in question in various combinations. The experimental variables considered included the method of instruction (matrix factor = 2), the type of skill to be mastered (matrix factor = 3), and the characteristics of the learner (matrix factor = 4). Throughout the duration of the program to date, the experimenters have been  plagued with malfunctioning of the teacher aid equipment so that, allied with the small size of the sample, the results cited in the final report are felt to be inconclusive. Nothing like the desired goal of the above matrix was realized. It is felt that substantial rewiring of the circuit coupling the power supply to the keyboards will have to be effected before the hypotheses presented for this program can be confirmed or refuted.

Instructional films, though of a very high technical standard, and though widely used nowadays, are seldom constructed along the principles of programed instruction. A well-constructed programed film will exercise a high degree of internal control over the learner's responses. The learner is made to behave in a specifically prescribed manner throughout the course of, and at the end of the film, by the use of the instructional specification (IS) and through the IS, by the program outline. The components of the IS are terminal behavior, instructional cue, elicitors,  and stimulus limits. This paper provides a blue-print for preparing an IS, and is one of five monographs that make up a demonstration kit for producing a self-instructional film. (GO)",

The foregoing may be regarded as a blue-print for defining a film's objectives. Then there is the problem of selecting a task which the film must perform. Here the point to remember is that a self-instructional film must include two considerations: behavior and subject matter. Finally, it must be asked that when the learning task is concerned with paired-associate learning, the decision may well be not to use a film at all, but rather to use less elaborate  and less expensive materials--flashcards, for example.

A sliding card gradually discloses the two basic sequences which programs usually follow--the linear and the branching sequences. A branching sequence may be normal or remedial, a frame regular or mainstream. A linear sequence may have a wash ahead or a wash back. A typical program frame comprises a stimulus, a response and a feedback. Prompts or cues, which are used to stimulate a response, may be formal or thematic. A frame may be intermediate or terminal, and cues should be faded out gradually when the frames are terminal. The programer must avoid copying frames and overprompting. RULEG (rule first and example afterwards) and EGRUL (the reverse  process) are two general programing strategies. A response may be overt or covert and must be related to the instructional content. A stimulus may be generalized or discriminative, and the programer must control both. He must deal, not only with response acquisition, but also with its maintenance. Chaining, which may refer forwards or backwards, is when instruction includes sequencing of several tasks. (GO)",

However, it is hypothesized that if the message elements arriving simultaneously from audio and visual channels are redundant, man will retain the information. An attempt was made to measure redundancy in the audio and visual elements and in their relationship by showing a film clipping to groups who recorded their recall. Confidence can be placed in the two following hypothoses: the recall of the visual element in a message where audio and visual elements are presented simultaneously is positively related to the visual redundancy; the recall of both audio and visual elements which are presented simultaneously in a message is positively related to  the redundancy in the audio-visual relationships. The other four hypotheses, also dealing with the relationship of audio-visual element recall to redundancy, favored the hypotheses; but the results were not conclusive. These findings imply that audiences lose much television and film information. (MM)",

All students gave the same speeches. Four experimental group speeches were videotaped. Instructors gave no critiques but instructors, observers, and students rated the speeches according to prescribed standards. Contrary to the hypothesis, the control group self-rating was closer to their ideal self-concept.  However, the experimental group, in contrast to the control group, submitted ratings which highly correlated with the instructors' and observers' ratings. Neither group changed their ideal self-concepts and both groups moved equally toward considering themselves in personal evaluative terms.

Between 1967-68 and 1968-69, there was roughly a 50% increase in electronic data processing (EDP) installations. Computer and remote terminal installations also increased 50%, but the proportion of computers under school systems or district control decreased slightly. These computers are oriented primarily to administration needs: finance and pupil categories each account for about one-third of all computer application; research and planning and facilities each account for about 15%; instructional programs and personnel applications are only 5% each. The minimum cost reported for all operations performed by a particular installation was 10 cents per pupil  per school year and the maximum was $12.26. Present trends indicate that the computer is being used in schools to solidify practices of questional educational value, such as testing, grading, and scheduling students by compartmentalization rather than by individualization. A strong recommendation is that federal support be given to foster a polycentric (many-centered) development of computer resources, rather than encouraging each school system to install its own equipment.

Beta weights for the regression equations associated with eight samples of student performance were computed. Results of the study indicated that the number of days required to master a given unit was related to the student's initial entering state; the most important factors being the student's unit pretest score, the number of skills that must be mastered, and the student's age.

He diagnoses a learning problem and calls in 'experts' as required, by means of electronics--TV, radio, etc.--or books. ITV can complement teaching by stimulating and motivating learning, exposing the pupils to resources that are otherwise unavailable, reinforcing classroom experiences, saving the teacher valuable time by disseminating routine data rapidly, magnifying visual materials and demonstrations, increasing listening and observational skills, and promoting in-service education. ITV has its limitations, of course, but a teacher can overcome them with an imaginative approach that keeps his pupils constantly on their  toes. (GO)",

        "author":["Worth, Sol"],
        "description":"The process of film making can be thought of as beginning with a person's feeling or concern about something. To communicate this feeling to others, the film maker (sender) must develop an organic unit which will provide a vehicle that can embody the feeling/Story-Organism. The film maker selects and orders a series of signs, images, or events which translate the Story-Organism into a message. The film viewer (receiver) then reverses this process. In order to understand this process, a science of sign language (semiotic) must be developed with reference to films. A film may be thought as a series of videmes; a videme being defined as a generalized shot or take. The videme may then be examined from the standpoint of the five parameters of the structural elements of film  language--Image in Motion over Time in Space with Sequence. To further develop the semiotic of film making various concepts and definitions of developmental linguistics ma y be useful. However, a methodology of research must be developed to explore them as they may apply to films. What is needed are specific hypotheses which can be tested, either by an analysis of film making or film viewing, or by controlled experiment. At the conclusion of the paper several ideas for research problems are set forth and a list of reference notes is given. (JY)",

There are many criticisms of the use of simulations and games, the most common being that they may distort reality, and that they may simulat e experiences which society demands that the individual shall keep away from in real life. An all-embracing answer that is offered against these criticisms is that they do not apply if the games and simulations are designed with skill and with good sense. Included in this report is a section entitled \"Design Your Own\" which tabulates the steps  necessary in the design of a game.

Three areas were investigated with experiments using children from nursery schools and kindergarten to sixth grade. The first experiment probed the effect redundant clues have on the recognizability of an illustration, the second the relative values of realistic and abstract illustrations in the teaching of a concept, and the third the effect of age differences on the perception of pictures. The first experiment, in which the pictures were presented by means of a tachistoscope, led to the conclusion that a picture becomes more recognizable as more clues are  furnished. In the second experiment, children taught the concept \"one-half\" by means of abstract materials did as well as those taught with illustrations of real objects: a four-year-old's idea of what is abstract is, apparently, not an adult's. The best learning was achieved when children were taught and tested with realistic materials. Children learned best when the illustrations suggested a kinetic situation. Perception increased with age. A great deal more research, though apt to be expensive, is recommended. (GO)",

In another group the teachers explained that the students had had no opportunity for a question-answer session. With the third control group the teachers were provided with a program guide and left to their own devices. Data collected included: standardized pretest scores of science knowledge, intelligence scores, posttest scores of learning from the television lessons, and certain background information for each child. The data from this  experiment suggests primarily that teachers be taught to use the Socratic method of instructional television utilization. Teachers should plan to create a classroom context beneficial to instructional television by involving their students in the lesson and encouraging them to respond actively to questions about the content.

Three increasingly complex experiments were designed to test the effect of varying delays of computer response on the number of commands issues per minute, as well as the total time needed to complete a task. The system used was a time-shared, on-line TX-2 computer and the Lincoln Reckoner, a subset of the programs in the executive system known as APEX. It was hoped that the experiments would not only further the knowledge of how people solve problems, but also aid in the design of new systems. The results indicate not only the feasibility of testing man-computer interaction,  but also demonstrate more clearly the differences between the subjects' behavior in the various tasks in such indices of performance as net completion time and number of outputs. In addition, the gross completion time curves and output rate curves indicate that experiments large enough to produce stable curves would be feasible.

        "description":"Experimental Programed Instruction of the anatomy of the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve is being conducted by the Harvard Computer-Aided Instruction Laboratory in cooperation with Tufts University Dental School. Two nearly identical programs are presented, one (PF) using representational diagrams and the other (PD) a schematic diagram and identification key. First year dental students were randomly selected and divided into four groups, each group taking the four sections of the two part course in a different sequence. Attitude testing toward programed instruction and subject achievement testing was performed both before and after the course. The entire course requires an average two and one-half hours of student time. Of the six pretest students who took the first  three-quarters of the course, it was found that Program PD yielded the most gain on Sections One, Two, and the total, but Program PF yielded more on Section Three. There was less overall gain on Section Three than on the other two sections. More data will be accumulated in the academic year 1969-70. Included in the document are examples of the schematic and representational diagrams, pre- and post-attitude questionnaires, achievement tests, sample lessons, a table of results, a program abstract and a list indicating distribution of the document.

This interaction tests the relevance of education to community needs, and its utility in helping local people to eventually solve their own problems. Activities during the 6 months to a year spent at a center include seminar programs, projects and research studies, several of which link the center to the students' institutions. Two centers are already in operation, 1 on the underdeveloped island of Kauai,  Hawaii and another in the Appalachian area of Pikeville, Kentucky. Two additional centers are planned for inner-city Chicago and for a suburb of New York City. Study results indicate that the Field Study Center model can be effective in different settings.

Roughly 64% of all colleges and universities in New York State operate programs for disadvantaged students, with state-affiliated schools involved almost twice as much as non-state affiliated institutions. Most of the programs are designed to help students find a place in a particular college program and, through guidance, financial aid, and counseling, to maximize the students' chances of college success. Other programs do not provide  specific college-placement services, but emphasize remedial language-arts, mathematics, science, guidance, and counseling. Opinions concerning the development of new programs for the disadvantaged vary from those favoring improvement of existing programs to those urging an increase in the number of students currently being reached. The major sources of funds for the programs are the colleges and universities, and the federal and state governments. The report contains a list of colleges and universities in New York State with the name and/or type of program in progress, level of program (pre-college or college), and type of student (high risk, average, or better).

These are organizations which extend authority and control over multiple units within society. There are three directions which future research may take in the systematic study of macro-administration in American higher education. These are sub-paradigms derived from other sources, but all of which may be applied to higher education. First, the federation sub-paradigm is based upon the political analogue in which a government of the federation and a set of governments of the member units both rule over the same territory and people, with each retaining some autonomy. These can take the form of a &quot;periphalized&quot; or a &quot;centralized&quot; federation. The  second is the sub-paradigm on policy and administrative practice. This would be translated into studies comparing the conceptual behavior of man with the cultural behavior of man within an administrative framework. In the third, the empirical history sub-paradigm, the mathematical formulae suggested by Mason Haire are fitted to institutional growth patterns. Two of the sub-paradigms have a direct relationship in prior use in the real world of research, and the policy administration sub-paradigm is rooted in a firm, logical substantive framework. (DS)",

The trends are: (1) the accentuated search for ways of coping with the knowledge explosion; Gerald Hoyt and Gilbert Burck point out the significance of the &quot;information explosion&quot; in world history and the growing importance of knowledge in technically advanced nations. (2) the continued deterioration of liberal arts education; Lewis Mayhew opposes Clark Kerr's favorable evaluation of the British college-German research institute blend in US higher education, and calls the union of research and service  functions the biggest problem facing the field today. (3) the acceleration of student unrest; Edward Shoben and James Michener identify main issues: Vietnam, racial injustice, middle-class values, and others.

The need for confidential processing of these data has stimulated increasing concern among psychologists, sociologists, statisticians, administrators, and educational researchers. This study was implemented in order to set forth some limitations and problems involved with this kind of research. The report examines some specific aspects of the privacy issue with respect to ACE's information system, and the major differences and similarities between the ACE Data  Bank and other data bank systems. A major emphasis is placed on evaluating devices that would help to preserve the confidentiality of data at each level of the system: data collection, transmission, and analysis dissemination.

It examined the interrelationships of their graduate majors, undergraduate majors and colleges, high school deciles and class size, age, sex, level taught, geographic location, year of matriculation, and M.A.T. scores. Although most of the study was concerned with the 774 students who were active in July, 1969, data are included on students enrolled from the program's beginning in July 1960. It was found that most degrees (52 of 90) had been awarded in either English or elementary education, and of those currently enrolled, most (464 of 774) had received their undergraduate degrees at Stevens Point. It was  evident that the graduate program had greatly expanded in recent years. Most students limit their studies to summers, however, and this helps to account for the large number currently enrolled and the small number of degrees awarded. Extensive use is made of tables and figures to present this data, and trends are noted. No specific recommendations are made. (DS)",

        "description":"Whereas past campus revolts in America were concerned with on-campus issues, the present student movement is political, and must be understood as such. Much of the student unrest has resulted from the belief of students that the system is not truly representative and unjustly excludes them from the decision-making process; normal political processes are not functioning; and the democratic process is too slow in bringing about urgently needed reform. Max Frankel, George Kennan, Seymour Lipset, Lewis Feuer, Robert Hutchins, Margaret Mead, and Pitrim Soroken have offered various interpretations of the causes and implications of student unrest. American student unrest is comparable to 19th century student movements in Russia and Germany, and to more current movements in France and  other countries. Placed in historical and cross-cultural perspective, the US student movement appears less radical, less violent, and less extreme. Much of the conflict in American universities has focused on the role of the university in society. As an institution, however, the university must undertake the resolution of problems directly related to its educational and parietal role, and must minimize sources of conflict that are social and political in nature. The university's future depends upon the way it meets these challenges. (DS)",

The survey instrument was a questionnaire which collected data for the entire year on the mode and incidence of protests, major issues, results, consequences, and administrative changes made. The facts in this report represent the first attempt to link campus unrest with a variety of institutional characteristics (control, type, size, selectivity) using a representative national sample of 427 US colleges and universities. Study findings indicate that most institutions are  attempting to respond in meaningful ways to major campus protests. Discipline has been a frequent response to violence; but major efforts have been made to modify curricula and racial policies, and to increase the freedom and power of students. The data also show that a majority of institutions, including those where major protests did not occur, made substantive changes in rules and policy during 1968 and 1969. One conclusion of the study is that US campuses, which have always been centers of protest and social criticism, are still likely to experience more unrest in years to come. The questionnaire and an analysis of the data are included. (WM)",

Current trends of educational growth and complexity demand increasingly accurate, rapid, and extensive planning, but the drudgery of assembling, processing, and analyzing large quantities of data often reduces planning efficiency. With the Higher Education Long-Range Planning (HELP) program, college and university officers may construct a methematical model of an institution, simulate its behavior over a 10-year period under hypothesized conditions, and arrive at policy decisions that are  likely to achieve desired objectives within the anticipated resources. The HELP approach involves philosophy (the &quot;why&quot; questions associated with an institution), objectives (the &quot;what&quot; type questions), programs (how activities will be conducted to achieve objectives), and resources (the allocation of personnel, facilities, funds, and time). Once a plan has been developed, it becomes the guide for implementation and analysis of results. The report discusses methods and model design, and presents 4 planning models actually in use to illustrate how varied institutions utilize the HELP program in their long-range planning processes.

The first objective of the CORD Program was to bring together talent in the participating institutions so that mutual assistance would be available; the second was to stimulate faculties not normally involved in educational research activities to initiate such. Because it soon became apparent that more training for individuals in participating institutions was necessary, an intensive 2 week summer training session was undertaken.  The first session, with a total of 61 participants from a diversity of academic backgrounds, was designed to develop competencies in 7 specific areas of educational research. From the 3 evaluation procedures used, including pre- and post-tests, this first session was generally successful. Tables and appendices present information concerning the session and its evaluation. Specific recommendations are made for future sessions.

Since the responsibility of implementing such a national policy would be shared by educational institutions, the federal government, and state and regional organizations, major recommendations are proposed for each of these 3 sectors. Roughly, the university would be primarily charged with the development and maintenance of sound programs of  education and associated research, both in the traditional and the developing scholarly disciplines. State and regional planners would strengthen existing institutions that offer graduate programs and establish new ones of high quality. The federal government would supplement non-federal sources of funding by providing a major share of continuing support for graduate education.

Information was derived from responses to mailed questionnaires sent during 1968 to academic deans at 281 colleges and universities.

It was found that student protests occurred at slightly more than half the sampled institutions. Faculty representatives had a major role in administrative planning to deal with  protests at about 25%, and provided information about the protest to the administration prior to the event in an equal number of cases. Faculty involvement with planning a protest was associated with occurrence of more peaceful types of demonstrations; correlations of faculty (or teaching assistant) planning and participation were smallest with physically violent and physical obstructionist protests. Faculty members were perceived as sympathetic supporters of protesters at about half the institutions and took leadership roles at 11%. Few deans felt that relations between faculty and administration had deteriorated as a result of the protest.

This study was undertaken to determine the extent and kinds of changes which have taken place in developing SCUs in the past and to make projections for the near future. From 200 replies to a questionnaire survey of SCUs, data were acquired on: recent curricular developments and curricular plans through 1973; financial data including information on student costs and faculty-student ratios; state coordination plans and related problems; growth patterns, institutional size and changing patterns of organization; innovative instructional practices in use now and planned for the future. Information was also  gathered from historical and statistical materials, reports from teacher certification sections of state departments of education, and site visits. The final report describes general characteristics of institutional changes during the past several decades, such as enrollment, purpose, degree programs, admissions policies, faculty staffing and salaries. Present and developing curricular programs, finance, and administrative organization are discussed, and profiles of 3 selected state universities are presented. (JS)",

Surveying the decade 1958-68, Chapter 2 analyzes the major grounds of dissatisfaction with and describes the major trends in attempts to reform the curricular-instructional pattern. Chapter 3 describes 6 basic elements of the  curricular-instructional subsystem and explores some basic relationships among them. Chapters 4 and 5 analyze 2 pivotal elements: the grading system and faculty-student interaction in the classroom. Chapter 6 summarizes the method and the findings.

AACS also plans to publish a Directory of Community Service Directors in Junior Colleges, working papers on specific  subjects, and an occasional major report on the state of the art and future prospects. Topics represented in these six issues include: community service program administration as distinct from adult education; a checklist of four basic community services for private or public colleges wishing to establish or strengthen their programs; information on materials exchange between AACS and the colleges; national organizational patterns for community services; responsibility of the college to know and reach out to all the people in the community; an interchange of program directions, problems, and achievements; formation of a National Council on Community Services; California programs; personnel training.

The effects of the two treatment variables, student variables, and interactions among them were tested. The students were randomly assigned to a closed-circuit TV (CCTV) group and a discussion group. Both groups covered the same material, but, in the latter, the teacher encouraged student participation. The rate of verbal teacher behavior that elicited or hindered student participation was calculated and student talk measured at about 13%. Student variables had been determined by natural science, math, and total ACT scores, and by pretests on scientific attitude and method. Student participation was measured by the Kuder  Richardson Formula 20. Significant differences between the groups were found only for final examinations, with the discussion group scoring higher than the other. The attitude of the discussion group was higher for the winter quarter, but not for the spring. No significant interactions among variables and no systematic gain from pre- to post-test were found. From these and other findings, six conclusions were reached. There was some evidence in favor of the discussion groups, but little corroboration of the theory of the need for continual learner response and reinforcement. Such techniques as computer-assisted instruction should be studied more fully as alternatives to traditional teaching. (HH)",

It depicts, with tables, current educational outlays: dollar amounts and percentages of educational and general expenditures; administrative and instruction costs; extension, public service, and research expenses; and library and physical plant costs. It also gives administration, instruction, library, and plant costs per full-time-equivalent student. Findings showed that: (1) of nearly $112 million spent by the 127 colleges, 52.9%  went for instruction, 20.3% for administration, 6.3% each for libraries and plant, and less than 1% for other items; (2) public colleges spent less (16.4%) than private colleges (33.1%) on administration; (3) public colleges spent 56.4% on instruction, private schools only 33.1%, compared with a suggested norm of 60%; for all schools, expenditure for extension and public services was below 1%; (5) library funds averaged 6.6% for public colleges and 5.4% for private; (6) both public and private colleges spent under 16% on plant operation and maintenance; (7) a wide range of expenditures was shown for all functions per FTE student.

From advisory meetings, student response, and one year's test of the program's basic design, certain observations were made. Business men, advisory committees, students, and educators were enthusiastic about the program. Students reported a new sense of contact, of community involvement, and of increased academic motivation. The relationship of career goal and work experience was of prime  interest to the students. Field experience does not replace general education requirements, but adds depth and enrichment to the major study. Opportunities for students to get experience beyond the present offerings have been sought. Employers' evaluations have been universally favorable to the program. Development of work-study relationships for students who are in difficulty with traditional courses is emphasized and successes documented. Veterans and others in financial need particularly appreciate the change to combine work and study. For some of the courses, transfer arrangements have been made with other state schools and colleges. (HH)",

Although other plans have been developed, the most promising allows two students to fill a full-time work station--one student enrolled for the semester, the other working full time. At semester break, they exchange positions. Each combines his college education with career advancement. Employer responses showed that 27 thought the alternate-semester plan would be useful to them; six felt they could develop a suitable plan; seven preferred part-time work with continuous school enrollment; 40 agreed with the principle of cooperative education; ten said they could not accommodate such a program; most liked having  both college trainees and fully-covered work stations; none had discriminatory hiring practices. It was also found that the program recruits students for distributive work and leads to other careers; half-time work is acceptable to most businesses, though it confines the student to nearby jobs; the value of full-time work and school varies for each student. Details of the program, including credit assignment, are discussed. Recommendations include a state master plan for cooperative education; promotion of the alternate-semester program; financial support for counseling, supervision, and work-station development; new models for open-ended terminal college program; a pilot study on employment patterns in the area's trade and transportation.

Testing programs are based only on middle-class culture; guidance and counseling do not allow for transitional programs or give help with personal, financial, and family problems; counselors need the aid of psychiatric social workers or laymen to act as liaison between the disadvantaged and the &quot;educated&quot; professional; recruitment of promising students should be done in their own neighborhood; remedial programs must be redirected; apprenticeship practices must be encouraged; more minority staff must be hired. In April 1968, a Committee resolution recommended vigorous recruitment of minority personnel at all  levels; in-service programs for teachers and administrators on minority problems; more jobs for minority students while in college; appropriate changes in curriculum and counseling; the tapping of all financial resources; placement of minority students in both credit and non-credit courses; giving precedence to student needs over college protocol; additional tutoring and more &quot;big brother&quot; programs. In simplistic terms, the junior college must get the disadvantaged student into the college, keep him there, and move him on to a 4-year school or a decent job.

For the author's purpose, religion is defined as \"that group of concepts ... of theology that have shaped our Western culture ... and the non-Christian world.\" One semester could deal with the Judeo-Christian heritage and a second with Eastern religions, with a view to teaching the student to understand them, to develop critical, imaginative, and incisive reactions to the facts of history, and to be emotionally and intellectually equipped to cope with and tolerate the differences as he encounters them in our pluralistic society. Nearly all academic subjects (sociology, psychology, history, philosophy, and especially music,  art, and literature) treat religion peripherally. Many of their themes are incomprehensible without an understanding of their contemporary religious influences. The author recommends that a course in religion should (1) instruct the student first in our prevalent Judeo-Christian tradition; (2) provide critical tools to evaluate the pagan, the Christian, and the naturalistic scientific mind; (3) include a study of primitive religions and such other great theologies as Buddhist, Hindu, and Islamic; and (4) relate this learning to art and literature, to modern institutions and practices, and to religion's role in various societies and historical periods.

The predictor intercorrelational table and the predictor criterion matrix both showed that a differential weighting favoring cumulative high school GPA's and verbal subtests could be used to predict academic behavior reasonably accurately. The specific GPA's were the best predictors; the quantitative skills were the least useful. Mechanical Reasoning, Spatial Ability, Reading Speed, Age, and Sex were unique variables. Multiple regression equations, coefficients of multiple  correlation, and percentage of accountable variance by each contributing predictor variable were computed for each criterion area. The percentile tables showed females higher in all measured high school areas and verbal subtest scores, with males higher in quantitative measures. The total group table coincided with the male table; the college total table was almost identical with a junior college table, but different from an all-college table consisting mainly of 4-year students. The findings suggest the test battery is predicting student college performance reasonably well. A locally constructed battery could possibly increase the validity, but not enough to warrant the time and money spent. (HH)",

In an experiment, known underachievers were combined at random with regular enrollees. The instruction method (contingency contracting) emphasized increased student motivation by making the student-teacher relationship cooperative instead of authoritarian. Teachers fulfill their part of the contract by giving individual help; students, by performing the assignments. It was noted that (1) no correlation existed between IQ and performance; (2) teachers must reject their accustomed teaching habits; (3) students must be aware of methods, objectives, and criteria; (4) the underachievers and the control group were not dissimilar enough for contrast; (5) factors besides ability are critical  to college success. These factors pertain to the teacher--he must know his students, motivate them, and avoid isolating himself from them. Students reported growth in valuing learning for its own sake, in self-management, in wanting to work, and in appreciating teacher concern, individual help, freedom from pressure, and being treated as mature people. Drawbacks were (1) previous instructor and student conditioning, (2) lack of individualized teaching aids, (3) inflexible school architecture, (4) traditional units of teaching time, (5) doubts of the efficiency of individual instruction.

The college reading center is for students who want to comprehend more in less time, quickly improve study habits, increase vocabulary, or improve their spelling. The program is valid insofar as it meets these needs. Reading comprehension, the most frequent lack, is only part of the complex reading act. The instructor, after finding each student's reading level, can arrange flexible groupings, ranging from whole-class discussion to individual instruction. Starting each student at his own level allows him initial success and builds his self-esteem. He must learn to set himself a goal for each assignment and to become a flexible reader by adjusting his  speed to the complexity of his material (e.g., a novel compared with a math paper). He will soon realize that his reading rate (and comprehension) depends on a combination of his basic skill, background, experience, intelligence, and the material's purpose and organization. The writer suggests a method of systematic vocabulary improvement. He also describes a directed reading lesson, which leads through recognition of purpose, arousal of interest, and silent reading for comprehension to oral questioning and rereading. This lesson should be applied to similar situations for transfer and reinforcement. The student must be encouraged to read independently for study or pleasure, as well as in the reading room. (HH)",

To see if those with definite majors or career choices in mind did better than those without, 300 students were tested according to the certainty of their choice. No significant difference in numeric point average (NPA) was found. The second study undertook to find items of a motivational nature for a test to predict student success. Fifty students with the lowest and 50 with the highest NPA's were selected. Of the 35 who took the 40-item test, 20 had high and 15 had low NPA's. The results suggested only a theoretical structure for a significant test, to be developed after finding more items that truly reflect  motivational components of success. The third study defined counseling as visits for other than procedural matters and achievement as high or low. Of 257 selected students, 152 had high grades and 105 had low. Testing for differences between those who did and did not seek counseling showed that, though counseling was most often sought by the high group, no causal effect of counseling on success was warranted. The fourth study was made to see if part-time work affects achievement or course load. A sample of 270 freshmen was divided into five groups by the number of hours they worked. Those planning to work over ten hours a week had lower grades, but there was no difference among the five groups in the credits carried. (HH)",

        "description":"To develop community service programs of genuine value, the junior college must have access to adequate funds. The usual sources are regular college funds; fees from enrollees; company, agency, or association sponsorship; and special funds. This paper deals mainly with the special sources--the local district, state board, federal grants, and foundations. In the search for financial support, the writer of the proposal must be able to specify the problem to be solved, the program proposed to deal with it, the expected results, the resources the college itself can provide, and the special qualities of the program that would interest the potential donor. He must also know the overall objectives of the funding source, the specific accomplishments it seeks, how the proposed program  will meet these goals, and in what ways the program is preferable to others' proposals. For a project of local concern, the college's own district or state is the logical source of support. If the community service offered has wider application, funds are fairly readily available under several federal acts. For unique or experimental programs, the seeker of funds may approach any of several private foundations that are particularly interested in some aspect of education. The author gives suggestions on proposal writing and appends information on sources of federal money. (HH)",

Students enrolled in business, chemistry, electronics, engineering, and nursing courses at Shoreline Community College (Washington) participated in the study. The Mann-Whitney test for unequal N and T tests was used to determine statistical differences in test performance between experimental and control groups. Students in business, chemistry, and nursing exposed to the videotaped instruction performed significantly better than those receiving conventional instruction. In electronics and engineering, however, only slight differences were found between the two groups. It was concluded that wider use of videotaped instruction for the teaching of special skills  would be beneficial and that further exploration, especially in technical-vocational areas and the more cognitive subject areas, is desirable.

Representing both vocational and academic programs, a random sample of 315 Vancouver City College students answered a questionnaire, giving data on sex, age, choice of program, residence, earnings, family unit, occupational class, and source and knowledge of financial aid. The data were analyzed to determine the socioeconomic characteristics and the percentage of those in the poverty class. The study then examined the source and availability of financial aid and the difficulties of obtaining it. So many aid programs have built-in qualifications, restrictions,  and limitations that the low-income student is automatically ineligible. The three most likely local sources of help for him are not widely enough known, and the applications for most other aid are unduly complex, discouraging to the student, incomprehensible to him or his family, and quite irrelevant to the situation. The reason such a small ratio of the poor attend college may well be that the restrictions and complexity of financial aid make it unavailable to those who need it most.

By accident, the two versions were handed out and 687 students answered both in quick succession. The staff decided to compare the two forms to see if the answers differed. Two questions were considered unsuitable for comparison. For the other seven, the frequency of differing replies ranged from 16 to 66%. Three possible explanations were offered: (1) students do not take such questionnaires seriously, (2) they are unable to answer reliably, (3) angry at answering the same questions twice, they deliberately mis-answered the second time. If the first or second is right, such data gathering is a waste of time. If the third is right,  the amount of data gathering should be reduced, assuming that the more questions a student must answer, the less reliable the replies. Point 3 will be re-examined in the fall 1969 semester, when both versions of the questionnaire will be given out at an interval of a few weeks. It is expected that, with the lapse of time, the student will feel no anger and may even forget he answered before. If marked differences in replies still show up, the matter should be pursued. While the format of a questionnaire does affect the way it is answered and may explain the differences found in this case, the value of the instruments is doubtful--for there is no way of knowing which format, if either, elicited reliable data.

Junior colleges throughout the state submitted catalogs, manuals, and other material for review. Student personnel directors (43) from nine colleges completed the Inventory of Selected College Functions. Interviews with staff and students were conducted on five campuses, with participation by staff members from four other colleges. Major strengths were (1) most programs are well supported, (2) staff members are committed to student-centered education, (3) relationships are good among staff, faculty, and students, (4) staff members have good professional preparation, (5) some programs could serve as resource centers for  other programs, (6) some innovative programs could inspire other colleges, and (7) students participate actively in college life. Major weaknesses were (1) some programs are peripheral and lack clear goals, (2) dean of students often has too many other duties, (3) some staff members feel a lack of professional identity, (4) present staff and funds are inadequate, (5) faculty members do not appreciate the program, (6) there is little in-service training or innovation, (7) staff lacks time for personal and vocational counseling, (8) students are apathetic, and (9) too few follow-up studies are made of dropouts or transfers.

In Colorado, the State Board prefers that the president be chosen at the local level by faculty, students, and local board members. His qualifications must fit the climate and values of the state system; e.g., he must de-emphasize the transfer program, encourage new clientele for post high school education, have admission policies that reach the poor and culturally deprived, provide vocational courses in the lowest skills and the highest technical levels, maintain flexibility in community services. More generally, he should be aware of such trends as the shift from local to state control, an ever-broadening clientele, increasing democratization of higher education, some  disenchantment with junior college aims, growing potential for conflict, a balance between state control and local autonomy, more competition for scarce resources. If he is starting a new college, he can profit from others' experience, not only in facilities planning, but also in taking the opportunity to introduce a less orthodox philosophy, directing resources to those most in need of them, and shaking off such traditional practices as the grading system, subject-matter departments, and selective admissions. He must try to bring ethnic minorities into the stream of education, promote a less institutional climate, teach low-skill jobs without literacy requirements, and, above all face up to this exacting position.

In June 1968, a national meeting was  held at Airlie to review the whole program. The first round of consulting, done in three areas (administration, finance, planning, research, community service; curriculum and faculty; and student personnel services), produced many recommendations, and evaluations by both consultants and colleges.

Although they usually have lower academic ability, they have other attributes worth enhancing. Testing and other selection tools generally apply only to academic aptitude, not to other qualities, and have a negative effect on the expectations of minority students. If they are expected to move upward from a low socioeconomic status, they step into conflict with background and family. While they are in great need of new ideas and life styles, they need not reject all their existing values. Even though wanting their children to prosper, parents give them little real encouragement. If they must work while in school, the time thus spent is at  the expense of their grades. They often scorn the junior college because it is cheap, forgetting that it makes their mobility possible. They are rarely intellectually oriented and must be shown the worth, to themselves and their careers, of the many other choices. They need co-curricular activities for the sharing of cultural experiences. Since those most in need of counsel rarely seek it, counselors must devise ways of going to them. They must learn to live with a normal amount of ambiguity, working into their career through a narrowing process of choice. The writer discusses many other pertinent characteristics and suggests ways for the counselor to make them work to the advantage of the students. (HH)",

        "description":"The remedial student's lack of success is characterized by low grades in English and math and by a high dropout rate. Topical Papers 1 and 2 (ED 022 479 and ED 026 050) considered two possible reasons for his lack of success. This paper examines a third, namely, his inability to form new concepts. It presents a description of concept learning to provide the instructor with a framework and terms for teaching a concept and an evaluation procedure for determining their effectiveness. Theories of how one forms a concept take one of two approaches: the learner as passive recipient or as active participant. In the latter case, the student has a concept when he groups things into a category according to a rule, e.g., \"walk\" and \"talk\" are verbs because they denote action. This paper  provides ten questions for diagnosing erroneous concepts and a procedure for determining whether concept learning is facilitated by using a framework. Construction, application, and evaluation of the test are described. Where results are significant, they support the use of the framework; where they are not significant, they suggest further modification of the instruction methods or modification of some other factor. The test can be used for other groups of students besides remedial ones. (HH)",

A socioeconomic data sheet was constructed by the writer and completed by 11,184 students enrolled in 42 North Carolina community colleges and technical institutes. Comparisons were made between North Carolina students and those in other states, in addition to comparisons among the program areas and among curriculums within the occupational programs. The study indicates that the community colleges and technical institutes, through the open-door policy, have successfully extended universal education beyond the high school. But certain factors should be strengthened if these  institutions are to provide a sound educative program for all the community. The results of the study indicate that there should be a determined effort to provide additional opportunities for the lower socioeconomic groups, the female, the evening student, and the student over 25. Social activities and the housing situation should be reviewed and adapted to the local situation. A more coordinated effort among the high schools, the community colleges and technical institutes, and the senior colleges is needed to provide a sound educative program for all the community.

Student dropout, defined as failure to complete the semester or to transfer to another institution, was the dependent variable. Instruments used were the Omnibus Personality Inventory, the Adaptive-Flexibility Inventory, and a questionnaire constructed for the study. Subjects were 259 freshmen beginning school in a Los Angeles community college in spring semester 1968. Personality configurations displayed by subject students on the OPI were compared with scores attained by a UCLA freshman group and with a normative group. The junior college population was more homogeneous than either reference group on every scale. Significant relationships were  found between high Complexity scores and dropout. Other significant findings were: dropouts were enrolled for fewer than twelve units; tended to be employed more time outside of school; had attended more schools prior to tenth grade; had mothers with less education. Dropouts had lower mean scores on the A-F Inventory, but the differences were not significant. (Author)",

The test was carried on between the Reno and Las Vegas campuses of the University of Nevada and the Davis campus of the University of California, using early production models of the machines. Results of the experiment indicate that the system is feasible and convenient for routine interlibrary use provided that improved reliability and consistency of copy quality is attained in later production models. Transceiving time for an average 10-page request is about one  hour. An average total elapsed time of 4 hours for completion of requests can readily be achieved. Quality of copy is adequate for most library materials when the machines are functioning properly, a condition which occurred less than 2/3 of the time with the early production models used in this test. Total operating costs for the system average about $9.85 per 10-page transmission. Appendices include technical aspects of the system, costs, and examples of telecopied materials. (Author/RM)",

A single united library was considered and rejected as a solution to problems confronting these several libraries, because it would sacrifice the advantages of present decentralization by delaying responses to special needs, and by reducing flexibility in library services. This report suggested, instead, a number of means for improving services and increasing resources through work that could best be planned and administered centrally. Such projects included: a guide or handbook to the various libraries and their holdings, a library newsletter, and a list of periodicals currently received, which should eventually be developed into a union  list of serials. A Current Theological Bibliography was recommended which would list what is available in the Boston area and would enable the scholar to scan what is being acquired. One further recommendation was made that the B.T.I. librarian serve as a coordinator for personnel placement, and that he work on the improvement of communications between libraries. (Author/RM)",

Three instructional packages were developed. One, directed to professional librarians, provided an introduction to system analysis, with particular emphasis on its  relevance to library operations. The other two instructional packages, designed for non-professional library personnel, consist of workshop materials on reference tools and services and Russian-to-English transliteration. Each of the three packages was tested in the field in libraries of different sizes and with junior-college students.

The use of computers to aid this processing is also discussed. The report views the university as a totality of many diverse information systems which are interdependent and interrelated, a concept which leads to the proposal that a single centralized information system be established using a computerized data base with remote  access by the various users. The possible uses of such a system are discussed. A bibliography of 102 items related to the three basic types of information systems is attached. (JW)",

The problem was first approached by examining the way in which an existing hierarchical classification system classifies things. The study of biological classification lead the research into the specific study of concept formation. At that point a method was devised of applying a set of rules for forming definitions concerning the problem of concept formation. It is first necessary to have a group or set of things that are members of the concept in order to obtain the essential attributes of the concept. Given a set of things, the attributes of the members may then be listed. From the  attributes listed, the essential or significant attributes must be abstracted in order to describe the concept.

Further studies of New Jersey library collections and testing of the standards were carried out by a staff at the Graduate School of Library Service, Rutgers University, with assistance from the State Library staff. Each sub-committee was also requested to reconsider its report in the light of new data and the developing plans for the state. In  addition, a consultant spent two months visiting selected libraries. Based on the information from these activities, it is concluded that three-fourths of New Jersey residents do not have access to printed materials and library services to meet their full educational and informational needs. The basic recommendations are that New Jersey must develop a coordinated network of library service over the state, and adequate financial support must come from both local sources of revenue and the state government. A specific program for library development is outlined in this report. (Author/JB)",

Correct solution of the incomplete matrices, comprised of three pictures in a row and three pictures in a column meeting at a blank intersection, required identification and combination of the common attributes of the row and the column. Concrete, functional, and designative concepts were used in construction of the matrices. Results indicated performance improvement with grade level and a significant interaction between grade and type of matrix. This interaction means that development of the ability to classify the three types of concepts occurs in chronological order: first, concrete, then funcational, and finally,  designative. In general, when errors were made, children seemed to choose the picture representing the type of concept (concrete, functional, or designative) shown by object-sorting studies to be the most frequent mode of categorization. The time required to respond decreased with practice and was negatively correlated with correct matrix solution. Further research should focus on developing a training program for the prerequisite skills necessary to solve the matrices.

An in-school program, including a televised component was designed for all the 5-year-olds entering school in September. A curriculum was devised to encourage the use of the Samoan language. Materials were imported when commercially available products were too expensive or did not reflect Samoan culture. A pilot project with 15 Samoan 5-year-olds was conducted to determine the appropriateness of the curriculum materials, to observe the response of the children and their parents to the program, and to begin to train Samoans who would be teaching. The program was repeated using two groups of children who were observed by 111 Samoan teachers and assistant  principals participating in the 5-week workshop. During August and part of September, 800 Samoan children who would be entering school, participated in the Early Childhood program. The groups averaged 15 in number and were taught by the teachers attending the workshop. Classroom activities were similar to the experimental programs. Early Childhood personnel guided teachers in conducting the successful program. It was felt that the majority of the teachers did a better than average job. The children responded well to the activities, curriculum materials, and the telecast. (JS)",

Readiness is relative, however, not only to the skill, but also to the technique of instruction. Thus, readiness for learning a particular skill by different techniques may come at different times. Attempting to force instruction on a child who is not ready can cause the child either to learn the skill by a more primitive technique (one which has little transfer value to other learning) or to \"turn off\" to learning altogether. \"Turning off\" means extinction or inhibition of behaviors necessary to learning, such as attention and active involvement. Many school learning problems, particularly  those of disadvantaged children, might be avoided if more attention were paid to readiness in the primary grades, when the danger of \"turning off\" because of lack of readiness is greatest. Experimental programs are needed that would actually delay formal instruction (while filling in necessary experiential factors) until readiness is apparent. (MH)",

In 1968 the gap continued to close between white and nonwhite children enrolled in preprimary programs, reflecting the influence of State and Federal preschool projects in poorer areas. As age increased, enrollment rates increased, but the proportion enrolled in private schools decreased. As family income rose, enrollment increased, with the highest percentage in the \"$10,000 and over\" group. A higher percentage of nonwhite children than white children from the lower income groups was enrolled, and for all regions of the  country, nonwhite enrollment was higher. Enrollment rates for nonwhites were higher than for whites in white-collar and manual service occupations. Children in farm families had the lowest enrollment rates, while children in white-collar families had the highest enrollment.

This was a result of a decrease in the death rate for white infants offset by an increase in the nonwhite infant mortality rate. Most U.S. counties which showed excess infant mortality had cities of 50,000 or more. Urban areas had nearly three out of four excess neonatal deaths  (under 28 days) in 1964. Twenty-two percent of the annual excess infant deaths occurred in the 21 largest cities, in areas with a low standard of living characterized by high maternal and infant death risks. Excess neonatal mortality in rural areas was concentrated in non-metropolitan counties. Excess white postneonatal deaths (1-11 months) were most frequent in rural and small urban areas, while excess postneonatal deaths of nonwhites was confined to urban areas. (DR)",

The method used to measure the children's attention was decided on in a pilot study of three measurement techniques, and consisted of an observer rating scale with the periodic introduction of a kaleidoscopic distractor. There were three groups of children observed: 2- and 3-year-old middle class children, 4- and 5-year-old middle class children, and 4- and 5-year-old Mexican-American children from lower income families. Five television programs for preschool children and one set of animated cartoons were viewed. To check for any possible correlation betwee n language development and attentiveness, the children were given the Peabody Picture  Vocabulary Test. The results of the betwee n groups analyses revealed a very high degree of generality in terms of the type of program content that appealed to the age, sex, and social groups studied. Further, there was no correlation between Peabody scores and attention levels, once age was partialled out. Attention level was very low; analysis of the program content showed that children paid greater attention to animated cartoons, introduction to novel objects, and initiation of novel action by the teacher-performer.

To determine what competence at age 6 is, a group of 13 highly competent 6-year-olds of mixed residence, class, and ethnicity were compared to a like group of 13 low competence 6-year-olds and the resultant information was collected in protocols. From this material, a list of differentiating abilities, some social and some nonsocial, was compiled. Highly competent 3-year-olds were found to be more advanced in these abilities than 6-year-olds who were doing poorly. As there was little competence divergence at age one, it was clear that an investigation of the interaction of experience and the  development of competence should be focused on the second and third years of life, (mostly familial experiences). To measure comparative experiential histories, an instrument was developed for codification of moment-to-moment behavior on the basis of inferred purpose. The next step will be the collection and analysis of data from families that have succeeded or failed to develop children of high competence. Also planned are longitudinal studies in which children will follow task sequences designed for optimal development. (MH)",

Half of the groups received a test in which set elements were pictures; the other half had words as set elements. Although there were significant differences betwee n grades for all three types of questions, (a) inclusion and exclusion are understood by a majority of even the youngest children, (b) intersect is understood by a majority of all bu t the youngest children, and (c) union is not understood by the majority of subjects except at  the college level. Those taking the test, in which set elements were pictures, performed better than those taking the test in which set elements were words. These results, in general, support the findings of the Japanese study, although Japanese children as a group scored higher than American children.

Thirty children, aged 12 to 36 months, were observed in three aspects of their environment: Human (family and peers), Static Physical (home and neighborhood), and Range of Experience (situations and activities in child's regular life pattern). On standardized scales or scales devised for this study, children were rated as very well developed or very poorly developed with respect to social and nonsocial competency. Rating scales which assessed patterns and effects of maternal behavior showed that well-developed children can come from crowded or spacious homes and that limited use of resources can be found in  both lower class and middle class homes. The quality rather than quantity of mother-child interaction was significant. After rating mothers on interaction, motivational factors implicit in the mother's behavior, and material resources available to and used by the child, five patterns of maternal behavior were described. These five prototypes were (1) the competent mother, (2) the &quot;almost&quot; mother, (3) the mother who is overwhelmed by life's circumstances, (4) the rigid, controlling mother, and (5) the smothering mother.

Units of maternal behavior were constructed  from the observation protocols and, after several analyses and revisions, 31 categories of maternal behavior were labeled. Preliminary inter-scorer reliability was 80%. Some of the final behavior categories were (1) rewards with object or promise rewards, (2) praises, and (3) ignores. Comparisons were made to give profiles of maternal behavior. The Maternal Behavior Scale will be used to isolate behaviors for longitudinal studies. (DR)",

Children in the experimental kindergarten classes were instructed individually in the use of the rods during each of the 3 years. Both the kindergarten experimental group of 30 children and the kindergarten control group of 23 children were given Test 5 (numbers) of the Metropolitan Readiness Test at the end of the second year. Though both groups did well, experimental students performed significantly higher. The first and second grade groups, who had worked with rods the previous year and two  years respectively, were given the Metropolitan Upper Primary Test. Of 26 children in the experimental first grade group, 73 percent had arithmetic totals scores above 80 percentile of the national norming group. Of 19 children in the experimental second grade group, 68 percent were above the 80 percentile. The high test scores of all three experimental groups indicate that use of the rods does upgrade arithmetic achievement. (JF)",

An Edison Responsive Environment (ERE) is used for research and demonstration purposes. The ERE provides audio-visual-tactile responses to the students'  actions. The machine is programmed to progress from an introductory to a written, visual, and oral question-and-answer phase. The Center's laboratory also contains non-automated equipment. Detailed records are kept on the children's progress. Each child is tested before and after the year's program for physical, emotional, intellectual, and linguistic achievements.

Also involved is a heavy overlay of personality and adjustment problems which lead to behavior difficulties. The cause of this condition is obscure, but several theories prevail. Prenatal development, the perinatal process, and postnatal illness are all factors that may be involved. Hereditary factors may account for a large percentage of cases, as well as sensory and cultural deprivation. Help for the braindamaged child involves giving emotional support, understanding weaknesses and  strengths, and psychiatric help or family counseling when advisable. Special classes for MBD youngsters focus on building skills and self-concept so that the children can return to the regular classroom as soon as possible. The teacher of the MBD child must be emotionally stable, well organized, extremely creative and resourceful, and capable of understanding and empathy. (JF)",

Individual differences of pattern on IPT and FPT indicated that the  ability to perceive structured sound is developed individually.

Reading and spelling tests were administered to the groups several times during the 3-year period. The results showed that the beginner's rate of progress was more rapid with i.t.a. due to the reduced volume of learning required. Children in this group, provided with a less complex alphabetic code, showed superior ability in word-building. Pupils who began with i.t.a. achieved superior scores on t.o. tests 18 months later, and when transferred to t.o. read with greater  accuracy and comprehension than children who began with t.o. By the middle of the third year i.t.a. pupils could spell as well in t.o. as students who began with this system. Therefore, the acquisition of basic reading skills appears to be accelerated with i.t.a., and transfer of training from i.t.a. to t.o. results in a substantial gain in learning to read traditional orthography.

Questions asked which sex performs certain functions, what the child would like in a &quot;pretend&quot; family, and who fulfills certain roles in his own family. The outstanding result was the general lack of difference between the father-absent and father-present children in preceptions of adult roles. Also indicated were (1) father-absent Negro  girls minimized the male role within (but not outside) the family, and (2) Negro boys see men as responsible family participants whether or not a father is present.

        "description":"One of the differences in child development caused by the mother-dominant, father-absent structure of disadvantaged Negro families might be the differential development of resistance to temptation in male and female children. It would be expected that girls would be more resistant than boys, that girls would show no difference whether their father was at home or not, and that father-present boys would be more resistant than father-absent boys. To test these hypotheses, 96 disadvantaged Negro 5-year-olds (evenly divided for sex, father presence, and sex of the experimenter) were taken individually to a room and left alone to play a bean bag game after an experimenter had explained the rules to them and how they could win a prize. Resistance to temptation, in terms of not cheating,  was recorded by a hidden observer. The results failed to support the hypotheses. In one of the few significant findings, father-present children resisted temptation more with an opposite sex rule-giver. Also, there appeared to be a trend for father-absent children to resist temptation more with male rule-givers. This effect is explainable by the concept of deprivation of adult male social rewards.

        "description":"The primary purpose of this study was to determine if an Outward Bound experience was more effective in reducing further delinquent behavior in adjudicated delinquent adolescent boys than a traditional training school experience. One hundred and twenty adolescent delinquent boys were the subjects (60 boys selected from a reception center group and 60 from correctional institutions). Thirty from each group were combined to form an experimental group and a comparison group matched on the basis of age, race, religion, offense for which they were committed, area of residence, and number of prior commitments to the Massachusetts Division of Youth Service. Effectiveness was measured by a comparison of rates of &quot;recidivism&quot; (return to an institution for parole violation or new offense)  between the two matched groups. Three Outward Bound schools located in Colorado, Minnesota, and Maine were utilized which provided the experimental group with physical conditioning; and technical, safety, and team training in a physical environment. The comparison group was treated in a routine manner by the Division of Youth Service. Twenty percent of the experimental group and 37% of the comparison group were subsequently identified as recidivists. Background variables and possibly the unique differences in the 3 Outward Bound schools are contributors to the differences found. The results suggest that for some delinquents an Outward Bound experience is a desirable short term alternative to traditional institutional care and is an effective means of promoting positive change.

Information gathering procedures included: (1) the administration of questionnaires to all students and teachers in 10 selected community high schools; (2) an interview with all parents of seniors in the selected high schools; (3) interviews with selected community leaders; and (4) a review and classification of educational news over a one-year period in local newspapers. Results of the study indicated that more  students planned to attend college in communities that stressed going to college as a key to later success. Also, family influences were found to play a large part in the educational and occupational aspirations of young people. It was recommended that an attempt be made on a state-wide basis to increase aid and support of local youth in low-income communities where educational goals are not emphasized. A bibliography, statistical data, and sample questionnaires are included. (EV)",

        "description":"The proliferation of community power structure studies and their results have led many social researchers to the conclusion that the principle explanation for many diverse findings rests with the disciplinary bias of the researchers. The purpose of this study was to make some tentative effort at explaining power structure characteristics as a function of community characteristics, or to show that differentiated communities have differentiated power structures. Two small Texas communities were selected for examination with a population range of 8,500 to 11,500 because they differed consistently on the following characteristics: (1) ethnic and occupation composition, (2) occupational mobility, (3) metropolitan influence, and (4) population increase. Data from related research was  also utilized for comparative analysis. The results tentatively support the hypothesis that as the characteristics of a community vary, the visibility characteristic of the power structure also varies. The findings also suggest that additional research would indicate similar relationships between power structure characteristics and community characteristics. (DK)",

There remains, however, considerable variation among the migration patterns for counties in different parts of the region. In all, nearly one-quarter of the 190 counties recorded net migration gains and an almost equal proportion reported net migration losses between 1960 and 1966. The discussion on some possible explanations for the marked change in migration patterns considers industrialization and urbanization, fertility decline, increased enrollments in colleges, and possible errors in the population estimates methodology. The paper concludes by relating the findings to the broader  context of rural-to-urban migration as a public policy issue. (Author/DK)",

About 90% of these relocatees were Mexican Americans. Sixteen months after the first families were relocated and four months after the last families were relocated there were 75.58% of the trainees still on the job. The purpose of this project was to study the adjustment which takes place as a result of retraining and relocation, and to determine what sociological factors represented the best predictors for success in the program including retention after retraining. Education level and previous occupation proved to be the best  predictors of success in the program. The major conclusion drawn from the study was that selected external factors are usable as predictors of ability to retrain and relocate, but conclusions based on a priori conditions are at best tentative.

The major findings of recent research related to the achievement of Indian students in school are summarized in an effort to describe the extent of their disadvantagement. Nearly all of the studies reviewed showed the Indian student to be far behind other students in achievement. On standardized tests, Indian children tend to do very poorly when compared with state and national scores compiled by the rest of the relevant stratum of the school population. Research has also indicated that generally the gap between the levels of achievement of the white and Indian students widens as they progress through school. High dropout rates among the Indian students were also revealed. The dropout  rate for the Indian female is considerably higher than it is for the Indian male student. Although a smaller proportion than white students graduate, Indian high school graduates have a high percentage enrolled in academic or vocational programs upon graduation. However, later studies revealed that many of these Indians were unemployed or underemployed. (CM)",

The curriculum in Indian schools in the area, geared primarily to white middle-class standards, is not relevant to the students, Textbooks and standardized tests, based on experiences common to a white culture, hold little meaning for Eskimo students. Teachers unfamiliar with Eskimo traditions and culture are unable to understand or communicate with the native people. Since the existing curriculum in Bristol Bay schools ignores the students' cultural background, the author considers the creation of a unified multi-semester social studies curriculum about the native heritage as a method of dealing with students' problems. This paper, as a  first step in creating such a curriculum, can serve as a source material for information about the Bristol Bay area, and is directed toward the development of a one semester secondary level course in native history and culture. A major portion of the paper consists of material about the history, geography, anthropology, archaeology, language (Eskimo and Aleut), and folklore of the area. The concluding chapters contain a suggested course outline, sample lesson plans, and a list of native resource persons.

Reservation families tend to be large, inadequately educated, living in sub-standard houses, and economically depressed. Although the Indians generally agree on the problems of reservation life, they feel a strong attachment to the reservation. It is indicated that prolonged residence in a city does not extinguish the desire to return to the reservation. Faced with the recognized problems, the Indians, particularly the older ones, do not want vast changes in their reservations. Indians attitudes toward  industrialization, whether positive or negative, may influence economic development.

Dr. William B. Stapp, University of Michigan, discusses the need for and major objectives of environmental education, and suggests points to consider in relation to the curriculum. Dr. Thomas M. Stephens, University of Pittsburgh, discusses methods of using environmental conditions for language acquisition. Emphasis is placed on external conditions which influence learning, i. e., teacher attitudes, instructional skills, and stimuli available for responding behavior. Instructional materials for outdoor education is treated by Dr. Carl S. Johnson of Ohio State University. He also lists recommendations  for teachers seeking materials for outdoor education. Dr. Mary Harbage, Wright State University, relates outdoor education to language arts offering various suggestions for creating learning opportunities. Possibilities for developing outdoor education concepts on school grounds are given. (CM)",

        "description":"There are presently 2,100,000 acres of National Forest land legally designated as wilderness under the Wilderness Act of 1964, in the Northwestern States of Washington and Oregon. This paper presents the results of a study conducted to find out what kinds of persons visit wilderness, the values and codes of behavior they associate with wilderness use, and their feelings about some hypothetical policies and guidelines that might be used in the management of these areas. Long questionnaires concerning these issues were sent to a sample of 1,950 recorded wilderness users. Wilderness visitation typically occurred in more highly educated, small family and friendship groups who take about five 2- to 3-day trips per year. About 30 percent (400) belonged to 218 conservation groups. A  scaling technique was used to identify a hierarchy of wilderness users ranging from wilderness-purists to those more urban or convenience oriented. Those who were more wilderness-purist in attitude reacted differently to some of the statements (53 on wilderness management and 22 on codes of behavior) suggested in the questionnaire. The appendix contains a statistical summary of the responses to the questionnaire and an explanation of the gamma statistics used to measure the association between wildernism (wilderness-purist concepts) scores and response to individual questionnaire statements.

Significantly more white children were promoted to grade 2, and among those promoted, white children were significantly higher on total reading and IQ. When IQ was statistically controlled, Negro and white  children differed significantly in reading. For white children teacher rating, readiness, and IQ were about equally good predictors of total reading achievement.

A critical review of some of the classical research which has influenced current thinking about how words are recognized is presented along with a discussion of some of the errors which can be found in these studies. A five-stage model of how beginning readers learn to recognize words is described as including unusual characteristics of words, word shape cues, phonics, context, and sight words. Contrasts are made among recent experimental findings concerning cues used in word recognition and some commonly held beliefs on the subject. Results of recent studies indicate that children prefer to use first letters, final letters, middle letters, and word shape (in that order of preference) as cues to word  identification. Discrimination studies indicate that children select the easiest cue for word recognition and that initial training on a list of words with low discriminability which forces attention on all letters, in contrast to training on a word list of high discriminability, encourages the child to adopt a strategy which provides a better basis for transfer to learning new words. Although letter-name knowledge does not seem to have any beneficial effect on reading, there is evidence that letter-sound training does have a positive effect. A bibliography is included. (WB)",

The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children was administered in December and the Stanford Achievement Test, Primary I Battery, in May. In May of the subjects' third-grade year the Stanford Word Reading and the Stanford Paragraph Meaning subtests were given. For first grade the best predictor of both word meaning and paragraph meaning was the Olson Reading Readiness Test. A combination of the Metropolitan  Readiness Test and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children was the best predictor for third-grade reading achievement.

The specific aim of the study was to assess the possibility that a deficit in cross-modality matching might be potentially useful as a diagnostic and predictive indicator of the rate at which adults learn to read. Subjects were 178 adults enrolled in basic reading classes in Flint, Michigan. Prior to collection of data, all students were given the Adult Basic Reading Inventory. Although only 31 of the subjects remained for the retest, the proportion of dropouts was about the same for the original high and low groups. The word recognition tasks involved the comparison of words under four conditions and two types of judgments: (1)  auditory-auditory match, (2) auditory-visual match, (3) visual-auditory match, and (4) visual-visual match. One judgment involved responding to two words and indicating whether they were the same or different. The other judgment involved the presentation of one word, then the presentation of two words, with the subject indicating which of the two words was the same as the stimulus word. Results showed that the better reader made more use of the visual-visual match; the less proficient reader utilized cross-modality comparisons. References and tables are included. (WB)",

Specific simulation processes, including sound films, audio tapes, overhead transparencies, and instructional booklets, provided teachers with a knowledge of, and the ability to administer, an informal reading inventory. A three-group-post-test-only control group research design utilized three stratified random samples of 32 teachers each from grades 2 through 5 in a large suburban school district. Pupils were randomly selected from each teacher's classroom. Differences between the grade level of pupils' readers and their performance on McCracken's  Standard Reading Inventory constituted the measure of teacher awareness. Findings indicated that this inservice program was effective only when conducted before school begins. Those teachers who participated in the program later in the school year were no more aware of pupils' instructional levels than those who did not participate. References are included. (Author/CM)",

The oral reading at sight which is typically required in the informal inventory is indicated as conflicting with suggested curricular practice for reading instruction. The errors on four rereadings for an 11-year-old boy are tabulated and show a dramatic improvement on rate and accuracy, as would be expected. Such factors as the individual's interest in the content and desire to read are discussed.

Computer histogram analyses of raw score data were made by class and grade level for each school and for the combined schools and were then considered in terms of the percentage of pupils in each grade scoring at or above grade placement level on the SRDT. Findings showed that visual analysis skills tended to develop at a rate consistent with normal  growth, while other skills developed more slowly.

        "description":"The idea of pseudo-classification based on external relevance was introduced and compared with the usual classifications using associative techniques. A general model for an information retrieval system using term classification was described. A set of operators for adjusting pseudo-classifications and preventing their deterioration was derived for a particular match function conforming with this model. Pseudo-classifications were used for prediction of relevant documents and for the evaluation of retrieval systems with respect to their theoretical optimum. The concept of improvability of a retrieval model with respect to its constituent submodels was introduced and elaborated upon. (RR)",

Two viewpoints were taken in evaluation. One measured the movement of queries toward the optimum query as defined by Rocchio; the other measured the retrieval experienced by the user during the feedback process. Both methods indicated that relevance feedback was effective. When only relevant document vectors were used, the algorithms provided equally good retrieval. Algorithms using nonrelevant document vectors for feedback improved the retrieval obtained by these users without requiring additional relevance judgments. No single feedback strategy was found to give superior retrieval for all queries.  However, all relevance feedback algorithms tested improved the average retrieval obtained. (RR)",

Formal evaluation focused on an intensive workshop for urban teachers given through one academic year. Comparison of classroom behavior of the teachers before and after the workshop indicated  that they learned to make greater use of outdoor resources, and other observations indicated the attainment of other objectives of the program. Workshops, including some for preservice teachers, and other project activities are described and evaluated in less detail.

Five hypotheses were tested, including one related to students' general understanding of science, and another related to students' views of astronomy, arithmetic, scientists, and learning experiences in science. Instruments used were Test on Understanding Science (TOUS), two locally constructed subject-matter achievement tests, and an experimental designed semantic differential instrument to measure children's perceptions of science. The student population (43 boys and 49 girls) consisted of the entire fifth grade in the University of Chicago Laboratory School during the school year 1963-64. All students were  taught for ten weeks by the same person, a science teacher at the Laboratory School. Major findings of the study were: (1) students were moderately successful in mastering some of the topics taught; (2) students' general knowledge of astronomy increased during the ten weeks of instruction; (3) the effect of studying these materials on general understanding of science were slight; (4) studying the materials did affect the students' view of astronomy, but did not affect their view of learning experiences in science.

The contract was directed at the development of a computer-based Chemical Compound Registry System through the buildup of machine and manual files of chemical structural representations, chemical nomenclature, molecular formulas, and bibliographic citations associated with the registere d compounds. To meet this objective the contract called for the registration of compounds from several sources. Progress was made in the number of compounds registered  from all sources.

Materials were combined from introductory college courses in biology, chemistry, and physics. A revised lecture and laboratory syllabus was prepared incorporating improvements suggested after a pilot study of the first year course. Advantages of the combined course are that it shortens the total time spent in covering the material (by about 16%), allows flexibility in student program planning, and permits treatment of interdisciplinary topics and a spiral development of concepts. Formal evaluation focussed on the comparison of attitudes of students in the experimental and conventional courses. The results suggested that the few significant differences found may have been  related to the quality of individual instructors rather than to differences in courses. Appendices include a detailed two-year course outline, a copy of the attitude test used, and a summary of the evaluation results. (EB)",

        "description":"Examination of potential corrosive effects which the use of instructional technology could have on the teaching profession indicates that there are three problem areas where alternatives exist. First, educational objectives should be the criteria used in assessing the new approaches, the basic question being not how much use can be made of the devices but what their contributions are to the outcomes of education. Second, standards in such areas as class size, teacher qualifications, and instructional budgets must be maintained or strengthened, with technological devices such as statewide television networks following as supplements to instruction, not as substitutes for quality standards. Third, indications that the new media and appliances will provide a variety of new  educational roles (leading to increased specialization) and will require additional personnel (thus increasing costs) have resulted in pressure to use varying pay grades for staff members. The proposed vertically differentiated staffing patterns, hierarchies in which each teacher is paid according to the role he plays, will lead to divisiveness among teachers and will extend the disjunction between teachers and administrators. A preferred alternative is the increased use of paraprofessionals and a more flexible horizontal differentiation based on differing assignments and tasks with personnel still being paid according to the level of their academic degree and years of experience.

Chi square and analysis of variance tests were used in analyzing the 493 (73%) responses. Included in the questionnaire were several items used to develop a scale entitled \"Belief in Traditional Sociopolitical Values\" (BTSV). Findings indicated that teachers vary considerably in their belief in traditional values. Teachers scoring low on the BTSV scale, as opposed to those with high scores, (1) are more willing to discuss all controversial issues in the classroom; (2) use instructional materials from several sources, thus promoting the expression of  divergent and often conflicting points of view; and (3) demonstrate greater ability to distinguish fact from opinion. Examination of demographic factors revealed that (1)teachers who major in fields other than social sciences and humanities as undergraduates tend to score high on the scale, and (2) those with high BTSV scores are more often physical education, or natural science majors who attened smaller colleges and have had more years of teaching experience. Sex, tenure status, type of community, and level of graduate education do not seem to be related to BTSV scores. (SP 003 022 is a related document.) (JS)",

        "description":"A study sought to cause a change in the question-phrasing practices of 40 students enrolled in elementary science methods classes. A method of instruction involving the analysis of videotaped classroom lessons illustrative of four categories (cognitive-memory, convergent, divergent, and evaluative) of poorly phrased and effectively phrased questions was designed and used as the basis of seven periods of instruction designed to cause a significant change from a greater proportion of low level (cognitive memory) questions, contructed by the students for elementary school science lessons, to a greater proportion of high level (divergent) questions. Questions constructed by students on pre- and posttests were evaluated by seven judges. Data analysis included use of the \"sign\" test  and chi square to test the significance of change. Findings led to conclusions that the ability of prospective elementary teachers to construct a greater proportion of effectively phrased questions can be improved by instruction, that they can learn to construct a greater proportion of divergent questions for science, and that a method of instruction employing the analysis of videotaped classroom lessons can be effective for causing such change. (Included are the measurement instruments, criteria for analyzing questions, transcriptions of videotaped lessons, bibliography, discussion of implications, and recommendations.) (JS)",

Stratemeyer to the field of student teaching, and Normand R. Bernier, University of Wisconsin, sketches the social and political turmoil forming the context for ferment in teacher education. The three parts of the lecture are presented by former students of Stratemeyer. In discussing \"The Urban Crisis and Teaching: Getting Ourselves Together,\" Monroe D. Cohen, Association for Childhood Education International, suggests five guidelines for action: learning to communicate with another culture, seeing educational problems in a broader social context, utilizing paraprofessionals, capitalizing on concern about irrelevant curricula, and building  trust in a world of alienation. John B. Ervin, Washington University, St. Louis, analyzes \"Freedom and Repression in the Higher Education Establishment,\" listing characteristic social changes in the academic setting, basic assumptions being attacked, and implications of the crisis for the establishment. In \"Activism and Teacher Education\" Martin Haberman, Rutgers, notes ten ways in which the new student protests differ from those of the past and predicts that resultant changes in teacher education will include the complete individualization and student administration of college programs and the control of inservice programs by professional associations and citizen groups.

Faculty receiving the experimental instruction were evaluated using the Purdue Rating Scale for Instruction and the Stanford Teacher Competence Appraisal Guide as pre- and posttests. No significant changes were recorded in their classroom behavior, but their increased interest and knowledge of current developments in classroom methodology led to the recommendation that the program be continued with proposed treatments in film and TV methods, test construction, curriculum organization, and instructional objectives.

A study of &quot;change concepts&quot; led to the conclusion that higher education and public school personnel (those persons most affected by the change) must be involved to the fullest extent possible in the consortium's decisionmaking processes; the Laboratory would serve primarily as a catalyst in the distillation of new ideas, providing financial support to encourage institutions to undertake a high-risk, innovative program. A five-stage plan  provides both a structure for the cooperative solution to problems and a set of principles to guide interaction among group members. Committees composed of a representative from each participating institution were formed to develop and conduct the program in each city; they successfully resolved such issues as financial responsibility, program content, faculty selection, and academic policy.

The model was separated into two interdependent parts, the instructional model and the management model. For the instructional model, teacher behaviors were systematically derived and specified for the prime objective of teacher education (preparing teachers who can bring about appropriate changes in pupil behavior) as well as for noninstructional tasks, and instructional guidelines were written for the inclusion in the model of instructional systems technology, behavior evaluation strategies, a personalization process  leading to the development of a personal teaching style, and preservice mastery of teaching competencies. A systematically designed management model, served by a computer-based information management system, controls the evaluation and adaptive functions and costing data. Model and program specifications were developed for the instructional content and organization of the program based on analyses of predictions for 1970, providing for a three-phase program (foundations, laboratory, and practicum) to be integrated into general and inservice education. Content specifications were also derived for the management model. (The complete report is contained in ED 026 305-ED 026 331.) (SM)",

The program was based on predictions about society in 1978 made by examining present trends toward urbanization, population explosion, and technology utilization. Inferences for elementary school education were made from these predictions and used as the basis of a task analysis of teaching for 1978. Five essential, interrelated teaching behaviors were derived from task analysis (the formulation of measurable behavioral objectives,  selection and organization of a student-centered curriculum, use of appropriate teaching strategies, evaluation of learner outcomes in terms of behavioral changes, and acceptance of professional responsibility as a teacher), and a three-phase program (underclass, preservice, and inservice) was devised to develop these behaviors in teachers. In addition to the teacher education components of the model program, facilitating components such as admissions and screening procedures, a computerized management control system, and staff utilization and development patterns were devised.

Six issues have most relevance to a more inclusive position: The union should review its resolution regarding certification based on &quot;general education&quot; in light of changes in the professional and academic specialization components of most preservice programs. On the question of temporary or emergency certification, the AFT should remain flexible but encourage its locals to establish standards or floors since the issue is so closely related to local needs. On the question of certification renewal, it must resolve problems regarding such projected innovations as evaluation of competency, levels of certification, and differentiated staffing. It must face issues  related to &quot;certification by examination&quot; and to &quot;program-approval certification,&quot; a better approach than the traditional course credit counting though it also poses problems. Finally, the AFT must study its role as the teachers union, not only regarding the issue of who shall determine certification standards but of what the real purposes of certification are. Apparently, qualified teachers should be licensed for a 3-year probationary period (to prevent incompetent persons from becoming teachers), but that certification requirements should not be manipulated to adjust the supply and demand of teachers or to enforce continued updating of professional knowledge and skills.

An evaluation of competence is acceptable if it means self-evaluation and peer-evaluation; the ideal of horizontally differentiated staff has value if no discrimination exists, financial or otherwise. AFT has taken some action on tenure and merit pay, and AFT-negotiated contracts often contain provisions related to inservice training, many based on the idea that forced certification renewal in order to offset obsolescence is unwarranted,  unnecessary, and unprofessional for teachers. A &quot;continuous progress alternative&quot; is based on the ideal of personalized and individualized education and on the belief that teachers should assess their own strengths and weaknesses and establish their own self-improvement programs in a professional way. Among other things these programs should include contractual arrangements for travel, books and materials, and structured and unstructured workshops and institutes on newly conceived techniques. AFT collective bargaining contracts must continue to include as many specific aspects of this general alternative as possible. (JS)",

        "description":"\"Teacher evaluation,\" a perennial educational red herring, is not a valid means of significantly improving educational quality. Raising the level of teaching performance nationwide will first require (1) a doubling of labor costs to establish a manageable maximum class size and to reduce teaching hours so that teachers have the time and energy to be true professionals, and (2) a raising of entry standards through an improved process of teacher selection and certification which should include greater academic content in teacher training, a master's degree, examination before internship, and a 2- or 3-year internship with gradual assumption of full teaching load under supervision by training teachers who also teach a reduced load. When progress is made in those areas, we might  begin to pursue other ways of improving teacher performance. Most abuses of the teacher evaluation process arise from attempts by administrators and supervisors to use their evaluative power to enforce discipline and conformity within the school bureaucracy. Some independent means of evaluation could be devised which would do more than merely pass judgment on the worth of a teacher. For example, a panel of teachers, supervisors, and college people not employed by the district might observe a teacher for perhaps a week, interview him, review records, and give a written evaluation, available to the teacher, which would emphasize his strengths and weaknesses.

        "description":"Aside from poor salaries and fringe benefits, the basic causes of teacher dropout are frustration and lack of status, both of which are greatly dependent on teacher workload. Components of workload are (1) a rigid school day and 35-hour week differing from freer patterns in higher-status occupations; (2) oversize classes which reduce teaching effectiveness thus increasing job dissatisfaction; (3) the lack of authority and facilities to deal with disruptive students and those disadvantaged by social class or reading ability; and (4) forced extracurricular activities and nonclassroom assignments which dissipate professional talent and energy. Many who leave teaching go not to private industry but to nonteaching jobs in education where salaries are only slightly higher but the  wear-and-tear factors more favorable. Collective bargaining contracts have done little to change workload because even slight improvements are expensive. (To establish a four-period instructional day and a 25-pupil class size limit would require doubling the present workforce.) Attempted remedies have included demonstration programs (which may solve problems but double costs) and less expensive but not entirely successful team teaching and modular programing experiments. The use of paraprofessionals holds more promise, but better teacher organizations must be built to produce funds at all levels of government and to establish a system of priorities aimed at making teaching more attractive and productive.

        "description":"This study proposed that a principal's behavior is affected by the feedback he receives from teachers and by his own commitment to change his behavior. The behaviors of 206 elementary school principals (volunteers) were rated by teachers at the beginning and end of the study; the teachers also used the rating scale to describe an ideal principal. The principals were then placed in one of four feedback groups: the first to receive both &quot;actual&quot; feedback ratings of their own behaviors) and &quot;ideal&quot; feedback (ratings of an ideal principal); the second to receive only &quot;ideal&quot; feedback; the third, only &quot;actual&quot;; and the fourth, no feedback. Moreover, the principals in each group either had not been asked to commit themselves to change or had been asked to choose one of two areas in  which to commit themselves--task assistance behaviors or personal support behaviors. It was hypothesized that group 1 would change more positively (approach the ideal) than the other groups and that group 2 would similarly surpass groups 3 and 4. It was also hypothesized that commitment would cause more positive change than no commitment, particularly in the behavioral area selected by the principal. Although covariance analysis of scores did not support the hypotheses, chi square analysis and change patterns suggest that feedback, especially &quot;ideal&quot; alone or &quot;ideal&quot; and &quot;actual&quot;, promote positive change and that &quot;actual&quot; feedback alone and solicited commitments to change may inhibit such change.

The aim was to establish cooperative arrangement between public and private schools whereby programs in the improvement of intercultural understanding can be developed, programs which could serve as models for other schools. Discussion and postseminar questionnaires and letters produced these findings: that interest in intercultural problems is great, that such problems exist within as well as across national boundaries, and that U.S. black-white problems might be approached as intercultural problems, but that teachers lack adequate background, preservice training, financial  means for study, materials, resources, and support of school administrators to teach effectively in this area. Rigid departmental structure and western ethnocentric bias are also inhibitive factors. Intercultural education might be improved by the establishment of (1) programs and a pilot information center to develop materials at the secondary school level; (2) summer institutes, conferences, and fellowships for inservice teachers; (3) pilot projects to set up a preservice program and a regional office to coordinate cooperative programs between public and private schools.

Unverified assumptions about the value of research assistantships impede the use of empirical analysis to advance knowledge about critical elements of research training. Research assistantships are not inherently valuable; rather, what a person does on his assistantship is related to what he does later in his career. Research assistants in education tend to engage in research significantly less than their counterparts in other fields. A dilemma basic to managing  assistantships is the \"conflict of interest\" for the senior researcher needing help in menial tasks. Assistants themselves are ambivalent about the value of their work. If we accept the potential value of the research assistantship in training educational researchers and want to maximize it, then we need to accelerate assistantship opportunities, recruit students earlier in their program, and limit their tenure, assigning them primarily to research projects rather than to bureaus or individual faculty members. Their experiences should be planned and controlled by those most centrally involved in the conduct of research training programs. (Ten references are cited.) (JS)",

The intensive group experience can result in improved communication and interpersonal relationships (not only, for instance, between student teachers and cooperating teachers, but also in their interaction with professional colleagues, pupils, and family). Schools generally have not recognized in a curricular or formal sense the fact that feelings are learned behaviors. With inner-city youth particularly, the ability to verbalize is essential to the process of becoming aware, but we generally have failed to apply the verbal symbolic method to interpersonal, psychological type problems. Educators have tended to be skeptical of such techniques as T groups and sensitivity  training, partly because group processes have not been conceptualized as learning activities and partly because caution has not been exercised in their structuring and facilitation. Some suggestions: The group activity should be regarded and described as a teaching-learning situation, each participant being encouraged to behave normally. It should be made clear what is to be done and what to expect. Emphasis should be on the description of behavior, not on its evaluation. Groups should function in a natural everyday environment without gimmicks; membership should not vary from meeting to meeting; and planning must provide adequate time and opportunity for involvement by each member.

        "description":"In describing parts of a Higher Education Act Title III \"Cooperative Project for Strengthening of Developing Institutions,\" I wish to emphasize the development of organic cooperation among the institutions. Not only the three small state colleges, but also the developed institution (West Virginia University) has profited from the project. Vehicles which have promoted true cooperative involvement have been (1) summer writing groups (to design instructional packages) composed of institutional representatives with the ability to cooperate and with enough power to make commitments; and (2) written commitments by each institution's full-time program coordinator to such responsibilities as the development of specific instructional modules and the field testing of others. The joint  production and sharing of video tape recordings and techniques was a successful entry point to building organic cooperation. Future sharing of major purchases and services will include a project using the tele-lecture system, the wire-blackboard device, and computer-assisted instruction. Data, after two years, from student tests and from laboratory and programed instruction experiments are promising. Comparison of old and new syllabuses indicate that instructors are attending better to behavioral objectives, evaluation procedures, sequence, and scope, and are building in procedures for active student involvement and corrective feedback. The project has been the organizing center for constructive change. (JS)",

The program involved (1) cognitive learning, (2) practicum experiences involving the theory or academic content, and (3) personal development in understanding of self in relation to others as demonstrated in the professional role. Academic areas were &quot;Group Dynamics,&quot;&quot;Cultural Background of Mexican-Americans and Its Influence on Language,&quot; and &quot;Learning Processes&quot; (which emphasized differences in learning patterns of disadvantaged children, particularly with regard to language). Participants worked on&quot;task group projects&quot; to attack real problems being experienced in the schools; these will continue during the school year. Other activities included &quot;sensitivity groups&quot; to enhance understanding of self and others, videotape role playing, and &quot;real&quot; parent-teacher interviews. Evaluation measures, a pre-post self-concept survey and three questionnaires, indicate that the program achieved its objectives as nearly as possible in the first phase, particularly in the movement of participant attitudes (toward their students and toward planning programs for them) from closed-mindedness to understanding and openness.

        "description":"A survey of 170 school districts was conducted to determine the type and amount of teacher participation in school policy decisionmaking. Ninety of these districts engage in collective negotiation in which teachers are represented exclusively by one teacher organization. In the remaining 80 districts, either a teacher organization is not recognized or teacher representation is on a proportional, separate, or council basis. Other variables considered during sampling and data analysis were the affiliation of local teacher organizations, school system size, and state laws. Questionnaire and interview responses indicate that collective negotiation enlarges teacher participation in decisionmaking and necessitates role adjustments by teachers, administrators, and school boards. (The  latter two groups, however, have retained areas of discretion.) Responses also show that collective negotiations are concerned primarily with personnel policy and secondarily with the implementation of educational policy. However, teachers are using collective negotiation to create alternative and more suitable procedures for making decisions about the development and evaluation of educational policies. Finally, the survey revealed that unions are more active than their association counterparts and that teacher participation is greatest in large school systems in which unions hold exclusive representation and where state laws encourage collective negotiation.

Aptitude tests for cognitive factors plus specially developed audiovisual tests were administered to 121 intern teachers randomly assigned to three treatment groups: a film-mediated modeling treatment (a filmed portrayal of analytic questioning); a written modeling treatment (a text of the film sound track); and a control treatment which received no model, but went through all other steps including initial instructions and microteaching pretest and two cycles of models, rehearsal, and microteaching. The criterion performances assessed by trained raters  included the frequency, variety, and quality of analytic questions used in three separate teaching sessions in addition to scores on two written posttests. Instructional treatment main effects as well as aptitude by treatment interactions were investigated using analysis of variance and comparison of regression slopes. Findings, which supported hypotheses, suggest that the rate and level of learning of a specific teaching strategy varies as a function of model presentation (film-mediated modeling most effective: no modeling least effective); and that the effectiveness of instructional methods varies from S to S with such differences being related to trainee aptitudes.

Field tests in Minicourse (MC) 1 (questioning skill at the elementary school level) indicated behaviorally significant changes in teachers and led to the development of four additional models designed to test the generalizability of the minicourse principle to other teaching skills. Other minicourses developed were MC 2, teaching the kindergarten child with minimal language experience; MC 3, questioning in a high school class discussion; MC 5, tutoring in elementary school mathematics; and MC 8, organizing the kindergarten for independent learning and small group instruction.  Preliminary field tests, comparing pre- and postcourse behavior, indicate all of the courses yielded significant teacher change and succeeded in providing teachers with a generalized approach for systematically dealing with problem areas. For example, MC 2 helped teachers to solve language problems systematically which previously were ignored or handled ineffectually; MC 3 increased pupil talk and decreased teacher talk in class discussions through judicious use of questioning techniques; MC 5 and MC 8 helped teachers to apply a systematic rather than hit-or-miss approach in structuring different types of learning situations.

Results of the study revealed that the average number of words in a communication unit ranged from 6.99 to 12.37; that the subject-verb-complement or subject-verb-direct object pattern appeared most  frequently; that words and phrases were used most commonly as movables; and that subordination complexities were not above the children's grasp.

A technologically-oriented civilization pressures students to devalue word connotation in favor of denotative exactitude. To counteract this tendency, teachers should adopt for themselves and instill in their students a regard for the multiple uses and meanings of language. By teaching a subject called \"language-and-literature\" and concentrating on the uses of language in literary works, teachers can develop students' language skills to permit the fullest self-expression. Poetry and prose-fantasy are useful subjects of study because the discovery of meaning depends on understanding metaphoric expression and the precise relationship of words. Particular activities  for students to increase their comprehension and expressive ability are writing from the viewpoint of a particular author, writing prose paraphrases of a poem, analyzing the linguistic changes in variant versions of the same poem, studying symbols in fantasy, writing poems, and writing directions for particular tasks.

Eliot's treatment of the apathetic society and the isolated individual, his concern for spirituality over sensuality, and his plea for collective responsibility for evil are themes that can be traced in his major works through formalistic and historical criticism. Simon and Garfunkel's &quot;Dangling Conversation&quot; can introduce students to the isolation and ineffectuality of &quot;The Hollow Men.&quot; A comparison between what students expect to find in a love song and what they find in &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&quot; can lead the students into the message of the poem. An in-depth study of the relationship of &quot;Murder in the Cathedral&quot; to Greek drama and medieval morality plays,  as well as intensive work in diction and prosody, can be rewarding. Oral reading of Eliot's works can illustrate one of his recurring ideas--modern man's apathy because of a need for spiritual values. Once the central themes have been established, students can broaden their understanding by reading thematically similar works by other writers, such as Camus, Kafka, and Yeats. (LH)",

Classrooms must become centers of intellectual ferment, with teachers providing &quot;reference, related, and multimedia materials.&quot; The school librarian should serve as an instructional materials consultant to the teacher. As textbooks are phased out, additional money for a broad range of instructional materials will become available. Long range program budgeting, however, needs to include sufficient state and federal funds for additional materials and clerical help. With a shift from content learning to process  learning, pupils can be released to become self-educating individuals. (JM)",

The curriculum consisted of 4 major unit, composed of individual study modules, on popular media and on visual, aural, and verbal communication. Each study module began by having the student confront some kind of artistic experience presented as close to the artist's intentions as possible. This was followed by activities which encouraged student examination of the experience and which led to a second experience culminating in an evaluative project. A psychological inventory, a design judgment test, and a musical sensitivity test were  administered to the experimental and three comparison classes at the beginning and conclusion of the semester. It could not be demonstrated that the experimental curriculum had significantly affected tolerance, flexibility, or specific facets of art or music. However, on the basis of student self-portraits, it was concluded that there was a significant enhancement of self-concept.

Richard J. Colwell's &quot;Elementary Music Achievement Test&quot; was administered to randomly selected sixth-grade pupils from 22 public school systems (62 classrooms) representing both urban and non-urban areas. Only one of the school systems tested had a mean score equal to or exceeding the mean of the test standardization sample. An instructional provisions inventory questionnaire, sent to all the state school systems, revealed that few provided adequately for music instruction, but urban systems rated better than non-urban ones. A comparison between achievement scores and instructional provisions of the six systems  with highest scores and the six with lowest scores indicated that a direct relationship exists between the two factors. The conclusion was made that in both achievement and instructional provisions for music, Tennessee elementary schools are deficient. (JM)",

Also studied were the effects of teacher background, fathers' education levels, students' political preferences, and the time, extent and pattern of instruction on the change in students' attitudes toward democratic values. To measure any change in thought, the Allen Scale of Beliefs was administered before and after the instruction period to 1612 students from four Florida counties. Findings revealed that gains in positive attitudes toward democracy (1) were generally offset for most students by the negative effects produced, (2) were higher for students whose fathers were college educated than for  students whose fathers had less education, (3) were negative for students expressing an &quot;other&quot; political preference, (4) were higher among students receiving instruction from teachers with average backgrounds than from those with above average or superior backgrounds, and (5) were little affected by class size or organization.

In the first survey, 30 educators agreed that the seminars had been effective in producing curriculum revisions and that they had changed teacher attitudes. In the other, 96 participants representing all seminars indicated that they (1) responded favorably to the \"status and involvement roles\" afforded by the seminars, (2) took part, in their own schools, in the preparation of social  studies curriculums and of units on democracy and totalitarianism, (3) brought fresh ideas into the curriculums from the seminar, (4) applied the informed opinions of university specialists and scholars to their educational situations, and (5) incorporated new materials and approaches directly into the social studies curriculum.

The unit is structured chronologically to indicate that the history of liberty is largely the history of legal procedures. It notes changes in the understanding of individual rights from early manifestations in England, through the 18th century American contributions in the Bill of Rights, to the Fourteenth Amendment. To further illuminate how legal processes affect the acquisition of human liberties, the 1963 &quot;Gideon v. Wainwright&quot; decision and the right to counsel are discussed.

Sections of the unit discuss (1) the religious, economic, and political uses that the first generation of Puritans made of the idea of God's providence, (2) the jeremiads that the second generation of Puritans heard from the pulpit and their responses to these warnings, and (3) the ways that the third generation justified the Salem witch trials which contributed to the modification of the idea of God's providence. Included are excerpts from Salem court records, from 17th century religious tracts  and sermons, and from the writings of men who shaped Puritan thinking--such as John Winthrop, Increase and Cotton Mather, Samuel Sewall, and John Danforth.

This program, funded under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, offers low income college students the opportunity for full time study by providing part time jobs. Students from Morgan State College were assigned to Baltimore schools as classroom assistants, clerical workers, and as aides in miscellaneous jobs. Supervisor ratings and questionnaires completed by aides assessed whether the aides gained anything from the experience and whether they helped the school system. In general, the aides felt the work was valuable to them and the school principals rated the aides as helpful in providing needed services.

Both the regular school year and the summer programs are directed toward development of ability to adjust in society. The school offers an academic curriculum as well as special emphasis on home economics and business education. Evaluation was based on interviews with staff and on the California Test of Personality administered to the girls. Findings show that the institution has &quot;an excellent record of success&quot; with the girls. Title I funds enabled the school to enrich its program. Test results indicate that the girls are probably more asocial than antisocial and therefore capable of change.  Suggestions for improvement, most of which would involve increases in funds, are included. A policy of pre- and post-testing in areas of academic achievement and personal and social adjustment is recommended. For other evaluations in this series see UD 007 956, 007 957, and 007 959. (NH)",

Scores for verbal ability, reasoning, number facility, and space conceptualization of middle- and lower-class Chinese, Jewish, Negro, and Puerto Rican first graders showed striking effects of ethnicity. Also noted was the fact that social class was a more influential factor in the level of ability of Negroes than among any other group. The presentation by Herbert G. Birch, \"Health and the Education of Socially Disadvantaged Children,\" points out that the poor health of these children is a primary variable in their  educational failure. Health factors which are specifically related to intellectual and educational deficits are prematurity, obstetrical and perinatal complications, birth weight, maternal physical characteristics and nutrition, and prenatal care.

The Bereiter-Engelmann method, the method based on operant conditioning, and the Montessori method are representative of the prescriptive-instructional theory which it is felt to inhibit expressive language. The developmental philosophy stresses a rich environment providing many varied opportunities from which a child selects his own activities. This method, however, does not stimulate his verbal expressive ability. The modified developmental approach which is discussed would encourage expressive language within a developmental context. The child's  spontaneity, verbal responsiveness, and eagerness to be heard can be capitalized upon by adults who listen actively. Talk-oriented schools would foster learning that has intellectual, psychological, and social value. Some examples of classroom practice are included. (NH)",

Project Beacon of Yeshiva University, the local school board, and P.S. 129 sought to develop innovative approaches, improve student achievement and instruction, and rehabilitate dropouts. The project involved a saturation program for the entire fourth grade, a learning center for retarded readers and behavior problem children, a special science program, inservice training, and the establishment of a local governing board. On the whole the findings were disappointing. The various features of the saturation effort either did not meet stated goals and expectations, or failed to materialize. Reading and achievement scores of fourth graders  did not improve. Despite numerous shortcomings in the learning center component, the evaluator suggests that a well-planned replication might assess the effectiveness of that concept.

Each situational component was significantly related to students' feelings of powerlessness, but only classroom racial composition remained significant when the other factors were controlled as well.

        "description":"The possibility was explored of greater cooperation between the New York State Employment Service and the secondary schools and 2-year colleges of New York in the production and dissemination of improved occupational information for students and counselors. To compile data on present practices and opinions of counselors and administrators, responses were obtained from 740 elementary and high school counselors, 52 2-year college counselors, 44 high school administrators, and 26 administrators in 2-year colleges. The responses indicated that counselors felt less well prepared in occupational information than in other aspects of their work, and that both counselors and administrators valued highly the kinds of information which the Employment Service could supply. As a result of  this study, a pilot project will be undertaken in Nassau and Suffolk Counties in 1967-68. A list of 212 local occupations has been prepared with the help of Employment Service occupational analysis. Guides on these occupations will be prepared and distributed to secondary schools and 2-year colleges as a part of the pilot project. A summary report is available as VT 005 799. (CH)",

Researchers used two standardized instruments, the Nelson-Denny Reading Test and the Technical Scholastic Test, and a questionnaire designed to obtain personel-social data for use in determining the socioeconomic background of each student. The four institutions selected for this study were: (1) a public-supported residential junior college, (2) a public-supported residential vocational technical school, (3) a public-supported non-residential technical institute located in a metropolitan area, and (4) a public-supported  technical institute located on a state university campus. Conclusions based on the findings of this study include: (1) Technician education students make choices with only limited knowledge of available programs and institutions, (2) Technician education students tend to express unrealistic educational objectives, (3) Technician students had limited contact with high school counselors, (4) Reading skills of technician education students tend to be lower than norms for grade 13 students.

The rapid development and application of technology is illustrated by accelerated rate of change. The educational system has been based on a concept of stability, and the present generation is the first which must educate youth for the new dimension of time and change. There is less and less opportunity for the uninformed and untrained worker. More and more specialized education must be provided. The shortage of specialized technicians and supportive workers and the evident supply of educable persons represents an unprecedented challenge to junior and community colleges. Individualized programs, often including remedial studies, relating to each student's field of interest must be  provided. Graduates of such programs may then achieve a level in the work force in 3 to 5 years that would normally take 12 to 15 years by past standards. New legislation dealing with occupational education provides funds for developing new programs, improving program relevancy, long-range planning, meeting needs of special-needs groups, exemplary programs, residential schools, work-experience programs, development and dissemination of curriculum materials, studies of manpower needs, and vocational educator professional development.

The general objectives include: developing jobs for persons having saleable skills, assisting these persons and their families in relocating to the job area, and identifying problems and providing solutions related to the relocation process. Over the past 2 years this experimental and demonstration relocation project has been instrumental in over 450 relocations of trained personnel. Its clientele has been mainly rural or farm displaced persons who have relocated mainly in an urban situation. The major  objective of relocation should be aimed at human resource conservation and development. The immediate aim should be to place adults in self-supporting circumstances and ultimately to expose their children to opportunities and circumstances which will prevent the recycling of unemployment and subsequently deprivation. Job development, placement precedures, trial allowances, and loan-grant allowances are also discussed. (CH)",

Because of the increasing number of older workers in the labor force and particularly in industrialized countries, specially organized employment programs which address the problems of maximum age limits, job redesign, and employment services are discussed. The committee concluded that the re-entry of many women into the labor force is dependent upon changing public attitudes, providing adequate community services, and appropriate adult training. Concerning  non-agriculturally employed rural-to-urban migrants and their dependents, assistance in mobility and adjustment provisions should be incorporated into national manpower policies, particularly where the size of this migrant population is significant.

Heads of households were provided intensive, comprehensive evaluation and treatment services to deal with their social, vocational, and psychological problems. In addition, they were provided services to facilitate their integration into the new community: tours of urban industries, help in approaches to finding work in a large city, help in finding housing, etc. At the conclusion of the services, they were assisted to secure suitable employment. After demonstrating job stability, clients were provided financial assistance to move their  families to the urban area. Of the 80 clients, 46 relocated and, 2 months after relocating, only one had returned to the supply area community. It was concluded that relocation can be a viable tool with populations of the kind studied, provided financial assistance for relocation can be coupled with extensive services that simultaneously deal with the characteristic complex of interrelated life problems.

The model provides for two programs. The program for the trainers involves: (1) conferring a majority of the credit for concepts learned from work being performed, (2) providing for credit which is transferrable to other colleges, (3) waiving entrance examinations, and (4) offering an Associate of Arts degree that accounts for the training specialty. The program for trainees is based on the principle that it is possible to obtain 4 years of college and the Bachelor of Arts degree  without ever entering a formal classroom. (This is not to say that formal classroom attendance will not be a part of the education sequence.) The goal is that the trainee accomplish the degree in 4 to 5 years while working full time. This means that credit must be given for learning that takes place on the job and for independent investigation. By developing measurements for such a learning experience, credit can be matched to the traditional course structure. (JK)",

The study was limited to year-round farm jobs in large-sized enterprises to develop some knowledge of working conditions, renumerations, and skills which will be required in the future. A 3-phase study was conducted involving a mail questionnaire, personal interviews, and farm record analysis. Personal interviews were conducted with farmers and with their full-time hired men in six selected Iowa counties. Questionnaire responses were obtained from 861 of the 2,700 members of the Iowa Farm Business Association whose records were analyzed. For each farm type considered, the items most highly correlated with the amount of labor hired were the value of  crop grown, the value of total working assets, and the particular livestock activities on that farm. The amount of labor hired was the result of the interaction of several variables. Most farmers were paying their full-time men in the traditional manner of a cash wage plus a house, some farm produce, and health and accident insurance, with possibility of a bonus at the end of the year. Most employees were rated as semi-skilled when given a choice of four skill levels ranging from unskilled to supervisory. This Master of Science thesis was submitted to Iowa State University. (DM)",

        "description":"In a representative cross-section of 20 Boston Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area's 120 registered hospitals, 524 individuals in 22 paramedical occupations were interviewed regarding their functions and educational backgrounds. In addition, questionnaires regarding hiring policies were directed to the administrators in these hospitals. Among extensive findings were: (1) There were discripancies between \"Dictionary of Occupational Titles\" job descriptions and those supplied by interviewees, (2) In only a few cases do hospitals regard as too high the entrance requirements and level of preparation encouraged by accrediting agencies and professional societies, (3) Although most hospitals indicated the basic aspects of their hiring standards have been in effect for many years,  most considered these to be valid, and (4) Personnel of widely different backgrounds perform the same or similar tasks. Recommendations include: (1) re-examination by hospitals of their total occupational structures to determine job requirements, (2) establishment of relevant hiring standards, (3) expansion of on-the-job training, (4) establishment by educational institutions of realistic entrance requirements, (5) examination by local government of licensing practice in relation to exclusion of the disadvantaged, and (6) development by hospitals of job promotion ladders.

Estimates for 1969, 1970 and 1971, useful for short-range instructional and budget planning are based on the number of high school graduates and of new students. Projections for 1972 through 1984, useful in long-range facility planning, are based on the number of births and of new students. The experience of the University of Wisconsin and Wisconsin State University campuses for 1964 to 1967 was used as a base for estimates and projections for college transfer and associate degree programs; the experience of the vocational diploma program from 1967 to 1968 was utilized for estimates and projections for that program. Apprenticeship and  unclassified enrollments were derived by subtraction of the other programs from the total. Some estimates and projections are: (1) 1970--all programs, 37,755; college transfer, 5,149; associate degree, 12,846; vocational diploma, 12,995; apprenticeship and unclassified; 6,765; (2) 1984--all programs, 49,302; college transfer, 5,807; associate degree, 14,120; vocational diploma, 18,039; apprenticeship and unclassified, 11,336.

Most federal agencies use PPBS for the development, analysis and presentation of resource needs. Traditional methods of budgeting focus primarily on resource inputs; PPBS focuses on both inputs (cost) and outputs (benefits). The guidelines in this volume suggest initial training in a sequential pattern for a course in PPBS. Examples used are drawn from the field of vocational education. Included in the instructional outline are sections relating to: (1) Overview, (2) Systems Theory, (3) The Planning Process, (4) Investment Alternatives, (5) Program Budgeting, (6) Analysis of Alternatives, (7) Programming and Management  Control, (8) Basic Data for PPBS, and (9) Limitations of PPBS. The document contains three parts: The What-When-Where-Who-Why of This Educational Program, An Educational Training Program in PPBS, and Supplement to the Basic Educational Program.

A sample of students who could read at fifth grade level or higher completed a series of inventories which measured their perceptions and expectations toward school, work, family, peers, and self. Additional information was collected relating to disadvantagement, personal plans and background, the community and the school. Major findings were: (1)  Socioeconomic disadvantagement is relevant to the community context, (2) The differences between disadvantaged and nondisadvantaged students did not appear as frequently as might have been expected, (3) Educational aspirations of disadvantaged students were generally lower than those of nondisadvantaged students, and (4) Disadvantaged students reported giving more thought to school plans and future jobs, viewed teachers in a more favorable light, and reported that school was easier.

Patterns of behavior were: (1) consideration of employees, (2) structuring expectations, (3) tolerance of freedom of action, (4) production emphasis, and (5) representation of the interests of the group. Small groups composed equally of well-adjusted and poorly-adjusted high school students viewed the movies and then engaged in free discussion without any attempt by researchers to influence student attitudes towards the supervisory role being discussed. Approximately 8 weeks after discussing the movies, the students were rated again by the teachers on adjustment to  supervision. Poorly-adjusted boys in the experimental group gained more in ratings of adjustment to supervision than did poorly-adjusted control groups that did not see the movie. Teachers tended to adjust their second ratings downward, however the experimental groups lost less than the control groups. The results for all groups, except well adjusted girls, favored the experimental groups that saw and discussed the movies. It was recommended that the movies be used further in training and research.

The linker enters this network by contacting (through periodicals, mass media, conventions, and directly) individuals in the audience who are more active than others (gatekeepers). Once gatekeepers have been identified, the linker, aware of the stages through which idea adopters must pass before accepting a new idea, must successfully communicate to them an understandable, attention-getting message which arouses personality needs and makes appropriate suggestions to meet these needs. This message is then passed on to the rest of the target audience by word of mouth. The linker must also actively solicit audience needs  and apply them to research products, serving as a two-way force for facilitating the flow of information. The linker's role, however, has been complicated by problems such as overload and marginality; when the functions of linkers are institutionalized, these problems, as well as the problems of lack of job security, coordination of activities, and specialization, are lessened.

        "description":"In May 1968, 10 leaders of Southwestern minority groups--Amerindians, Blacks, and Spanish-speaking--gathered to share their educational problems and discuss collective solutions. From their thoughts on assimilation and integration, on living conditions, curriculum, local school board control, and teacher education, two ambivalences emerged: (1) While the child should be educated to make a living in the modern world, he should also remain within the ethnic cultural fold. (2) While minority groups resent not having political power, some still fear formally organized political action groups. Remedies for these ambivalences and for the inferior education offered to non-Anglo children may lie in a pluralistic (rather than \"melting pot\") approach to culture in the schools, in different  educational goals for non-Anglos, and most importantly--because each tribe and minority group is unique--in local ethnic control. (Appended are a 54-item bibliography and brief biographies on the participating groups: American G.I.

        "author":["Kottenstette, James P."],
        "description":"The investigation of ultrafiche technology and its applications in higher education resulted in an unanticipated far-reaching study on the general use of microforms. This occurred when it was found (1) that reader presentations of typical educational materials were of excellent quality throughout the range of reduction ratios investigated, 32x to 150x, and (2) that student reading rate and comprehension when using reader presentations of materials were independent of reduction ratio and essentially equal to that obtained on hardcopy. These developments transformed the study from one exploring &quot;Can a student use an ultrafiche presentation?&quot; to one that asked &quot;Will a student use a microform presentation?&quot;&quot;Broad usage on a routine basis&quot; was accepted as the overall application  criterion. The study of microform application was approached in two ways. One approach considered library application from the economic and administrative standpoints; the other centered on applications that could have great value to many students, i.e., those consistent with routine usage. In addition to the development of these applications, experiments were undertaken to explore the utility of microform presentation in terms of user performance and user acceptance. An attempt was made to identify the presentation factors operative at the interface of man and machine which create negative attitudes toward the use of microforms, and to organize these factors into a conceptual framework to show both relationships and fundamental considerations for improving acceptance. Two secondary  research projects were also conducted during the course of the investigation. In one study, the library at the University of Denver was characterized from the separate viewpoints of the microfiche systems designer and of the microfilming specialist through an analysis of a sample of books. The second study developed a method for evaluating image quality in terms of readability and of visibility. A discussion section in the report integrates the separate studies into a consistent statement on the considerations involved in microform publishing (particularly ultrafiche) for educational applications. Objectives in continuing the overall program are also discussed. (JH)",

        "description":"A study was made to determine the extent to which educational innovations developed through federally funded projects of Title III of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act are continued and thus adopted by the local public school system or by other school systems in the United States. Information was obtained by a questionnaire survey of the school superintendents of the applicant school districts for the 330 operational projects which had been approved and funded by the U.S. Office of Education in fiscal year 1966 for a 3-year period. These projects were then analyzed according to selected variables--(1) the characteristics of the school systems in which the projects operate, (2) the personal characteristics of the projects themselves--in order to determine which factors,  if any, were associated with the continuation of Title III projects in local school districts. The survey yielded that 279 (84.5%) of the 330 projects in the survey were continued. Continuation was found to be associated with such project characteristics as cost and preparation of materials, such situational or system variables as wealth and community norms, and such superintendent characteristics as age and education. The average project was responsible for stimulating 20 similar new projects in other schools. The study findings were intended for use by granting institutions (federal, state, and private) in helping to refine the criteria used to review and evaluate proposals for innovative programs, and by school superintendents in aiding decision making regarding the installation of  innovations.

Oxford and other universities have traditional extramural departments strictly concerned with non-vocational, usually non-examined, non-degree courses; London University has been serving the majority of England's part-time students. The binary system reveals two approaches: (1) colleges which are supervised by the Council of National Academic Awards responsible for forcing up standards of amenities and directing students into specific careers; (2) the training for a traditional arts degree irrespective of subsequent occupation. Areas of concern are: Technological colleges which were converted into universities are being filled by arts students;  the University of the Air might do no more than overlap with the work being done by Workers' Educational Authority, other adult education centers, colleges of further education and the British Broadcasting Corporation. Sufficient investigation has not been done to properly assess the students who will be served by the University of the Air. (nl)",

Among revelations of the questionnaire were: (1) the majority of clientele felt that staff members providing leadership for agricultural program should be specialists; (2) a significant number felt that agent visits lacked uniformity and that specialization favored some producers; (3) the lower gross sales  clientele were more likely to feel alienated by present programing efforts; (4) the higher gross sales clientele were more likely to be participating in and using area extension programs and staff resources; and (5) the majority of all clientele felt that farmers, local businessmen, industry, and public leaders needed to be aware of and understand developments that could affect each other's actions and decisions.

Pertinent findings of the Joint Advisory Committee on Continuing Engineering studies, and its recommendations for future action by universities, industry, technical societies, and the Federal government, are cited. In addition, continuing education in the fields of commerce and medicine is briefly reviewed and assessed. It is concluded that future emphasis should be directed toward organization and program development at the local  rather than national level, under the direction of local planning groups.

A presented questionnaire was mailed to 4132 professional directors in the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) and 1219 were returned. Of the respondents, 52% had been professional directors for 10 or more years; 17%, for less than three. They worked mainly in rural areas or small cities (26%) or in inner cities (26%). Volunteer leaders in the YMCA were 69% male and 31% female; as a group they were relatively well educated, with 65% having attended college. On the average, 63% had served for less than one year, with inner city communities having the highest proportion of those who had served over three years and rural communities  or small cities having the lowest proportion. Data indicated a positive correlation between training time and length of tenure. On the variables sex, education, occupation, tenure, and training time, there were important, but not statistically significant, variations between types of communities. (nl)",

The training experience was keyed to broad YMCA purposes, objectives of the training schools, and individual goals. Personal goal setting, stressed as a means of instilling responsibility for oneself and others, entailed developing a working relationship between advisors and junior leaders, helping individuals become aware of their growth potential, and conducting human relations skill training and modified sensitivity training. Procedures included written scales and personal inventories, Christian social influence skills courses, decision making and gaining group consensus, and varying uses  of discussion, role playing, and demonstrations for training in moral values. Sentence completion tests, content analysis of goals, evaluations of school programs and junior leader performance, followup questionnaires and interviews, and other evaluation techniques were described, together with major findings obtained.

Projection is done through demographic data on the United States (U.S.) and data on the YMCA for 1957 through 1975. In general, the method of duplicating gains and losses is used. There are three major content sections: the first projects demographic data which provide an overview of the U.S. in the 1970's and includes projections which have direct implications for the YMCA, namely, those concerning population, families, education and occupation,  distribution and income, mobility, urbanization, and the economy; the second deals with the YMCA in the 1970's and consists of organizational projections concerning constituency, leadership, finance and program; and the third examines the implications of the projections and raises a series of questions that appear important for planning by the YMCA leaders in the next decade.

Next, in a background paper and commentary, are somewhat divergent opinions on such questions as the balance between vocational and general education in CAEs and overlapping between CAEs and university extension. Evaluating both the background paper and the commentary, Section three stresses the view that a broad, extensive program at the subuniversity academic level has an important place in Australian adult  education and that CAEs would be well fitted to the task.

A staff of part time resource development consultants from the University of Maine developed the program; and supervision was provided by the community action agencies. Experiencing confusion and frustrations caused by lack of training, late funding, and problems of great distances, and facing a continual flow of debilitating crises, it was decided to identify the concepts underlying the program as well as planning and implementing it. It was decided to use a rational-emotional, individualized  approach to training in problem solving; unique to this Mainstream project, aides were not only to be trained for increased employability but also were to have a client group; there was to be individual responsibility for learning, an evolutionary model of programing, role modeling the consultant on problem solving, and the right to fail; and it is hoped that the evaluation phase will become an ongoing phase. Despite its trials, it is felt that Operation Mainstream is overtly becoming a success. (nl)",

Data were obtained from the homemakers (whites, Negroes, and Indians) by an information sheet and Gordon's Survey of Interpersonal Values. These were among the findings and conclusions: (1) although the homemakers were varied in orientations, the total group and 911 subgroups ranked benevolence highest; (2) in the interaction of value orientations with other factors, 14 of the 36 associations were statistically significant at the .001, .01, or .05 level; (3)  there was some similarity between mean scores of ethnic groups, but much variation within groups; (4) in the Extension Service, where the group approach is used to achieve learning and a continuing relationship exists between the Extension homemakers and Extension agents, it might be desirable to use Gordon's Survey of Interpersonal Values as a guidance and counseling instrument.

        "description":"This study sought to outline the general consensus of sociologists, educators, planners, administrators, and social reformers in India as to the nature of adult literacy; to examine drawbacks (if any) in their concepts; and to analyze and harmonize different viewpoints on functional literacy. Differing concepts in the field at large were traced mainly to different goals -- economic development, vocational training, continuing education, productivity and social participation. A dichotomy was also noted between literacy as a medium for communicating ideas, and literacy as both a medium and an idea. Reactions of 40 respondents were obtained concerning a definition put forth by UNESCO. The respondents were sharply divided as to the scope of literacy skills and the subject content of  literacy education. Moreover, their views seemed to reflect theory (especially from child psychology) rather than practical experience. A new definition based on the aim of making people more amenable to change was proposed and discussed. (Included are a bibliography and excerpts of respondents' remarks.) (ly)",

Interviews were held, and 21 ABE classes visited in nine communities; 18 ABE personnel furnished self-evaluations during course in Manchester; and briefings were held for ABE teachers and directors. ABE directors, teachers, counselors, and students were surveyed by questionnaire, and responses from 57 community leaders were also tabulated. Such program aspects as patterns of cooperation, program objectives, effectiveness of classroom techniques, teacher characteristics, student background and  aspirations, selection of textbooks, scheduling, and testing were investigated. It was concluded that the overall program is beginning to meet the needs of its clientele. Needs in leadership training, curriculum, methods, publicity, and cooperative planning were suggested, together with steps for back home implementation. (The document includes 46 tables.) (ly)",

The project, conducted at the University of Texas at El Paso in 1968 (in the spring and fall semesters), was set up specifically to provide additional training in listening to different voices, and to sharpen skills in note-taking and outlining in English classes. The first part of the research used students from the Freshman English course--one group of foreign students, and a control group of English-speaking freshmen. Fifteen-minute tapes were made on a variety of subjects by six professors and an outside visitor. The students could hear a tape twice in one 50-minute lab period. They took  notes and outlined the taped lecture. Their notes, taken up after every lab session to avoid any copying, were supplemented by work in class. The teacher took the notes to class and the students were given their own notes to look over. They then kept them for use during a test on the tape--at which time they could see whether or not they had written down the things important for that test. This self evaluation led to improved skills. Commercial tapes and several other innovations were added in the second semester of research. The author feels the program's aims were accomplished.

        "description":"The ADD (Auditory Discrimination in Depth) Test measures the auditory perceptions basic to grasping the logic of the English writing and reading system. If the level of a subject's auditory perception--his ability to discriminate the phonemes of English and his ability to code phonemic sequences in both non-syllabic and syllabic units--can be determined, it can be estimated how much developmental work is going to be needed before the writing and reading task will become comprehensible to him. The ADD Test gives both diagnostic and prognostic information in this respect. This test requires the subject to manipulate colored blocks to indicate his perception of the relationships of sounds in oral patterns. The three categories involved are designed to check the ability to (1)  discriminate isolated phonemes in sequence; (2) perceive phonemic relationships in a simple, protected syllable; and (3) perceive phonemic relationships in complex syllables. Informal norms suggest that if auditory perceptual judgment is functioning, four-year-olds can handle Category I, first- and second -graders can handle Categories II and III. Difficulty with Category I after five or six years of age is uncommon, but even some adults cannot handle Categories II and III. This deficiency has been reflected in almost every instance in poor word attack in reading and poor spelling skills. (See related document ED 028 430.) (AMM)",

The literature teacher has two responsibilities--to discover the student's previous literary experiences, and to be thoroughly familiar with the problems involved in the development of literary appreciation in a second language. Assuming that the reader of a second language has acquired the basic skills of reading in his native language and that he can read in English with some fluency, it is extremely important that his attitude towards reading literature be positive. To achieve this, he must have been introduced to the literary world at a comfortable, uncomplicated level, where the theme was not too unfamiliar and the vocabulary load not an obstacle to comprehension and enjoyment. The  reader must also develop skill in perceiving implied meanings, generalizing, grasping and relating important ideas, anticipating events and predicting outcomes, and recognizing sound patterns and rhythm which evoke sensory images. It is suggested that teachers avoid exhausting every line, crowding materials, lecturing instead of teaching, and spending too much time on historical or social background. Teachers should look out for misinterpretations due to cultural differences, and not assume skills or emotional maturity. Selection and presentation of various literary forms are discussed. (AMM)",

        "description":"\"An English Pronunciation Course for Puerto Rican Seventh-Graders\" grew out of a similar remedial pronunciation course for freshmen at the University of Puerto Rico. One of the linguistic principles involved in teaching young adults a foreign language concerns the fact that \"linguistic acquisition is stabilized by puberty,\" and language learning becomes progressively more difficult (but not impossible, as the author points out). Interference from the vernacular, another difficulty, is met with in these pronunciation courses by the use of visual representation of words containing the new sounds being practiced, rather than the written representation. The students concentrate first on hearing the new sounds and reproducing them, after which they are drilled from print. A knowledge  of the nature of oral language is invaluable help in teaching difficult English sounds. Experiments show that one can learn to perceive the non-significant features of one's own language quite easily in another; it is only a matter of time and effort from perception to production. The courses, which end with a correlation lesson on the symbols used in the lessons and those used by a standard pocket dictionary, aim to give the students oral and listening skills which can help them to speak and understand English better. They must continue practicing these skills in an oral course in grammar. (AMM)",

The problem of ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) instruction is complicated by the changing relationship between education and the ability to obtain employment. The treatment of the Mexican-American particularly, in trying to achieve acculturation rather than assimilation, has resulted in the wholesale dropout of two generations of students, now adults, who must be molded into functioning members of society. Compared to children, adults have a much larger native language vocabulary and have already developed  abstract concepts in their first language. Also, if they are literate in their own language, they can usually make conscious and deliberate use of grammatical generalizations and apply them to new language experiences. Because of these two factors, the following features of the audiolingual method represent a conflict of learning theory and are pedagogically inappropriate for the adult education student in ESOL: (1) dialog-centered lessons; (2) inductive learning of grammatical patterns; (3) avoidance of the native language; (4) withholding the written form; and (5) natural speed of presentation.

It is recommended that a child first begin the reading program in his native language with the help of a bilingual teacher or teacher aide. When ready, he begins the reading programs in English. Initially, he expresses his experience in some graphic form such as drawing, painting, or clay work, and then tells his experience to the teacher and the other children. He dictates his story about the picture to the teacher in his own words, with the teacher writing the story about the  picture in his language, the way he says it. He begins to write by tracing over the teacher's writing and eventually writes out his own stories, which are bound and become part of the basic and supplementary reading program. In his discussion of this approach to teaching reading in a bilingual preschool program, the author describes the basic assumptions, the advantages, and the flexibility in organization and scheduling. He concludes with several stories representing various levels of English proficiency, written by bilingual children in California and Massachusetts. (AMM)",

It is the primary aim of the ITC (Intensive Training Courses), set up by the Council on Language Teaching Development of Japan in 1968, to train students to overcome their reluctance to speak English by developing skill in communicating their ideas in English. Thirty-two ITC groups in English were  set up throughout Japan. Each group, consisting of one Japanese English instructor, one native speaker informant furnished by the American Committee for Cooperation on English in Japan, and 15-20 students, was required to spend two weeks totally immersed in an English-speaking atmosphere. No specific method or theory for English teaching was recommended; the teachers were asked, however, to place as much emphasis on debating exercise as possible.

Evidence also indicates that when Mexican-Americans mix English and Spanish together in the same sentence the result is not a creolized language but instead a very relaxed and arbitrary switching of codes, both of which are available for use at any time.

It is dangerous to accept the imposition of linguistic theory as the basis of effective teaching methodology. The goal of the linguist, who works in a framework of ex-post facto analysis of data, is the description of language; the goal of the language teacher who works in a framework of experimentation where outcomes are not predictable, is the development of language skills in the learner. Those teachers  who have inherited students who have passed proficiency tests in English and are unable to cope with communication in an English-speaking environment can testify to the inadequacy of the assumption that the ability of a student to reproduce the symbols of the English language is both necessary and sufficient to effective communication in English. Suggested as a focus of attention is not improvement within the present view of language teaching and learning, but the restructuring of the present view, to accomplish the goal of communication.

A survey of current work and findings in dialect studies follows. In the last part of the paper, the author discusses research needs in the areas of (1) field techniques (size of sample necessary for a reliable study of social dialects; role of race, sex, and social class of the fieldworker in affecting the speech of an informant; elicitation procedures which can get at judgments of the grammaticality of nonstandard structures apart from judgments about social acceptability; and importance of  statistical calculations in comparing the various quantitative measurements that are made), (2) descriptive studies (intonation, Black English in the South, nonstandard white dialects, age-grading, acquisitional studies of nonstandard dialects, and more descriptive date on the role of sex in language), and (3) theoretical issues (way in which observed linguistic variation can be accounted for in a linguistic model of description, extent to which a description can encompass more than one idiolect, and descriptive differences between several types of language situations).

The objective of the study was to evaluate the potential applicability and usefulness of CAI in the instructional environment of the Defense Language Institute (DLI). The operational phases of the study were implemented in the Russian Aural Comprehension course at the DLI facility in Monterey, California (DLIWC). The study proved that (1) the instructional programming system was satisfactory as a prototype technology; (2) the instructional staff of DLIWC under DLI technical direction achieved good efficiency of program preparation; (3) operational integration of CAI into the DLI course and school was smooth; (4) CAI training was effective: students trained by CAI learned about as well  as students in the normal Aural Comprehension course; and (5) CAI measures of student learning constituted highly reliable predictors of performance of trainees on DLI tests. It was recommended that a pilot CAI operation to develop CAI as a technique for future military training language instruction should be established at an appropriate time and place. It should develop improved CAI instructional techniques, the use of CAI as a language testing medium, instruction rates adjusted to student ability, and computer methods for improved evaluation and control.

It summarizes some cross-linguistic similarities in acquisition of several different types of languages: English (both white and black, lower and middle class), German, Russian, Finnish, Samoan, and Luo. With this small but diverse collection of languages and cultures the author is in a position to consider varied speech input to the child and observe what remains constant in the course of language acquisition. He finds a number of small, intriguing differences but believes that \"what is remarkable at first glance is the uniformity in rate and pattern of development.\" He traces stages of language development and points out the linguistic universals which manifest themselves at the various stages.  Typically, in all cultures examined, there is a period of babbling ending somewhere around 18 months of age. Overlapping this period is a stage of single-word utterances, followed by a stage of two-word utterances at around 18-24 months. The two-word stage is often quite brief, but its structural and semantic characteristics appear to be universal. The author believes that the universality of this phase suggests the maturation of a \"language acquisition device\" with a fairly fixed programming span for utterances at the start. (DO)",

The roles of the various personnel in the program are discussed as are workshops and inservice training. The University of Nebraska set up an evaluation of this program, based on triads of elementary schools in each of Douglas' districts. Operation of the mental health services are described as full, limited, or normal. Two measures were considered, change in teacher's attitude and change in pupil behavior.  The Wickman Scale and the Minnesota Teacher Attitude Inventory were used. The results indicate that teachers' attitudes do change with participation in the workshops.

Therefore, the present study was aimed at three tasks: (1) identification of pupil learning, behavior, and adjustment problems for which teachers feel they need new remedial strategies; (2) the presentation of a rationale for utilizing behavior change strategies; and (3) testing of three strategies for working with representative teacher identified problems. Through a questionnaire, pupil problems were identified and categorized into three basic categories: (1) misbehavior, (2) learning, and (3) personal-social. Strategies for working with representative sample problems were developed from research and theory. Change in behavior will  most likely occur when the distance between what the child wants and what he has is greatest. Steps are given for the counselor to follow in consulting with teachers. Strategies for treatment are presented in three case studies. The remediation techniques employed in the cases were designed to extinguish \"undesirable\" behaviors and replace them with productive modes of functioning. (KJ/Author)",

Dealing with very vocal, rebellious community members presented difficulties in accepting their reports as truth and not fantasy. Group maintenance was a problem since the leader had no control over group membership or community attendance. Neither group (police or community) trusted the leader. Police had to drop their defensiveness and community members had to learn to accept police as human beings before progress could be made. The varied goals of the members had to be considered. With no practical goals in common, the leader had difficulty  designing a tactical plan for these confrontations. Suggestions for developing group humor are given. The leader's awareness of community politics, resources, and history is helpful if he is to be a group catalyst in a short period of time. References are included in this report. (KJ)",

Appel and Haak, using decision-making theory as a springboard, attack key assumptions which underly vocational education decision-oriented counseling. \"Innovations in Counseling Teachers\", Brown and Fuller suggest that counselors, if given a choice, should get out of the business of counseling with individual students and into the business of counseling teachers.  Hall, in his article on video-tape, hypothesizes that total feedback on counseling would make for more accurate assessments than partial feedback (audio or video alone) in supervision.

The basic topic investigated in this study was the character and extent of the climate of learning within the residence hall-houses and the relationship of the learning climate to freshman  attitudes and academic performance. Among the list of general observations and conclusions were: (1) the characteristics of residence hall groups vary extensively, (2) undertones of non-intellectual behavioral norms exist, (3) houses differ in their climate of learning as perceived by residence, and, (4) the climate of learning has no demonstrable effect on freshman academic performance when the influence of academic ability is removed.

        "description":"This report contains an assessment of the impact of Upward Bound programs on secondary schools and communities. The findings are based on a systematic study and analysis of the relationships observed among the universities, secondary schools, and communities involved in Upward Bound. The study was carried out in 16 selected cities across the nation to evaluate a variety of different programs in an attempt to determine the effect Upward Bound has had nationally. The recommendations in this report are aimed at providing constructive guidelines for the improvement of the program. This study indicates that Upward Bound has had a significant impact on the student participants, but has had a minimal effect on the internal operations of the secondary schools, the attitudes of the  faculties, and the reactions of the local communities. Many aspects of the administration and operation of local programs need improvement. The public relations role of local project directors should be broadened. Above all, it is essential that the program be expanded to include larger numbers of high school students if any tangential effect is to be realized. (Author/KJ)",

Recruitment of these groups, traditionally barred from regular college admission, has been pursued with the help of minority students who go into the community to provide a peer group setting in which to tell the story of the University. A High Potential Program, initiated with selected culturally-deprived freshmen on a ten-to-one student-teacher ratio, is designed to ease the students into regular University courses at a rate comfortable for each student. Financial assistance is provided to students, student aides, and recruiters. Programs of this nature point up the need for a different  type of academic personnel--one who can establish deep and genuine relations with people. (CJ)",

        "description":"Many colleges and universities are concerned about the academic advising (counseling) that their students receive and recognize the need for a better system. Presently, students can look for help to: (1) a fellow student, (2) a student advisor, (3) a faculty member, or (4) a counselor. The first two listed are used most often. These two, however, due to a lack of training, turnover, and student attitudes are not usually as effective as a counselor. Five reasons for using counselors for academic counseling are given, including the statement that counselors are people oriented--not subject oriented. Students cannot be compartmentalized in academic, emotional, personal, or vocational divisions. If the Counseling Center is to be the single office for all types of student help and  information concerning academic and personal problems, then the doors must stand open to receive all students regardless of their needs. Thus, the Counseling Center will truly become the place to go for help. (Author)",

Schools cannot prevent all emotional disorders, neither can they correct all those which come to them. Public opinion and the judgments of educators agree that the most significant results of education are the generalized learnings and attitudes that enable a person to attack his life problems more successfully, rather than the specific skills and information he receives. The quality of the school's influence for mental health is determined by the personal characteristics of the teachers. Psychosocial needs of children and positive teacher characteristics  are discussed. Implications, including the need for concern toward teacher mental health are discussed. Guidelines for developing a school mental health program are presented. (Author/KJ)",

While there is little information available on careers and work for world peace, much information is available on the national military. Funds are greatly lacking in world peace work areas. Vigorous action is needed to meet this crisis for our youth and for the world. A list of needed projects is listed,  including: (1) studies of careers with various international agencies; (2) studies of part-time life interests related to world peace, and (3) studies and writers for counselors and youth on what can be done for world peace.

To the student personnel worker a particular problem is posed; how to encourage cultural contact, particularly with foreign and minority students while at the same time encouraging the conformity necessary for effective functioning, both in society and in the university. In our pluralistic society, we should recognize diversity as shared opportunity but in reality we partition society off into the \"two culture\" streams--the humanist and the scientific. Cultural pluralism tends to become cultural imperialism whereby the dominant culture seeks to absorb the subsidiary one to provide commonality. The role of the university is such that it can become more relevant  to the world in which it functions by seeking cutural encounters beyond itself rather than by merely defending the majority culture and its ideological rationale.

In a search for a more effective method of working with drug abusers, 12 questions were devised. These are self-evaluative and directed at the counselor. If a counselor can openly and honestly answer positively to them, perhaps he is ready to counsel with youthful drug abusers. As with so many youthful clients, the counselor visualizes a great part of his role as centering around changing their self-concept. It seems that so many of the young drug abusers see themselves in a non-performance role, and it is the counselors' job to help them see themselves as people who can and do perform. Some suggestions are offered for  effecting the desirable change in self-concept. The use and dangers of confrontation as a therapeutic tool is discussed. A counselor is attempting to help the drug abuser find a more effective, healthy way to mature which can lead to positive and constructive change in self-concept. (SJ)",

Other differences  are noted. Of special interest is the finding that bright under achievers do not differ from low achievers in most dimensions investigated.

        "description":"The Specific aim of the present project was to establish criteria for playfulness and nonplayfulness in adolescents and to develop measuring instruments for these behavior dimensions. It was hypothesized that teachers were able to rate adolescents on these traits as manifested in the high school classroom. Questionnaires were completed by 115 junior high and high school teachers. On this instrument, ten subscales showed satisfactory reliability and validity coefficients. Two distinct factors emerged, and on the basis of their loadings on component traits of playfulness and nonplayfulness, were labeled \"social-emotional\" and \"academic\" playfulness and nonplayfulness. Conclusions drawn from the data include: (1) playfulness and nonplayfulness are identifiable in the high school  classroom and are complementary ends on a rating scale continuum, and (2) teachers see their students as relatively stable in playfulness-nonplayfulness characteristics over a period of one to two months.

        "description":"The gifted adolescent who presents himself for therapy is distinguished from other adolescents in at least two ways. His view of himself and the world is more abstract, and his identification in finding his place in a social continuum is more difficult. Yet, the gifted adolescent has much in common with all adolescents. The clinician, however, like the teacher, can distinguish these gifted individuals. The gifted are capable of more developed and skillful manipulations of the higher abstractive functions. Creativity is more likely to occur in the gifted. Since gifted adolescents tend to report in terms of high level abstractions and express many complex theories, it may take special effort to get data from them upon which new catagories and theories can be developed. The  therapist must: (1) be able to distinguish the thin line between the gifted schizophrenic and the non-schizophrenic, (2) be free to enter the realms of abstract thought, (3) be aware of the gifted's ego expressive functions and defensive functions, and (4) be able to meet the patient on his grounds. Accepting their superior abilities and the inferiority of others is helpful for the gifted, particularly in relating to others. (Author/KJ)",

The program includes: (1) counseling, mainly academic; (2) tutorial work, (3) special English courses concentrating on writing, (4) developmental reading and/or mathematics courses, and (5) financial assistance. Evaluation of the program  provided the following results: (1) 46 per cent of the group achieved a \"C\" average, and (2) 54 per cent achieved a grade average above probationary status (1.50). Problems noted were: (1) hostility, feelings of inadequacy, and general confusion among students, and, (2) little flexibility in the programs of the new students.

Using the basic assumption that guidance and counseling personnel might best meet these needs, an idea for conducting a pilot program in elementary school guidance evolved. The implementation of the program is discussed. Five counselors at five schools in Lincoln, Nebraska, participated. A summary of the program including methods of evaluation, and general remarks is given. The program was generally considered successful.

The relative contributions of variables to the general index have therefore been proposed as an indication of the relative importance of the variables to the canonical solution. The second section of the monograph attempts to establish a description of the value system utilized by contemporary adolescents in assigning status to other members of their sub-culture. The sample consisted of 12th graders in seven schools. Sociograms were constructed giving student's choices and rejections  of males and females separately. Findings, concerning values and status are presented. The authors feel that the technique used was valuable. By utilizing the canonical solution with R, and the proportioned squared multiple correlations, one can look at the way two sets of variables are related in multiple populations, and then to select the more important variables for further study.

Through investigation and interviews the following points were discovered: (1) many blacks were sensitive to their skin color, (2) the students felt short-changed educationally, (3) their home environment was felt to be a handicap, and (4) there was overwhelming peer pressure to achieve above their levels. Taking this information, the following criteria were drawn up as necessities for an effective counselor: (1) he must be acceptant, (2) he must be able  to approach students, (3) he should be available, (4) he should contact parents and maintain this contact, (5) he should be a straightforward, honest, and if necessary blunt advisor, (6) he should be aware of black causes, (7) he should have participated in a training program, (8) he should have knowledge in his advisee's stated major field.

HCU's perceived their climate as far less supportive than did their respective supervisors. Those who perceived their climate as supportive tended to be rated by their supervisors as having higher competence, congeniality, and effort. In contrast, HCU reliability was unrelated to job climate and negatively related to job retention. Increasing the supportiveness of the job climate seems to be a major avenue for increasing performance; and the implementation of these changes lies less in increasing the HCU's competence than in exploring the low reliability (lateness and absence) he demonstrates in  response to his climate.

        "description":"Upper-middle and low socio-economic level (SEL) subjects were compared on a discrimination learning task and on personality measures of locus of control of reinforcement and need for approval (Napp). Upper-middle SEL subjects were found to be faster discrimination learners than low SEL subjects only when the relevant stimulus cue was on a highly attended stimulus dimension. No SEL differences occurred when training was on a cue of a low attention level dimension. As predicted, internal subjects learned the discrimination task faster than external subjects, but this relationship held only for the upper-middle SEL subjects and only after the correlation was corrected for the attentuating effects of the low reliability on the IE scale. No relationship between Napp and the learning  task was found for either SEL. Low SEL girls were found to be more external and higher in Napp than low SEL boys and upper-middle SEL girls and boys. Results suggest that the attention level of the relevant dimension is a major variable in discrimination learning. Further investigation of the personality correlates of discrimination learning is also suggested. (Author)",

However, several practicing school counselors stated that they did not relate their self-understanding to their work as counselors. The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability of classifying counselors as Sophisticated or Naive with respect to self-awareness, and to obtain counselor and client ratings of effectiveness. The polarization model of so classifying counselors is not complete; a continuum model might be more reliable. Clients of naive counselors rated their counselors higher in counseling effectiveness than did clients of sophisticated counselors. (Author)",

Responsiveness was assumed to evolve from the interaction of two components of self-other orientation, self-esteem and complexity of the self concept. The pattern of self-other orientation found least frequently among politicians (state legislators and superintendents of public schools in comparison with teachers and principals) was high self-esteem and high complexity (the apolitical personality pattern). Political candidates with this personality pattern were also elected to office less frequently. The results are interpreted within a framework of personality differentiation-integration. (Author)",

The resulting data were subjected to a maximum likelihood factor analysis. Four of the factors obtained from the first set of data were replicated in the cross-validation sample. These four factors were: (1) a large, general factor which seemed to represent a dimension of positive characteristics; (2) a stable, rational factor; (3) a neat, clean factor; and (4) an active, talkative factor.

It was operated by 10 mothers, both black and white, indigenous to the project. It was supported by funds allotted by the Office of Economic Opportunity to the Research and Development Center at Harvard University for a two-year period from September, 1965 to June, 1967 for the purpose of developing innovative schools which would challenge traditional education. Initially the Harvard team had planned to utilize teenagers who had dropped out of high school to run the program. However, it turned out that mothers took over the program, since the teenagers interest was short-lived. The Harvard Team wanted to leave decision making up to the  community mothers in a democratic fashion; however, this became inimical and detrimental to the program, since chaos and lack of organization resulted. An evaluation of the program showed that participants and community people felt that there should be more organization and structure and a clearer delineation of roles if it were to be effective. Playroom 81 did increase the achievement expectations of group members and help them become more self-reliant. (Author/KJ)",

The inadequacies of self and social guidance mechanisms for social adaption are assumed to be associated with the concept of alienation. The alienation syndrome is defined as low self-esteem, low social interest, and high self-centrality. This triadic pattern is shown to describe behavior problem children, neuropsychiatric patients, and to some extent, persons over 40 years of age, and American Negro children. It is suggested that the processes leading from exclusion to the alienation syndrome may be a self-fulfilling prophecy mediated by  reduced social reinforcement. (Author)",

In terms of the self-concept, the control function associated with integration is assumed to be self-esteem. Self-esteem is linked to consistency of behavior across situations stemming from a supra-organization of the self-system.

The purpose of this research effort was to examine empirical data on how social groups and individual households achieve social mobility in order to identify alternative intervention points. Social mobility is seen primarily in socioeconomic terms with a strong but not exclusive, emphasis on the role played by educational attainments in the mobility of individual households and social groups. A current emphasis of our research is an investigation of the occurrence (or lack of occurrence) of certain events as the individual passes through his own life cycel, i.e., a study of intragenerational mobility. Using  survey research methods, retrospective life histories have been obtained for a national sample of the noninstitutionalized population of males 30-39 years of age residing in households in the United States and a similar sample of Negro males. This paper, while not intended to be a comprehensive manual, discusses the general approach developed in the project, illustrates many of the procedures, and gives examples from the survey data.

Certain generally applicable educational principles can aid in coping with these problems when coupled with empirical testing of all materials with children and/or teachers. But, the payoff of curriculum development is what happens to teachers and children in the classroom. Curriculum evaluation is concerned with describing this result. Evaluation studies have to take place at a time when the materials have stabilized; yet the studies have to last long enough to examine longitudinal implications. The tradition of educational evaluation has, unfortunately, concentrated on the achievement of the individual child, and no attention has  been paid to the objectives for which the teachers actually use curriculum materials, the classroom processes through which teachers try to attain these objectives, etc. (DE)",

Secondly, if attention to a wide range of problems and fields of study is necessary for the personal and intellectual development of the students, how can idiosyncratic interests and aptitudes be cultivated? A third dilemma is the problem of evaluating the consequences of programs. A resolution of the latter might be to develop procedures that would secure a wide range of unobtrusive data on  student behavior. (Author/MF)",

        "description":"Problems with defining the administrative organization of the New Haven school system led a new superintendent of that system to request aid from local industrial management experts. An organization expert was \"loaned\" to the school system by a local industry. The end result of 6 months of interviewing and analyzing was a document, called \"The Price Report,\" that assessed the organizational structure, pointing out serious deficiencies and proposing a detailed plan for reorganization. A local public utility then placed three men under the superintendent's direction to implement the reorganization plan. In addition to their basic assignment, they wrote an \"Administrators' Manual\" and produced an innovative management inservice training program. A reorganization of information  channels has led to improved communication within the administrative structure, with the press, and with the public on a direct basis. Copies of questionnaires used in the study are appended with a summary of \"The Price Report.\" (DE)",

Descriptive data upon which the evaluation was based include interviews with parents and students and staff, an activities checklist, standardized achievement tests, student records, and case studies. The objectives of the nongraded program emphasized the needs and abilities of the individual student, with progression rates commensurate with ability. In addition, the nongraded curriculum was to provide for independent study and to recognize the value of experiences outside formal study. The program was designed to give the student more responsibility in directing his program of study and to encourage  self-motivation. Finally, the program intended to provide a meaningful appraisal of the students' achievement. The data revealed that a father's socioeconomic status greatly influenced a student's curriculum placement and that more direction was needed in helping a student choose his program of study. (LN)",

Emphasized throughout 18 different addresses was the responsibility of academic transition assumed by the middle school. At the elementary level, the emphasis is on developing basic skills in a self-contained classroom; in high school the emphasis is on specialization in a subject-oriented program. Middle schools fit into this picture by building self-awareness in the student--thus aiding in the process of  social adjustment--and by providing exploratory intellectual experiences in subject matters that are studied more intensely at the high school level. Administration, curriculum design, architectural design, and instructional techniques implied by the middle school are covered. A selected bibliography of 68 citations is appended. (LN)",

Older teachers who have been retired for 10 years or more face serious economic problems because of low salaries in the past, weak benefit formulas, lost service credit by teachers who moved from one State to another during their teaching careers, and, for teachers under social security, the availability of social security coverage only since 1950. Some States have adopted methods to cope with the impact of rising living costs on the retirement income of teachers. These include: (1) Special adjustments by State legislatures, (2) cost of living adjustments, (3) automatic percentage increases, (4) retirement benefit adjustments when salaries of active employees rise, (5) excess  interest or earnings supplements, and (6) variable annuities. Although there has been progress in the past 10 years, a correcting mechanism is needed to provide for continuous adjustments in postretirement income to minimize the effects of inflation on the purchasing power of retired persons living on fixed incomes.

To determine the effect of this reduction on voter support for the schools, a stratified sample of 520 registered voters was interviewed in the fall of 1967. The actual vote in the 1966 elections and the intended vote in an upcoming levy election were compared for groups of respondants that varied in age, marital status, homeownership, children in or out of school, interest in athletics, religion, attitudes toward racial integration, income, education, and race. In general, the reduction of school services appeared to effect greater support (vote)  changes among those respondants who were placed in a conflict situation by factors of cost and interest in the school system (e.g., property taxpayers with children attending school) than among those respondants whose vote did not involve conflict. Specific findings are presented in the document's 84 cross-tabulations and in the appended straight tabulations of all of the interview responses. (JH)",

The pupil performance tests indicated that for this class of students, a modification of traditional maps to include the use of a unified legend, a compass rose, prominent lines of latitude and longitude, and no more than three type sizes or styles improves map reading  ability. The use of different colors had indeterminate results. The study indicated that the superior map format would be proportionately beneficial to the middle grade student regardless of variables such as socioeconomic standing, I.Q., sex, and learning aptitude.

Three forces of change are: (1) The emphasis on cognitive development in the disciplines; (2) the continuity of education over the span of life; and (3) the adaptation of instruction to individual requirements. These influences dictate a form to which evaluative techniques must adapt. The specification of learning outcomes must be well defined in order to evaluate progress toward these goals. For long term projection, a diagnosis of a student's initial state is required. A key task is to determine measures of instructional alternatives to prescribe the most effective sequence of courses. Continuous assessment is necessary to aid in moving to higher and alternative levels. The interaction  between individual differences and instructional practices must be known and measured. And finally, the instructional system must be capable of accumulating knowledge from which it can improve its own functioning and come closer to its expressed goals. (LN)",

The statistical design is intuitively simple, using the framework of the two-way classification analysis of variance technique. For example, the mean and variance are derived from the performance of a certain grade level of students on arithmetic fundamentals. From the matrix of students and proposed test problems in the cell determined by the test and grade level variables, random sampling from both categories will provide efficient estimates of the mean and variance. Formulations for finite and infinite populations are derived. This document reduces the theoretical complexities to readable form; it includes a short literature review, a description  of the technique using examples, an extension of the technique to multiple matrix sampling, and a discussion of the negative variance estimate problem using multiple matrix sampling.

The training intervention, in a junior high school, used exercises designed to increase awareness of interpersonal and organizational processes. Rather than attempt to improve the personal development of individuals, the goal was to increase the effectiveness of the faculty as a working body. Issues that thwarted organizational functioning included: (1) Insufficient role clarity of the principal, vice principal, counselors, and department coordinators; (2) failure to draw on staff resources, especially between academic departments; and (3) low staff involvement and participation at  meetings of committees, departments, and full faculty. Posttraining questionnaires pointed to favorable improvement. A related document is EA 002 557. (LN)",

The study tested: (1) Behavior of administrators in meetings in their school system; (2) behavior toward subordinates; (3) skill in diagnosing problems; (4) ability to see alternative strategies in diagnosing problems; and (5) influence on nonparticipants in their school systems. Measurement instruments compared this experimental group with a control group in discussion of issues in school, sensitivity to problems in staff and administrative meetings, interaction with subordinates, and organizing of subordinates.

Data were obtained from (1) a review of the literature, (2) attendance at professional association meetings, and (3) a series of interviews with accountants. The findings to date indicate that the normative patterns governing the organization and division of labor have broken down due to the emergence of the computer as part of accounting systems. The traditional structure of accounting firms is a bureaucratic pyramid. Use of the computer reduces the necessary number of lower status positions, whereas middle level employment of specialists in computer technology has increased. The upper level auditors and the specialists have communication problems which place the  traditional noncomputer-trained auditors in a situation of conflict. Their pattern of role behavior has changed and informal norms have developed to meet the needs created by the computer audit. (Author/MF)",

The daily coordination of ear training, sight singing, chamber music, and a wide variety of selected standard music provided the basic musical knowledge. The first 3-week period involved 6 hours of study per day under master teachers in class and rehearsal sessions. The remainder of the year involved weekly private lessons under local string teachers. Progress was outstanding for all students and parental and student excitement proved to be high. During the first  3-week period, the students progressed the equivalent of 6 months to a year of study under ordinary conditions. Subsequent study under private teachers has proven proportionally rapid. A changeover from the numerical notation to the conventional notation was effected with no loss in speed of learning.

Based on a total sample of 840 elementary students (38% usable response) and 960 junior high students (49% usable response), statistical analyses indicated that teachers' use of the guides and their classroom presentations were successful in stimulating student interest in conservation problems. With the exception of the unit for grade 6 on minerals and oils, which proved too difficult and will require rewriting, consistent student test performances in all school districts and in all other grades indicated that the materials are at an appropriate  grade level of difficulty. Findings support the value of the sequential resource unit approach to both the teacher and the student. In addition to an introductory guide to Wyoming's natural resources and their management, complete curriculum core units for each grade are appended as follows: (1) Wildlife, (2) Water, (3) Soils, (4) Grassland, (5) Forests, (6) Minerals and Oil, (7) Pollution, (8) Human Resources, and (9) Environmental Usage.

Sixty educable mentally retarded and 60 mentally normal junior high school students were randomly selected and assigned to one of three treatment groups, each learning to a different criterion, for each intellectual category in order to learn a paired associate task. Retention was assessed by immediate recall scores, 24 hour recall scores, and relearning scores following the 24 hour interval. A 2x3 complete factorial analysis of covariance was performed for the following dependent variables: original learning; relearning; and 24 hour recall. Immediate recall was assessed utilizing a 2x3 complete analysis of the variance procedure. The  results of the investigation indicated inferior learning performance and a 24 hour retention deficit for retarded subjects; and amelioration by overlearning of retention deficits in the retarded subjects. In addition, the results in the area of rote learning and retention comparing mentally retarded and normal subjects were found to be method dependent. (Author/JD)",

During 1965, 10 clients were served; staff members were recruited and added during the next two years; and over a 3-year period 194 clients were referred and 126 were served. The core service was rehabilitation counseling; other services included psychological and psychiatric evaluation and testing, social work services, and ancillary services. The majority of the 126 clients were young; 51.6% were between 15 and 24 years of age; males outnumbered females 87 to 39; 73.81% were prelingually deafened; and illiteracy represented the most frequent vocational handicap with 46.8% of the  126 clients unable to read at the fourth grade level. Seventy-seven clients were either employed or in academic or vocational programs after leaving the project. Conclusions were as follows: there is a continuing need for services for deaf adults; there was a direct relationship between availability of staff and the ability to develop a caseload and provide services; lack of staff hampered stimulation of referrals; there was a major failing of educational methods with the clients, many of whom were normal or above in intelligence; and more services were needed. Implications for the future and recommendations are reported. (RJ)",

Teachers rated the behavior of children in their classes using the Quay Behavior Problem Checklist; subjects were also given achievement and intelligence tests. Seven subgroups were found as were some educationally relevant variables associated with behavior clusters. Groups differed to some extent with respect to IQ and associated factors; no differences were found in terms of psychometric characteristics. Indications were that grossly different curricula would not be necessary, and that the overlap between behavioral characteristics and learning characteristics was not great. When compared with normals the  disturbed groups showed distinctive differences; no group, however, was retarded in reading relative to mental age, but the majority of teachers perceived subjects to be achieving far below what psychometric instruments showed.

It raises funds by selling tax exempt bonds and notes. The Fund is authorized to receive payments for air rights plus payments in lieu of taxes are used to retire bonds. Multi-use buildings add a new dimension to community development, leading to a greater identification among school, home, and business. In addition the sizes of new schools can be economically reduced, creating a more personal atmosphere. (NI)",

One part of the report depicts plans and phased objectives for the major projects within the CAI Center. Plans are continued for a collegiate physics course, the CAI course in social welfare, and the Intermediate Science Curriculum Study course. Activities have been inaugurated for teacher recruitment and placement, the use of systems concepts within education, and accompanying data management and analysis  programs required to facilitate research efforts. Another section presents studies in progress, and these range from the use of CAI in collegiate counseling processes to the use of the CAI system to study discrimination processes under varying attitudinal reinforcement conditions.

High quality programs presenting new medical knowledge were broadcast in an effort to promote continuing education of general practitioners working away from centers of medical sciences. Studies using mailed questionnaires and interviews to assess the breadth and reaction of the viewing audience revealed that a remarkably low number of doctors (7% to 21%) tuned in the programs. Reactions from sample panels of viewers tended to be unspecific. Although the study is small, sporadic and not statistically significant, making it impossible to draw conclusions about defects in particular programs, the overall conclusion is that the programs were not  having a serious educational impact.

Some of the items were based on information contained in the visuals, others on the commentary, and a third group on information to be found in both the visual and audio channels. Some items were visual, and some verbal. The aerodynamics films were shown to 430 ROTC trainees divided at random into eight test groups. The experiments, concerned with the overall effectiveness of the  audio and video elements, yielded the following main conclusions: (1) Significant learning accrues from the presentation of the film as a whole, and from the presentation of either the audio or video channel alone. 2. Neither channel is consistently better than the other. 3. Both channels together are consistently better than either one alone. 4.

Findings immediately related to practice are often inadequate, omitting the theoretical establishment of principles by which we can explain and predict the phenomena of our world. These theoretical linkages to the practical world of decision-making occur more frequently as researchers form more innovative hypotheses and design both innovative and rigorous investigative procedures. A research report should present a clear statement of what was studied, the method used in studying it; specification of how the data were analyzed, the results of the study, and conclusions and interpretations. The research evaluator must seek a logical presentation of the problem, since this will  partially determine the researcher's ability to develop adequate methodology. The hypothesis must be defined, the sample chosen carefully for stated reasons, the design determined to be valid, and the dependent and independent variables defined and measured. Each study is only a single block in the construction of a theory applicable to educational policy making. No study is without flaws or takes into account all the variables of today's world. Knowledge of research evaluation, therefore, is essential. (MM)",

Feedback was defined as any consequence or result of performance that is perceived by the learner. Behaviorally, three levels of feedback were seen: videotape replay of two class performances with traditional (class and instructor) feedback for all performances; audiotape replay of two class performances with traditional feedback for all performances; no electronic replay of any class performances but with traditional feedback for all performances.  Videotapes of three other speakers were viewed. Native speech skill and improvement were measured by nine evaluators who viewed videotapes of the first and final speeches made by all students. Analysis indicated that subjects who viewed videotapes of two of their class performances demonstrated significantly greater overall speech skill and bodily action, personality, language, and voice skills than the other two groups between whom there were no significant statistical differences.

Proximity error occurs when, due to the ordering, or polarity, of the differential scales, one answer on the semantic differential results in another answer to a subsequent question being substantially changed from what it would otherwise be. A computer produced a set of semantic differential questionnaires which were controlled for various kinds of proximity error--effects due to order of concept presentation, of adjective presentation, and of order of adjectives within a particular scale. Three experiments were conducted varying questionnaires and types of proximity error. In each experiment all measures indicated no significant differences in  response traceable to questionnaire format manipulations, showing that proximity error was not a problem in administering semantic differential questionnaires.

National integration, upgrading and extending education, strengthening the vocational and technical components of education, modernizing agriculture, family planning, teaching literacy--the stated goals of the Indian government--could be more easily achieved with a national television network. Capital investment and operating costs for such a program are high; less expensive alternatives should be considered. An adequate technical and personnel base would be necessary for reliable service--which means training programs and industrial modernization if the country is not to be dependent on outside help. A department must be established to control and organize the program. If satellite  television is to be employed, the problems of access to satellite technology, coverage area and spillover, and heterogeneity of the viewing audience must be solved. It is probable that, in the case of India, the best way to provide an economical, reliable, national network, with service to the villages, is to move gradually in the direction of a system employing direct television broadcast from a satellite.

The instructor declared that he had few difficulties after initial troubles of a technical nature had been eliminated.

This study explores a method of evaluating a particular film and of producing a film with greater ability to teach. The verbal message of the film is broken into paragraphs concerned with common topics. Questions testing the information contained in each paragraph are administered to two groups, one which has heard only the sound track of the film and one which has seen the entire film. The improvement in the ability of the students to answer questions after seeing the complete audiovisual presentation,  which is significant, provides a test for the effectiveness of each part of the instructional film.

Continuous re-education is needed to maintain the competence of teaching personnel already in service. One way of providing this instruction is through the use of video tape techniques to demonstrate good teaching practice. Video tape has the advantage of providing realistic demonstrations in different teaching conditions and allowing instruction without disrupting normal school functions. This study investigated the effectiveness of video-taped demonstrations in changing practices and viewpoints of different types of teachers when used in varying ways. Video-taped demonstrations had a positive effect on quality of teaching, the greatest  change occurring in those rated as needing the greatest improvement and among the highly motivated. Young teachers learned strategies faster but older teachers adapted learning more effectively to the classroom situation. Principals were fair raters of teacher improvement.

Here is an attempt to define the characteristics of filmic communication in order that it may be applied to more complex educational aims. Language and filmic symbolism are compared to facilitate coding through varying levels of complexity. Problems raised by this form of structural analysis are discussed within the framework of the codification. A functional analysis is also made of filmic communication, in which film is conceived of as a system of implementation with the potential for the conceptual manipulation of the environment. It is felt that the effects of filmic communication are accountable to a process termed coding  transformation, during which the characteristics of the symbol system transform experience in such a way as to supplement individual cognitive processes. It is also felt that the inherent characteristic of film as a symbol system is its inductive nature, which is highly valuable in communicating those aspects of educational development such as discovery, inquiry training, reflective teaching, hypothetical mode or, generically, inductive teaching. References, tables, coding models and schematic diagrams are presented. (SH)",

Current practices in audiovisual distribution cause frequent frustrations in availability. It is also difficult to find up-to-date cataloguing that teachers can refer to. Research was undertaken to determine the major problems of existing media centers, and an in-depth study was made of the Sacramento Unified Schools Instructional Materials Center and of the Alameda County Schools Curriculum Materials Center, both large California districts. A computer-controlled system is suggested which will carry with it new possibilities for instructional film use but possible under the present manual system. The  proposed system is addressed to the problem of making materials available for classroom use in the most expeditious manner possible. The system involves multi-purpose computer terminal stations in each school with access to a regional computer center. Recommendations are made for further study to define engineering requirements, for financial aid programs to implement the system, and for pertinent legislative reform, as well as for training for the media specialist and &quot;re-education&quot; for educational film producers.

The project placed major emphasis on learning efficiency and a systems approach and used two sources of continuing information: a National Seminar on Learning and Television and a Field Consultant Service. It was found that ITV was deprecated by educators and educational television broadcasters alike, that the use of ITV was spotty and optional, that emphasis in ITV productions was placed on teaching inputs rather than learning outputs, and that teachers were not aware of the use of educational technology in facilitating educational change. As a result of these findings, an inservice self-instructional course kit and  problem-oriented workshops (on the societal, state, and individual urban school district levels) were devised to acquaint educators with the process of systematically analyzing objectives and problems in terms of the learner and to use educational technology to implement comprehensive educational change. In addition, a group of educators visited Samoa to examine the school systems there which operate on the basis of a systems approach and which use educational technology extensively. (SP)",

Results showed no significant difference between non-mediated students of different kinds on the variable of interest as measured through capillary pressure, suggesting that this measurement is too insensitive (especially when taken after, not during, testing).

        "description":"The purposes of this study were: (1) to validate capillary pulse pressure as an indicator of affective response, (2) to determine whether teachers and students respond similarly to instructional films, (3) to determine whether positive affective response yields greater cognitive learning, and (4) to determine whether capillary pulse pressure can be used to identify scenes within films which yield negative affective responses. The major instrument of this study was the psychophysical response of the viewer as measured by capillary pulse pressure. Analysis of data showed (1) no dependence between overt and pulse pressure evaluation of students and adults who viewed the films, (2) no dependence between capillary pulse pressure and cognitive learning, and (3) no dependence between  student and adult pulse pressure evaluations. It is possible to differentiate amongst scenes as to which will yield the strongest negative response in either group of evaluators. It may be that pulse pressure is not an adequate indicator of anything; or that techniques used for measurement need refining; or that pulse pressure is a response to an as yet undefined stimulus. Further study is in order. Some specific recommendations as to its character are made. Supplements include a bibliography, material used to conduct the tests, and statistical data. (JY)",

The study was conducted within a computer-based drill-and-practice project. For the study two computer programs were developed. One program presented and corrected the lists of words. The other program planned lessons for each child as a function of the mathematical model the words represented, the words the child was studying, and the child's performance on the words. An analysis of the correct responses made by each child through the study demonstrated that the strategy derived from the One Element Model produced significantly better terminal performance than the strategy developed from the Single Operator Linear model.

        "description":"With data obtained from a National Science Foundation Survey on Computers in higher education, the differences in the pattern of costs and usage of computer centers at higher learning institutions on the West Coast and comparative institutions in the rest of the nation were analyzed. Doctoral granting institutions of the West Coast are strikingly different from those of the rest of the nation. In comparison with other institutions, the public doctoral granting institutions of the West Coast are highly dependent on federal funds for their computer centers, think in big terms for expansion, depend on and use federal funds in many computer activities, and have a different usage pattern in some subject areas. Private doctoral institutions also have a greater reliance on federal funds  for their computer centers. In many respects, the public West Coast doctoral institutions are closer to the pattern of a private West Coast institution than to equivalent Eastern doctoral granting public institutions. There is great value in analyzing sub-sets since some of the differences between regions, and between public and private institutions are causing distortions in the national pattern. (Author/JY)",

Each course was semi-automated in order to free the instructor's time for question and answer periods. One experimental group of junior college students took the course using FM radio, an illustrated syllabus, and student response sheets. Another group took the same subject on campus using a combination of tapes, filmstrips, student response sheets, and seminars. The radio students were able to conduct a discussion with their instructor by calling the radio station each night that the program was presented. A t-test was run to compare the mean scores of these two groups on two mid-term tests and one final test. A statistical analysis of the data determined that there was no significant difference  at the 1% level of confidence in the learning of the two groups. It was felt that the course could be successfully taught by radio and thus fulfill the college's responsiblity for community education. (Author/JY)",

        "description":"Capillary pulse pressure measurement may have potential as a covert but direct means of determining a subject's level of affect as he encounters the frame-by-frame content of programed instruction. An experiment was designed which called for recording the capillary pulse pressure of subjects as they worked through some programed instruction sequences that had specific flaws deliberately inserted in them. It was hypothesized that the record of capillary pulse pressures would show characteristics which would independently reveal these encounters without the need for further overt interaction with the subjects. Each of the high school students had a small pulse transducer taped to the end of his finger. As he worked through the specially prepared programs, the data obtained was  recorded on a chart recorder. It was found that capillary pulse pressure characteristics vary from person to person, but individuals may still be placed in one of a small number of type-groups. Variation in the magnitude of an individual's capillary pulse pressure occurs both as a long term and as a short term phenomenon. It is possible to determine from the charts the level of involvement of a given subject. Samples of charts obtained, statistical charts, tables, and a bibliography supplement the report. (JY)",

Over 12 days, subjects completed a pretest, an attitude toward instructional media scale, study of the course material, a posttest, a computer-based testing attitude scale, and another posttest to assess the effects of explanation on learning. Results of analyses of variance of the data showed significant learning of course material for  all students between pre- and posttest scores, that individual role subjects performed better than teacher and pupil role subjects, that feedback in the form of explanation was more effective than knowledge of results, and that the method of spacing error-producing frames did not adversely affect student attitudes toward PI. In addition, it appears that attitudes toward PI and computer-based testing were generally dependent on the number of errors made on the tests, and that student attitudes toward technology did not affect performance.

Fred Hechinger, education editor of the New York Times, discusses the range of devices available, from film strips to computers. He feels that industry is oversold on the future of educational technology, both because of the generally conservative views of educators and the misunderstandings prevalent about the process of education. John Henry Martin, Senior Vice-President of Responsive Environments Cooporation, designates American education, particularly urban education, a complete failure. He cites the benefits to be gained from applying dollar value productivity measures to the acquisition of instructional materials and media. What is needed is a better  understanding of the process of learning itself, and an application of that understanding to media development and use. Louis B. Wright, director of the Folger Shakespeare Library, takes a social historian's viewpoint of the process of education. He feels that the technological revolution has not yet faced the unchanging character of human nature. The control and manipulation of technology for humane ends, he concludes, is a great challenge.

Two types of student performance data related to specific objectives (derived from statistics for the number of students selecting each option on tests, frequency distributions of student scores on an objective by objective basis, and on a unit by unit basis, and cross validation data on parallel items) and subjective teacher and student judgements. Examination and analysis of these data by computer reveal  whether a unit needs refinement or not; if it does, the data can reveal the difficulty, whether it is a lack of consistency in activities and objectives between learning, a poorly stated problem, inappropriate sequencing of learning activities, or lack of student understanding of the presentation format.

The student was presented with an event which had an outcome that ran counter to his expectations. Motivated by his curiousity, he then searched for an explanation to the discrepancy between what he expected and the actual event. Several avenues of inquiry were offered to assist him in his investigations. To test the program, 71 fourth grade students were divided into three groups--one control and two experimental. The experimental groups used the Inquiry Development Program in addition to their regular curriculum. Pre- and posttests were administered to determine the levels of achievement responsibility and academic achievement in  science. A test to measure the level of inquiry was administered afterwards. The results of the tests for independence and academic achievement were compared through an analysis of covariance. The test for inquiry was analyzed by a one-way analysis of variance. The only significant difference was shown to be that the students of the experimental group offered more explanations to a problem situation than did those of the control group.

Student responses to multiple presentations of each set were scored for accuracy (the control condition) and, half of the time, for speed as well (the experimental condition) by a machine providing immediate reinforcement. When frames of the  experimental condition responses were compared with frames of the control condition, it was found that scoring and reinforcing for speed were statistically reliable in increasing both speed and accuracy; a statistically significant relationship exists between the number of reinforcements and question answering accuracy and speed.

This included a planned sequence of study, work, and community living, individualized program options for all qualified students, and financial planning to make a year abroad possible at no more cost to a student than a campus year. The pattern proved workable and, since 1964, about one-half of each graduating class has been on AEA. Because rapid expansion of international education at Antioch and nationally has provoked many questions, the report describes some of the controversial issues in the academic area with reference to AEA's experience. AEA students studied and worked on all continents, adapting their schedules to differing university  calendars. According to AEA alumni, educational objectives of the program were achieved. Crediting and evaluation were usually based on examinations and/or professorial statements from schools overseas. Self selection proved successful. AEA students were of high academic quality and remained so during their study abroad and after their return to Antioch. The incorporation of experience abroad into campus structures was one of the weakest aspects of the program. However, the international emphasis of Antioch and its foreign language course offerings rose considerably. (JS)",

        "description":"America is experiencing its most rapid change over, and it is necessary that this change be contained in a meaningful way. The main thrust of our recent changes has been in the direction of an erosion of belief in the American dream on the part of college students and ghetto residents. If the heart of the American experience is to be &quot;access&quot;, then equal opportunity for equal life chances must be provided for all. The inner city revolution is part of a deeper and continuing &quot;uprooting revolution&quot; which violates the organic health of individuals, the community, and nation. Television has had a revolutionary impact by implying that fulfillment of desires can be instantaneous. Trust and communication are 2 crucial factors in the relationship of society to students and ghetto  residents. However, this trust has been broken, and the result has been activism, often violent. Activism is good, but it should be preceded by reflective thinking. There are 7 theories that attempt to account for violent activism. Much of this activism has been directed toward destroying the organism of the university. Constitutional structures must be revised, and a new setting must be created within which the teaching and learning processes can proceed in a healthy way. Change can be effected if collective intelligence and will are used. (DS)",

The Institute for Educational Development undertook 3 general activities in this study. First, data were gathered to establish a sound basis for analyzing and projecting the need for additional facilities and programs for higher education in Vermont. Secondly, although originally a comprehensive plan for higher education in the state was to be developed, this came in the form of a recommendation for the establishment of a permanent &quot;Coordinating Council for Post-Secondary Education in Vermont&quot; to fulfill this function. Suggestions for its structure and function were  made. Third, the financial capability of Vermont with special reference to the state's aid to education was analyzed. This report is a summary and commentary on the data that were collected, and a series of recommendations. The data, presented extensively in tables, include figures on student enrollments and projections, course and degree offerings library and physical facilities, and number of faculty and staff. (DS)",

        "description":"In the spring of 1969, Brown University adopted a new, flexible and progressive undergraduate curriculum. The movement for curricular reform began in late 1966 when a group of Brown students headed by Ira Magaziner, '69, formed a Group Independent Studies Project to examine undergraduate education at Brown. The Group released a 450-page report 15 months later on shortcomings of US higher education with specific recommendations for curricular reform at Brown. While a Special Committee examined the report, campus-wide discussions were held on its principles and proposals. After the Committee issued its INTERIM REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS, the faculty debated the report for 3 days and on May 8, 1969, approved the new curriculum. An underlying assumption of the new curriculum is that  education must be judged by its effect on the intellectual, aesthetic and moral growth of the student. Only the student can evaluate the extent to which his education satisfies these needs for personal development, so he must be willing and be permitted to assume responsibility, in major part, for the direction of his own education. New seminar courses and extensive counseling procedures should increase and improve collaboration between students and teachers. &quot;Modes of Thought&quot; courses replace traditional freshman offerings; distribution requirements are eliminated; individual concentration programs are stressed; and grading will be on an &quot;A B C &quot; or &quot;Satisfactory&quot; basis.

        "description":"When the University of California at Berkeley initiated year-round operation in the summer of 1967, the prevailing question concerned whether such a system would work. Midway through the summer term of the following year, a mail survey of 2,100 students --a 25% sample of those enrolled in the 1968 Summer Quarter-- was conducted to evaluate the program and to assess student reactions to it. In order to establish whether the sample group differed from the total summer student population and from students who attended other terms during the year, a comparison was made of survey data and information gathered from the total student population through regular registration procedures. Of particular interest were any distinguishing characteristics of summer quarter students, their  opinions of and reasons for attending the summer session, and patterns of their attendance. Since their reasons for attending would facilitate the tailoring of the program to their needs, a large portion of the questionnaire was devoted to this topic. The findings presented in this report are based on responses from 1,428 students. They analyze the students' characteristics, their patterns of attendance, the reasons why they chose to attend the summer quarter, and their reactions to the summer program. The survey questionnaire and 36 tables are included. (WM)",

Major emphasis is placed on securing an outstanding faculty, on using new instructional techniques, on delegating a large amount of responsibility for their education to the students, and on organizing the educational program to concentrate on the interrelatedness of subject matter fields. The academic program will initially focus on the arts and sciences but institutes for professional education will later be established if  warranted by demand and enrollment. Housing arrangements will encourage the intellectual development of students. Faculty members will participate in teaching teams and in counseling students. A Learning Resources Center will house the library, television studios and transmission facilities, audiovisual viewing and listening rooms, a testing and guidance clinic, reading clinic, teaching machines, language labs and other aids to learning.

This study assessed some of the kinds and sources of data used in the decision making of college presidents under present conditions. Presidents of institutions belonging to the American Association of State Colleges and Universities were queried on: which officers have the responsibility for providing the president with data such as studies on students, budget and curriculum, long range planning, space utilization, and federal  programs; what kinds of institutional data in these areas do they regularly review in making decisions; how does the president decide where to gather information in making policy decisions; does the president communicate research findings to the faculty; and what was the value of ongoing studies compared with those completed when a problem arose. The results, analyzed in this paper, show no standard set or recommended pattern of behavior. It was found, however, that presidents seem preoccupied with providing physical facilities and budgetary efficiency. (JS)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to develop the schema and methodology for the construction of a computerized mathematical model designed to project college and university enrollments in New York State and to meet the future increased demands of higher education planners. This preliminary report describes the main structure of the proposed computer simulation model as a non-stationary Markovian process with 3 basic segments: &quot;initialization&quot; (input of available data and setting the stage for system dynamics), operation (aging the system's student population and having it flow through the system), and output (describing the characteristics of students at different educational levels). This main structure is designed to act as a &quot;calling&quot; program for &quot;contingency programs,&quot; which are  separate computer models that provide data to educational planners and alter parameters in the main structure to show the effects of changes in the environment on enrollment projections. Features of the model would provide enough flexibility to meet growing informational needs and to use the capabilities of existing data systems in N.Y. State. Recommendations to the State Education Department of New York are (1) to construct a model that simulates student flows at 1 college as a prototype for a comprehensive state-wide model, (2) to develop a higher education information system for New York State, and (3) to conduct research on the development of desired functional relationships involved in contingency programs.

This report, the first of a series of 10 to be issued by the Committee, discusses the background, premises, and purposes of the study. Later reports will deal with more specific programs and areas within the university. The premises for the study deal with the ideal roles of the university in its relationship to society and in nurturing the educational processes. The most important aspect of the educational role should be to give the student freedom to direct his academic life. On the basis of these premises and the reality of the present situation at Stanford, recommendations will be  made. The first and most important recommendation is that the university should seek to &quot;sustain a spirit&quot; of self-examination and self-renewal, and that these endeavors should be physically supported by an Academic Planning Office and a standing committee of the Academic Senate. A more detailed proposal for the Academic Planning Office, a discussion of university goals, and findings from preliminary research are included in the appendices.

The series, based on the concept that education should be a continuous process of discovery throughout life, sets forth recommendations for strengthening the academic enterprise at Stanford University. This report concentrates on the undergraduate curriculum. The General Studies Program is seen as lagging behind the pace of rapid change experienced by the university and its students since the Program's inception in 1956. Perceiving discrepancies between the general educational ideal and the institutional reality, the Steering Committee advocates a transitional set of university-wide prescription that would help to resolve some of the differences. Sixteen  recommendations propose changes in curricular programs and requirements. Another 14 deal with academic operation: the calendar and schedule, courses and credit, and grades and examinations. This second set of recommendations repudiate some modern, restrictive practices and embody older traditions of higher learning that facilitate educational objectives.

It is proposed that procedures for student selection be based on many separate categories rather than on a single set of criteria. A pool of potential applicants could assess themselves for selection on the basis of categories within which Stanford students compete, the approximate percentages to be  chosen from each category, and the level of achievement that would ensure a reasonable chance of selection. Current students and faculty could provide their descriptions of the university and understanding, encouragement, and help in decision-making. The applicants selected would decide whether or not to enroll and whether their financial needs can be met.

Problems with Stanford University's professional  counseling appear to stem from indifferent attitudes of students, faculty, and administrators. In the hope that the kinds of attitudes that are vital to good counseling may be brought about, the committee proposes structural changes that would clarify --for both students and advisors-- the university's means for providing vocational and psychological counseling.

Part I contains the Committee's recommendation which center around 5 judgments about the future of the program and are designed to exploit the educational opportunity that the program represents. It is proposed  that the program be freed from any connection with Stanford's undergraduate General Studies Program and that more flexible and diversified policies be followed at the overseas campuses. To this end the Committee recommends a separate committee for each overseas campus that would establish policies for that campus. Part 2 describes the Committee's work during 1967 and 1968.

The message, in short, is that public institutions need private support to maintain quality and opportunity. Private support can make possible: the provision of superior facilities; \"venture capital\" to initiate experimental projects for which it is difficult to obtain financial support; the  braodening of educational opportunities; the support of areas for which tax funds may not be used or available.

Students are most often involved on committees concerned with the admissions and financial aid programs, curriculum, library, calendar, and guidance programs of the university. Almost 60% of the institutions reported that student committee members are elected by the student body. The general trend regarding qualifications is the  requirement that a student be a full-time undergraduate, and an upperclassman. Student participation is generally successful, as 43 of 52 institutions reported that student contributions were \"moderate\" or \"substantial.\" Approximately 90% of the institutions indicated that student membership on academic committees was initiated at their schools after 1960.

This study was directed toward determining the ways in which students acquire roles within student cultures. An effort was made to identify both the factors in the precollege environment that are associated with the initial orientation and the nature of interpersonal experiences in the college environment that confirm or change the initial orientation into an actual student role. Data were obtained in the summer of 1965 from 1822 entering students at the University of Massachusetts. An instrument  called the Student Preference Schedule was used to measure orientations to the role of students. Such orientations were found to be: measurably diversified; related to aspects of family background; associated with a student's choice of a major and plans for graduate study; important, when combined with ability, in affecting academic performance; generally stable during the first 2 years of college; and measurably related to significant interpersonal encounters with faculty members.

Models representing different types of exchanges were developed and visits were made to both campuses by Hampton's and Cornell's faculty and administrators for lectures, participation in classes, and comparison of procedures, curriculum, facilities,  and equipment. Student programs involved semester study exchanges and various extracurricular activities. Planning curriculum and faculty development at Hampton proved difficult at first, but mutually beneficial working relationships were later established. The problems, mostly preliminary misunderstandings, were due primarily to the historical differences between the two types of institutions. Since the conclusion of the 2-year project, activities have continued and developed greater formality and depth of cooperation. Appendices included detailed progress and evaluation reports. (DS)",

In the &quot;Interim Report,&quot; brief statements on the purposes of the University and the principles of undergraduate education precede discussion of specific components of the new curriculum. Personal development is  heavily emphasized. Under the new curriculum, the major portion of the freshman year will be devoted to Modes of Thought courses. Programs of concentration will center on broad themes; University courses will be interdisciplinary or problem-centered; opportunities for independent study will be unlimited; all courses will be graded on a &quot;Pass&quot; or A, B, C basis; and requirements for the BA degree will be altered.

It was hypothesized that the intellectual disposition and academic ability of students were related to their persistence at UC and satisfaction with their experiences there. Information was gathered on freshmen entering in Fall 1965 for 2 years. Data included personality and academic aptitude tests, questionnaires, college achievement and persistence, and interviews. In general, there was not a disproportionate number of average students remaining on the campuses  after 2 years (as had been anticipated), although more of those below average left. Academic ability was unrelated to withdrawal in a linear way. Reasons for leaving were related to the types of students. The campus environments were distinct in that different reasons applied to the same types of students at different campuses. Forty percent of all the students had left by Fall 1967. Evidence presented in this report indicates that if administrators and faculty wish to retain the most students possible, particularly those who are highly intellectually oriented, they must more fully accommodate the educational and developmental needs of their students. Extensive tables and copies of the questionnaires document the text. [Not available in hard copy due to marginal legibility of original  document]. (JS)",

Visits to participants in an institute were intended only to evaluate it, but uncovered also the need for an outside consultant source for presidents, for continuing development of second-echelon officers, and for immediate preparation of leaders from minority groups. Seminars have given an opportunity for college leader involvement and have shown the value not only of rapid transition from theory to practice, but also of theory in broadening the  narrow focus on immediate needs. The doctoral program is intended to develop chief administrators, whose personal and intellectual qualities will be enhanced by a study of theory and practice, by original research, and by experience in an administrative internship. The Cooperative Internship Program is an innovation in teacher preparation designed by a joint junior college-university team. The interms, though ready to teach all students, will concentrate on the minorities. The program has tried to recruit them from the minority groups. At the employing colleges, they will carry a solid teaching load, but will also have time to prepare and research their material and to have contact with colleagues. (HH)",

Before active recruitment begins, the governing board should develop accurate job descriptions, criteria of personality and staff balance, systematic appraisal methods, wide involvement in selection, efficient assignment procedures, and promotion criteria. It must also make sure the recruiter knows its policies. To determine the need for new faculty, a ratio can be established among full-time faculty, full-time students, number of credits they carry, projected enrollment, and expected normal faculty attrition. Staff time for hiring new faculty can also be calculated. Sources of qualified teachers are many. While a master's degree is widely preferred, actual teaching competence must also be  considered. In order of frequency, high schools, graduate schools, universities and other colleges, and the business world supply most instructors. The colleges may recruit by wider publicity of the opportunities on their campuses, by following up personal contacts and staff recommendations, or by choosing from unsolicited applications. Responsibility for selection varies with the college. It may rest with the dean, president, department head, advisory board, or special panel. The authoritarian vs. flexible personalities of the president and potential faculty member should also be taken into account. The review suggests several areas where further research would be useful.

Students take turns presenting the bits; if one fails, the group takes over. In this rotation, each student leads at least once in the session; the group verifies all steps. The instructor acts mainly as consultant. The principle is illustrated here with a course in math or philosophy. The outline allows for varied student interests; shows progress from strict first objectives to more flexible ones (through small group rather than lecture sessions); gives direction in the use of the textbook (Copi's SYMBOLIC LOGIC); sets up relationships among the instructor and students as individuals and as learning team members. Expected  outcomes were: various interests would be generated; four to six student leaders would emerge; students would help each other; they would use the library more; their anxiety about grades would lessen; some would reach an A grade before end of term; behavior would be reinforced with little pressure from the teacher; average learning team size would stabilize at five; ten or fewer would have trouble adapting to the learning style; some would settle early for a C or B and become less attentive. At quarter's end, some groups met most expectations; some held stable and highly motivated; others were distracted by other classwork; many opted for extra sessions; students exhorted each other to study; they learned to function as group members.

        "description":"In a junior college introductory course, an instructor taught two sections in two different ways to discover any differences in achievement or attitude. Fifteen students were randomly assigned to a conventional class and 19 to a field-work class. The first learned by lecture, group discussion, individual project, visual aids, a field trip, and an oral book report. The second class met with a teacher in their discipline at one of five local colleges, made ten visits to the college, completed at least ten of 20 behavioral objectives, recorded their experiences, and helped the instructor in several ways. Both sections took pre- and post-tests on the junior college and, at the end of term, completed a questionnaire evaluating the course and an essay on their perceptions of the junior  college. In a final written exam, the conventional class answered five short essay questions and the field section designed a new college to include their own ideas. Presented are comments from both classes on college in general; faculty appraisal of the student teachers; special remarks from the field class on instruction, faculty, self-image, environment, and governance. Also summarized are essay, test, and final exam results, the writer's observations, and student evaluations. The field course appeared to produce greater student involvement, less superficial learning, demonstrable competence in subject matter, and a commitment to junior college goals. It seemed generally to prove the worth of the pilot project. (HH)",

The greater involvement thus allowed showed the need for sub-professional help, especially in welfare and day-care centers. This project set out to (1) recruit those who, with two years of training, could fill such jobs; (2) arrange articulation with senior colleges to allow credit for any who pursue a professional career; (3) coordinate its program with local agencies most likely to hire its graduates. The courses could be terminal or transfer, emphasizing basic sociology and social welfare, and including liberal arts, field work with agencies, and special service community projects. Recruitment was directed to current and prospective students and to aults in the area. In the two  years of the program, 347 students enrolled; 22 went on for a B.A. Coordination with outside agencies was achieved once a salary scale and job category were set for these workers with less than a degree but more than high school. Widening its scope in the second year, the project added three consultant/instructors. Though certain state agency habits at first slowed the project, it later spurred a few agency changes. It revealed the college's role in community welfare, student reluctance to remain subprofessional, and the need for both undergraduate and graduate work-study programs in the agencies. Even those without a B.A. would benefit the community with their knowledge of society's needs. (HH)",

As the problem was immediately important, materials would be plentiful. Four courses (speech, composition, social studies, literature) and three instructors dealt exclusively with this 2-quarter, 16-credit project. The Fall 1968 class of 25 had only four blacks in it; the next had 14. The students did field work in the community; their reports were their writing assignment. As previous pre- and post-tests of attitudes had shown a student gain in empathy with other ethnic groups, the tests were not used for these two quarters. The investigators will reinstate them next time, however, as this one revealed that the black students lost less anti-white  prejudice than expected. It was also clear that, after initial hesitations, the different perspectives of team teaching contributed to the vitality of instruction. It was disappointing to discover that not all students responded to the responsibilities of freedom. A more topical approach will be used in the next project, e.g., black community life, sex and racism, under- and unemployment, integration in education, housing and civil rights, police relations, etc., and, of course, possible solutions to the problems. Prerequisites will be more rigid and the course numbers will be made specific to this project.

In such a field, where outcomes must be expressed in terms of student writing skills acquired (or not acquired), few well-defined experiments have been reported. This investigator, in an attempt to discriminate among levels of performance in student themes, faced the problem of establishing a reliable evaluation technique. The techniques she finnaly adopted are described in this report. Having set up a grading system, she then sought to learn if one way of teaching grammar was more effective than another. Of two sections in the grammar course, one became the control group, taught in the traditional way, while the other, the  experimental group, received three hours of language laboratory instruction and one hour in a recitation-discussion class. Tables show the correlation of rank and raters in grading the themes for each group, and pre- and post-test scores for each class. It appeared that gains were greater in style than in mechanics. The comparisons showed that theme improvement was not appreciable related to the teaching method or to the quarter of instruction. The students did improve their techniques after instruction in grammar and style. The method of grouping showed a significant upward shift in style, but an insignificant one in mechanics. (HH)",

It must be ready for several student clienteles with changing needs, interests, activities, and values; for the under-educated of all ages; and for those special populations not served by other schools, all without neglecting its current students. Barbara Thomas discusses problems (and possible solutions) in student assessment. Late-enrolling students, requiring post-admission tests, make program planning difficult. Lack of such testing affects retention/attrition rates, placement, and teacher workload. C. E. Glenister examines 2- and 4-year students on six points of the Study of Values Scale. The differences between men's and women's values at  the junior college are noted. Staff, administration, faculty, and personnel workers should consider them in selecting more effective programs and teaching methods. Terry O'Banion considers the problems of students' transfer shock (academic and emotional), including lack of counseling, low self-esteem, solidified social groups, lack of money, admission and evaluation policies, repeated testing, and doubtful prerequisites. James W. Trent urges a systematic evaluation of the junior college and its programs to understand the dynamics of the variety of institutions and students and to find principles and techniques useful to other colleges at least cost.

Statistical comparisons were made scale-for-scale between these students and national normative group average scores. The comparisons of means and standard deviations were analyzed by &quot;t&quot; tests; the results of these tests were presented. In general it was found that both males and females were quite different from the standardized groups and appeared to be somewhat deficient in the areas considered essential for effective educational outcomes. This report was prefaced with a description of the test including a discussion of its rationale, reliability and validity, and the advantage of using this type of personality inventory.  (MB)",

        "description":"Dissatisfied both with lecturing to 125 students three times a week and with the idea of having teaching assistants conduct seminars, the author devised a new method of handling his class. With administration consent, he arranged to lecture to the whole class (by then, 275 students) twice a week and to conduct 11 seminars of 25 students each. These 13 classroom hours a week were his entire teaching load. At first meeting, the class was introduced to its &quot;contract&quot; with the instructor, the course workbook, the immediate-feedback testing method, the seminars, and the grading system. The workbook consisted of open-end questions derived from all segments of the course (lecture, seminar, text, and outside reading) and was the basis of all examination questions. The testing method,  intended to give the students immediate feedback, is described in detail, as are the terms of the contract and the grading system. The last was designed to show the students' learning more accurately than the customary curve grading. The instructor added interest to the lectures by use of slides, film strips, etc., and by pre-arranged student illustrations of an idea. He also learned each student's name. Seminars were not necessarily coordinated with the lecture material, but instead encouraged the student to understand and express his feelings toward himself and society. The instructor found he saw more students in his office than in previous years, even those spent counseling. (HH)",

Faculty members act as advisors, as they know policies, course requirements, student personalities, and vocational requirements as well as full-time counselors. The principal aim of the guidance program is to help students make better use of their abilities--social, academic, and personal. Each Harcum student receives three planned interviews per year, one after each mid-term grade report and one after the start of the second semester. They cover academic, vocational, and personal/social  matters. A confidential folder is maintained, containing information from each session, academic records, and data on any further action taken, such as referral to the health service or to a dean. A follow-up is essential on any referral. The advisor must know the college policies, regulations, and academic requirements and be prepared to help the student, formally or informally, in many areas, e.g., choice of program, study habits, extra-curricular activities, and long-range vocational plans. He must be genuinely interested in helping her to reach her own decisions, not in imposing his own values. The advisor can use the resources of the whole campus, including any other department, service, faculty, or staff member. (HH)",

In the avocational realm, as well as the vocational, the 2-year college can serve the special needs and interests of the community. Short courses, lecture series, concerts, leisure activities and services, and community use of campus facilities help the community college to meet the challenge of its name. Effective public relations programs must (1) assemble facts on the objectives and resources of the college and on areas of public ignorance and possible criticism; (2) pinpoint its target populations; and (3) make full use of its sources of information, including faculty and staff, students, instructional programs, college events, and community services. A college's image may be enhanced by a clearly  defined philosophy, precise objectives, and programs that meet the stated objectives. Advisory committees, which are actively involved in the planning and decision-making processes, help to fulfill the need for 2-way communications between the college and the community. The results of one study, focusing on community opinion, indicated that an association exists between informed individuals and a positive opinion toward the college.

Each interlibrary loan requester was asked to record what position he held (attending staff, resident, intern, other staff), and whether his request was related to patient care, teaching, continuing education, or research. The discussion covers the dependability of questionnaire information, who uses the service, need for and growth of the service, and use of the service by different groups of requesters. Among the conclusions reached are that (1) interlibrary loan service involves many factors and simple counts of users and requests are not useful for determining service policy, and (2) if access to scholarly records for health care is accepted as  a requirement in hospital environments, perhaps an interinstitutional approach to planning for the access service would be more valuable than trying to define what a single hospital library ought to do or be.

The study involved the examination of Kentucky's school, public, academic and special libraries and the Department of Libraries, followed by the development of a statewide plan of library service which includes a program for funding the plan. Study data were obtained from questionnaires sent to all types of libraries, visits to libraries in each category, interviews with over 50 librarians and staff members of the Department of Libraries, and an examination of relevant literature. It was concluded that library service at all levels in Kentucky needs to be expanded and coordinated if it is to meet the needs of current and potential library users.  Although the Department of Libraries has been the source of energy and innovation in the library system, it is time for all types of libraries to make a greater contribution of their own. The basic recommendation for improvement is a plan for establishment of a statewide library network. This will involve strengthening of the Department of Libraries, establishment of resource centers, larger units of service, direct funding for public libraries, and a training program for librarians.

The mothers actively participated in a parent-training program consisting of tutorial training in which a series of lessons designed to teach preacademic concepts and skills to the children was presented to the mothers. In lessons on classroom management the mothers learned to manage pupils and to provide good social learning experiences in group situations. The tutorial curriculum included 150 lessons covering primer level skills. Initially, mother responses to children indicated high rates of inappropriate tutorial behavior. The mothers were then coached to praise correct answers and to help children before they made mistakes. Because these mothers  exhibited little skill in maintaining orderly, productive play with groups of children, a &quot;Switching System&quot; was introduced in which boundaries of activity areas were defined and children were required to complete an academic task before moving to another area. As a result, a quiet, well-ordered environment was established. There are indications that behavioral deficits in poor children can be minimized by providing their mothers with limited teaching and management skills using positive reinforcement. (DO)",

Responses to three types of tasks (moral and causal judgments, and general reasoning) were recorded for 28 boys from grades three, four, and five. Results supported the first hypothesis. Subjects who scored at the high level in general reasoning also scored at the same high level in moral and causal judgment tasks. But subjects scoring low on general reasoning tasks were  inconsistent in their level of responses to the other two tasks. Thus, the second hypothesis was not confirmed. Where each task was compared with age, significant results were yielded only for the moral judgment task. Here the older group of boys had significantly higher scores than the younger group. Comparison of the relationship between tasks shows only the relationship between general reasoning and causal judgment to be significant. (JF)",

Direct involvement with preschool children in community-based settings is recommended, for training should provide both knowledge of subject matter, and an understanding of young children.  At all levels of teaching, certification should depend upon demonstrated competence, and criteria and procedures for evaluating competence should be established. Both training programs and certification requirements should be flexible enough to permit competent persons with limited training to begin working with children. There should be more than one route to certification and licensure based on competence rather than credits, and new approaches to inservice training for teachers should be designed. (DR)",

Meetings were divided between child-centered activities (presentation of educational toys and materials) and mother-centered activities (discussions on child management and birth control). The second year program suggested mothers use positive reinforcement, show increased interest in learning, and give children experience in problem solving. Study results showed that the infants made intellectual gains on the  Stanford-Binet and ITPA. Mothers showed much interest in the 2 year program, attended regularly, and became involved in paraprofessional teaching and Head Start. Teacher observations during home visits indicated that mothers' attitudes changed positively in respect to teaching their infants. The study concluded that parents must be included in programs for the disadvantaged and that the time variable is crucial to attitude change since it was the second year before mothers developed the self-confidence to use at home what they had learned in class.

Teachers also reported that the program helped children to develop a positive self-concept, especially the older children, who developed good peer relationships and experienced success. Teachers expressed concern that the program did not allow enough time to work with the individual young child.

Five head teachers in a project for disadvantaged 5-year-olds who were rated by supervisors at either extreme of effectiveness were selected for observation of their behavior. Complex, in-depth observations, based on behavioral episodes, were made of each teacher in the settings of \"Morning Greeting\" and \"Large Group Activity.\" These observations were analyzed on a structural and quantitative basis involving 16 factors governing a behavioral episode. While the  nature of the resulting data made statistical analysis inappropriate, several major trends were recorded. Those teachers rated effective maintained a smoother continuity to their activities, ended more episodes with the attainment of goals, and showed more positive and less negative emotions than their poorly rated counterparts. The effective teachers were more directly involved, more spontaneous, and more in control of situations. (MH)",

Teacher ratings of creativity and independence, grade point averages, art grades, and IQ scores were also obtained. It was hypothesized that a unitary trait of &quot;creativity&quot; could be measured. Statistical analysis of the tests resulted in the extraction of nine significant factors. Six of the factors were achievement, adjustment, sex-typing factor for fears, mental ability, intolerance of ambiguity, and self-confidence. Three factors, used as measures of figural creativity, stood as independent traits: the ability to complete the unfinished, the ability to handle complexity, and preference for complexity. Therefore,  it is concluded that figural creativity is not a unitary trait. As expected, traditional measures of intelligence and grades were independent of the figural creativity factors, although subjects were of better than average intelligence. Personality variables were independent of two creativity factors: the ability to complete the unfinished and preference for complexity. The third creativity factor, ability to handle complexity, was found in children who were perceptive, happy-go-lucky, and admitted that they had common fears. (DR)",

The tests consisted of three visual pursuit tasks; measures of convergence, refixation ability, and  power; and power; and the Draw-A-Circle task.

(Syntax refers to the rules for ordering words within sentences; associativity refers to the network of meaningful relationships which exist among words in a language.) Twenty-four children from each of grades kindergarten, 1, 2, and 3, were asked to randomly repeat as many words as they could remember from a series of stimulus messages. It was hypothesized that older children would benefit more from structural cues and have an increasing advantage over younger children as the tasks became more structured. Eight testing tapes were administered during two sessions using minimal stress and inflection. Each tape consisted of items with syntax and  items without syntax. The hypothesis was confirmed; syntax helped only the third graders. There was significantly greater recall of the messages with associativity for all grade levels. The experiment was repeated adding intonation to the items with syntax. Intonation resulted in marked improvement in recall, particularly for messages with associativity. Because the capacity to process and store verbal information increases as children grow older, further research is required in this area. (MH)",

Workshops were conducted for 15 non-specialist teachers to explore the concepts of space, time, and force, and to incorporate these concepts into a dance curriculum. Prototype lessons were developed for 3- to 8-year-olds. Classroom activities focused on solving problems through movement; discovering the concepts of space (shapes, sizes, and relationships); time (both clock and calendar intervals); and force (weight, gravity, energies in motion, and relationships between objects in space). Evaluations consisted of teacher and classroom  observations. These evaluations indicated positive outcomes of behavioral objectives. Recommendations were made for the improvement of teacher selection and preparation and development of a process-model curriculum. (DR)",

Topics in the 23 page Rationale section range from theories of cognitive development to an extensive explanation of the workshop concept which is recommended as the basis of the theater curriculum. The workshop should emphasize creative problem solving in an atmosphere of human interaction without authority-imposed discipline or instructor approval-disapproval. The workshop experience should be child-oriented to permit each child to proceed at his own rate, and should teach processes and methods of working rather than facts. The authors outline their proposed program of teacher  preparation, involving summer sessions and an academic year apprenticeship. Theatrical lighting, props, student-teacher ratio, coaching, and evaluation are explored. Specific suggestions for workshop activity and improvisations are made. Finally, although the pilot project was unable to secure many of the conditions considered essential to an effective theater program, the original recommendations were confirmed. (MH)",

Following a workshop and planning conference, the Central Atlantic Regional Educational Laboratory (CAREL) staff, classroom teachers, and music specialists instigated The Developmental Phases of Musical Exploration. The six phases were free exploration, guided exploration, free improvisation, planned improvisation, reinforcement, and evaluation. The program, using a team teaching approach, utilized a music laboratory, audio equipment, and electronic music.  Teachers were evaluated through questionnaires, classroom visits, individual teacher consultations, and experience reports. Students were evaluated by a pre- and posttest, classroom observations, and tapes of musical experiences. Results indicated high teacher and student involvement and students' development of musical creativity and positive attitudes toward music. Aural tests require further analysis. Refinement of the program into a pilot process-model curriculum and incorporation of music into a multi-arts core curriculum were recommended. (DR)",

In workshops and classrooms, teachers used stories, pictures, poems, and class discussion to encourage student response and expression, both oral and written. To encourage creativity, correction of grammatical and spelling errors was de-emphasized. Evaluations were made of taped classroom and workshop sessions, oral and written reports prepared by  the teachers and CAREL staff, and children's written work. Results indicated improvement in children's self-expression and writing ability.

Teacher role refers to a teacher's behavior concerning the duties, responsibilities, and functions expected of the teacher by her clients and herself. Teacher style refers to the way in which individual teachers perform their roles. Teachers have had three basic role models: (1) maternal: keep children safe and busy, (2) therapeutic: help children express feelings and reduce tensions, and (3) instructional: transmit knowledge. The author predicts the instructional model is \"in\", but will meet resistance because of these limitations: (1) Academic and intellectual goals are confused, (2) Important teaching style elements (flexibility, warmth, enjoyment, and encouragement) have been  neglected, and (3) The relationships between teachers and clients, particularly parents, have not been stressed. A new definition of the instructional role is needed. Current limited knowledge suggests role models may not be as important as individual teaching styles. (DO)",

By comparing the speech patterns of these children, this study sought to determine whether their language development is limited by their economic status or by their ethnic group status. Twenty randomly selected beginning first graders from each of the three ethnic groups were interviewed and recorded at length as they told stories about pictures they were shown. The recordings were analyzed for both patterns and mazes (hesitations, false starts, etc.) on the basis of a simplified form of the Indiana Conference Scheme of Analysis on the First Level. The  three groups responded approximately the same on total sentence patterns and all specific sentence patterns except one. They also responded approximately the same for total mazes (tangles of language not effective for communication) and all specific mazes. These results imply that low socioeconomic Negro, Spanish-surname, and Anglo children beginning first grade are aware of and use basic English syntax patterns in approximately the same manner. Differentiated materials are not needed in class as much as exposure to total language developing experiences. (MH)",

Part I examines the shaping of a child's abilities and achievement by the norms, roles, and practices of his parents. The influence of parental sex roles on the parent-child relationship is discussed. Part II discusses family influences on achievement. The family structure, now undergoing important changes, affects the educability of the child. In today's smaller family, the child is dependent on the immediate family group rather than a kinship group. Membership in a social class or ethnic group influences values, child-rearing approaches, family organization, and characteristics of the child. Language, social behavior,  and social class are also related. Although most of the young child's experience is within the family, there are important extrafamilial influences, which are discussed in Part III as are studies on mass media dealing with socializing and learning effects. Additional research on the effects of peer groups and school environment is recommended. (DR)",

Goals of CAREL were to develop (1) five components of the arts and humanities: visual arts, dance, literature, music, and theatre for kindergarten through grade 3, (2) a program to prepare classroom teachers to teach the arts and humanities, and (3) a conceptual approach to show the goals and kinds of resources that can meet pupil needs in the arts and humanities. The children were encouraged to explore freely within each art form. Problem formulating and problem solving abilities were developed through teacher and student feedback. Although students were initially inhibited, it  was found that within minutes pupils could be \"turned on\" as they began to improvise and communicate. An attempt to establish behavioral objectives in the initial stages failed, and it was concluded that children's needs must first be determined. A summer workshop prepared teachers, and curriculum development workshops were conducted throughout the year. Appendixes include a summary of field school participants and a proposal for the continuation of the program. However, because of lack of funds, the program was discontinued. (DR)",

Curriculum simply exposes students to appropriate content and subject matter. Educational research should concentrate on the evaluation of curriculum innovation, including recommendations to scrap irrelevant subjects in high school curriculums. The second principle is motivation (whether extrinsic or intrinsic) which is essential for classroom learning even when there is a good curriculum. The third principle of learning is academic ability. Intelligence is not highly changeable but neither is it fixed. The teacher should assume a positive attitude toward learning problems as she  attempts to be effective. Less important than the others is the fourth principle, teaching methods, which only slightly affects subject matter proficiency. Research should be directed toward finding teaching techniques that minimize time and money expenditure, without regard for effectiveness.

The survey provided basic information for (1) evaluating legislative proposals for loan guarantee programs, (2) nationwide planning, and (3) assessing the role and problems of the private sector in providing outdoor recreation. Out of a sample of 2,091 banks, savings and loan associations, and life insurance companies, 72.1 percent (1,509 institutions) responded to the mail questionnaire. The principal finding was a need for improvement in the availability of credit for financing outdoor recreation enterprises. In addition, financial institutions lacked information regarding these  enterprises and their potential as borrowers. (TL)",

Family characteristics and economic status were compared by race (white and Negro) and residence (farm versus nonfarm). Attempts were made to determine retirement expectations of rural families and to predict retirement income. Findings indicate that pre-retirement family incomes and educational attainment have a direct bearing upon economic expectations for retirement. Also, public action is needed to solve some of the human issues in rural retirement including substandard housing and the social problems of isolation. (JH)",

The major findings of the study were that attitudes toward education were significantly related to place of residence, sex, social class, level of education, receivership of mass communication, and spatial mobility. It was concluded that although the sample exhibited some characteristics of a relatively modern society in attitudes toward education, the relationship between attitudes toward education and the other variables supported the classification of the Dominican Republic as a transitional society near the traditional end  of the traditional-modern continuum.

The summary of theories are organized into rural-urban recreation differences based on the influence of (1) size and density of population on man's behavior, and (2) culture on man's actions. The discussion presents the \"opportunity theory\" which implies that availability of opportunities is the important criterion. Cultural differences are discussed in relation to man's perspective towards the natural environment. Inherent life styles and values also explain some differences. However, all of the theories are cast in general, ambiguous terms which are untestable  when conducting a study. Residence on the basis of population density, data on origin of upbringing, controlled variables and population samples, not just samples of recreationists, must be clearly defined when conducting a recreation study.

The uniqueness of the study lies in the utilization of respondents' perceptions of poverty to establish a definition of poverty. The data is based on 1960 census projections of Montgomery County, Indiana, and two additional sets of data gathered through personal interviews. The findings indicate that the low perception of poverty in the county may be accounted for by its dispersion, particularly in the small towns, and by the high incidence of older persons who live alone and may have little visibility. Also, younger heads of poverty families have low levels of education indicating that  poverty is going to continue. Finally, the perception of Montgomery County as an area with little poverty is inaccurate. (DK)",

The Personal Orientation Inventory, F Scale, Semantic Differential, Leary's Interpersonal Checklist, and the Motivation Analysis Test were used to measure internal criteria. Ryan's Rating Scale, the Michigan Picture Test, and the Leary Interpersonal Checklist were used to measure external criteria. A factor analysis was attempted to explain differential changes in behavior over a period of time. It was found that educators exposed to Human Relations Training become less authoritarian and more  self-actualized. They develop better interpersonal relationships in addition to developing greater self-insight and leadership skills.

In recruiting for the project, applicants found in the active files of the Supply Area Texas Employment Commission offices were given first consideration. Applicants were carefully screened to meet eligibility criteria and had to reassess their interest in relocating. Job development was conducted with the realization that there was a large surplus of unemployed manpower in all of the supply areas. Interested companies from different areas  of Texas were listed with pay rate and job types. The major role of the Texas Employment Commission was locating suitable housing for the relocated families. Housing, work, and personal problems caused most of the adjustment problems.

Nine suggestions for action on better housing are offered.

The intellectual processes which education has dealt with for so long is dependent upon the physical processes for their functional adequacy and efficiency. Several areas of health education can be readily adapted to the school situation. Certain health areas are more critical and vital to the well being of society than traditional academic subjects. Effective health education may be a partial solution to some of the problems education faces such as the drouput and developing a student's self-image. (DB)",

This creates a problem for rural areas because, despite the many innovative efforts to entice physicians to establish a rural practice, new physicians are concentrated in the urban areas. However, the problem of inadequate rural health services is not hopeless if the small communities will take advantage of those people in their community who have some background and experience in health services. Such local services, aided by modern technology, can have a very positive effect on the health service problem in rural America. In addition, the passing of recent Federal legislation aimed at area-wide planned  health services can further alleviate this recognized problem. (DB)",

The major purpose of the project was to ease the transition problems for nonresident students and their families caused by the transfer from ungraded and 1-room elementary schools to large city schools. The orientation program, organized into 5 phases, was designed to ease this transition through contacts between the school and the home. Phase 1 identified all students graduating from rural elementary schools. Phase 2 identified students with academic difficulties. Phase 3 consisted of 2 personal contacts between the school and the parents. Phase 4 was a 1-week  orientation program conducted for the students in the school they were to attend. Phase 5 was an evaluation of the entire program by students, parents, teachers, and counselors. During this phase a survey of 221 students and 165 parents indicated almost unanimous support for the program. Parent and student comments about the program, both favorable and unfavorable, were included in the appendices to this report. This project was funded under Title III, Elementary and Secondary Education Act. (Author/TL).",

Section 1 describes the Junior High Development Center, a program designed to help students who had very low basic education skills and showed signs of becoming school dropouts, but had the potential to graduate from high school. Ten students were chosen for the experimental program and 10 students were used as a control group. Students in the experimental program spent half a day in the program and half a day in regular school classes. The experimental group scored significantly higher on a mathematics test and were rated by parents as having significantly improved behavior. There were no  significant differences on class grades, reading test scores, and teacher and counselor evaluation of behavior change. Section 2 of the report describes the Special Program for the Enrichment of Educationally Deprived (SPEED), a related program developed for 7th grade students enrolling 27 students with low basic skills who were potential dropouts, and 11 special education mentally retarded students. The program was characterized by flexible programs, tutoring, small group instruction, and field trips. An evaluation indicated that the majority of students showed a general improvement in grades, school adjustment, and behavior. (Author/TL)",

This intertribal political organization was the major accomplishment of the Iroquois. The League, in turn, made the Iroquois a decisive force in the fur trade and in the conflicts incident to the European colonization of Northeastern North America.

The survey indicated that 62 percent of the farmers interviewed were illiterate, and 16 percent of those who were  literate had never received any formal education. Only 26 percent of the children older than 7 years were attending school, while 54 percent had never enrolled in school and 29 percent had dropped out after enrollment.

Teachers were asked to react to a description of a hypothetical reading problem. Study of interview data showed that reading teachers generally were negative about the degree of concern for reading evidenced by content area teachers and that content area teachers who were successful were concerned about the reading needs of their students and were endeavoring to deal with them. Conclusions from the interview study do not support those of earlier studies. According to interview results there do not seem to be unidentified reading problems in secondary content areas, nor does there seem to be a reaching out of reading teachers to  content area teachers.

Correlational techniques were employed to determine whether, and to what extent, relationships existed between verbal associative learning skill and several measures of oral language. The Cattell Culture Fair Intelligence Test and the Verbal Paired-Associates Test were administered. At both grade levels significant zero order correlations were found between the associative learning measure and the following language measures: mean length of response, mean of the five longest responses, standard deviation of response length, number of different words, and structural complexity  score. Standard deviation of response length, the language measure most highly correlated with associative learning, was also significantly correlated with the IQ measure; however, these two measures correlated significantly when IQ was held constant. It was concluded that there is a relationship between oral language development and verbal associative learning. Tables and references are included. (Author/CM)",

In 1962-63 approximately 550 first-grade children were taught reading in sex-segregated groups. It was found that boys grouped together did not gain significantly more than those in heterogeneous sex groups and that girls' overall achievement was significantly better than boys'. Teachers observed the following eight basic areas of differences in the learning patterns of boys and girls: personality style, activity levels, verbal facility, auditory discrimination, listening skills, attention span, goals and motivations, and interests. In 1963-64 and 1964-65, an experimental reader written to capture boys' interests was compared with the state adopted basal  series as to the effects on boys' reading achievement; significant differences favored the experimental group. During 1965-67 a set of basal readers for grades 1 through 3 containing adventurous stories geared to the interests of boys was developed and tested with significant results. Materials for reading readiness and basal readers for grades 4 through 6 are currently being developed and tested. References are included. (CM)",

The study concluded that the sooner a child learns the letter names the greater his achievement in reading. Letter-name knowledge carries over to the learning of letter sounds, and short vowels in isolation are 1.7 times harder to identify than short vowels in phonograms. Implications of the study are discussed. The learning of letter names is seen as the background for phonics and as an important element in the accurate perception of word structure and the building of a large sight vocabulary.

Therefore, to complement existing clinic facilities, the CHILD Center, Kentfield, California, has included in its regular teaching program a remedial-diagnosis mobile unit. The unit visits elementary schools on a monthly basis, providing teachers with opportunities to become acquainted with diagnostic instruments and to practice using remedial techniques. One teacher and one child, chosen from this teacher's class, work together in the mobile unit on a daily basis. The teacher acts as diagnostician and as remedial teacher; the child, as a \"teacher's teacher.\" At the end of the month  the two are able to continue their working relationship into the classroom.

Eye dominance was determined through hole-in-paper and V-scope; eye control at near and far point, through the telebinocular; hand dominance, through tapping, connecting dots, and a variety of performed acts; reading achievement, through the California Achievement Test; and reading differential, through a formula utilizing IQ's from the California Test of Mental Maturity. While controlling eye and dominant eye were found to be unrelated to each other, no significant difference was observed in reading achievement or reading differential regardless of the dominance  or control characteristics of the subjects. A strong tendency was observed for subjects to exhibit more mixed dominance at eight grade than they had at grade 2. Finally, observing no significant difference in dominance patterns of male as compared with female subjects, the authors concluded that neither dominance nor control was a significant factor in the reading achievement of the subjects studied.

Some of the particular classes considered are theories of measurement in the sense of the Scott-Suppes definition while others are theories of measurement according to a natural generalization of the above definition. Part of the significance of the results is that they are closely related to problems of proving representation theorems in measurement theory. Ideally, one would like to have a finite list of universal axioms which are both necessary and sufficient for guaranteeing the particular representation in which one is interested. The results of this technical report show that in many cases we are forced to settle for  more modest achievements.

Averages are further used to solve a number of important practical problems - to find the work done in stretching a spring, the distance which a body dropped from rest falls in a given time, and the force against a rectangular dam. The volume of solids bounded by two parallel planes is determined by multiplying the distance between the planes by the average cross-sectional area. These volumes can be used to find  the force on a dam of triangular or semicircular shape.

He distinguishes pragmatic validity from deductive or inductive validity, and discusses the requirements for validity of pragmatic inferences (which are accepted or rejected in terms of the performances of their premises and conclusions). The development of reductionist bridges between classical and molecular genetics is discussed, using the genetic role of nucleicacids and the co-linearity of genetic and physical structures as examples. The experimental procedures and results that led to inferences in these areas are described and analyzed in terms of the performances of sets of sentences. It is shown that the validity of  such inferences is dependent on the compatability of conditions of performances of the sentences. The importance of collateral knowledge in selecting compatable conditions of performance is illustrated. (EB)",

The model postulates four stages in the processing of an external stimulus: encoding (stage 1), central processing (stage 2), response selection, e.e. decoding (stage 3), and response execution (stage 4). The total reaction time can be decomposed into two or more components which reflect the operation of these stages. It is argued that RT=A+B(Hc) where RT is total reaction time, A is the time taken for stages 1 and 3, B is the rate of central processing and Hc is an expression of the uncertainty associated with stage 2. Experiments based on this model investigated high speed scanning of random figures in human memory, retrieval time as a function of memory ensemble size, information  processing as a function of speed versus accuracy, and memory retrieval and central comparison times in information processing. The results were consistent with the model, and it proved possible to quantify the rates of steps involved in the stages. (EB)",

The rationale is the idea that professional performance can be described in terms of control over certain areas of reality that are essential to developing creative roles, rather than the ability to fill already defined teacher roles. The program is operated as a democracy with small self-regulated units of students (inquiry groups) monitoring their own progress and administering the program to themselves with the assistance of faculty counselors whose role is based on a \"differential training model\" for  individualizing instruction. A \"contact\" laboratory is organized to provide teacher-candidates with opportunities for study, microteaching, and experimentation rather than to socialize them to the school as it presently exists. Program components are based on four future-oriented roles, each involving constant experimentation: (1) institution builder (shaper of the school), (2) innovator (rather than bureaucratic functionary), (3) scholar (academic specialist also involved in the study of teaching and of children), (4) interactive teacher (instructional decision-maker; master of teaching strategies; flexible, sensitive developer of classroom social systems).

It is based on specifications of instructional and program goals in terms of behaviors to be exhibited by the trainee in three broad conceptual areas which imply a hierarchy of teaching competencies: mastery of content knowledge produces subject matter competency; mastery of content knowledge plus behavioral skills produce presentation competency; mastery of both plus humanistic or personological skills produce professional decisionmaking competency. Appropriate instructional modes (e.g., programed and computer-assisted instruction, video tape models, microteaching, classroom simulation materials) have been developed to assist each trainee to achieve the competencies individually.  Performance criteria reflect the differentiated roles candidates will assume in a professional staff, and training for flexibility will make teachers change agents for schools. Implications of these trends for school principals: (1) Inservice training should become an extension of competencies. (2) Refined performance criteria can allow selection and promotion processes to be more objective, and supervision truly diagnostic. (3) The principal's role will shift from disciplinarian and evaluator to organizer, director, and facilitator--creator of a flexible setting to nurture teacher innovation. (JS)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to compare the attitudes of teachers toward the professionalization of teaching with the attitudes of state and local educational association leadership personnel. A questionnaire based on resolutions acted upon by the New York State Teachers Association House of Delegates examined opinions of both groups on programs designed to foster professional advancement, to promote association gains, and to improve working rights and privileges. Of the 809 questionnaires distributed (674 to a proportionate sample of teachers from 45 selected school districts representative of elementary and secondary; rural, urban, and suburban; large and small schools), 529 were returned, representing all segments of the sample. Results indicate that the views of association leaders  and classroom teachers differ significantly: In general, teachers tend not to accept responsibilities necessary for professional status, while association leaders are knowledgeable about professional matters and willing to work toward attainment of professional goals. Suggestions for programs to advance professional status: (1) Local associations, with state and national cooperation, might place greater emphasis on conveying to their members a better understanding of professional ethics, responsibilities, and knowledge of the characteristics of a profession. (2) Teacher preparation institutions could include the foregoing in their programs. (JS)",

Of the 50 percent sent overseas to teach, more than two thirds are young liberal arts graduates lacking orthodox teaching credentials, but by 1965 many states began recruiting them, often giving salary credit for the two years abroad and granting at least temporary teaching certificates. Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C., initiated special programs of teaching and continuing education which included intensive orientation courses, supportive counseling from experienced teachers, and frequent meetings with consultants and subject matter specialists. Returned volunteers find the jobs rough, tough, and  frustrating, in some ways more so than their overseas service. Many undergo cultural shock similar to that experienced overseas; some lack professional distance in dealing with students, or expect more of themselves than they can produce. But because improvisation is part of the Peace Corps way of life, they are constantly trying out new ideas to handle their classes. The perception that they bring to their teaching can be a positive influence in designing the tactics needed to cope with the disadvantaged, and if they can see their way through the first difficult months of adjustment, they promise to make an invaluable contribution to this important problem.

A secondary purpose was to test the statement made by Cherryholmes (1966) and others that simulation cannot change attitudes. A pretest-posttest design, applied to 30 students randomly selected from a secondary methods course and randomly assigned to provide equal size experimental and control groups, led to several conclusions regarding the effectiveness of this type of simulation experience. The simulation experience did not lower the general  anxiety level of student teachers (as measured by the IPAT Anxiety Scale). It did not lower the concern of the subjects for classroom discipline (Triplett instrument), nor increase their self-concept (researcher-designed instrument), nor increase the success rating assigned to student teachers by their student-teaching coordinators. Although student talk, as measured by Flanders' interaction system, did increase in classrooms of student teachers who had the simulation experience, student-initiated talk did not increase. Thus, the one positive finding is suspect since no other directional hypotheses were supported. (Author/JS)",

Ossorio) with no attempt to reduce the complexity of teacher-pupil interaction in order to use a less complex system. Rating scales were developed on which observers ranked the correspondence between (1) observed teacher and class behavior and (2) statements of teacher policy and class reaction. Each of four raters observed four of 16 teachers in their best and worst classes (as identified by the teachers); each also provided measurements  of the classroom control achievements (CC) of the teachers not assigned to him. A median split of the teachers in terms of CC formed a high and low grouping for testing hypotheses about the relationship between policy descriptions and CC. Results support continued development of rule-following description: it was applied by observers in a limited amount of time and did permit a discrimination between teachers who vary in classroom control achievements.

The curriculum allowed each student to choose from alternative activities (such as lectures, special projects, or independent study) which are repeated so that each student can review or participate in each activity. As a result of this program, student achievement, initiative, and responsibility have increased greatly. (SP)",

Based on classroom observations, interviews with instructors and students, and the guidelines laid down by Pearl and Riessman in New Careers for the Poor, the evaluation examines the effectiveness of teaching methods and curriculum in achieving the goals of the New Careers project and offers recommendations for improvement. The underlying emphasis of the recommendations is on the need for a reality-oriented approach--one which operates according to limited and achievable goals rather than impossible dreams; which recognizes the job of teacher aide as a worthy end in itself rather than  as a step to further advancement; which gives top priority to practical job-related instruction rather than remedial and/or general education courses; which incorporates the standards and structure of the &quot;outside world&quot; rather than making &quot;special provisions&quot;; which recognizes the particular nature and needs of the type of student involved in the program and recruits and remunerates accordingly; and one which encourages openness and confrontation rather than evasion (particularly in matters involving &quot;the middle-class guilt complex&quot; of the instructors and the &quot;resistance-to-change complex&quot; of the students).

A presentation-practice-feedback instructional paradigm was used within a microteaching format: (1) 10-minute pretest teaching session, (2) viewing of videotaped models displaying the criterion behavior, (3) practice in matching the model behaviors in a videotape microteaching session, (4) viewing the playback, (5) posttest teaching session. The 40 preservice elementary teachers  were randomly assigned to four experimental conditions in a 2 x 2 fixed-effects design: (a) no cues in either modeling or feedback conditions, (b) cues only in feedback conditions, (c) cues only in model treatments, (d) cues in both training conditions. Transcripts of the teaching session were rated independently, using an eight-category system developed to rate the dependent variable questions. Analysis of variance produced findings supporting part of the hypotheses: it was concluded that in the acquisition of a complex teaching skill, observational learning with cueing is more effective than feedback, with or without cueing, in producing desired behavior change.

The 141 IPI students studied had been exposed for two years to the program which involved 600 students in two schools; they were compared with 198 non-IPI students from control schools matched on geographic and socioeconomic factors. Achievement tests administered to each were the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, a part-Iowa Test, a free writing sample, an IPI language test, and an IPI math test. The data analysis on 53 variables (using factorial analysis of variance and the Scheffe formula of difference between means) divided students into grades, sex, schools, and IQ levels. No significant differences between groups was  established, indicating that IPI and non-IPI students achieve equally well in the areas tested. Nonsignificant trends suggest, however, that (1) IPI as a method has been most effective in the language area; (2) in mathematics, IPI students do not achieve as well as non-IPI students; (3) fifth-grade girls in the upper intelligence levels tend to achieve better in non-IPI settings than their IPI counterparts; and (4) success of an IPI program depends on content, method of administration, student characteristics, and teacher role.

Part 2, the research review, reports three types of studies: (1) survey-questionnaire studies which report the perceptions of educators in communities which have adopted the nongraded plan, (2) studies related to grouping practice which have a bearing on nongraded organizations, and (3) studies which compare nongraded organization  with the traditional self-contained classroom. This section concludes with a critique of the research, noting conflicting findings and problems which make it difficult to generalize results to other situations. Part 3, \"An Approach,\" contains a position statement and a list of steps for implementing an organizational plan with suggestions regarding organization, grouping of pupils, curriculum revision, equipment and materials, scheduling, evaluation, the library (laboratory for learning) and reporting to parents.

Objectives were to provide research understanding, transfer of that understanding to an ongoing project, and development of ability to communicate research results. Individual and group instruction was given in research methods and evaluation, project planning and organization, and proposal writing. Two separate 4-week programs were conducted June 13 through August 5, 1966. To test the hypothesis that the amount of structure given to the program would influence the amount of learning and attitudes toward research, the first group was given a structured project-research-fundamentals-oriented program and the second an unstructured  project-oriented program. A follow-up conference was held in January, 1967. When semantic differential measures of both groups were combined, favorable attitudes toward all research concept areas were indicated; achievement posttests showed acceptable progress in learning research methods and facts for both groups. The unstructured learning organization seemed superior (though not significantly so), influencing favorable attitudes toward more research concepts, better achievement performance, and greater satisfaction with workshop organization, visiting lecturers, and facilities.

Guest lecturers presented papers on several themes: Perspectives in Program Development in Distributive Education; Nature and Theory of the Project Method; Managing and Controlling Learning Experiences in the Classroom; Teacher Behavior in the Project Classroom; and  Gearing Up Teacher Education Programs for Project Instruction. Small Task force groups of participants discussed the concepts and produced reports on implications for two areas of need: school and classroom, and teacher education. The papers and task force reports are contained in three seminar publications: one is a series of readings on the project plan in distributive education; the others are guidelines for implementing the plan in schools and through teacher education.

The basic objective was to enhance the development of acceptance of self, acceptance of others, and acceptance by others in both the trainees and the children. It was theorized that human relations instruction plus counseling would result in greater attitudinal change than would result from instruction only, or no instruction. There were four treatment conditions: (1) previous human relations training, (2) lecture and small group discussion in each of 10 areas of human relations principles, (3) individual and group counseling, (4) development of a relationship with a child randomly matched with the trainee.  Four instruments were administered to trainees and four to students to measure self-concept, interpersonal values, attitudes, and personality. Although the analysis of posttest data did not produce statistically significant results, the study demonstrated that positive attitudinal and behavioral change can be transmitted from instructor to student to child through the approach utilized.

The structural-grammar textbooks of the forties and fifties were inadequate, and the grammars of the sixties, although improved by the influence of Chomsky and his colleagues, are still not as good as they should be. Also of questionable value are the efforts of conferences, curriculum centers, and summer institutes sponsored by the \"Establishment.\" To improve conditions, frank but constructive opposition to current establishment-produced materials and procedures must be made by our best scholars, linguists, and teachers, for teachers themselves must ultimately determine what they are to teach. Simple obstructionism, however, is not the answer. The current emphasis on the  importance of language studies requires that teachers decide either to teach the English language and educate themselves for the task or to relinquish the task to someone else. Goals that can be obtained despite the present dearth of adequate language-teaching materials should be made. Among the topics that can be taught well, now, are a scholarly and intelligent traditional grammar, lexicography, history of the language, and dialectology. (JM)",

The  results of the study indicated (1) that good spellers performed better than poor spellers on the word-choice discrimination test except on problems of extreme difficulty, when performance of both dropped to chance levels, (2) that the relationship between spelling achievement and verbal intelligence was only moderate, and (3) that spelling achievement reflected, in part, increased knowledge of the probability texture of English.

        "description":"Because of their interest in naturalism and socialism, critics often overlook the major intellectual conflict in Jack London's work: the paradox of individualism. London regards society as affecting the individual in two ways: it either promotes individuality or it demands a conformity that undermines individualism. When society fails Buck in &quot;The Call of the Wild,&quot; he is driven to self-reliance and forced to become an individual, whereas White Fang is punished for exercising his individuality. In &quot;The Sea Wolf,&quot; London develops these two extremes of social influence in the socially-isolated Larson and the socially-conforming Van Weyden. London favors Van Weyden, who ultimately realizes his identity as an individual and applies his abilities to improve society while Larson  remains aloof and ineffectual throughout the story. London criticizes the destructive nature of this dualistic society in &quot;Martin Eden&quot; and shows Martin's frustration at a society that glorifies great individuals of history and literature but simultaneously ostracizes living nonconformists. Martin's suicide symbolizes London's paradoxical and inconclusive appraisal of the individual in and against society. (MP)",

A questionnaire survey listing pedagogical applications of ideas in the articles was administered both before and after the readings were completed. The data indicated a positive change in attitude for 12 of the 40 statements on the questionnaire. The teachers planned 1,295 changes in teaching performance as a result of the readings. Concerning 84  statements of possible pedagogical changes suggested by the articles, each teacher claimed a mean of 13 changes in his teaching due to the articles, and a total of 13 planned changes for the future were listed. These results indicated that professional readings can change teacher attitude and performance, and that a broad program of readings is an effective method in updating English teachers.

In past attempts to achieve universal literacy, language reformers have proposed a revised alphabet of one grapheme for each phoneme, a change which anti-reformers have insisted would be costly. Modern linguists, on the other hand, have suggested that the key to spelling consists in understanding the system that determines the orthographic sound-symbol relationship. The computer in the Stanford study classified and sorted 17,310 commonly used words according to a set of rules devised by the researchers for defining the American English language. The results indicated that over 49% of the words could be spelled correctly using phonological clues  and that another 36% could be spelled with only one error. Utilizing the findings of the Stanford study, educators can develop a new sequential, structured spelling curriculum that will help students understand the basic relationship between sounds and orthographic symbols in English.

        "description":"Traditions and emerging trends in the teaching of linguistics and composition are examined in this collection of papers. Joseph Mersand predicts a future emphasis on the subject of English as a discipline, leading to a more adequate preparation and increased supervision of English teachers and a greater stress in the classroom on written composition, the study of language development, sophisticated uses of instructional materials, and individualized instruction. Robert Donaldson charges that, despite a revolution in the field, few English teachers have incorporated linguistic insights into their classroom practices. Harold King surveys the growth of scientific investigations into language structure, and Marvin Greene articulates the role of linguistics in the teaching of English.  Joe Darwin Palmer elaborates on Noam Chomsky's theory that transformational grammar can provide sets of rules to generate all the correct sentences in the English language, and Samuel Stone suggests some classroom applications of generative grammar. Floyd Bergman describes an individualized, sequential program to eliminate some of the problems in teaching composition, and Henry Maloney indicates methods of improving the content of junior high school compositions.

The definition of standard usage, given in 1932, as that language used by well-educated persons remains valid and depends more and more on professional writers for guidance. The far-reaching liberalization of both written and spoken language since the Second Edition of \"Webster's New International\" is reflected in the usage of professional writers. Consequently, the label \"colloquial\" has become unnecessary as a dictionary classification, especially since sharp distinctions between formal and informal language usage are not always clear. Examples of specific word changes connected with the Third Edition are  the spelling of \"all right\" and \"callus\" and the inclusion of \"gimmick,\"\"corny,\" and \"spendiferous\" as acceptable rather than slang.

In such a curriculum, the teacher has a wide choice of procedures and materials, the student sees language applied in realistic situations, and the individual skills and concepts reinforce each other. Since no one book presents such a completely fused curriculum, the teacher must plan his own program to meet the students' needs, correlating teaching activities with the focus and goals of the unit and with the literary works available. If the school is not departmentalized, integrated curriculums can also be set up between teachers of English and teachers of science, history, health, and home economics. In core curriculums, where one teacher is  responsible for language arts and social studies, American history or civics can be integrated with the English curriculum.

For one semester, four classes of remedial writing at Jefferson College in Missouri served as experimental groups in which ideas and sound were stressed while grammar and concepts of correctness were eliminated. Three classes served as control groups in which traditional teaching methods were used. Experimental classroom sessions were divided into two parts: a thought stimulation period, exposing students to such motivational aids as films, slides, prints, cartoons, or recordings; and a writing session, occasionally preceded by a discussion period. Pre- and post-test composition samples  of the experimental and control groups plus the results of the Cooperative English Test provided evaluation data. Results indicated that students taught by the experimental method learned to write as well as those taught by the traditional grammar method.

Most of the data was gathered in early 1968 by questionnaires sent to 548 public and 68 non-public schools listed in the state directories of Maine, Virginia, Ohio, Missouri, Texas, and California. The five areas studied were the newspaper's financial status, expenditures, circulation, advertising, and subsidies and other sources of revenue. Some conclusions made from the study were that (1) many high schools have not solved the problem of financing their newspapers through student support, subsidies, or advertising, (2) business  management is frequently casual because few advisors have specific preparation in business procedures and the staff is more interested in editorial activities, and (3) schools which offer journalism courses and schools whose newspaper advisors have a minor in college journalism are more successful in business operations than those lacking such advantages.

Although the narrator has begun to realize his own lack of identity through his activities with the Brotherhood in Harlem, it is in the cellar with 1,369 light bulbs that he acknowledges his invisibility. He is thus freed from the necessity of running in order to pursue identity, and can now help others fight for the  principle of individuality.

He follows a code of honesty and hates &quot;phonies.&quot; He is aware of class distinctions and sees the world as a confrontation between the &quot;In-laws&quot; and the &quot;Out-laws&quot;; he recognizes himself as one of the Out-laws but is not dismayed or less alienated by the situation. Like the anti-hero, he is lonely, but the main distinction between Smith and the anti-hero is that, while the anti-hero abstains from contact with society, Sillitoe's hero deliberately becomes involved in fighting society, thus alienating himself. For example, he trains for  the race and then deliberately loses it. Smith's &quot;proud, stubborn, and independent spirit is the source of his loneliness, and the source of his heroism.&quot; (LH)",

Curricular theories are discussed and positive and negative attempts to define literature are made. A case is made for basing the curriculum on criticism. Part 2 advances four postulates--the communication of knowledge about literature, a theory of relations between criticism and literature, acceptance of the literary work as the isolated atom to receive critical attention, and curriculum order derived from a theory of the learning process. Considerable attention is devoted to an outline of a four-year program based on  these postulates. The program sequence is formalist (freshman year), synoptic (sophomore), analogical and generic (junior), and synthesizing (senior). (AF)",

The variable of social class was included in the second study. The measures used were derived from the self-social symbols method in which subjects either draw or paste on a sheet of paper a symbol to represent the self. Negro children were found to have lower self esteem in both samples. On the measure of social interest, the Headstart Negro youngsters more often placed themselves outside the group, while in the first grade group a race by  class interaction was found. The Headstart Negro group identified more with mother and teacher, while in the first grade group, the differences were related to class, not race. Social class seems to be salient as a determinant of self esteem, social interest, and patterns of identification in young children of both races. (NH)",

While there has been a considerable communication flow between Israel and the United States on approaches to and  studies of education for disadvantaged groups, the similarities and parallels between England and the United States warrant establishment of more systematic and comprehensive channels for a regular flow of information.

The beginning speech course is required of all these students in the Experiment in Higher Education at Southern Illinois University. Experimental and control groups (E- and C-groups) were set up after the fourth week of the course. The experimental variable was the use of the video trainer equipment (camera, monitor, and tape recorder) as an adjunct to the instructor's oral critique and written evaluations of student assignments. Findings are reported in two parts. Part I, the results and conclusions of comparisons of E- and C-group scores on tests, critics' evaluations, and self  evaluations, notes no differences between the two groups. In fact, the video playbacks may have had a detrimental effect on the E-group. Part II, findings based on semantic differential scales, reports that the self-safety factor and total-self measures were the only significant differences. (NH)",

Moreover, successful science experiences might stimulate in these students a desire to read in order to continue their progress. The science activities involved concepts essential to an understanding of electricity and magnetism, and mechanics and light. The experiments were stimulated by such phrases as \"to see the light,\"\"that rings a bell,\" and \"to blow your own horn.\" The group responded favorably and showed capacity for abstract reasoning.

Rigorous evaluation of the program in terms of employment following high school and academic achievement was thus impossible. However, tentative experimental-control comparisons on post-high school employment, and on academic achievement using the Metropolitan Achievement  Test, reveal that the experimental groups were always equal, and sometimes superior, to the control groups. A highly favorable result following the second year was that a large number of students in the initial experimental groups stayed in school in spite of urban renewal problems. See ED 019 704 for &quot;Guidance Units&quot; used in the project. [Urban renewal maps, pages B1 and B2, are not included with the document because of their marginal reproducibility.] (EM)",

Major problems inhibiting the development of such manpower programs were fragmentation of social welfare program and lack of total community concern and involvement. These problems were considered to be the result, not of indifference, but of the inability to define action roles or to construct a vehicle through which effective action might be carried out. Over a period of 1 year, local leaders representing major components of the community developed the following essential elements of a coordinated community manpower program. First, the program must be fully understood and supported by  local leaders. Second, the full-time staff person is necessary to provide continuity and incentive. Finally, local leaders, themselves must determine problems, analyze resources, delineate program and service gaps, define possible courses of action, and identify program responsibility.

Because funding was available for only 1 year, the research objectives could be realized only in part. Some results were: (1) elicitation of responses related generally to success or failure,  and (2) variation among schools in the magnitude of relationships. Exploration of the psycho-social climate of nursing schools and the use of NSC scores in concert with a qualitative analysis of individual responses as bases for remediation of students' problems were recommended. The NSC, NAI, and EI are discussed in detail. A special study involving Purdue's five associate degree programs is presented. Phase I and II are available as VT 009 168. (JK)",

Fourteen individuals representing the task oriented and relationship-oriented leadership styles and two levels of sociometric status were randomly designated as leaders for small groups. The groups worked on five structured and five unstructured nursing problems in 10 fifty-minute sessions. The hypothesis that leaders of different styles use different kinds of verbal statements in communicating with their group members was not confirmed. Rather, a difference in the amount of verbal involvement was suggested. Task-oriented leaders talked significantly more to their group members. Superior performance of the groups led by relationship-oriented leaders on  both types of problems did not support the hypothesis that relationship-oriented leaders perform more effectively on unstructured problems. It was suggested that future research include measures to test the interpretation that the overall nursing philosophy outweighs the type of task. All instruments are presented in the appendixes.

Marital status, education, and age have all been shown to affect participation rates. On an impressionistic basis, marital status has been shown to have a greater effect than education, which in turn has a greater impact than age. Although age is of least importance, there is evidence of a pattern in its effect. Within &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; education groups of single females, age is roughly related in an inverse manner to participation. The pattern for married women is more complex. Within each of the educational groups, the top three rates relate to  those aged 40 to 44, 45 to 49, and 50 to 54--ages at which labor force re-entry occurs, after the prime child-bearing-and-care years.

Cross validation of the LHSC in two schools of nursing revealed significant differences between achievers and failures but not between achievers and underachievers. Phase II was largely a replication of Phase I but three schools of nursing were used. In two schools, significant relationships were noted between achievement and NES-LHSC Total as well as five attitudinal areas. In a third school, achievement was  related significantly to NES-LHSC Total and one attitudinal area.

        "description":"Operation Retrieval is a research project designed by the Department of Labor to review and assess the experiences of 55 experimental and demonstration projects for disadvantaged youth conducted during the period 1963-65, and to assess the impact of strategies in job placement, job creation, and job development. Job placement and development units are discussed in terms of their relationship to other project components, the structure of the staff, and the location of the job placement unit. Methods used to obtain jobs for disadvantaged youth include: (1) applying traditional techniques, (2) developing new jobs, (3) working with employers to modify job requirements, and (4) developing youth potential to meet employer standards. Five types of problems and possible approaches to job  placement are: educational deficiencies, arrest records, and physical, emotional, and resource problems. Follow-up is discussed in connection with supportive services and employment experiences. Recommendations relate to retrieval and use of information, research, inter-agency relations, and follow-up activities. (JK)",
