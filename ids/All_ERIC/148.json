        "author":["Fullman, Christopher E."],
        "description":"As a recent curriculum innovation replacing Freshman English, the Freshman Investigative Seminar consists of 12 or 13 students meeting for one semester of five weekly class hours, directed by faculty from different disciplines. Its objectives are to lead the student to learn how to gather information from various sources, how to keep accurate records of research and reading, and how to write a clear report on a specific topic chosen from research findings. This course first developed from dissatisfaction with the traditional Freshman English course and focused on the subject of the American Indian. Following this general theme throughout the course, students ultimately gained greater appreciation of and insight into both the complex culture of the American Indian and the moral  issues involved in confrontations between Indians and the white society.

        "description":"This paper discusses the rationale and teaching methods for a six-week unit, for a high school freshman English Class, on perception, semantics, and writing, which places special focus on developing tension in student writing. The first four objectives of the course focus on perception and the next two focus on semantics. The seventh objective--developing a point of view in an extended definition--is the first writing assignment. The eight objective concerns the revision of the definition paper; the ninth objective asks the student to write a personal narrative that shifts in point in view and evokes within the reader a sense of tension, and the tenth objective requires the student to pass a proficiency test on punctuation. The major portion of the paper discusses the personal  narrative assignment, includes a description of preliminary teaching activities designed to motivate the students for writing, and discusses the results of the assignment. A number of the student narratives and a bibliography are included. (DI)",

Two pantomimes are suggested to demonstrate the division of the brain: in the first, one figure represents the right half of the brain (Goldmund), and the other figure represents the left half (Narziss); the second mime is designed to represent three different kinds of self-concepts, each one representing a different adaptation of the two kinds originally portrayed in the first pantomime of Goldmund and Narziss.

Eight women were assigned to dyads: two acquaintance dyads (subjects were acquainted through a small class in communication and had known each other for two months), and two friendship dyads (subjects had been friends for about a year, and had participated in one session of a sensitivity group together). The four dyads engaged in free, unstructured discussion for 30 minutes on four separate days. They were instructed to talk about themselves, so they might know more about each other. A unit was defined as the introduction of a new topic or an interruption by another participants. Possible units consisted of the following: question about the  other; reinforcement of the other; religion; marriage and children; dating, sex, love; parental family; physical condition and appearance; money and property; politics and social issues; general emotions; interests, hobbies, and habits; relations with others; personal values; school and work; and demographic and biographical characteristics. The results indicate that self-disclosure can be studied in ongoing communication through interaction analysis. (WR)",

The subjects were 309 college students enrolled in a basic speech communication course. Ten of the classes were taught by male instructors, ten by female instructors. The subjects were administered a revised version of the Personal Report of Confidence as a Speaker. The results indicated that students did not have a general preference for criticism of delivery or content. They  apparently felt that both types of criticism were equally important. Also, student preferences indicated that instructors should include both positive and negative comments in their criticism. (WR)",

Three social issues (gun control, student busing, and air pollution) and three economic issues (unemployment, government loans to big business, and wage and price control) were chosen. A  total of 45 college freshmen responded to the social issues, and 45 freshmen responded to the economic issues. After the subjects responded to all of the issues, their responses were collected and the subjects were given a list of cues and were asked to rate each cue in terms of its importance in generating responses. The results indicated that cues tend to be topic bound and that there is a correlation between perception of cue importance and actual use of cue in generating responses. (WR)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to measure possible differences in comprehension, retention, and attitude change resulting from presentation of three versions of an oral persuasive message which varied in organizational structure to subjects differing in organizational ability as determined by the Goyer Organization of Ideas Test and an intelligence test. Variety in organization was achieved by preparing an adequately structured message, then rearranging its units into a random and a reversed version. Subjects were 246 college students enrolled in an introductory course on speech communication. Tests of attitude change and comprehension were developed and administered to all subjects. Three intact classes (one for each message treatment) of 49 students completed the same  comprehension test three weeks later as a retention test. The results show that an organized message promoted greater comprehension of the material than a randomly assigned one. No significant differences in attitude change or in retention were found among the three groups although a high positive correlation between comprehension and retention was indicated. The study fails to support the assumption that a well-organized speech is more persuasive than a poorly organized one. (TO)",

Results of one study revealed a definite relationship between a child's self-esteem and his \"modeling,\" or imitative behavior, after observing a televised film. A self-esteem inventory was administered to elementary school students, and those who scored in the first and fourth quartiles were selected for observation. Half of the group viewed a special film that depicted both prosocial and antisocial actions and then were allowed, individually, to play with toys in a room similar to the one shown in the film. The others played with the toys in the same room but had not first seen the film. Results indicated that a low self-esteem child  imitated more and to a greater extent the prosocial than the antisocial behaviors viewed on television compared to high self-esteem children. High self-esteem males imitated antisocial behaviors to a significantly greater extent than all females or low self-esteem males. Sex and self-esteem, together with the behaviors viewed in the television film, were reliable predictors of antisocial or prosocial behaviors. (RN)",

The study of ritualistic behavior is a study of competence in its most basic form. Turn-taking in conversations--an example of ritualistic behavior--not only helps us apportion the floor, but also serves a symbolic function of helping the interactants to define their relationship. The way in which this ritual is managed by one interactant will affect the judgments made about him by the other interactant. Thus, research may show that it is the management of the small, unnoticed, ritualistic behaviors that has the greatest effect upon us all; it may be these behaviors that determine whether or not we are successful interactants.

Student volunteers were allotted pegs and instructed to build bridges on a peg board. The subjects worked in groups of four. However, one member of the group was a confederate of the experimenter and was assigned the supervisory position for each group. The subjects were allowed to work the problem of building bridges for about two minutes before they were asked to stop. They were then allotted more pegs and asked to continue building. This  peocedure was repeated three times. Following the third time, each group member was given an opportunity to express himself about the allocation method used. To control this communication each subject was given a listing of six influence statements. The Trust Test was also administered.

Pacification is based primarily on &quot;grandiosity,&quot; the exaggeration of a problem to make it too big to be solved by the group. Techniques of pacification include use of abstract language, generalizations, stereotyped language, cliches, or proverbs. Situations are pacified when individuals use questions to make assertions, respond to a question or statement other than the one  posed, or define the source of a problem to be outside the subject or situation. Through the use of pacification techniques, an individual can interfere with social interaction and interpersonal communication and thus block the functioning of problem-solving processes. (RN)",

Premiered in January 1926 and directed by the expressionist classics interpreter, Leopold Jessner, the play reflected Bronnen's personal solution to both his own conflicts and the tense national situation by dramatizing the eternal dialogue which modern man conducts with the past. The fate of Alexander the Great merges with that of a contemporary Alexander as he embarks upon an ultimately self-destructive path of conquest to the East. Both the nature of the monologue--repeated response to unseen characters--and the chiarosco  technique aided actor Fritz Kortner's dramatic interpretation. Reaction of both drama critics and audience was typically violent for a Bronnen premiere, although applause remained dominant. (Footnotes are included.) (JM)",

        "description":"Since the norm-referenced grading system produces a student-teacher conflict situation, a climate and grading system conducive to supportive interaction seems desirable, especially in an interpersonal communication course. This can be accomplished through contract grading, in which the instructor defines the contract components and the student agrees to achieve a particular grade level. Components should include course objectives, learning methods and tasks, student responsibilities, methods both for demonstrating content learned and for evaluating the mutually developed contract, the time limit, and the quality of work expected for different grade levels. Goals of the interpersonal communication course--greater student acceptance of responsibility for his communication and  increased student awareness of others' communication attempts--lend themselves to contract grading with various behavioral objectives on a variety of cognitive levels. Teachers can thus create a threat-free, non-defense arousing environment with a higher degree of motivation for learning. (JM)",

        "description":"A comparative approach to the study of communication can be seen as extremely valuable for a thorough understanding of human communication. In its broadest sense, communication is a biological phenomenon, defined as the interchange of information between an organism and its environment. Communication systems of living organisms differ qualitatively and in relation to their fundamental differences and environments. Moreover, they cannot be ranked on a superiority scale. Both cultural and noncultural factors may influence communication abilities and behavior. Although the formal rationalist method of investigation presented by Chomsky and Miller poses some problems, it can be applied in studying animal communication systems and does allow for the exploration of numerous  possibilities. This procedure, followed in working with the common loon, has proved highly productive and has provided material for further study. (JM)",

A part of the problem is to determine which courses should continue to be offered and to better fit student interests to the course available. One solution to this problem, is the offering of \"preview courses.\" A preview course, as practiced at Illinois State University and elsewhere, is a condensed, short course or series of class meetings during which the instructor presents the syllabus, textbooks, and approach to the subject matter. Students attending such sessions could sample the dimensions of existing courses before enrolling and thus would be more likely to be satisfied with the courses chosen. A college \"preview course\"  program is a tangible demonstration of interest in students by college academic departments. (CH)",

        "description":"Black theatre has come a long way from the major stereotypes of black people established by white playwrights, but it is still trying to convey the fact that blacks remain in a kind of prison. The slow pace of black theatre in becoming art is obviously due to the long degradation of blacks, the tolerated injustice of whites, and the belated granting of dignity to black family life. From the paternalistic attitude toward blacks in \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" revealing the evil of an unjust social system, through plays by Langston Hughes, Louis Peterson, and others, to the fresh, angry viewpoint of \"A Raisin in the Sun,\" black theatre finally progressed to portray family unity and the importance of self-respect. In two recent films, \"Lady Sings the Blues\" and \"Sounder,\" the ugly image of  the maligned, distorted, sexless black woman was overcome. However, colleges and universities bear a great responsibility for training and educating black theatre workers in all roles with a goal of a human dignity of universal quality. (JM)",

A description of the special case of the District of Columbia follows a brief summary of important findings on intradistrict disparities from research of the last 15 years. The court-mandated adaptation of Washington to the issue of intradistrict equity is compared to the means of resolving this dilemma adopted by comparability provisions of Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). The author's conclusion that intradistrict equity, by prevailing definitions, has largely been achieved, rests not only on the  findings in the report, but on other factors pushing for intradistrict equity, such as collective bargaining agreements, decentralization, and recent cutbacks which have urged many urban districts to reassess their means of allocating shrinking resources.

It has proceeded along separate fronts--administrative decentralization, district and school advisory councils, and a special experimental district. This paper describes the extent to which these developments have progressed. It also seeks to explain why only modest steps have been taken and describes the obstacles that decentralization faces in the Chicago political system. In seeking to explain these obstacles, primary consideration is given to the role of ideology in explaining the behavior of school administrators. The author focuses on that aspect of ideology which describes the proper processes by which an individual believes that government is supposed to operate, the  way social change ought to occur, and the strategies and tactics appropriate to a government official.

It then considers the fiscal issue of the consequences of resource redistribution from the use of performance criteria. The report's overall conclusion is that serious but not insurmountable political, technical, and cost problems would exist in the creation of the required data base. However, should these problems be solved, the report argues that a potentially appealing combination of imcome and  performance criteria could be created at a 25 percent increase in program cost. Additionally, it reports that by allowing a choice between income/AFDC and performance criteria, the program could be designed to prevent any district from losing monies while at the same time aiding those nonpoverty students who are educationally disadvantaged.

Carol Sigelman stresses the following four concepts: follow-along (the monitoring of the developmentally disabled person in the community), advocacy, protection, and shelter, Alternatives for the provision of protective legal services for the developmentally disabled are considered by Gerald Bensberg. The present status and implementation of concepts of citizen advocacy in Nebraska are reviewed by Helen Zauha. Marie Moore describes a United Cerebral Palsy Association demonstration project of three models of advocacy programs which take into account demographic variables, differences in service availability and delivery,  and differences in organization patterns. Parameters, definitions, and alternatives for protective services in Ohio are examined by Elsie Helsel. Phyllis Emory and William Parks also review aspects of protective service and public guardianship in Ohio. A critique of protective services in general and the Ohio protective services system in particular which centers on the need to protect the civil and human rights of the developmentally disabled is offered by Michael Kindred. Appended is the text of the Ohio Protective Service Law. (DB)",

        "description":"Discussed is the history, organization, and value of team teaching with retarded children; and provided is a program description of team teaching during 1969 at one center which involved 22 children from 6 to 12 years of age. Team teaching is seen to provide for varying student needs by teachers of varying abilities. Definitions of team teaching and related terms such as multiage grouping are given. Economic advantages are said to have been an early impetus to team teaching efforts with the inauguratory program occurring in 1957 at a Massachusetts school. Team organization is considered in terms of the value of both flexibility and structure, the need for initial planning sessions, the need for suitable facilities and equipment, and the involvement of ancillary staff and  consultants. Advantages of team teaching with retarded children are thought to include individualized instruction and flexible grouping. Two case studies are given to illustrate the positive effects of team teaching on a 13-year-old girl and a 10-year-old boy, both severely retarded and withdrawn. Reported are results of the program evaluation at Nobel Center in Indiana which included completely meeting objectives such as forming smaller groupings for more effective teaching and not meeting objectives such as maintaining continuing assessment of the curriculum program. Also listed are the measurable goals for each of the five pupil groups in areas such as appropriate behavior, the criteria for grouping, a sample program day, and teacher opinions of the program.

Project objectives are reported to have been pursued at the public school sites of the 50 participating teachers. It is explained that 44 cooperating teacher competencies  were isolated by means of two surveys. Summary evaluation results are said to suggest that project goals have been achieved to a considerable extent.

Linguistic theory is needed to evaluate the structural suitability of candidate languages, since both official and national languages must have a high level of standardization as a cultural necessity. On the other hand, only a braodly conceived and functionally oriented linguistics can serve as a basis for choosing one language rather than another. The role of linguistics in the area of language development differs somewhat depending on whether development is geared in a technological and scientific or a literary, artistic direction. In the first case, emphasis is on the development of terminologies, and in the second case, on that of  grammatical devices and styles. Linguistics can provide realistic and practical arguments in favor of language development, and a detailed, technical understanding of such development, as well as methodological skills. Linguists can and must function as consultants to those who actually make decisions about language planning. For too long linguists have pursued only those aims generated within their own field. They must now broaden their scope to achieve the kind of understanding of language that is necessary for a productive approach to concrete language problems. (Author/PP)",

The project is described in general introductory terms, with the emphasis on the background, some of the main problems, and a summary of the three principal phases. The total communication method of teaching the deaf, characterized by the simultaneous use of speech and sign language, is discussed; and those procedures used in describing spoken language are applied to the analysis of sign language. It is concluded that the construction of a system for  transcribing sign language is possible. In addition to the aims cited above, the anticipated results of the project include: (1) the evaluation of the influence of sign language on linguistic development and learning, (2) the drawing up of proposals for a sign dictionary, (3) the analysis of the linguistic feasibility of the total communication method, (4) the presentation of guidelines for the further development of sign language, and (5) the development of materials for teaching sign language.

The grammar and vocabulary of each lesson are presented through the dialogues which are based on real-life situations. The grammar is  loosely sequenced according to the following considerations: (1) relative simplicity or complexity, (2) logical progression, (3) usefulness in every day situations, (4) patterns of wide applicability, and (5) structures contrasting with native languages.

The population studied consisted of Finnish secondary students in their sixth year of foreign language study The motivational and auditory variables in foreign language learning were related to school achievement in English, in order to discern what variables in each predictor group (personality, intelligence, motivation, and auditory ability) can best predict these achievements. A questionnaire rating English as to its pleasantness, importance, and difficulty  was used to measure motivation. Auditory variables were measured by sound discrimination and sound-symbol association tests based on tape recordings of an unfamiliar language and nonsense English words. The results showed that English language skills as measured by the instruments of this research were best predicted in most analyses by reasoning ability and the ease and pleasantness of English. Personality played only a minor role. (LG)",

The data was collected from 45-minute interviews with three different groups of college students essentially alike in age: (1) 13 whites from Louisiana, (2) 12 blacks from southwestern Ohio, and (3) 10 whites from southwestern Ohio. Attempts were made to induce the production of \"an\" by three different tests or linguistic \"games.\" The following conclusions were drawn: (1) There is a wide variation in the pronunciation of the indefinite article before beginning with a vowel. It is often \"schwa,\" and sometimes the article is dropped entirely. Reduction of \"an\" to \"schwa\" occurs most frequently for black speakers. (2) Where there is  evidence of style shifting for the black informants because of the race of the interviewer, the variation between \"schwa\" and \"an\" does not show style shifting. (3) The feature that favors the deletion of /n/ the most is a pause between the article and the following word. It is noted that more data from a wider range of social classes, ages, and styles, and from more varied geographic regions, are needed to substantiate this work. (PP)",

The best use of reading material in the early stages of second language acquisition is as an aid to communicating in the target language. Consequently, reading material should be chosen not for the literary value or relevance of its content but for the simplicity of its vocabulary and grammatical structures. Questions about reading should be based on the need for structural manipulation of the language, rather than on teaching the content. A demonstration of the question-asking procedure using an introductory German text illustrates the quantity and variety of questions that can be constructed on the basis  of a short passage. These questions involve transformations, forcing the student to create new sentences in answering, and can serve to teach verb endings, usage of adverbials, and other difficult German structures. The use of such questions in the teaching of a second language should serve as a transitional stage between learning basic grammatical structures and using the language in conversation. (LG)",

        "description":"The distinction between formal and casual English as reflected in the lexicon, in phonology, and in syntax is studied. Formality is treated as separate from other categorizations of language such as geographical origin of the speaker, social class of the participants, or specific context of discourse. The study was restricted mainly to the use of two informats. A categorization of lexical entries and rules into three stylistic levels--formal, netural, and casual--is rejected as insufficiently detailed. Sentences exhibiting stylistically discordant elements are then used to get at fine distinctions in level. A more complex gradation model by which each linguistic element is assigned a value between -10 and +10 is outlined. The degree of stylistic deviance of a sentence is then  calculated as the difference between the values of the most extreme elements in it. Within the framework given here, the linguist must determine which phonological and syntactic rules and lexical entries are stylistically marked and assign them values in a way that predicts the correct ordering of both elements and discords. Ways in which the more complex model could fail to be adequate are also discussed. (PP)",

        "description":"A word of caution is needed about the tendency of language teachers to seize on simplistic and unproven solutions to complex problems. For example, the concept of individualization, when it is limited to having students work in isolation to fulfill mechanically-prescribed objectives, should be questioned. The so-called \"systems approach\" to foreign language learning simply attempts to do more efficiently the same depersonalizing things that caused the educational problems. If the learning experience is to have any permanent value for the student, he must perceive what he is learning as intimately involved with his own self-fulfillment. Student interest and motivation are the keys to success. Foreign language teachers have in the past made the mistake of introducing too much  content at too fast a rate. Textbooks should be used as basic resources rather than as basic curricula, and undue emphasis must not be placed on the quantity of material a teacher covers. Students must be given a chance to do something with the language they are learning, to use it instead of simply memorizing it. Teachers must choose course content on the basis of the following three questions: (1) Is it a genuine sample of cultural and linguistic material? (2) Does it fit the student's level of maturity and intellectual development? (3) Will the student find it interesting and worthwhile? (PP)",

The financing patterns for higher education that develop in the next decade may be expected to have an impact on the characteristics of these new labor-supply entrants. The first part of this paper describes some alternative patterns of higher education financing that may emerge in the 1970's. The second section deals with how each alternative may be expected to affect three characteristics of the highly educated labor supply: their number and educational attainments, their socioeconomic backgrounds, and the appropriateness of their training for the manpower demands of the future. The third section contains an analysis of job preferences and  labor force effort and participation rates, with an emphasis on the effect of student loan financing on these characteristics. Finally, the fourth section contains an evaluation of the previous parts and a discussion of the policy implications. (Author/MJM)",

Findings indicated: (1) University faculty participants in UWW are likely to be of senior rank. (2) On other demographic variables, UWW faculty do not differ significantly from the university faculty at large. (3) UWW faculty participants express greater interest in teaching than research, and the majority feel that a faculty member's teaching effectiveness, not publications, should be the primary criterion for promotion and tenure. (4) Only 10 percent of  the faculty prefer to rely only on the UWW model of one-to-one advising of the sort provided in UWW; most prefer a combination of teacher-student patterns of interactions. (5) The majority of respondents are in agreement with UWW's goals of helping students to learn how to learn and to achieve a liberal education. (6) The majority of respondents worked with more than one UWW student, and there is a tendency for individual university faculty members to be repeatedly contacted for service in UWW.

        "description":"A questionnaire, sent to the chairperson of either the psychology or the sociology department of all colleges and universities in the United States, explored the extent and nature of attitudes about hiring Ph.D. couples in the same department. A total of 2,027 colleges and universities comprised the sample group; however, only 16 percent (329) returned the questionnaire. Results indicate that administrators who would oppose hiring a husband-wife team in the same department are in the minority, and that antinepotism policies and attitudes are no longer prevalent. The 33 percent of department chairpersons who did respond in the bottom third of the scale are a sizeable minority. It is possible that nearly a third of the time the Ph.D. couple will be greeted with a chairperson who at  least actively opposes their candidacy for two positions in her/his department. Advantages and disadvantages to both the department and to the couple are indicated. (MJM)",

        "description":"Health Manpower Legislation and related research aspects are the topics of this report. The program of the Comprehensive Health Manpower Training Act of 1971 played a major role in the medical school enrollment expansion that occurred between 1971 and 1973. Medical school admissions decisions have been responsible to federal policy objectives and broader social concerns regarding equality of access for women and minorities. Primary care physicians need and are choosing speciality training, whether in family medicine or one of the more traditional specialities of internal medicine, pediatrics, or obstetrics-gynecology. Although public schools and private schools have increased real tuition levels during the past decade, the spread between the two has increased. The strong  technical interdependencies among patient care, research, and education in academic health centers mean that there are strong interdependencies between federal decisions in the health manpower field and federal decisions in other health care areas. Greater reliance on clinical faculty earnings for institution support will require that clinical care in teaching hospitals be oriented more toward secondary and tertiary than toward primary care. Government proposals for the use of special projects to promote primary care may compensate for the financial problems associated with primary care training as well as for those created by cutbacks in general institutional support.

        "description":"The history of higher education in the U. S. traditionally has been characterized by the same kinds of studies as most other American history: ones that focus on the experiences or concerns of the authors. What such history ignores is the group that for most of this century comprised about 40 percent or more of the undergraduate student body and about 20-25 percent of the faculties; namely, women. The difficulty of looking at the history of women in higher education through the same methodological lens as men is that the focus on success brings forth a set of women that is significantly different from the other women educators and from other women. Investigations of backgrounds of successful women faculty and administrators suggest that many of these women have had one of two  experiences: attending an all-girl's high school or college or coming from an immigrant family. In single sex institutions, a teacher can support and encourage her students vigorously in a fashion that is rare in coeducational institutions where both faculty and students often tend to regard male students as more meritorious of academic consideration. Other areas that need further study concerning women are discussed including the influence of sororities, the role of the academic wife, influence of college life on women students, effects of coeducational institutions on women, and sex-linked curricula.

A budget of estimated yearly expenses suggests that a child care program could be totally self-supporting based on a monthly fee of $110 for each child in full-time care. Securing the necessary physical facilities presents the major problem. An interest survey resulted in the collection of 181 completed questionnaires. Parents who responded to the survey are USC staff or administrators, about one-third are students, some of whom also work at USC, and the remainder are faculty. Parents of 70 children aged 2-5 requested full-time child care, while more than 50 additional children need part-time care. Three-fourths of the parents  stated that they are able to pay at least $80 per month for full-day care and about one-half are able to pay more than $100 per month. Suggested alternatives for child care at USC include: (1) a facility directly operated by the university, (2) a facility operated by a nonuniversity organization with university assistance, or (3) a completely independent child care facility established with some university encouragement.

At this seminar plans were made to broaden the program focus from just consortium concerns to include the full range of interests in systems of interdependence in postsecondary education. These proceedings, to the extent that presentations were made available for publication, reflect this broader concern. The papers report on old and new problems of cooperation and coordination. They address critical issues such as: how to use resources more effectively; how to reach for benefits of campus-free, time-free learning; how to counterbalance centralization; and how to extend learning opportunities to new kinds of students.

Some of the applicants who are rejected from U.S. medical schools may contemplate the pursuit of medical education in another country. Foreign medical education, however, seems to present more problems than solutions, and potential applicants should seriously review their motives and realistically evaluate their personal qualifications before deciding to become foreign medical students. Some problems encountered by the 6,000 U.S. students studying medicine abroad are discussed, including: admission requirements, choice of school, placement services, application possibilities, description of policies by language of instruction, clinical clerkships,  certification, and examination performance of returning U.S. students. Anyone contemplating foreign medical study should: (1) carefully examine current admission standards and past test performance data for U.S. students and graduates from foreign medical schools; and (2) realistically appraise personal aptitudes and abilities before investing precious years and extensive sums in a venture that offers no guarantee for the eventual practice of medicine in the U.S. (Author/PG)",

(2) As roles of boards of trustees become appreciated and understood, one may expect that implications for trustee membership, board organization, and board operations will become clearer. The author focuses special attention on the following: composition of the board, renewal, morale, and accountability. Since the role of the  president is so important in his relationship to the trustees, the author sums up his opinions on the role of the president.

Transfer students were matched with native students from the universities using session year, year of program, degree sought, age, sex, and first year cumulative grade-point average. These matched data were presented descriptively to indicate comparative academic performance of native and transfer students. The data were tested for significance at the .05 level of confidence on a two-tailed test of significance having first been tested for homogeneity of variance. These data were used to test eleven different hypotheses designed to investigate the effect on the academic achievement of the two matched groups on the variables of year  of program, age, sex, and degree sought. It was found that Red Deer College transfers achieved academically as well as native students at the University of Calgary, and that this achievement was not affected by the variables inspected. At the University of Alberta it was found that Red Deer College transfer students achieved academically only slightly below the native students. In the third year of a degree program the transfers experienced an academic drop in achievement, especially in the categories of females, students under 25 years of age, and students seeking Bachelors of Education degrees or degrees classified as &quot;other&quot; in the study.

Responses were received from 42 percent of these. Surveys were also sent to financial aid administrators and to budget and finance officers at all public and private colleges and universities. Some of the report's findings and recommendations, include: (1) A simplified, probably standard, form should replace the confusing welter of forms a student must use to apply for financial aid. (2) Nonrepayable assistance and loans play a  more important role in the budgets of low income students, but low income parents as well as middle income parents still make a considerable financial effort to send their children to college. (3) Small businessmen seem to be unfairly treated by the current method of determining how much aid a student needs. (4) The Illinois State Scholarship Commission should institute tighter monitoring to detect fraudulent aid applications. (5) Studies should be made of students who do not win State scholarships to find out whether without that aid they cannot attend college for financial reasons. (MJM)",

It was found that a significant number of students do attend more than one institution, with the most frequent move being from one senior institution to another. This is understandable in view of the absence of a community college system in Louisiana. The role of 4-year colleges in performing junior college functions is discussed. It was also found that there  are several areas in which credit acceptance policies are not uniform between the different institutions or even between units within the same institution. These inconsistencies include policies covered in &quot;Guidelines for Improving Articulation Between Junior and Senior Colleges&quot; (for example, acceptance of &quot;D&quot; grade credits in transfer if native students receive credit for courses in which &quot;D&quot; is earned). Approaches to improved articulation used by other states are explored, and it is recommended that Louisiana move to form an articulation committee and develop a statewide credit transfer policy.

The Council staff has followed this debate and has identified critical population factors that will influence future enrollments in Oregon institutions. In light of this, the Council has presented population trends that influence postsecondary enrollments to 1984. Considering these projections, several policy questions arise concerning facilities, staffing, students, and finances, all of which are discussed separately in this document. This review of potential problems facing postsecondary education in Oregon during the next decade makes it apparent that many critical decisions will be faced by educational policymakers at all levels  during this period. The decisions that will be faced both during the growth of the late 70s and the decline of the 80s in some segments will test the ability of Oregon's system of educational governance. This system, which is based largely upon voluntary cooperation, planning, and coordination, may not be able to respond to the unprecedented changes that appear to be facing postsecondary education. Critical decisions regarding funding, student allocation, staffing, and facilities utilization, particularly during the post-1980 contraction, will require much greater coordination and planning than has been necessary during the extended period of sustained growth of the 1960s and 1970s.

During the 1972-73 academic year at the University of Miami, student satisfaction and dissatisfaction in 34 areas of University of Miami student life were examined (via four field surveys) for possible relationships with student attrition. The survey instrument was a questionnaire. Dissatisfaction in seventeen of these areas was found to be correlated with student plans to return (or not to return) to the University of Miami in the fall of 1973, while dissatisfaction in the other seventeen areas was not correlated with such plans. The variable that was most highly correlated with attrition was the students' perception  of their progress toward their academic and career goals. The greater the dissatisfaction with the progress toward these goals, the greater the attrition. The results are shown in two tables. In table I the areas of student life in which dissatisfaction was correlated with attrition are shown. In table II the areas in which dissatisfaction was not correlated with attrition are shown.

In meeting these demands, particularly in an environment of economic growth and an atmosphere of fiscal optimism, it should not be surprising that the implementation of new programs and the creation of new institutions would overshadow and outdistance the movement to coordination. However, while overshadowed, such movement never ceased, and as growth and expansion characterize Washington higher education, so do cooperation and integration. This report, containing early recommendations on enrollment distributions, institutional  roles, academic instruction programs, and expansion in the number and capacities of community colleges, set the stage for many subsequent steps to coordinated programming in this state. The primary purpose of this draft outline was to broach the subject of comprehensive long-range educational planning and stimulate its discussion. Suggestions from institutions of higher education influenced the second version of the outline.

The comparative analysis is based on data derived from administration of the Hofstra University Course and Teacher Evaluation Questionnaire and the New College Evaluation Questionnaire to 368 New College respondents at the conclusion of the spring semester 1974. The purpose of this study was to compare results on the two forms to determine: (1) if similar information was gained from the two forms, (2) if one or the other of the forms alone provided information appropriate to the needs of New College, and (3) if in the future it would be necessary to administer both forms. Overall, it might be  concluded that the two forms do get at basically the same information, since significant correlations do exist between many items and many items do have &quot;face&quot; or content similarity. Yet, as previously indicated, much higher correlations might have been expected among certain items that are in fact identical. The possibility of some systematic bias in responding, as suggested by the review of individual respondee sheets, and by the relatively low intercorrelations between forms with relatively high interacorrelations between items on the same form, limits any extensive interpretation of comparability of forms.

        "description":"The New College Living-Learning Unit was begun in 1972-73 as an optional beginning semester for New College freshmen. The basis for the curriculum was taken from the regular freshman program at New College but given a 'unique' substance (the notion of community from a multiplicity of discipline perspectives) and unique physical facilities. The following report is an evaluation of the Living-Learning Unit for its second year of operation. Three faculty along with 52 students comprised the population of the unit. The curriculum for the program included a &quot;core&quot; course entitled &quot;Being Human&quot; that was required of all participants. In addition, six other courses were listed as part of the Unit, although students were not required to take any of these other courses. The primary concern  of this evaluation was with the perceived value of the Living-Learning Unit and the &quot;Being Human&quot; course in particular. Two additional dimensions, the physical facilities provided for the program and the student's attitude toward this type of program in general, were also of major interest. In the eyes of the students responding to the Living-Learning Unit Questionnaire, the Unit appears to have failed to materialize as a cohesive, meaningful, learning experience. But it must be remembered that the views expressed in this report reflect only 40% of the participants and therefore may not be representive. The appendix contains the survey results. (Author/PG)",

Conclusions indicated: (1) Parttime faculty tend not to be faculty wives. (2) A significant number of parttime faculty are continuing graduate work. (3) Parttime women tend to be less  satisfied with salaries and more likely to be dependent upon the parttime job, while men tend to be teaching parttime for extra money and are less concerned about salary levels.

In addition, 50 of the 68 freshmen were administered the Cooperative Reading Test, the Omnibus Personality Inventory, and the New College Entrance Questionnaire. Based upon a review of SAT, high school deciles, and entrance test data on entering freshmen, 1973-74, the following points were made: (1) Overall, the level of academic achievement based on SAT scores has dropped an average of 4 or 5 percent over students admitted the previous year. (2) The mean high school decile for entering students was 3.5 and is approximately the same as Hofstra Freshmen in general. (3)  Reading levels of entering freshmen are above average overall, but levels of comprehension are slightly below average. (4) Students selecting New College appear to be intellectually motivated, to have an interest in the pursuit of ideas rather than facts, and to prefer the kind of social environment that they perceive exists at New College.

Academic achievement was measured by the cumulative grade-point average (GPA) for spring quarter, 1973. In addition, an analysis of persistence to graduation was undertaken for similar groups of freshmen athletes and for a sample of male students for the years 1965 and 1968. Results indicated the mean GPA for male athletes for the spring quarter, 1973 was slightly less than the mean GPA for male undergraduates for the entire university and for each college except Agriculture, where the athletes involved had a slightly higher average.  Also the average ACT Composite score for male athletes was slightly less than for that of all male entering freshmen in each of the years 1968 through 1972. For the 1965 male student sample in this study, the rate of persistence to graduation was 51 percent, with 4 percent still in school; the rate for the 1968 sample was 40 percent with 14 percent still enrolled. The educational progress of these small groups of students indicates that the 4-year time span to receive a bachelor's degree or its equivalent is perhaps not the best indication of persistence for either the athlete or any other male undergraduate.

For each of the four groups a probability sample of the civilian noninstitutional sample population has been drawn by the U.S. Bureau of the Census from 235 sample areas representing every state and the District of Columbia. Each sample consists of approximately 5,000 people. Conclusions tentatively suggest: (1) There is an enormous diversity in the background of students, even when they are  grouped into relatively homogenous curriculum categories. (2) Many of the students show the clear effect of inadequate or no vocational guidance in their hopes and educational objectives. (3) Even in a world in which guidance was both accurate and abundant, many careers would be begun, terminated, and changed as a result of exogenous and accidental events that are completely outside the control of the student. (4) Most of the men in this study had vague career goals that were subject to many changes.

If a student works for an agency or company but receives compensation only for his out-of-pocket expenses or receives no compensation at all, that student could be considered as a volunteer worker and not eligible for workmen's compensation. Although there are no court cases to refer to, a court may construe receiving room, board, or other necessities from an employer in lieu of money payment as employment.

High officials responsible for education policy in OECD member countries, including a number of ministers, attended the Conference together with teachers, administrators and participants from trade union and professional organizations. The central concern of the Conference was to examine the advent of mass higher education in its main patterns and characteristics and to identify alternative policy measures for facilitating the overall structural transformation of the system toward meeting its  new objectives in the context of social and economic development. The present volume contains a series of four background studies relating to some of the major themes of the Conference.

        "description":"This paper was delivered to a symposium held by the University of Canterbury, New Zealand, as part of its centennial celebrations in May 1973. The central theme of this paper is that the idea of the university as an effective instrument of social reform has been dangerously exaggerated. This disjunction between expectation and capacity is grounded on a misunderstanding of two modes of the university--the university as a corporate institution and the university as an academic community. The university as a corporate institution is elaborated, then social change, investments, admissions, professional networks, influence of the university, and the influence of the educated man is discussed. The author concludes that the university's greatest instrument for social reform is not its  institutional muscle but its graduates who will have appreciated a dedication to careful analysis and precise statement, and that embraces a view of what could be, which is the first prerequisite to social reform.

Despite the immense potential of the institution, it has almost equally big problems. The Public Library community recently consolidated over 380 separate library authorities into 115. Each faces the problem of assimilating different systems into a new administrative and bibliographic unit. In spite of this turbulent scene, the British Library (BL) community hopes to develop a program providing both scientific information services and bibliographic services. The BL  objective is to provide a reservoir of bibliographic records. To accomplish this objective, the systems approach will anticipate the development of the International MARC Network and do everything possible to ensure that records coming through this network can be found and used with as little modification as possible.

It showed that teachers have been asked to perform an impossible instructional task, and to improve public education a systematic study of the important relevant variables must be initiated. These findings need to be implemented in systematic instructional programs which draw on advanced knowledge of curriculum, instructional methodology, learner variables, and instructional delivery systems. However, psychological research evidence is not directly applicable to the nonlaboratory learning situations in schools. Also, there is little, if any, established data about teaching which is widely accepted. On the other hand, the recognition of trait-treatment interaction analysis is an  important milestone despite current criticisms. In addition, computer generated instructional materials have been quite positive when compared to traditional instruction. Programatic research efforts will be required to identify the appropriate variables and relationships and incorporate them into a single adaptive interactive instructional system which can have widespread application.

These are collected into separate lists of factors or variables that disproportionately benefit either high mental ability students or low mental ability students. Those instructional procedures that benefit low ability learners are characterized as largely serving a \"compensatory\" function, that is, they provide the mediators, organization, and modality that the  students cannot provide for themselves. In turn, the instructional procedures that benefit high ability students serve a \"preferential\" function by calling on and utilizing their higher aptitudes. These generalizations are then expanded to form very detailed prescriptions for instructional media design, depending on the mental ability of the learners. (WH)",

        "description":"Reconstructing media research so that generalizable knowledge can be produced requires an increased emphasis on attributes of media which interact with individual differences to effect learning. In order to accomplish this, media researchers must make a distinction between research \"with\" media and research \"on\" media. Privious efforts to systematize the selection of media for instruction by developing taxonomies generally have not been derived from previous research; they also do not draw on previous efforts to organize or conceptualize individual differences in learners. An alternative approach to the structuring and testing of media attribute taxonomies might list attributes to be validated by forming a three-dimensional matrix of subjects, behaviors, and attributes. The  matrix is then collapsed across each of the three factors in turn and intercorrelations factored. By collapsing across subjects, for example, it is possible to compute the correlations between all the pairs of media attributes on specific behaviors and factor analyze the intercorrelation matrix. Factors would represent functionally similar media attributes; i.e., clusters of attributes which tend to elicit the same behavior. The result would form the basis of a media taxonomy for research purposes. (Author/WCM)",

It is our contention that as a theoretical argument the ATI approach extends current practice in a desirable direction but that this approach, like those it is intended to replace, seriously limits the possibility of optimal adaptation to individual differences. This paper attempts to identify the theoretical premises of the Cronbach/Snow argument and to propose alternatives which are less limiting.

Differences in people's experiences do lead to different cognitive structures. Different people use the same machinery of perceiving, coding, storing, and retrieving. Neverthless, how they use this machinery, what information they process by this machinery, and which particular use of a given piece of machinery they prefer, will make a major difference in knowledge structures leading to an enormous variety of individual differences. Even very small differences in environment and experience can make large differences in knowledge structures including the learner's knowledge about how to process information, even  though it is probably true that the underlying machinery is the same for all learners. Systematic investigations on the media based on TTI-Process oriented theories appear now to hold the promise of making a major impact on our understanding of the communication process as well as on our understanding of human behavior. In terms of the theories, technology, and research methods that the task requires there has never been a more opportune time. (WCM)",

The subjects were 4th and 5th grade students, mostly Mexican-Americans, in a low-income school. Pairs of subjects were matched on age, sex, and initial achievement level in math. Subjects in both conditions used a modified form of the Math Drill and Practice program by Suppes, et al, 1974. Task specific attention or inattention and locus of control were measured. Among the  major finds were: (1) that the choice group was significantly higher in engagement, (2) for both groups, engagement decreased significantly over a 15 day period; and (3) distinctive choice patterns did occur. The findings also showed that children will choose problems that result in poor academic performance; if performance in choice situations is to be improved, training methods that use information about children's unique patterns of choices should be designed.

The North Carolina State Department of Public Instruction surveyed state officials responsible in the 50 states, five territories, the District of Columbia and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Fifty-seven NDEA III-A questionnaires were sent and 93% were returned; 95% of the ESEA II questionnaires were returned. The NDEA III-A survey found: (1) that 50 of 52 respondents have local funds available to match federal allocations for 1974, and (2) that advanced funding had a &quot;great&quot; effect on program effectiveness. The ESEA II survey determined that 50 out of 54 respondents  believed 1974 funding was inadequate to meet state-wide needs and estimated the amount of additional funds that could have been effectively used. Both surveys estimate the total amount of federal funds that could be matched by states in 1975, 1976, and 1977. Also, both agree that federal funding should be increased. (WCM)",

In MMIS a scientific datum by itself is not information, but is information if and only if it is tied to an appropriate story or myth that has meaning to the individual who needs the information, the organization in which he is located, and the type of problem that he faces. Since this defines the key variables underlying MMIS, the study of the critical literature dealing with the nature and function of mythology becomes central to MMIS design. Ways are suggested in which the literature of mythology and the phenomenon of story-telling can be used in the design of MMIS if not for information systems in general. An experiment dealing with some  central features of MMIS involved playing a series of games under the twin conditions of uncertainty and dialectical advice. Experimental subjects were exposed to the advice of two radically opposing &quot;experts of the game&quot; who were designed to present opposing views of the game situation. A suggested program of research and a list of references are given. (Author/LS)",

Phase I was devoted to locating existing collections through the use of a questionnaire, preparing checklists to aid in the search for specific items, and beginning to locate newspapers, periodicals, and bibliographies. During Phase II substantial progress was made toward locating manuscripts and archives, theses, oral histories, and pre-1950 imprints. Phase III activities included completion and distribution of a consortium list of materials purchased with a Special Purpose Grant and submission of a manuscript to a publisher.

Most of the employees were in lower socio-economic status jobs. Some 19% of the black youths received some pretraining, while approximately 10% of the white youths were pretrained. The sample consisted of 905 white youths and 342 black youths drawn from the National Longitudinal Survey of the labor force, a project sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor. Comparisons were made between those who did not receive training during that interval. The study concluded that: (1) employers play an important part in helping with upward mobility of the labor force; (2) the type of training received  relates to the occupational opportunities of the youths; and (3) broader opportunities for training for black and white youths will help reduce the economic differentials.

Each was considered inadequate. As a result, the people hiring (and firing) EDP staff were faced with an inadequate supply of well-qualified programers and analysts and an abundance of poorly-trained, unqualified, and inefficient personnel. This created an artificial limitation of the utility of industry computers. The study concluded that there is not one solution to the problem, which will continue in the  field of business data processing. However, if sincere and conscientious steps are taken by the industry and educational institutes, the problem can be allieviated significantly. Industry stands to gain tremendously by working in partnership with colleges, universities, and private EDP schools for the of establishing guidelines and objectives for data-processing education.

While questions remain in regard to the technology itself, the health and viability of the industry, and government policy, librarians are seeing cable communications as an opportunity to gain credibility and visibility, and also as an extension of the legitimate function of libraries to collect, store, and disseminate information. While the public library remains in the forefront at the moment, university libraries are beginning to use campus-wide cable systems, which are often interfaced with the commercial cable system in town. School media centers are also participating in cable activities, and special libraries are becoming repositories for video materials used by their  companies for training and sales purposes. At present the public libraries, which stand to gain the most from cable communications, have the opportunity to participate, together with other groups, in educational and planning activities to insure a people-oriented cable system and to program to fulfill various information needs of the library's clientele. In the future, cable appears to offer an opportunity for electronic resource sharing at relatively low cost. (Author/LS)",

Specific findings were made in the areas of: quality, suitability, and patterns of services; problems of access; legal reference materials; staffing; censorship; selection and control of materials; library programs; space utilization; funding; administrative support of librarians; and library position in the administrative structure. A major  finding was that there was an acute need for improved library service to confined persons. While no one pattern of service could be right for all situations, some of the critical factors should be: recognition of inmates' right to read, stable funding to allow systematic planning, communication and cooperation between the institution and outside libraries, service to staff as well as inmates, clientele participation in developing library services; and administrative support.

Examples are interactive graphics that allow the student to initiate animations of physical processes and interactive block diagrams that allow the student to learn the functional organization of complex devices. Projects are underway to test the effectiveness of these uses. (Author)",

A pilot project was undertaken to study the development of problems into research projects. The research was to be divided into three areas: problem perception and problem definition, information search and dissemination, and local information and documentation. In the process of doing its research the project had to consider data collection by interviews, data handling by rating scales, impressionistic content analysis, and computer-based content analysis. Throughout its work the project has focused more on model development than on field research. (WH)",

The areas explored were: (1) the types of programs which they reported liking or disliking, (2) the types of programs which they felt informed them, (3) their attitudes toward commercials, and (4) the factors associated with their perception of the credibility of the various types of presentations of roles, situations, and information. Information also was sought on the manner in which disputes with parents or siblings over which programs to watch were managed. The children were found to prefer entertainment programs and to consider most commercials annoying. Family conflicts over which program to watch  appeared to be a powerful stimulus for political interaction within the family. (Author/PF)",

Five conclusions were reached regarding a model diffusion system. First, diffusion, not dissemination, should be the concern of SEAs. Second, diffusion systems and the diffusion process itself provide means to a larger SEA objective--the health school system. Third, an SEA diffusion system is comprised of information, linkage, staff development, strategy design. Fourth, while several state education agencies are involved in assisting local schools using diffusion system resources, very few, if any, SEAs  have been able to coordinate resources in a coherent delivery system. Finally, there is a significant role that SEAs can play in research and development activities related to diffusion resources and the diffusion process. (WCM)",

Accordingly a cost-effective Learning Resource Aided Instruction (LRAI) System centered around a Data General NOVA minicomputer augmented with slide projector-audio cassette media was designed and developed at the University of California, Santa Barbara. A similar system was integrated into the educational program at California Polytechnic State University and experimentally evaluated for two courses with large enrollments. These courses were an introduction to COBOL and an introduction to BASIC, respectively. The evaluation procedure consisted of comparing the curricula of the two courses taught  in a traditionally-aided instruction (TAI) mode with that taught in a LRAI mode using appropriately structured questionnaires, common examinations, and statistical analyses. The results of the evaluation strongly demonstrated that the performance of students using the LRAI approach was better than those in the TAI mode of instruction. (Author/WCM)",

The major features of the curriculum are the interactive student control and the branching to different sets of lessons, determined by individual student needs. A feature of the computer program is the daily and periodic student reports which are available. A language arts test was developed and used in an evaluation experiment in which five different models of student progress were tested. In addition,  experiments on the teaching strategies and sequences of tutorial CAI were performed. The latter experiments involved an item analysis of the lesson exercises. (WH)",

The students were mostly sophomores at the University of Massachusetts. Two teaching assistants and the instructor provided the 60 member sample population with two types of assignment sheets, one relating to the textbook, one relating to the teacher-authored programed materials. All students were advised to take self-quizzes at the end of programed lessons. A student who did not achieve mastery on the self-quiz was advised to study the alternative assignment material. Deadlines were utilized. A final examination and a treatment-interaction analysis evaluated the one semester experiment. The median score (78 percent) earned on the final exam was equal to the 85th  percentile of the departmental examination. The treatment-interaction analysis, using grade point average as the independent variable, showed uniformly higher scores in the experimental group. The study dramatically confirmed the need for individualization of time to complete the course although the amount of flexibility needed to be increased by one or more orders of magnitude. (WCM)",

A quantitative description of service performance was provided by the measurement of the following parameters: output sizes, recall ratios, precision ratios, coverage ratios, and novelty ratios. The relevance predictability of the enriched titles which appear on the BA Previews tapes was also studied.  The users' reactions to the service were assessed by means of another survey at the end of the experiment. Correlations between quantitative performance measures and the users' assessment of the service, were examined.

A summative evaluation of the system was performed. The use of a computer in Project PLAN* allows the teacher more time to spend with individual students and contributes toward record keeping and feedback on student progress. Project PLAN* was evaluated in the elementary grades using the Metropolitan Achievement Test in grades 1, 2, 3 and using the Iowa Test of Basic Skills in grades 4, 5, 6, 7. Affective measures were also used to determine the difference in the students' self-esteem, general anxiety, and test anxiety. Other activities of the evaluation included student and teacher questionnaires and a cost analysis.  Mixed results were reported in the evaluation, some of which could be attributed to known contamination of the data. (WH)",

A benefit-cost analysis tries for each alternative to measure benefits and costs, which are then discounted to yield a present value. Unofrtunately, in educational systems benefits cannot be measured, and the idea of a discount has no meaning. However, a cost effectiveness analysis may have application to education since it compares the different costs of alternatives against the different performance levels on objectives. A decision criterion must be able to relate and measure all the performance of difference alternatives. Most educational  organizations do not have the data for a cost effectiveness analysis, yet the thinking and judgments on relative value and performance are most desirable. (WH)",

Students were matched in pairs on two pretests, a verbal aptitude test, and an electronics and mathematics aptitude test, and randomly assigned to the two curricula, which contained identical theoretical material. The two training programs differed principally in that the computer-based curriculum provided simulation of trouble-shooting experience through interaction with the computer, while the programed textbook-based curriculum had to rely solely on written explanations. Two criterion measures were employed, a written multiple-choice test of theoretical knowledge and an actual trouble-shooting session on faulty digital logic  circuits. These were applied within a week and repeated 9 weeks after completion of the course. While observation and anecdotal evidence suggested that the computer-based curriculum was more interesting and stimulating, expecially for the brighter students, none of the objective measures showed an advantage for the computer group.

The model is a set of equations which describe an educational program and the changes and flows in student enrollment in all the courses of an educational system. Thus the model is restricted to the internal logic of an educational system which is simulated deterministically. Some of the variables employed by the model are population figures for each age and also promotion, repetition, distribution, and leaving rates for each course. The simulation model can be adapted to determine the demand for teachers, the costs, and the cumulative output of any educational system. The model has been employed in several countries,  and its implementation on a computer would allow a more objective simulation with more refined results. (WH)",

High frequency of appearances of these distorted roles and situations might lead to viewers' perceptual rigidity in typing of characters in general, but might have some positive function in radio and television in \"unmasking\", amusement, innovation, and communication of complicated social types over time. Exploratory research results suggest that upper middle class children find television programs which rely heavily on caricatural elements less believable than patterns of programing which either appear or are stated to be true, such as some commercials, documentaries, and science presentations.  This finding of apparent awareness of caricatural elements is in general agreement with other research in which it was found that advantaged children were less likely than disadvantaged children to believe that television presented an accurate portrayal of the world around them.

Responses were received from 66% of those surveyed. The major conclusions derived from the survey were the following: (1) there is a trend toward central locations for school media centers, (2) media specialists are frequently asked to perform extraneous administrative duties, (3) the media specialist needs to solicit teacher patronage and suggestions, (4) specific university training for media work is needed, and (5) the function and use of the media center has improved.

For each reference request received in the libraries, the date, time, duration, mode, class of question, and user type were noted. These statistics were tabulated and analyzed by computer. It was concluded that the overall complexity of questions asked in a science library is low and that few non-trivial reference requests are received during evening hours.

The fourth season of Sesame Street and the second season of The Electric Company were rerun through the summer by most of the public and commercial television stations that carried the shows throughout the school year. A nationwide research study indicated that The Electric Company, now in its second season, is watched by 3.5 million in school, an increase of more than half a million viewers over the first season. Another three million watch the program at home. Research indicated that the series meets its reading instruction objective. No general changes in the curriculum for The Electric Company are planned, but there will be some  changes in emphasis. Sesame Street's new programing will give fuller treatment in the bilingual/bicultural area as well as in the area of emotions and feelings. Because of reduction in funding from public sources, new funding sources and investments are being explored. (Author/WCM)",

Without their intervention, the result may well be a lack of concern for local public services. However, the entertainment and communications industries will interconnect cable systems without the assistance of state and local governments. The FCC will license firms to do so. On the other hand, local government initiative in regional interconnection can be the catalyst which forces communications technology to address problems of urban congestion, rural decline, etc. Nevertheless, there are several problems public officials must address: (1) interconnection facilities do not necessarily fit public jurisdictional boundaries; (2)  public uses of cable may require audiences and program sources larger than those available to a single cable system, but more localized than a national network; (3) cable systems deliver services only to cable subscribers, but the audiences for public services may not necessarily be connected to cable system.

The objectives of the system are: (1) to provide citizens and public officials information on community problems; (2) to provide civic planners knowledge of the views of citizens so their decisions will be responsive to these views; and (3) to offer citizens effective roles in civic and school planning. Over 5,000 persons (4 percent of the eligible population) voluntarily registered as televoters, and most participated in one or more televotes. About 700 persons voted on each issue which represents a substantially greater input than school authorities usually receive on specific issues. An evaluation of the system at the  end of the demonstration gave consistently favorable responses. It appears that the citizens are willing to pay the cost of operating the televote system. It is recommended that: (1) the system should continue to be developed and operated to jointly serve those public agencies which wish to cooperate in its use; (2) outside funds should be sought to support the improvements in the system; and (3) the telephone company should be requested to approve a unique prefix so that televotes may be dialed from all phones in the area.

Also examined are three basic approaches to the automation of library circulation systems, with examples drawn from systems already in operation. In addition, the impact of the emergence of consortia of libraries dedicated to cooperative processing of materials has been considered and incorporated into the design. The conclusion of the design team is that the on-line system at Ohio State University be adopted with minor modifications for use at Purdue. Of particular interest in a technical sense are the recommendations for use of a new technology, light pens reading  bar-encoded labels, and the adaptation of an existing operational circulation system from another university. The proposed system will also have an impact on other future university applications because of the inclusion of the bar-encoded, machine readable label on the university passport usable for many purposes.

Specifically, this investigation describes, by a mathematical equation, the relationship between the \"subjective\" information content of written textual material and the relative number of errors committed by a learner when asked to predict, letter by letter, the content of given textual material. The relationship shows that the subjective information of a given text for a specific learner is directly proportional to the number of wrongly-guessed signs made by that learner. This is expressed mathematically by: I=3.1E; Where: I=Information in Bits; E=Number of wrongly guessed signs. The application of Shannon's guessing  procedure (1951) in this study permits the measurement of the \"subjective\" information of a given text for a specific learner. The derived equation permits the measurement of information in terms of a value that is dependent not only on the inherent qualities of the subject matter, but also on the internal state of the learner.

The experiments compared a method of teaching derived from analysis of human tutors (Tutorial Mode) vs. a method derived from programed instruction (Block-Test Mode). In the three experiments, Block-Test Mode was systematically converged toward Tutorial Mode in order to pinpoint what aspects of teaching strategy affected student's learning. Tutorial Mode was significantly more effective in the first two experiments, and nonsignificantly effective in the third. The results indicated that the major factor affecting the student's learning was the strategy that tutors use of reviewing the material in greater depth on a second pass. Allowing the students  to ask questions, and the tutorial strategy for relating new material to the student's previous knowledge contributed only a small amount to the differences found in the first two experiments.

Interviews with representatives and senior staff from a sample of 40 House offices show concern that the current communication systems are either too narrow--letters, telephone calls, physical conferences--or too broad--television, radio, or other media. The workload of congressmen is increasing so that effective constituent communication is ever more difficult, but the need for that communication is even greater. Emergent telecommunications (particularly cable television) offer the potential of great time savings and ideal communication at the right level. However, there are possible problems of cost, accountability, abuse, and overuse. The entrenchment of  incumbents seemed to be a particular concern of Congressmen. It is recommended that telecommunications should be expanded to aid Congressmen with the proviso that fair and balanced access to communication channels be available to all political participants.

Once trained in the use of the Instructional Development Institute (IDI) system, participants sought to produce a competency-based program and guide to the preparation and certification of library media supervisors, and to develop a variety of competency-based inservice/preservice prototypes. Supervisory participants  identified and defined five major roles for a media supervisory. A list of competencies was outlined for each role and for 28 functions, and suggestions were made for preparatory experiences. An &quot;inside-outside&quot; evaluation of the institute was conducted through personal interviews and a written questionnaire at the final session.

It is expected that media use analysis and communication assessment procedures will identify those persons who share similar media use characteristics. A systematic way of being creative can be predicted to increase the visible range of choices in media use in exponential proportions, greatly expanding the possible ways that the Mister Roger's Neighborhood program segments and materials can deliver educationally to the child. Once  media use patterns are expanded in this way, and once specific patterns of use by professionals and the special child are identified, it should be possible to plan and design subsequent segments and materials to effectively reach both audiences.

Twenty-one junior year students, (nine Black or Spanish American and all economically deprived) were recruited. A random sample of 20 students in the regular MLS program were selected as a control group and compared to the trainees in background and attitudes on their graduate library education. During their junior and senior years, the trainees took some library science courses, attended lectures and tours, and participated in two projects: a reorganization of the Albany county jail library  and a paid summer internship. In interviews, trainees stated that their undergraduate exposure to librarianship had assisted them in making career decisions. They felt that their 3-year program was outstanding. The SUNYA program had a lower dropout rate than similar programs to date. Only one of the program's objectives was not fully met--to encourage trainees to take undergraduate programs in fields rare to graduate library students. Only four trainees chose unusual undergraduate programs. (SL)",

Many people have different ideas concerning how a center fits into the content model of knowledge or the transmission model of teaching. The purpose of an instructional center is often called \"improving instruction\", but this can be ambiguously interpreted. On the one hand the purpose could be to aid and supplement existing methods and objectives of instruction. This is likely to mean the center is to be a service agency for the faculty. On the other hand the center might seek to go beyond the existing methods and curricula on campus. In the latter case a  conflict with faculty can easily develop. The survival of an instructional center sometimes depends on the independence of its funding and the vagueness of its stated purposes. The idea of being a \"catalyst for change\" should be avoided. Overall, centers should be expected to engage in research, science, and teaching. (WH)",

As background material, an overview of existing centers was constructed from earlier interlibrary loan studies; small surveys of public, special, and state library agencies; and staff visits to a number of existing centers and regional networks. To meet the need for improved resource sharing, a recommended structure for the coordination and integration of resource and bibliographic centers into a national network for improved interlibrary loan service was developed. As part of this design the nation was divided into a number of suggested bibliographic regions  and delivery zones for the physical supply of requested materials. Various kinds and levels of services have been considered at each level within the program--national, regional, zone, state, and local. Estimated developmental and operational costs are shown along with a proposed schedule for the accomplishment of the recommended program. (Author/SL)",

Similar procedures were followed by the three systems: a catalog, listing paperback books for children and adults, was prepared and distributed by bulk mail. Prestamped book order cards were enclosed. Program evaluation was based on monthly circulation statistics, an analysis of geographic distribution of patrons and of subject popularity from a 10 percent sample of the completed order cards and, at the end of the project, a questionnaire to an 8 percent sample of the BBM patrons. The mean cost per user of the BBM service was $8.12. Data suggested that the  programs did not achieve their goal of stimulating library use and the development of new library districts, since a high percentage of the BBM users were already registered library patrons. Furthermore, the total group sampled was not willing to pay an annual fee large enough to support any type of library program, even a BBM service. (SL)",

Further explanation is provided on the process of generating library goals and objectives.

Libraries must actively intervene to provide information and referral services on the problems of daily living and should serve as cultural institutions, reflecting the various ethnic orientations to be found in the city. Important ingredients to a successful urban outreach program include a sympathetic staff and small, neighborhood library centers. The greatest difficulty in carrying out any specialized program for the disadvantaged is the matter of funding, for the very concentration of poverty and related problems reduces the city's fiscal and personal resources for meeting these needs. In addition, urban libraries, because of their large collections,  are called on to serve as research libraries and area resource centers for the suburbs. Statistics show that library expenses are rising, but that urban libraries are receiving a decreasing share of the city budget. Additional funds are imperative for the development of library programs deemed necessary for urban living. (Author/SL)",

The development took the form of a generic model specifying a linear sequence of steps, namely: assess competency needs, specify competencies, determine competency components and performance levels, identify and implement competency attainment procedures, establish assessment of compentency attainment, and validate all system components. A functional analysis was performed on each of these steps. In the future it is hoped to eliminate a time-bound curriculum in the sophomore reproductive biology course and substitute a set of self-learning modules where students would learn content independently, using their own personal choices  of method of teaching.

Two questionnaires were designed for use in the study: a checklist to describe the current involvement of community colleges  in a foreign-student program; and an additional questionnaire using a Likert-type scale to identify the perceptions of the respondents. Five categories, including general policies and procedures, admissions, services, instruction, and cultural impact were studied. Data were collected from the 28 public community colleges in Florida during the spring term of 1973. The results of the study showed that although foreign students may not be actively encouraged to attend all of the Florida community colleges, there appears to be some agreement between attitudes and actual practices. Twenty of the colleges make reference in their catalogs to foreign students. Conclusions and recommendations are provided. The checklist of policies and procedures, the attitude questionnaire, and census information  relating to foreign students are given in appendixes. (Author/DB)",

Findings from this information system indicate that a significant proportion of the nonreturning student statistic has been due to intermittent enrollment, change in personal plans, and completion of personal objectives, rather than due to failure of the student or college. Such revised understandings of attrition have consequences in terms of measuring accountability, predicting  nonreturn, defining the community college dropout, and developing action programs and services to meet student attrition.

Questionnaires were sent to 1,150 public and private community and junior colleges, of which 40 percent responded. Nearly 90 percent of the responding colleges were public institutions. Sixty-three percent reported some type of institutional research, with 51 percent having formally organized research programs. Of the colleges reporting, 47 percent indicated institutional research budget increases. As compared with findings reported in an ERIC monograph, &quot;Junior College Institutional Research: The State of the Art,&quot; published in 1968, the research  categories popularity had changed in some instances. The category &quot;Students&quot; remained the most popular research interest; however, &quot;Curricula and Programs&quot; dropped from second place in the 1968 study to fifth place in the current study, with &quot;Instruction&quot; being the least popular category in both studies. In terms of research preference, there was little difference between past research activities and current projects, the most popular areas of research continuing to be students, student services, and institutional operations. Sixty-one percent of the colleges sometime involve their institutional research officers in important decisions, and 97 percent would like to exchange research ideas and methodologies. (DB)",

        "description":"A questionnaire survey was conducted to determine the amounts and types of interinstitutional cooperation, including the number of persons participating, that existed in Montana postsecondary education. The cooperative activities included consortia of educational institutions, faculty exchange, provisions for student exchanges and/or concurrent enrollment, articulation and transfer agreements, facilities sharing, other cooperative agreements, and joint degrees. In addition, the potential for such arrangements for improving economic and educational effectiveness was assessed. Results of the survey included the following findings: (1) three community colleges, the three private colleges, and the six units of the Montana University System participate in consortia; the five  vocational/technical centers frequently act as an informal consortia; (2) all of the institutions participate in various forms of facilities--sharing with state, local, and private agencies; (3) student transfer is probably the major point of contact between and among universities, colleges, community colleges, and vocational/technical centers; (4) there is little formal faculty exchange and sharing; (5) there are nine formal cross-registration and student exchange agreements. It is recommended that state-funds support of continuing education problems be studied, the concept of faculty sharing be expanded, exploration of avenues of cooperation be continued, and the problems of student articulation and transfer be undertaken on a formal or an ad hoc basis.

World Game is a means of engaging humanity's best intelligence on the situations and problems arising from living on Earth, and it is a means of ensuring that the intelligence and energy of wide ranges of people are engaged in the work. The experiment was conducted as a single course, rather than a full program of study, during each of three quarters of the school year. Results of the experiement showed that although there was only one instructor and about 60 students enrolled, the wide range of activities explored offered an opportunity to assess college and community reaction to the World Game studies. As an experiement to determine what kinds of preparation students need in order to  succeed in World Game activities, the program was extremely valuable. It was shown that a self-selected sample of community college students can learn the essentials of the basic concepts and then apply some of the methods of World Game to the study of their community and society. An appendix provides a Student Project Report for the fall and winter quarters of the course. (DB)",

Drawing on communication and decision making literature, the model relates time, action, and audience dimensions. The results of these relationships is labeled &quot;institutional study impact.&quot; Impact is viewed as the outcomes from a variety of audiences producing various actions over a longitudinal time period. A longitudinal case-study approach is the general research metodology used to implement the model. A variety of criterion measures and data collection instruments are used to insure an exhaustive and reliable assessment of the research-impact process. To provide a comprehensive analysis mechanism, a Research Impact Gram (RIG), adapted from the sociologists'  sociogram, which incorporates the time, audience, and action dimensions, is used. Other quantitative measures can focus on comparing attitudinal changes over time by audience type, and communication networks can be constructed as an aid in determining dissemination time estimates and communication links. Qualitative analysis can focus on the written and verbal feedback on the report's content, format, and significance. Decision making reactions can be categorized and labeled. Data analysis limitations inherent in the model are that measures become more unobtrusive as the audience goes from primary to tertiary; data become less reliable as the time dimension lengthens; and action becomes more difficult to assess when the behavior is either nonresponsive or rejecting.

Data were gathered by use of a questionnaire and guideline questions, as well as by supplementary information and materials furnished by the interviewees. Interviews were held with the person responsible for research in each college, as well as with other people in the colleges. Analysis of the data showed that: (1) the institutional research office of each college was organized as an  administrative unit; (2) the person responsible for research is at the director or coordinator level in the administrative structure; (3) the research office usually employs at least one professional person and one secretarial or clerical person, and there is a tendency to employ one or more technical or paraprofessional persons; (4) decisions to institute a research unit are made unilaterally at the presidential or president's cabinet level; (5) research project priorities are generally decided at the administrative level; (6) evaluation of the research project output has not been formalized; (7) research directors felt that too much research time was being diverted to nonresearch projects; (8) there was need for research designed to assist in the development of new instruction methods  and to assess the outcomes of instructional methodology; and (9) the release of data to the public through one office enhanced the image of the college with the public.

Regression analysis determined how well college achievement correlated with a composite of high school grades and ACT scores. Records of 48 students from September 1970 through June 1973 provided the data. The analysis resulted in a coefficient of correlation of r = .85 to provide a fairly high predictive measure.

        "description":"The academic-standards policy of the community college is often inconsistent with the open-door admissions policy. A large number of community colleges still used a fixed Grade Point Average (GPA) standard when determining academic standing. Would it not be sounder educational policy to use a developmental system of GPA requirements in determining probation and dismissal? A possible model for academic probation is: .80 by completion of 12 semester hours; 1.20 by completion of 24 semester hours; 1.50 by completion of 36 semester hours; 1.80 by completion of 48 semester hours; and 2.00 by completion of 60 semester hours. A student who falls below these standards would automatically be placed on scholastic probation until the next category of semester hours is reached. Only under  very unusual circumstances would a student be allowed to remain on probation for a third successive semester. Of what value is it, either to the student or to society, to admit a student who needs academic assistance and place him on probation before he has had time to become stronger academically? The community college cannot fulfill its philosophy properly if it does not feel free to develop techniques and policies that enhance its philosophy. (DB)",

A. C. C. Over 40 percent of the total number of fall entrants  earned a &quot;B&quot; average or above (50 percent for females) at the transfer institution; 15 percent earned below a &quot;C&quot; average (6 percent for females); (4) females' GPA for the fall 1972 entrants was 2.79, males 2.47, compared with respective L. A. C. C. GPA's of 2.59 and 2.45. Both groups improved their GPA at the state institution; and (5) transfers in the Schools of Letters and Science at the three local campuses averaged 2.6 or above; those in the Schools of Business averaged below 2.4; and the only group averaging below &quot;C&quot; (1.98) were seven Fine Arts transfers from Northridge.

Collective bargaining is primarily a community college phenomenon. Of 212 institutions with certified bargaining agents, 150 are 2-year institutions. Motivating factors in choosing the collective bargaining process are: the faculty fear of administration policies, the need for recognition, the size and complexity of the school organization, and job security. The demonstration has influenced the faculty's perception of collective bargaining as a means of achieving their objective. Increasingly, state legislatures are recognizing the right of public employees to bargain collectively, and faculties are utilizing this change in attitude to increase benefits  through organizing. Among the main dangers of faculty bargaining is the creation of an embattled and adversary climate that is a deterrent to program planning. To defend against this, administrators and legislators should try to understand and empathize with the forces and motivation present in faculty acceptance of unionization. (DB)",

A course, which involved 2 hours of instruction per week plus 1 additional hour of independent work, combined with educational/vocational counseling, was offered. Freshmen who ranked in the bottom 40 percent of their high school graduating class and whose SAT scores were below 800 with a verbal score below 400 were informed that a reading and study skills program was available. Of 82 students who met the criterion for course attendance, 41 enrolled and 33 completed the entire course. The students who did not attend were used as  a comparison group. Three studies were made to determine the immediate and relative effects of attending the course: a comparison of pretested data with posttest data obtained from three subscales of the Cooperative Reading Test; a comparison of the pretest data with the posttest data from the Student Attitude subscale of the Brown-Holtzman Survey of Study Habits and Attitudes; and a comparison of semester average, English grades, and frequency of failures between the experimental group and the control group. Results of the studies showed that the experimental group's semester average was significantly improved when compared with the control group, and benefits were realized as a result of the counseling experience.

A summary of Maslow's Needs Hierarchy, along with a description of the characteristics of the self-actualized person, is presented. An analysis of humanistic education reveals it has much to offer as a means of promoting the principles of self-actualization with students. The Personal Orientation Inventory, developed by Everett Shostrom, is an objective paper and pencil personality test that measures 14 different scales of self-actualization. This article reviews some of the relative research done with the POI on college students. A description of the POI and its scales is also offered. The heart of this article is an analysis of the POI results on samples of community college  students. POI data and profiles are presented for male and female vocational-technical Associate of Science degree aspirants and college parallel Associate of Art aspirants at Polk Community College. The students are also compared with a 4-year university freshmen sample. The t-test of significance reveals several interesting differences between the groups. The article concludes with a summary of the results and recommendations for implementation. (Author)",

It discusses the role of major social institutions on higher education policy and curriculum in carrying out these three major functions. The study reveals a major shift of influence from church to business, occurring in the late 19th century. It also shows government, labor, alumni, and philanthropic influences on higher education. A study of the influences affecting policy and curriculum at a Florida community college was undertaken. A questionnaire was mailed to the college vocational-technical advisory committee members who are community leaders in various vocational areas. In addition, the top 11 administrators were interviewed to  determine the source and extent of other community influences on curriculum and policy. Informal influences were found to be coming from public schools, churches, civic-social clubs, business, and various other groups and individuals. Recommendations to administrators concerning the improvement of relations between the community and college are given in the conclusion. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"Because state agencies have found that the licensing of family day care homes presents administrative problems which are quite different from the licensing of day care centers this report presents arguments against traditional licensing practices. Six alternatives are suggested for states making decisions about their future directions in family day care regulation: (1) Continue to license family day care, making some improvements in licensing statutes and procedures, and adopt one of four different models for registration which have been proposed by experts, which are: (2) registration as a form of licensing; (3) registration as directing regulation; (4) registration with required training of family day care mothers; and (5) simple registration. The final option (6) is to abandon  the effort to license or to register, but put the same effort into upgrading homes through nonregulatory methods such as support systems and education of the public. An incentive program for registration is deemed to be a necessary corollary to any chosen model, and a further refinement of each of the basic alternatives is suggested before a basis for uniform recommendations to the states can be made.

It is written to be used by an instructor who is working with preschool parents. The activities, which are designed to be uncomplicated and reasonable in cost and invested time, are grouped in 10 sections: (1) knowing the child; (2) what happens between parent and child; (3) setting goals for the child; (4) emphasizing everyday happenings; (5) reading to children; (6) using free and inexpensive materials for language experiences; (7) making the alphabet letters; (8) games that can be made at home; (9) writing down children's experiences; and (10) writing stories  with the child. Each of the sections contains directed activities to be performed with the instructor's guidance, at home activities involving the parent and child, and parent take-home sheets with information and exercises they can use to increase their own knowledge. Some benefits of the program are listed; the major expectation is that the activities will enhance a child's chances of success in the initial stages of learning to read and write. (SDH)",

The first part of the paper presents the goals, theory, and history behind CEP. Implementation of CEP learning labs for elementary school children in disadvantaged community areas is explained in terms of the financial assistance, administrative work, and community and institutional cooperation required. Children ranging in age from preschool through third grade attended these labs for a half-hour each day of the week. To make CEP a community program, community leaders were consulted, and several indigenous community residents were trained as  paraprofessional lab workers. Both the 1971 and 1972 evaluations of the program were affected by research or administrative problems, and the results are difficult to accurately define. The second part of the report analyzes the development of CEP. Topics discussed include: (1) the institution-building model; (2) general and specific goals; (3) working relationships and problems between CEP, its director and the school board officials, school staff, Model Cities Program, community and black leaders; (4) CEP leadership and internal structure; (5) resources; (6) personnel; and (7) conclusions.

This demonstration program sought to show that the principal cognitive element missing from the experience of low-income children in preparation for schooling is a sufficient amount of concept-building verbal interaction in the family, especially between mother and child. Four successive cohorts, entering in 1968, 1969, 1970, and 1971, in groups ranging from 70 percent to 100 percent black were enrolled in the program. The program consisted of 92 semi-weekly, half-hour home sessions spread over 2 years. These were held by interveners called 'Toy Demonstrators' who were trained to show a mother, by participating in home play sessions with her child, how to  interact verbally to enhance the child's conceptual and socioemotional development. Test results (Stanford-Binet and WICS, Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Reading and Arithmetic Standard Score on the Wide Range Achievement Test, and Child's Behavior Traits) for the four cohorts of children indicate that the program probably does work, within the context of the research project, with fairly substantial and stable IQ gains of about 17 points.

In this paper, factors are examined that in all probability affect the adult's success in maintaining sensible control and changing child behavior when it seems necessary to do so. Five such factors are: (1) the child's desire to please his parent, (2) parental use of praise and approval for good behavior, (3) parental use of reasons and explanations, (4) consistency in discipline and the effective timing of punishment, and (5) the fear of punishment. If parents and children are to live comfortably with each other, there must be give and take. Since the parent is the more mature of the parent-child pair, the parent must take the initiative in seeing to it that his or her  relationship with a child is vital, constructive, and rewarding.

The earliest vocalizations are discussed in terms of an acoustic communications model in which the baby's vocal repertoire becomes incorporated into a closed-loop, feedback system with his mother. Certain pre-lingual \"signals\" may be associated with those maternal actions which bring about a reduction in psychobiological stress, thus becoming one medium in which infant-mother attachments are formed. In order for a mother to determine a particular stressful state such as pain or hunger from the cry signal alone, crying would have to be acoustically distinctive to this state. To determine whether such distinctions exist, the vocalizations of twenty-two infants were tape-recorded under a  variety of stressful conditions: pain stimulus, startle, evidence of hunger, etc. An ensemble technique of spectral analysis was developed to show that relatively long intervals of crying in one infant may indeed exhibit an average spectrum which is acoustically distinctive to the type of pain stimulus and to hunger. Less clear is whether such distinctions also transpose to groups of infants in a similar stressful state. (Author)",

A degree of difference was noted favoring the experimental groups. An analysis of variance between the three  groups indicated a significant difference between both experimental groups and the control group. However, no significant difference was noted between the two experimental groups. The information gathered from the test results provided the teachers with data which enabled them to make meaningful and judicious decisions concerning the children's educational future. Early screening and identification can allow the kindergarten teacher to design a meaningful program and remediate the child's learning problems within the classroom setting. (Author/CS)",

The evaluation system described in this paper is a result of an intensive examination of the purposes and types of evaluation systems for their compatibility with the Piagetian assessment approach. The paper includes a brief description of the cognitive developmental program, the design and implementation of the evaluation system, and the types of information generated by the system and their utilization in the program. A hierarchy of developmental levels was derived from Piagetian theory and research, and these levels were used to guide the teacher in both activity presentation and formative data collection.  The computer-based evaluation system provided a mechanism of continuing feedback, and suggests a means for a more systematic and intensive study of the formation of cognitive operations in children. The system is expected to be of particular use in a careful study of such phenomena as transitional periods and/or horizontal decalage (eg. the effect of intervention programs on different cognitive operations during transitional periods.) The proposed evaluation system is believed to offer a significant contribution to Piagetian methodology and research and application of the theory in a variety of intervention contexts. (CS)",

In spite of similarities among the tasks with regard to perceptual salience of cues, ambiguity of stimulus situation, and problem solving set, performance on the tasks was independent over age. Also unreflected in these data is the synchronous development of class inclusion, multiplication of classes, and multiplication of relations reported by Inhelder and Piaget  (1964).

In order to develop such a social learning evaluation system one must: (1) organize the evaluation system around the progress and needs of the child, (2) identify the kinds of social learning behaviors to be assessed, (3) select evaluation approaches which are conducive to promoting pupil progress in social learning areas desired, and (4) design ways to communicate such progress to the child and the parents. The purpose of this kind of evaluation system is not to establish a mark to identify how effective the child is in comparison with his peers, but to assist the learner by establishing his progress and development in relation to desirable behavior. The  appendices contain three diagrams which provide examples of possible assessment techniques and evaluation forms. (CS)",

        "description":"This essay critically views the prescriptions of Jean Piaget and Lawrence Kohlberg concerning moral education within the public schools. Piaget's paradigm of the moral life is elaborated, and his prescriptive theories for the schools are presented. In contrast to Durkheim, Piaget argues that schools should resist adult-imposed moral rules whenever possible, and must not assume the responsibility for representing the values of the larger society. The author contends that the arguments of Piaget and Kohlberg lead to an educational sectarianism, which has the effect of encouraging an autonomous insensitivity to the way in which the political world works, and turns the school into an unrealistic isolate world. In addition, it is argued that Kohlberg's theories for moral education are  wholly within the framework of the liberal welfare model; that is, directed toward reducing the number and treatment of deviants through judiciary, police, welfare, and psychological services. The effect of Kohlberg's theses has been to compromise the radicalism of Piaget's initial logic. Piaget's American colleagues, as representatives of an educationally liberal tradition, find themselves in the paradoxical situation of attempting to affirm the basic soundness of present institutions, while at the same time striving to use as much of the sectarian, radical rhetoric as possible.

To accomplish these aims, 12 first-born female infants were tested in their homes every two weeks between the ages of 1 and 6 months. A total of eight visual, three kinesthetic and three auditory tests were administered. Thirteen behavior categories were observed during both the control and reaction periods. The two hypotheses formulated to guide the research are supported by the data presented in the three main sets of  results. These results show that: (1) imitation exists as early as 1 month of age but is limited to certain types of models; (2) these first imitative responses wane between 2 and 3 months of age; and (3) there is absence of imitative response during the first 2 months of life to some other types of models, (i.e. auditory) but once imitation to these models comes in, it increases with age.

This study is intended to explore mothers' perceptions of possible delegation of some basic child-rearing functions during the mothers' absence for employment. Comparison of the child care arrangements which the mothers saw as best able to carry each function, with the actual child care plans in use, and with other criteria such as parental convenience provide clues to dilemmas in child-rearing when the mother is employed. Structured interviews were held with 118 mothers whose children were involved in a &quot;supportive child care project&quot; or a &quot;by-home project.&quot; The supportive child care services provided emergency day care for children and parental  consultations. In the by-home project, care and transportation of children from infancy through age 14 were handled by a small group center near their home. Eight child-rearing functions were identified: (1) physical nourishment; (2) cleanliness; (3) safety from danger; (4) medical appointments; (5) preparation for the future; (6) provision of affection and love; (7) maintaining social contact between the children and their friends; and (8) providing good behavior examples. Results are reported in terms of parental choices for performance of the particular function. Choices included care in the home by relatives, non-relatives or self, out-of-home care by relatives or non-relatives, and group care by home or other facilities. (Author)",

The home visitor, a paraprofessional, helps the parent learn effective ways of instructing children. Television presentations, broadcast five days each week, are produced to achieve specific objectives derived from the curriculum, and the group experience is conducted by a group experience leader and is designed to achieve objectives  for a classroom type situation. Objectives are coordinated with home visit and television presentation objectives. (Author)",

Those individuals or boards who have the control of the schools should take the initiative to redefine the role and expand the mission of the neighborhood elementary school as a child development center.

Children with high object orientation were expected to be relatively advanced in organizing and classifying physical objects. In contrast, children with high people orientation were expected to be relatively advanced in social kinds of knowledge. Subjects used in the study were 38 white, middle class children; their mean age was 4 years and 10 months. Data were gathered from these sources: (1) observation of the children during a free play hour in nursery school; (2) four tests of knowledge of the physical environment; (3) six tests of social knowledge; (4) a sociometric measure of peer popularity; and (5) ratings on the  qualitative aspects of each child's play behavior. Findings indicated that object-oriented children did perform better on tests of ability to organize and classify physical materials. No relationship was found between people-oriented children and their social scores. Performance on the social tests was found to be related instead to greater popularity among peers and higher ratings on the quality of social behavior. In conclusion, two interactive models suggested by the results are discussed. (SDH)",

Each partner could move only one place at a time: towards his own goal (competitive moves), his partner's goal (cooperative moves) or sideways (neutral moves). After each pair had completed six trials of the game,  instructions were given which either stressed group orientation and deemphasized competitiveness or stressed individual orientation and competitiveness. Twelve additional trial games were then played. Results indicated that girls show a greater flexibility of behavior as a function of sex of partner or of instructions than boys do.

Research results imply that certain ways that parents interact with their children are more effective than others in aiding the development of a child's social, intellectual, and language abilities. In this connection, an overview and analysis of the Harvard Preschool Project study of the development of competence in young children is presented. Discussion centers around the following questions: Do the characteristics of competence occur in the same sequence in children of different cultures? Are these characteristics dependent on internal developmental structures similar to those that have been  theoretically described by Jean Piaget? How much attention should be given to studying the existence and importance of critical periods? Should parenthood be a licensed profession requiring special preparation? And how much influence should the state exercise in the family life of its citizens? (Author/CS)",

        "description":"To determine what child care arrangements are made by employed mothers, how much they spend for child care, and their potential use of other arrangements including day care, a study was conducted in the Pittsburgh area early in 1973. Included were four work settings which employ women in a variety of occupations. A structured questionnaire was mailed to 819 women workers: (1) white collar workers at two universities, (2) unskilled and professional workers in a hospital, and (3) semi-skilled workers in a food processing plant. The distribution of the responses to the questionnaire, an analysis of the factors affecting the mode of child care and the level of child care expenditures are included in this general description of the study and its findings. In general, the respondents  were satisfied with their current arrangements, but expressed support for government or industry-related child care arrangements which would be easily assessible and inexpensive.

The Parents Are Teachers Too Program (PTT) was offered for 12 weekly sessions at six day care centers in different Michigan cities. Three incentive conditions were operating: Incentive 1 paid a $5 stipend to each mother for each meeting attended; Incentive 2 provided babysitting and transportation for each meeting attended; and Incentive 3 provided no incentive other than the program itself. The principal dependent measure was maternal attendance at PTT sessions. Child self-esteem and the quality  of mother-child interaction were also measured. Results indicated that (1) There was significantly more attendance in incentive conditions 1 and 2; (2) incentive 1 initiated and maintained more attendance than Incentive 2; (3) there was significant positive change in child self concept in all conditions; (4) Children evidenced greater positive change in self concept in Incentive 3; and (5) No significant changes on mother-child interaction measures were evidenced based on incentives or attendance.

        "description":"In keeping with the trend toward greater parent participation in the education of their children, a preschool intervention program designed to improve the educability of children who would enter kindergarten at the start of a fall term was conducted in one elementary school. The major purpose of the project was to determine if mothers would accept the role of home teachers for their prekindergarten children on a regular basis, using school-prescribed tasks. A sample of 12 mothers and their children was studied. Mother-instruction was measured by a checklist that obtained information about the extent to which mothers engaged in teaching the prescribed activities at home. A teacher observation survey recorded ability of the child to perform supervised skill activities. It was found  that mothers in the program did show an active interest in school-home relationships, as evidenced by the regularity with which they accepted the role of home teacher. The pupils in the project, after entering kindergarten, were better adjusted socially and performed better in verbal expression than classmates who had not participated in the project. Based on findings in this program, it is recommended that the parent's involvement as home teachers be extended throughout the school career of their children. (Author)",

The importance of a mother substitute and a &quot;home away from home&quot; in which both preschool and school-age children are free to be themselves is emphasized. The key to an optimal relationship between the natural and day care parents is mutual cooperation, friendship and confidence. Each child has the greatest opportunity to develop emotional maturity if he is placed in a setting which respects and encourages his uniqueness. Flexibility of the day care mother can allow for unusual preferences, sick care and the provision of special adult and peer relationships. In addition, the entire home is an environment for learning, and the advantages of home care are evident in many areas of the child's developmental  growth. The individual characteristics of the family day care mother are also important; factors such as her time availability, emotional makeup, abilities, and belief in what she is doing are instrumental in determining the results of her care.

The project extended from July 1, 1952 to December 31, 1953 with field work confined largely from January to June 1953. Four study centers were selected: \"Glades\" area, Palm Beach County, Florida; Northampton County, Virginia; Seguin Independent School District, Guadalupe County, Texas; and Hoopeston-Milford-Rossville School Districts, Vermilion and Iroquois Counties, Illinois. Field work consisted of interviews with migrant families, teachers, principals, and other informed persons;  securing transcripts of the child's school records; and meetings and discussions with local groups. This report discusses the study; a migrant pupil testing program involving 428 children in the Florida study center; and a 6-week experimental school for migrant children near Waupun, Wisconsin during the summer of 1953. It also reviews other major studies on migrant education conducted since 1935. (NQ)",

        "description":"Implicit or explicit national governmental actions designed to perpetuate, change conditions, maintain the status quo, or introduce change (although not designed for that purpose) are known as policy. Some of these actions relate directly to population distribution from early land grants to present urban renewal and rural development activities. Others relating to agriculture, growth, and relocation of industries and government facilities, expansion of higher education opportunities, service in the armed forces, housing, and the widespread construction of transportation systems have had unanticipated impacts on population relocation. Shifts in demands for services have also resulted in population redistribution. When these occur, the government must consider their impact in  formulating policies; existing policies must be evaluated and their implementation mechanisms reassessed or new programs devised. Factors which should be considered are: (1) the numbers involved, (2) the locations affected, (3) the migrant's importance in his parent and host populations, and (4) characteristics of people which predispose them to require specialized services. In recent decades, the heavy movement of blacks out of the rural South has produced shifts in service needs. This outmigration effected compositional changes in both rural and urban populations, affecting the urban South, the urban non-South, and the rural South. The paper also examines some policy implications related to service needs caused by this movement. (NQ)",

        "description":"The paper addresses variations in the occupational and educational expectations of high school seniors from two geographic regions of the U.S. It gives particular emphasis to differences in the proportions with high expectations, to the relationships between those proportions and certain personal-social characteristics of the respondents, to respondents' perception of source of influence on occupational and educational decisions, and to respondents' perception of the attitude of their parents toward those decisions. The basic premise of the paper is that factors associated with geographic residency affect the behaviors and perceptions of residents. The contention is that geographic climatic and terrain imperatives, normative patterns associated with ethnic composition of the  population, expectation and perceptual sets developing from occupational and religious characteristics, traditions based on differing historical precedents, and similar factors will be reflected in actual behaviors as well as in attitudinal patterns. The 1970 North Carolina sample consisted of somewhat more than 3,000 respondents; that from North Dakota (1973) was a little more than one-third as large. Comparison of the total sample from each State shows that the proportion of the North Dakota sample with high educational and vocational expectation was slightly higher than in North Carolina. The difference was somewhat greater for vocational expectation, but in each case was sufficiently small that one need not attach much meaning to it. Thus, the differences tend to support the  contention regarding influence of socially derived consequences of geographic location. (KM)",

        "description":"Historical changes reflected in the educational goals of black and white high school seniors in 1966 and 1972 were compared. The five orientation dimensions studied were aspiration, expectation, goal deflection, goal certainty, and goal intensity. Data were collected in the four contiguous Northeast Alabama counties of Cherokee, DeKalb, Jackson, and Marshall. These counties, which corresponded most closely to traditional Appalachia, were mountainous, predominantly rural, and characterized by low incomes and poor living conditions. In 1966, the sample consisted of 924 students in 19 high schools. In 1972, 918 students in 15 of the original 19 schools comprised the sample. Questionnaires were group administered to all seniors. Among the findings were: (1) educational aspirations of  black and white boys were generally lower in 1972; (2) educational expectation levels of boys were generally lower in 1972 while female expectations were not; (3) rates of anticipatory goal deflection did not change greatly from 1966 to 1972; and (4) black boys and girls revealed more certainty about achieving their expected goal in 1972. Findings indicated that Northeast Alabama youth showed a rather consistent trend toward a lowering of their educational goals and a weaker value for education. Future historical comparisons were recommended to determine whether these changes represent merely a short-term trend or are more indicative of a long-term shift in societal values. The findings are presented in separate tables by sex for each of the five orientation dimensions. (NQ)",

Data originally collected by students' self-reports and administrative records for panel-designed researches at Stanford University (1958-1965) and the University of Oregon (1961-1967) were pooled for this study.

Major variables were rural-urban background, social class, measured intelligence, and academic performance. Results indicated that: (1) there are very slight rural-urban differences in high school and college performance regardless of sex and/or social class; (2) while neither rural-urban nor social class background is more important it is the combination of rural-urban background, social class, and sex that has more predictive potential; (3) the top one-third of the 12 types of achievers consists mostly of urban non-middle class female students while the lower one-third is composed of rural, middle class males; and (4) since college performance is influenced by college potential (which is affected by sex, class, and rural-urban background) selection effects are operative.

Two contentions pertaining to educational expectations have been that (1) the expectations of youth as a whole are rising, and (2) the traditional variance between rural and urban youth are depreciating. Based on data obtained from North Carolina high school seniors in 1963 and 1970, these contentions were investigated together with a number of indicator variable relationships. The sample consisted of about 1,200 students in 1963 and approximately 3,100 in 1970. The latter had a larger urban component and included a limited number of non-public school students. Data were presented on the assumption that observed differences in expectation between the 1963 and 1970 students result from  the influence of time and its associated variables. Some findings were: (1) 28 percent of the 1963 students indicated high educational expectations compared to 35 percent in 1970; (2) expectation was high in 1970 in all but one of the 14 comparisons; (3) expectation among black students in 1963 exceeded that of 1970; and (4) the ratio of difference in proportions of urban and rural residents with high educational expectations decreased slightly in 1970 although the gross expectation of urban residents remained substantially greater than that of rural respondents. Data gathered from about 1,000 high school seniors in North Dakota in spring 1973 are presented in the tables, but due to geographic and social variances are not used in time-sequence analysis of the North Carolina data.

Metropolitan (M), and nonmetropolitan (NM), and family structural type were controlled. Data were obtained from black families living in a Southeast Texas county (M), the county seat, and two small open-country villages in an East Texas county (NM). Interviews were conducted during the summers of 1970 (NM) and 1971 (M). The respondents were female homemakers not over 65 years of age and not under 18 (unless the mother of a household child) with children under 18 in the household. An overriding study limitation was the small number of disabled families in the two study units, thus making the findings on degrees of disability vs. degrees of interaction rather  tentative. Major conclusions were: (1) disabled families generally experience lower levels of internal family interaction; (2) no universal relationships exist between the degree of family membership disability and the degree of internal family interaction; (3) neither community nor family type significantly influence the impact of the incidence of family membership disability on the magnitude of internal family interaction; and (4) certain community and family types influence relationship between the degree of family membership disability and the degree of internal family interaction which are not universally observable.

Students, teachers, school personnel, and parents were questioned about tribal and formal education. It was found that so far San Juan has been the only pueblo to introduce bilingual and  bicultural studies into the elementary school. The others prefer to keep the tribal and formal educational systems departmentalized with tribal education in the kivas. Even though bilingual and bicultural studies have not been developed at Taos, Tesuque, Zia, and Zuni, Indian aids who speak the language of the pueblo have been hired to reinforce instruction. This paper also discusses the history, language, and educational and population statistics of the Pueblo Indians. (NQ)",

        "description":"The continuing transition of rural development from its old to present day form is discussed, treating varied perceptions of its goals and the continuing resolution of approaches through legislation and appropriations. Some of the goals are community development, human resources development, natural resources preservation, and a more equitable distribution of benefits. The rural development dynamics to accomplish these goals include appropriations, the projects developed by State Agricultural Experiment Stations, and community improvement research. The Rural Development Act of 1972, the first concrete legislative commitment for a joint research-extension effort toward solving rural development problems, includes programs for education, research, credit and other financial  assistance, and planning. The paper also cites some rural development crises--lack of organization of development efforts, the underdevelopment process and lack of alternatives (especially in relation to the land grant universities), food and energy shortages, and the depletion of natural resources. Overall, though, the assumption is made that despite a slow start and lack of strong viable support, rural development will continue as a program of interest and action for some time to come.

This 1970 cultural transition study investigates the processes of the acculturation of Mexican American (or Chicano) children to the prevailing white middle class sociocultural system in the U.S. The public school as a formal means of cultural transition is a particular focus and the Coyote Elementary School (fictitious name) as a subsystem of the multiracial and multicultural town of Hidalgo (also fictitious) is the site. The various chapters cover: (1) research problems and methodology; (2)  the sociocultural milieu of Coyote Elementary School; (3) social, cultural, religious, educational, and health institutions in Hidalgo; (4) an overview of Coyote Elementary School which generally focuses on services; (5) professional and human relations at the school; (6) teacher and staff attitudes toward Chicano students; and (7) a closer look at the school, which includes grade level organization, staff structure and organization, and teaching methods. Overall recommendations include the development of compensatory education programs for culturally different and low income children; institutional changes; and work on changing people's attitudes, values, and on creating a more humane society.

The first section of this 1973 Oregon Rural Manpower Report, planning, covers administrative organization, meetings attended during the year, and staff training programs. Economic developments include natural resources, energy, and trade. Employment and unemployment trends, comments from 21 local offices, and community development programs are also explained. Services for rural people cover Volunteer Rural Manpower  Representatives, Seasonal Offices in &quot;rural&quot; and &quot;urban&quot; counties, the Central Oregon Functional Economic Area Project and the Cooperative Rural Manpower Project--Operation Hitchhike. Rural manpower programs and activities for farmworkers examine local recruitment programs, inter-area recruitment, and farm labor contractors. Problems remain in monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of operations and service delivery, however, because of the difficulty in obtaining information in regard to the Secretary of labor's 13 Points. The extensive tables include such things as argicultural activities, wages, and crops. (KM)",

This paper examines Title I of the Act, which transformed and amended the Consolidated Farmers Home Administration Act of 1961 to encompass more rural development programs, and added major new loans and grants for rural industrialization. An overview of rural industrialization research examines the economic, community, and agricultural effects of this development, consistently indicating that industrialization does produce more jobs in the nonagricultural sector of the economy. Several studies also report, though, that only a small number of the jobs are filled by unemployed local persons;  most are taken by people from outside the area. Rural industrialization guarantees very little in terms of overall community improvement, and, because of the quantity of small towns (there are about 300 in Missouri alone), answers for most communities must come from other sources. More than anything else, the need in rural development acts is for a far more critical analysis of the legislation before it is passed. (KM)",

        "description":"The social and cultural distance between the schools serving American Indian children and their communities has been viewed as the source of many of the basic problems in Indian education. In 1968 the Hopi Indian Tribe of Arizona instituted a Follow Through Program to provide for such parental involvement in their schools' educational processes. This study looked at how Hopi parents defined formal education and the school and how that definition was affected by participation in the school program via Follow Through. Between 1970 and 1972 studies were made of Hopi attitudes toward formal education utilizing participant observations and semi-formal interviews. P. T. A. meetings, classrooms, teachers' and principals' meetings were observed. Using a standard questionnaire, 178  parents were interviewed. As a result of Hopi-Anglo interactions within the school context for the past 100 years, Hopi parents degined the schools as Anglo institutions where their children are sent to learn Anglo skills, especially English. Parental involvement via the Follow Through Program did not significantly change his definition because the program, designed and implemented from without the community, tended to reinforce and perpetuate the basic patterns of Anglo-Hopi interactions.

        "description":"The extent to which the social maladjusted female role among the Eastern Band of Cherokees is a consequence of cultural ambivalence is investigated. The 28 problem families were examined in light of the adolescent/accommodative perspective whereby Federal paternalism is viewed as perpetuating a dependent adolescent behavioral life style among marginal Cherokees caught between two unobtainable cultural objectives: the traditional conservative harmony ethic vs. the dominant protestant ethic. The cultural identity problem is greater for the marginal Cherokee female than for her male counterpart. For men, cultural ambivalence takes the form of overtly aggressive behavior; for the female, there is a tendency to resort to sexual activity, which in turn enhances her biological role  model. This subsequently results in early pregnancies, unwed mothers, premature marriages, and early divorces as well as child neglect, a situation made more significant by the matrilocal and matrilineal Cherokee family pattern. The marginal female, although having greater access to physical stigma resulting from social failure, has less of a chance to escape the anomic situation prevalent on the reservation, resulting in a continuation of these problems that are primarily transmitted through the primary family setting.

It is also possible to characterize change activities in terms of positions along 2 sets of dimensions (vertical and horizontal) on which these approaches differ. The goals and structure of the People Mobile Project, which was conducted in Chenango County, New York, are summarized and the project is analyzed in terms of the 2 sets of dimensions.  Some conclusions are suggested based on this analysis. Two of these are (1) the need for a new role--the \"community support worker\" and (2) the need for anti-poverty action on the State and national, as well as local levels. (Author/NQ)",

The proposed plan provides the rationale and activities necessary for accomplishing this, trying to eliminate the incompatibilities between the school and the minority children. The plan proposed was based on the Cardenas-Cardenas Theory of Incompatibilities, which attributes the poor school performance of minority and disadvantaged children to an incompatibility between the characteristics of these children and those in typical instructional programs. Five incompatibility areas are: poverty, culture,  language, mobility, and societal perceptions. Since these are so interrelated, the program incorporated the principles of (1) interrelatedness and interdependence and (2) adaptability. It outlines the elements of school activity which must be adopted: educational philosophies, policies, scope and sequence, curriculum, staffing, co-curriculum activities, student personnel services, noninstructional needs, community involvement, and evaluation.

        "description":"Educators' main concern in 1956 is with teaching in small communities rather than exclusively with teaching in one-teacher schools. The modern rural school is likely to be one which serves an entire community, usually including a hamlet, village, or small-town center and the surrounding open country area. Yet, the school tends to be small (about 64 percent of all school districts have fewer than 10 teachers and about 11 percent have 40 or more). Written for teachers who serve small communities, the Department of Rural Education's 1956 Yearbook focuses on problems encountered by teachers in small schools throughout the United States. Emphasis is upon practical approaches to these problems, although it is recognized that no solution to one teacher's problem can be transposed to  another situation. The solutions are based on the assumptions that (1) good learning experiences utilize and grow from the child's own environment; (2) education is more effective when directed toward the improvement of living; and (3) it is important that the school program be sufficiently flexible and varied to allow each child the opportunity to grow to his maximum capacity. Also included are a 53 item annotated bibliography and the roster of the Department's active members for the calendar year 1955 and those enrolled prior to April 1956, listed alphabetically by States.

        "description":"The traditional dichotomies of urban and rural may no longer be valid. Investigating whether or not there are socially significant areal units to redefine rural and urban areas, the report described one attempt to delineate such units and to test them for sociological utility. Counties were placed in homogeneous social units based upon the characteristics of the resident population. The methods utilized were termed &quot;factor ecology&quot; and the phenomenon chosen for the test of social utility was selected patterns of migration. The latter choice was arbitrary; the emphasis herein concerned methods and their verification. The areas tested -- 208 counties in Missouri and Nebraska -- were for experimental purposes only, but they did represent a broad range of socioeconomic conditions.  The process used 8 steps: (1) determine the relevant variables that describe each county's population; (2) subject these to factor analysis; (3) from step 2 obtain the factors and significant variables for each factor; (4) determine the index score for each factor for each county through the use of factor loadings; (5) standardize the index scores; (6) divide the standardized scores into quartiles; (7) delineate the counties into homogeneous, non-continuous social units based upon the quartiles; and (8) test the resulting areal units by comparing them with areal units formed through analysis of migration patterns.

        "description":"In numerous midwestern industrial cities, the greatest influx of rural urban migrants is from the southern Appalachia region. The migrant mountaineer comes from a rural way of life which emphasizes individualism, traditionalism, self-reliance, and strong loyality to an extended family peer group. In the urban environment, the migrant finds himself in a culture that is time-oriented, organization conscious, and where peer groups develop from casual relationships. Many eventually adjust; a significant number, however, are unable to make the transition. Students and school personnel from 3 urban junior high schools in Cincinnati (Ohio) were interviewed. Appalachian students were identified by county of birth. The 8th grade Appalachian migrant student is approximately 13 1/2 years  old, and probably was born in a southern Appalachian county. His family migrated to the city the year before he entered kindergarten, and he has attended at least 2 elementary schools prior to enrolling at the junior high level. His attitude toward school is neutral. He has average grades and attendance patterns; however, he normally will not participate in extracurricular activities. A model that would make urban schools more relevant to the Appalachian student includes 4 phases of growing involvement -- awareness, research, support, and action. (KM)",

All seven districts decided to use a bilingual Spanish-English reading approach beginning at the kindergarten level. In September 1973 the program was expanded to include first grade students who were in the kindergarten program. Consequently, the 1973-74 program included 43 first grade classrooms; total enrollment was approximately 1,100 in the first grade and 1,000 in kindergarten. The bilingual materials were the first and second year materials from a sequential, 3-year Elementary and Secondary Education Act program designed for Mexican American children with little or no knowledge of English. A revised administrative procedure for tracking  the achievement and progress of students in each classroom was developed and implemented for 1973-74. The project staff designed three charts for teachers to use to track individual progress and achievement: (1) the Oral English Classroom Record Sheet; (2) the Spanish Reading Classroom Record Sheet; and (3) the English Reading Classroom Record Sheet. The various objectives for the different levels are given, with tables presenting the achievement results for the year. (KM)",

The main purpose was establishing educational continuity through interstate cooperation. The study involved migrant students in grades K-6 from Texas (a home base State) programs who arrived in the Indiana (a receiving State) programs. A systematic search for a viable population was made and a research design generated; but because of poor crop conditions in Indiana, the Texas target group did not appear in sufficient numbers to actualize the research plan. The new project goal was to introduce the criterion referenced approach into several Indiana cooperative migrant education programs to determine the type of problems encountered from a variety of  sources. Migrant programs in Elwood, Walton, and Converse administered the Criterion Reading materials to their students and reported teachers' perceptions. Some findings were: (1) overall the teachers' response to this approach was positive and (2) most highly valued were the materials' diagnostic nature as well as the concept of educational continuity and visible evidence of progress made possible through this approach. Many Indiana teachers felt that initiating the tests was time consuming in a short term program and that more teaching could be spent with the children if the tests were instituted at the home base State.

Its curriculum reflects the problems of the surrounding area Educational activities of both children and adults are often organized around the school. The school program becomes the community program as teachers, administrators, and parents work together to better life for all. Where the quality of living is being improved, the school program is based on the principles that (1) good learning experiences utilize and grow from the child's own environment; (2) education is more effective when directed toward the improvement of living; and (3) it is important that the school program be sufficiently flexible and varied so each child may have the opportunity to grow to his maximum  capacity. The Department of Rural Education, National Education Association, requested descriptions of good rural community school developments from selected persons in the United States and other countries. The descriptions in this 1960 publication, designed to familiarize rural educators with some rural community school practices, are from the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Libya, Jordan, Norway, Australia, Israel, Bolivia, Egypt, and the United States. They pertain to living standards, school curriculums based on needs and resources, adult education, colleges, teacher education, government agencies, and cooperative planning for school and community improvement.

A tri-racial group of male and female interviewers from Robeson County, North Carolina (locus of the research) mostly questioned respondents of their own race. Pre-interviews determined eligible females and couples (females had to be between 18 and 49 and if without a spouse, have at least  one child) and their race. The 695 interviews examined the total number of live births, family size preferences, and socioeconomic status. Data were analyzed, for the most part, using descriptive statistical measures (e.g., the arithmetical mean and percentage distributions). Control variables considered major variants were race, age, socioeconomic status, years married, and age at first marriage. Survey results were presented for the total sample and for various subgroups. Some findings were: (1) 73.4 percent of the wives approved of family planning; (2) when race is controlled, more whites approved of family planning than blacks; and (3) more blacks approved than Indians.

        "description":"The paper examined occupational projections and orientations of an American Indian group, the Mississippi Choctaws. Two related problems currently facing the tribe are the low educational and skill levels of its population and persistently high unemployment rates. In 1973, permission was granted to study the occupation and residential aspirations and expectations of 133 students in Choctaw Central High School, the only high school for Choctaws in the State. Since the cultural and socioeconomic background of the Indians may cause their occupational status hierarchy to vary from that of the larger society, the study was expanded to include the &quot;general standing&quot; of occupations among the Indians. Data analysis suggested that student aspirations were limited by locally visible and  relevant jobs and occupations that other Choctaws have attained. Findings also indicated that, while almost all Choctaw youths aspired to occupations which have high or moderate status within their own subsociety, many of these rank substantially lower by standards of the larger society. This suggested that researchers should take the possibility of variant occupational perceptions into consideration in assessing the occupational aspirations and expectations of minority youths. They further suggest the need for an examination of the prestige assigned to occupations by isolated populations. (KM)",

        "description":"Teachers on Indian reservations or in Indian communities are a specific homogeneous group since they teach the same minority group, live in a specific but often different area, and function in a cross-cultural situation. This study examined teachers of the Papago Reservations and delineated obvious differences between them. Profiles are given for Bureau of Indian Affairs teachers, teachers in the Indian Oasis School District, and all teachers as a whole. Initial contacts were made with the superintendents of the respective groups; 100 percent of the Bureau staff and 90 percent of the county respondents were sampled. Social distance between the teachers and Indians as an indication of community integration could not be measured by this questionnaire. Responses to the question,&quot;American Indians have made major contributions to American society&quot; were positive for both groups at a 90 percent frequency. There are 2 possibilities that account for these answers: (1) many may have answered by reaction rather than by considering the question and answers; or (2) the consideration that, for the Indian to have a valid culture, he must somehow show how it relates and contributes to American society. If these are correct, then there are important implications for Indian education. If teachers are going to work with Indian problems and carry with them the assumption that the Indian must somehow relate to American society as a whole, the possibilities of negative consequences are greatly increased.

        "description":"The report examined the American Indian dropout rate for the fall semester, 1973-74, at Ft. Wingate High School (FWHS) in Gallup, New Mexico. For that period, the FWHS dropout rate was 26 percent, compared to a national average of about 25 percent (FWHS) statistics are for one semester; national statistics are for an entire year). Dropouts were defined as students who had enrolled in the Federal boarding school and later withdrew without completing a full year. Reasons for leaving were: (1) illness, (2) transferred to another school, (3) did not return from home leave, and (4) some kind of trouble. A questionnaire was developed and sent out to each of the identified dropouts, with a 35.4 percent return rate. Section A asked reasons for withdrawal, covering health; absence;  parental influence; dorm conditions; and trouble with police, other students, or at home. The major reasons for dropping out were: (1) sent home for drinking or AWOL (17.2 percent); (2) stealing in dorms (16.6 percent); and (3) missed too many days. Things the respondents liked most about FWHS were counselors (92.7 percent), teachers (91.2 percent), and activities (90.6 percent). Things disliked most were other students (30.9 percent) and dorm staff (28.8 percent). Activities and classes were felt to be the best things about Wingate High School; drinking and stealing in the dorms were the worst. (KM)",

During 1973-74 (REPSAC's third year of operation), twenty-nine 3, 4, and 5 year old low birth weight children handicapped by physical difficulties, learning aptitude, perceptual and motor problems, language handicaps, and economic, cultural, and education deprivation participated at Clovis, New Mexico. The program was divided into comprehensive components: instructional, staff development, community-parental involvement, and  media development. The evaluation design that assessed REPSAC's effectiveness used pre- and posttests. The abilities measured were: learning aptitude, language development in English and Spanish, sensory and perceptual development, speech development, school readiness, and psychomotor development. A periodic subjective evaluation of the students' self concept, observations, and interviews was also conducted. Some major findings were: students made significant gains in language ability in English and Spanish, sensory and perceptual ability, school readiness, and psychomotor development; students developed and maintained a favorable self-image; and parents maintained a positive attitude toward the program.

        "description":"The Humboldt County Grand Jury (1973-74) examined the attitudes of high school youths toward law enforcement in the California county. Since these are sensitive indicators of their attitudes toward authority in general, results should not be interpreted as being exclusively relevant to law enforcement. The study covered a 4 month period, sampling 671 advanced level high school students from 5 schools. The first phase surveyed student attitudes toward law enforcement officers; the second investigated the relation of student adjustment patterns to these attitudes. To identify sources of rating variations, students were divided into subgroups by sex, school attended, parents' income level, and racial group (American Indian and Anglo). Ratings of law officers are also influenced by  the broader, perhaps more stable, personal and social attitudes (alienation and authoritarianism). There was a significant relationship between the respondent's degree of alienation and evaluations given law officers. Success within the school society depends primarily upon acculturation, which by and large means conformity to an implicit model of social behavior and personal conduct and compliance to the will of the teachers. Those students who are the most &quot;culturally different&quot; from the white middle class model, in this case Native Americans, suffer most and achieve least. The report emphasized that differences in achievement levels are not caused by differences in ability to learn, but rather are the consequence of the interaction of the students' cultural backgrounds with the school  system.

High priority areas included the improvement of social services delivery and the increased participation of low income families in the economic, social, and political life of the county. The need for the Peoplemobile was suggested by the field staff and confirmed by research studies during the first year. It appeared that the persons most in need of help -- the rural poor -- were being helped the least. Therefore, the project staff obtained a used schoolbus and staffed it with college-age summer assistants with special areas of expertise (e.g., services offered by  different agencies). The Peoplemobile took its first trip in June 1971, providing information to approximately 200 individuals or families. Overall, the evaluation of the project concluded that the Peoplemobile should be continued. Also, the project found evidence to suggest that: (1) there is need for a bridge between the rural poor and the agencies; (2) low income people sometimes need support in dealing with their problems; (3) low income persons need help, particularly legal, in clarifying their problems; and (4) the problem of helping agencies help the rural poor is an urgent and complex one.

Seventh grade Environmental Life Science is lab-oriented and based on a variety of student experiences. Course objectives are presented as well as the course outline. A multitext approach, with a suggested textbook list, is organized on reading ability level. The Earth Science Course, grade eight, focuses the attention of the student on the physical world in which he lives. Instructional materials suggested include films, filmstrips, and reference books and publications. The ninth grade curriculum exposes students to many physical science areas as well as a basic background for physics and chemistry students. A Materials List suggests texts and  experiments that could be incorporated into the program. The major objectives of Biology I, the course content and supplementary materials are built around the BSCS green and yellow versions, an ecological approach. Supplementary materials include lab exercises, field exercises and films. Included in the chemistry curriculum are plans for an academic chemistry section and a terminal science section. Cotton and Lynch's &quot;CHEMISTRY: An Investigative Approach&quot; is used for academic students and Metcalfe, Williams, and Castka's MODERN CHEMISTRY, for the non-academic course.

        "description":"In the first chapter Brownell critically examines the psychological bases of the three most common theories of arithmetic instruction: drill, incidental learning, and meaning. In chapter 2 the results of a nation-wide survey of actual teaching practices are reported. Chapter 3 presents a contrast between \"informational arithmetic\" and \"computational arithmetic.\" In chapter 4 \"social utility\" is defined much more broadly than just \"computationally useful,\" and implications for arithmetic instruction are discussed. Following this is a survey of opportunities for use of arithmetic in an activity program, with specific examples. Chapter 6 discusses practices in the teaching of fractions and decimals, followed by the report of a study on transfer by Overman. Reported in chapter 7 are  the results of a survey on current practices in teacher-training courses in arithmetic. Two chapters are devoted to transfer of training in arithmetic and types of drill; using these as a basis, David Eugene Smith expounds on the past, present, and future of instruction in arithmetic. In chapter 11 arithmetic is considered from a mathematical viewpoint as contrasted to a pedagogical viewpoint. Next Gestalt psychology is discussed, with implications for mathematics teaching. The last chapter compares the efficiency of different methods for division. (LS)",

Next comes a survey of the educational situation with particular emphasis on the reorganization of secondary mathematics instruction. Chapter 3 presents arguments for the value of mathematics instruction for logical thinking, especially in geometry courses. The role of undefined terms, postulates, propositions, and theorems is discussed, and the example of a mathematical structure, the field, is presented. The next two chapters present discussions of the contribution of mathematics to civilization and to education, respectively. Stressed in chapter 6 is the idea that the educational value of mathematics is the  central point of the pedagogy of mathematics. Mathematics is related to science and to art in the next article, with numerous applications suggested.

No textbook was used, and students were given much individual responsibility. Much work was devoted to studying the use of logical arguments in nonmathematical situations. Chapter 4 summarizes much of the geometric content studies in the course. Chapter 5 is devoted to evaluation, which consisted  of tests, evidence of transfer to other situations, and reports by pupils, parents, teachers, and other observers.

The papers are written by geography teachers at the secondary level with the purpose of creating units of instruction, designing pupil activities, and locating suitable classroom and laboratory materials. A way in which the geographic method of inquiry can be applied to problems within the student's environment, a demonstration of how students develop an understanding of scale, a unit of study in physical geography, a regional approach to geography, and an exercise in problem solving related to food production, are topics of the first five papers. Changing attitudes on  the part of the professional geographer, the classroom teacher, and the high school student involved in the projects are reported while the major challenges and responsibilities confronting those concerned with upgrading geography in secondary schools are observed in the next two papers. Finally, a guide to future participants in the Project comments on the structure of geography with reference to geographic fact, spatial distribution, and areal association. (Author/KSM)",

While these objectives are accepted by educators, the curriculum established for their achievement is widely criticized, resulting in new teaching strategies, approaches, methods, and curriculum materials which have been developed to accomplish the old goals as well as the new objectives made necessary by demands of a more complex society. The history, criticisms, and reform of political science education are  discussed in this paper.

The following conclusions, however, are drawn from the data: religion is the most important source of orientation; experiences gained at school are second with emphasis on teacher's impact; the peer group is of next importance;  the minister is fourth; mass media is fifth; and the family plays no significant role with respect to this issue. Open-ended questions about war and peace elicit responses of frustration and aggression, a conventional view of war, the passive nature of peace, and general pessimism about obtaining peace. Tables of data, a sample from the questionnaire, and a bibliography complete this report. (JH)",

It is divided into sections on the nature of art, elements of art, and movements and trends in the world of art. Materials direct the teacher toward important events and concepts, useful exercises, and pertinent points for student development. The material, illustrated by student art and reproductions, is not intended as the substance of lectures but as an outline of areas of emphasis to be used by both student and teacher in the development of a flexible course based on a theme or principle of their choosing. A visual diary of information and observations to help the student become visually sensitive and a portfolio of the student's work are kept as indications of  student performance. The course is predicated on the availability of a studio and on access to genuine works of art. At the least, an atmosphere of art, within the working environment is mandatory as is the presence of an artist as teacher, Sources of materials from museums and commercial producers are listed at the end of the guide, as are literature references pertinent to the study of movements and trends in art.

The report contains selected characteristics of research from a considerably longer list in the original report which is the third in a related series of investigations in which the characteristics of federally funded social research are assessed. Objectives of the study for NIE were to develop an instrument to  assess the methodological quality of the research component of proposals; describe the substantive issues of proposals; determine issues removed and retained at each step of the NIE review process; relate proposed characteristics of the research component; and assess systematic preferences in the NIE proposal review process in terms of the review process used by Minnesota Systems Research, which conducted the project.

The statement is intended to serve as a guide to the Education Department as it plans programs to carry out the Regents' goals and policies, and as a possible starting point for development of goals and programs by schools and other educational agencies. The Regents expect that the discussion and actions stimulated by this paper will lead to a higher degree of goal realization for all students in the State. The 10 goals listed include the following: (1) mastery of the basic skills of communication and reasoning; (2) ability  to sustain lifetime learning; (3) ability to maintain one's mental, physical, and emotional health; (4) understanding of human relations; (5) competence in the processes of developing values; (6) knowledge of the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences; (7) occupational competence; (8) knowledge and appreciation of our culture; (9) understanding the processes of effective citizenship; and (10) knowledge of the environment.

        "description":"To explore goals for economics education and ways in which these goals might be improved, reconciled, and consolidated, a Delphi-like inquiry among more than 200 economics educators, economists, businessmen, other social scientists, and educational administrators was undertaken. Statistical data and comments as to respondents' views expressed in one questionnaire was relayed back to them with a successive questionnaire. The process was repetitive for the purpose of eventually developing a composite opinion shared by the respondents in the light of reactions of others. Key findings of the inquiry, considered important guides for more effective economics education, are that the goals of economics education differ widely, both within and among the groups surveyed and that  respondents arrived at a general concentration on one or another of three possible goals. The need for the inquiry, its process, and findings are discussed. Recommended actions deal with specification of goals, explanations to business interests and educational administrators, and implications to trainers of teachers of social studies. Exhibits include four questionnaires and responses. (Author/KSM)",

The data most frequently presented in these studies concern types of schools surveyed, length and level of courses offered, students enrolled in courses and their grade levels, teacher characteristics such as hours of college background in psychology, and textbooks used. A concluding article, &quot;High School Psychology in the Pre-CPCP Questionnaire,&quot; discusses a standardized questionnaire to be developed by the American Psychological Association Committee on Pre-College Psychology  (APA-CPCP). The usefulness of such a questionnaire is suggested by the disparity among items sampled in the independently organized state surveys, exemplified by the seven status reports. A further impetus for the questionnaire is the funding by the National Science Foundation of the APA's Human Behavior Curriculum Project for Secondary Schools which will require accurate and complete information on pre-college psychology.

The following evolutionary levels of conceptualization are suggested; Asia as (1) a setting for Western history, where Western events take place under foreign and exotic skies; (2) a problem in American foreign policy, recognized because of its potential effect on our lives; (3) a Westernzing area, as opposed to stereotyped concepts of the exotic and impoverished East; (4) comprised of our brothers, or the &quot;we are all human approach&quot;; (5) studied with the comparative social science process approach to country; (6) an area with cultural uniqueness; (7) a region with  forms, patterns, and outlooks to be ingested into our own system of thought and behavior. An evolutionary framework--from nonrecognition of Asia to acceptance on Western terms and finally to learning how to think from an Asian point of view--allows the teacher to take himself and his students from one level to the next, starting from whichever level is appropriate. Viewed as a process of consciousness raising, teaching about Asia provides room for growth for both student and teacher. (JH)",

        "description":"This paper outlines some of the values that make the High School Geography Project (HSGP) useful in other cultural settings, describes some of the current developments in other countries, and illustrates the utility of the project by following one activity through four &quot;transformations.&quot; Most countries fall into one of three categories of trends in geographic education: (1) those updating the content of traditional courses, (2) concerned with the reform of teaching methods within traditional frameworks, and (3) concerned with improved methods and new course structure for mass education. The six distinctive teaching approaches used in HSGP--openers, concept developers, skill development, simulations, inquiry techniques, valuing processes--have their maximum utility in the third  category of countries. Simulations produced in West Germany, Israel, Brazil, and Hong Kong acknowledge the Portsville game from HSGP as the source of their ideas. The obvious utility in other countries of the HSGP teaching approaches suggests that a future direction for geographic education lies in a concrete &quot;place&quot; component. (Author/JH)",

It is divided into four sections with commentary preceding the listings of books and journal articles pertinent to particular topics. In the first section, A Rationale for a Pluralistic Society, the commentary traces historic concerns for Americanizing the citizenry and makes a plea for recognizing that cultural pluralism is indeed desirable. Part 2, Evidence of Ethnic Bias in Instructional Materials, describes and documents the evidence of such bias. Part 3, Efforts to Change, includes an essay describing proposed solutions, projects, and programs and an indicative rather than comprehensive documentation of such  efforts. The fourth part, Resources for Educators, includes comments on a wide variety of information sources from bibliographies selected for children to provide background which will help teachers sharpen their understanding of our cultural diversity. The fifth and final section, Evaluation Your Textbooks for Racism, Sexism, contains a practical guide for evaluation of instructional materials with reference to racism and sexism. (JH)",

Language, reading, science, social studies, and mathematics texts were evaluated. Blatant sexism is found in all areas. Different ideas of behavior and mores are propagated for boys than for girls; words and pictures imply that men act in radically different ways from women, and that this difference is normal, natural, and socially valuable; males are encouraged to acquire a wide variety of skills and achievements, while the energy of the female population is directed into the kitchen and obstetrics ward. Among the recommendations are the following: (1) textbook departments and committees should pressure textbook publishers and  demand meaningful constructive inclusion of more females as soon as possible; (2) librarians and teachers should be provided with bibliographies that include books presenting girls or women in a favorable manner; (3) libraries should be provided with as many books of this type as possible, and teachers should be urged to have all pupils read them, not just girls. A list of the books evaluated is included. (Author/RM)",

Objectives of the core study are application of economic concepts to current events, feedback through regular testing, individual consultation, optional \"work\" sessions, and team teaching from the two instructors. Activities include case studies, a macro game analysis, and analysis of newspaper articles. The 4 weeks of individual options include tutorial sessions, an enrichment course complementary to the core materials, a seminar on wage-price controls, and individual projects related to a student's major interest. Research analysis of  the course focuses on the relationship between student attitudes, cognitive success, and various student characteristics. Students perform well on all types of tests and feel that they learn a great deal. The teacher's role is significantly different but very satisfying.

A liberating education addressing these factors and centering in social studies, but characterizing an entire school, should include: (1) training in learning how to learn; (2) content devoted to human and self-understanding; (3) involvement of students in cultural and social  goals; (4) population education; (5) environmental education; (6) peace education; (7) familiarity and involvement in political and social action; (8) an interdisciplinary approach; (9) future studies; and (10) a global orientation.

The Clark Teaching and Learning in Graduate Geography Project views teaching and research as the same process looked at from different points of view. It includes a module entitled Geographic Ways of Knowing, a module dealing with teaching strategies, and a practicum. Assessment of all the programs will be directly related to the follow-up experience of the various participants. (JH)",

The program, co-directed by a graduate student and faculty member, is available to all graduate students on a voluntary basis and consists of three levels of training over a 3-year period. Training may be entered at any level with financial support provided to all participants not receiving support as teaching assistants; credit is offered but does not count toward degree requirements. The first level of training consists of methods, problems, and theory of instruction with observation and assistance to second level trainees who teach laboratory and discussion sections for  lower-division geography courses. At the third level trainees participate in team-teaching with a faculty member or teach as an independently supervised intern at a local college. The benefits to undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty in better trained instructors and greater student/instructor contact are obvious. A prospectus of activities and resources for the 1973 program are included. (JH)",

Participants in the training institute wer chosen to represent diverse ethnic and cultural groups in our society. The model consisted of three components: (a) the use of the trainees' local data as a vehicle for  inservice research training in design, data processing, statistics, and evaluation report writing; (b) the clustering of trainees from different educational programs with similar objectives to facilitate the offerings of local siminar groups and to provide mutual support for the trainees and gathering of data that has generalizability to other school systems; and (c) the incorporation, within the research process, of sensitivity to the black and other minority prospectives.

In order to isolate those attitudes and behaviors that seemed to be important for successful performance in the program, data were obtained from students who had completed the program. These data were synthesized and presented in the form of a 31-item instrument, which was designed to reflect student self-assessment.

Accountability means the &quot;improvement of instruction,&quot; and the key to the accomplishment of the improvement of instruction is improved teacher effectiveness. The truly effective teacher fosters total student development while teaching the basic content of the curriculum. Good assessment programs and meaningful inservice training for teachers are necessary for the improvement of instruction and teaching effectiveness. Accountability relates to everyone connected with public education. Students are required to attend school on a regular basis in compliance with the Compulsory Education Law. Parents are accountable for their children's attendance and should also  be consulted when their children are not achieving. Parents are also responsible for making their opinions and priorities known to the school. Teachers have always been accountable to their students, parents, supervisors, and ultimately, the school board. Administrative and instructional support personnel are accountable to students, parents, teachers, boards of education, and the public, while the board of education is responsible to the public for establishing priorities for the expenditure of public monies.

Demand for teachers in the state of Connecticut will decrease from about 2,300 per year to about 1,300 per year by 1980 and will continue to shrink the next 4 years to about 1,200 in 1984. Connecticut presently produces about 5,000 to 6,000 new teachers each year, and many who qualified in previous years are competing for the same jobs. Students are already turning away from the study of teaching, and enrollment will certainly drop 30-40 percent in the next 3 years, but the oversupply of new teachers will probably continue for many years.

Activities included a pretest, a review of individual pretests as well as a group comparison, and a posttest. Results indicated elementary school teachers have similar values, but they are different from those of community leaders. Results of the data analysis suggest it may be possible to change teachers' values through cognitive dissonance on the ranking of the value terms&quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;equality.&quot; Teachers in two out of three schools tested showed significant change in their ranking of the value term &quot;freedom&quot; after an inservice workshop that included the pointing out of a dissonance relationship between where the teachers ranked &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;equality.&quot; Further study is recommended.

The development of two substantive systems in teacher education is discussed--the teacher system (the model of a teacher) and the program system. Five strategies for articulating the model of a teacher are noted: (a) the model of the school, in which the teacher is seen in relationship to his job environment and the necessary teacher competencies are developed after the model of the school is defined; (b) the generalist model; (c) the model of a particular educational approach, in which the teacher is provided with the competencies necessary for implementing a certain instructional strategy; (d) the practitioner model; and (e) the traditional program components  model, in which the usual elements of teacher education are translated into competency statements and competency programs. Since the model of the teacher provides the substance of the program, program design is completed after the model is defined. In the first stage of program design, decisions about overall program strategies, the nature of the interrelationships among components, selection of component strategies, and the possible compatibility among components are made. In the second stage of program development, elements are created along with the devices that will relate the program elements to one another. (HMD)",

Six adoption agents were selected for interviews by a panel on the basis of the number of institutions worked with, number of years in the business, experience with components of the innovation, conceptual and verbal abilities, and documentation of experiences. Resulting information is condensed into two categories. One category deals with information about adopting PTE, and the other category presents the guidelines set up by each agent. The author presents a set of generalized guidelines, derived from an analysis of agents and contrasted with Havelock's Innovation Adoption Process. The author concludes that  the most salient finding emerging from the interviews was that each agent was his own man acting on self-knowledge, along with a strong commitment and knowledge of the innovation, to provide the vital elements that activated the adoption stages leading toward effective use of PTE. Also, the definitions of the terms &quot;change agent&quot; and &quot;adoption agent&quot; are differentiated. (PD)",

Change agent behavior is viewed as ranging from impersonal through personal to interpersonal. The organization of this paper reflects these underlying patterns. At the same time, behavioral sciences and marketing research are brought to bear in  an effort to help explain the need for planning and evaluation strategies based on market segmentation, product differentiation, and communication skills. Case studies are briefly discussed, and a table of indicators is provided as a tentative guideline.

To test the viability of this approach, University of Minnesota graduate students majoring in elementary education were studied in terms of their declared career orientations. This investigation indicates that the graduate program in elementary education was oriented to serve a single group of educators, namely, school personnel, and tended to be less receptive to other groups of educators utilizing the program to further their career development. It is concluded that this approach is viable in terms of the data generated and the distinctions possible. A 26-item bibliography is included. (Author)",

The historical development of the project is discussed, including: (a) conceptualization during the first year, (b) development and implementation in a 9-hour block of reading/language arts methods on-campus during the second year of the project, and (c) operationalization and integration of the addition of 15 hours of student teaching to the 9-hour method block during the school year 1972-1973. The report also suggests the importance of developing teacher education programs in cooperation with classroom teachers and school administrators,  developing within teacher trainees a strong theoretical framework on which to base their decisions, and providing new directions for teacher trainees in moving from theoretical positions to simulation to field work in a field setting providing exposure to many teachers at a variety of grade levels.

Students enrolled in the course completed a 36 multiple choice preinstructional inventory. Both the experimental and control groups were permitted assigned specific access time to the self-instructional lab where all equipment was housed. After all the subjects had completed the module, a posttest was administered. An analysis of covariance made adjustments for initial inequalities between the experimental and control  groups since they were not randomly selected or matched pairs. The computation showed that the experimental group achieved a greater gain in cognitive information over the control group at the .05 level of significance. It was concluded that mediated self-instruction was superior to the lecture-demonstration method insofar as the experiment was structured. (HMD)",

Two separate classes of 25 students (group A) and 27 students (group B) underwent a pretest. Both classes were then taught through traditional teaching methods. After each lesson, group A was taken outside where the science concept was reinforced through a motor activity, while group B participated in pleasurable activities not related to science. The experiment consisted of eight lessons from the Simple Machines unit conducted over a two-week period. After this period, a posttest was administered, and 6 weeks later an extended interval test was given to test the degree of  retention. The pretest scores were found to show no significant differences between groups A and B. The results of posttest show that group A scored significantly higher than group B at the .05 level of confidence. There existed no statistically significant difference between the scores of the extended interval test and the posttest, although raw score data indicated that group A scored higher than group B where p. was less than .056. The posttest scores indicate that the use of motor learning activities should be considered an enrichment or reinforcement aid in teaching first-grade science concepts. (Author)",

Measures were obtained from 321 boys and girls attending kindergarten and first and second grade. Sample correlation matrices were computed on all variables at each grade level. Multivariate analysis of variance procedures were employed to determine grade and sex differences in performance on the proprioception tests. Multivariate multiple regression analysis was used to estimate the relationships between each of the dependent variables and the set of proprioception tests. Regression equations were established for the criterion dependent variables. Significant intergrade differences were found for  performance on three of the proprioception tests. No significant performance differences due to sex were found for any of the proprioception tests at any grade level. Intercorrelations between proprioception scores and the measures of physical growth, motor performance, and academic achievement reached significance most frequently with the thickness discrimination and static balance tests. Significant intercorrelations between proprioception and academic achievement measures were most frequent at the kindergarten level and decreased with each succeeding grade. The predictive ability of the proprioception measures was greatest at the first-grade level. (Author)",

        "description":"This paper describes the traditional role of the college student teaching supervisor, makes some observations concerning this role, and suggests a new role. The author makes the following observations about the traditional role: (a) it implies that the college supervisor can best contribute to teacher education by observing and then holding conferences with student teachers; (b) it has frustrated college supervisors, student teachers, supervising teachers, and administrators because it does not meet their needs and expectations; (c) it makes it impossible for the best college supervisors to make a substantial contribution to student teachers; and (d) it is a waste of the college supervisor's talents. The author recommends a new role that would involve decreasing the amount of  time devoted to observing and holding conferences with student teachers and increasing the amount of time devoted to in-service teacher education. Four advantages of this new role are listed. It is suggested that this new role will improve in-service teacher education since college supervisors constitute a group that is well qualified and conveniently available to improve in-service teacher education. Seven cautions regarding the new role of college supervisors are described at the conclusion of the paper. A 10-item bibliography is included. (PD)",

The characteristics of a critical thinker are described (a) securing appropriate information, (b) appraising the evidence obtained through the use of logic and reason against previously defined standards, (c) coming to a valid conclusion, and (d) acting in respect to that conclusion. The author states that emphasis on the stimulation and improvement of critical thinking requires selection of materials that are relevant to students' interests and that if teaching for thinking is to florish and have impact on schools, individual classroom teachers are the key to the effort. The teacher's role in developing critical  thinking skills and ways to exert influence over students' thinking ability are discussed. In conclusion, the author states that thinking is the best method of problem solving and recommends that teacher training institutions emphasize critical thinking and prepare teachers to teach critical thinking.

Chapter one, &quot;Mutuality of Effective Functioning and School Experiences,&quot; emphasizes acceptance of pupils' thoughts and feelings and the pupils' challenging of the generalizations and the concepts that are inherent in the structure of knowledge in the curriculum. Chapter two, &quot;The Achievement of Competency,&quot; discusses mental health from the viewpoint of the qualities that one needs in order to function competently. The importance of these qualities--work, play, and love--and their effect on learning is developed. Chapter three, &quot;New Conceptions of Children's Learning and Development,&quot; is a  reexamination and a comparison of research evidence regarding the development, learning, and motivation of human beings. Chapter four, &quot;A Cognitive Field Theory of Learning,&quot; emphasizes inadequacy of some ideas about learning and reinforcement theories of learning as guides to teachers' action in the classroom. Chapters five, &quot;Self-Actualization; A New Focus for Education,&quot; and six, &quot;Learning and Becoming--New Meanings to Teachers,&quot; describe ways some teachers put into effect points discussed in previous chapters. Chapter seven, &quot;The School and the Ego as Information Processors,&quot; discusses the concept of information, the common denominator of all the other chapters. (Author/PD)",

The experimental design consisted of three treatment groups each emphasizing tactile, cooperative, or individual experiences in physical education. The control group participated in tactile, cooperative, and individual activities. Subjects, consisting of 235 elementary school children representing four integrated, self-contained, third-grade classes in two schools, were pretested by a sociometric rating scale to determine their interpersonal relationship status with other children. After participating in a 6-week sports unit, the subjects were posttested on the same sociometric rating scale. Results indicated that there is a statistically  significant change in a positive direction in interpersonal relationships of black children who experience tactile communication with white children in sport and that there is not a statistically significant change in a positive direction in interpersonal relationships of white children who experience tactile communication with black children in sport.

A battery of skills tests, a game knowledge test on alley soccer, and the California Test of Personality were given to 221 fifth-graders. The pre- and post-battery of skills tests indicated that boys obtained better scores than the girls on the various soccer skills and that students who had more extensive exposure to the activity developed greater soccer skills. A significant difference was indicated between the task and in individual program styles of teaching on the pre- and post-game knowledge test. The significant sex difference occurred where the experimental  groups met three times weekly, with the boys obtaining higher scores than the girls. The pre- and post-personal adjustment scores indicated very little sex difference, with girls attaining higher scores than the boys did.

This multivariate approach allows the comparison of performance capabilities simultaneously over the many recognized components of the motor domain and the assessment of that portion of a retarded sample whose subtended  performance profiles resemble those of the intellectually normal.

The programs are compared as to their goals, the testing modalities and physiological parameters used for prescription of the initial training session, and the methods and the progression of training. Regarding goals, there is a general agreement that aerobic capacity is the most important component. There is much variance with regard to the pretesting session, especially regarding the benefits of the exercise electrocardiogram and who should give the stress test. The widest discrepancies between authors are found in the criteria for prescription of the initial training session. Some authors recommend interval training, others continuous training, while others avoid any strict  regimen for training. The question of both the optimal and the minimal number of days per week to elicit the training effect is still open to question. While some commonality was found among the authors sampled, it would appear that further research is warranted in the field of exercise prescription. (Author/JA)",

The 75 volunteer male subjects were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. One group was given informative knowledge of results; another group, positively reinforcing knowledge of results; while the third group was given no supplementary knowledge of results. All subjects were given 30 trials on a coincidence-anticipation task which required the subject to make a motor response at the time a moving object coincided with two separated, stationary objects. Two responses were made on each trial. A fine motor movement was required on the first response, but a large  motor movement was required for the second response. Results showed no significant differences in performance among the treatment groups on the first or second response. It was concluded within the limitations of the study that informative and reinforcing knowledge of results were no more beneficial to the performance of the present coincidence-anticipation task than was the intrinsic feedback inherent to the task.

The results of the second and third study, which were designed to eliminate the primacy effect, were similar to the results of the first. In the fourth study, tutors viewed a graphical representation of the tutee's performance on the first part of a concept formation learning task.

It was hypothesized that the experimental groups attending workshops in each of the three areas would improve their interpersonal skills, acceptance of themselves, acceptance of others, values and attitudes toward minorities, and skills in the teaching of linguistics. The control group was comprised of students who volunteered for the experimental workshops, but who were unable to participate because of conflicts in scheduling.  Measurement of the effect of the workshops was made using self-rating instruments before and after the workshops. Analysis of the results shows that subjects in the Interpersonal Skills Workshop did not feel that they improved their interpersonal skills or their acceptance of themselves or others. The subjects who participated in the Attitudes and Values Workshop did not feel that they improved their attitudes toward minorities. However, the participants of the Linguistics Workshop did feel that they had improved their language teaching skills. (HMD)",

Each student completed the Wear Attitude Scale and a Student Opinionnaire at the end of the 18-week instructional period. Students were scored on general attitude toward physical education, attitude toward the class they were enrolled in, grading fairness, attainment of course objectives,  suitability of assigned out-of-class work, class size, availability and value of reference material, and appropriateness of tests to meeting course objectives. Results indicated that performance-based instruction developed a better general attitude toward physical education, as compared to attitudes developed by the traditional teaching method. Volleyball students expressed a lower opinion of performance-based instruction, while fencing and golf students held a better opinion of performance-based instruction than they did of traditional methods. All classes disliked the assigned out-of-class work, which was a part of performance-based instruction. (Author)",

The goal of the first year of the study was to identify and analyze those combinations of intern background characteristics and Teacher Corps program characteristics that are related to desired teaching skills and attitudes of interns at the end of their training. Data were collected at 20 sixth-cycle projects that prepared elementary school teachers. Data about the training program at each site were obtained from university professors and deans, project staff, local education agency superintendents, school principals and teachers, community persons and interns through questionnaires and interviews. Data about intern characteristics after training were gathered through  classroom observations, questionnaires, intern activity logs, and interviews with interns. It was found that important trends related to positive exit factors were, without exception, program factors; that is, none of the background experiences or characteristics (excluding ethnic background) had an impact on the intern's exit characteristics. Only three exit characteristics could be predicted from program factors with an acceptable level of accuracy.

        "description":"This paper focuses on the theory of organizational change and development as presented by Ronald G. Corwin in his book, &quot;Reform and Organizational Survival: The Teacher Corps As an Instrument of Educational Change,&quot; and the implications this theory has for efforts at institutional change which are being made by the Teacher Corps. Corwin identifies two models of organizations: (a) a rational model which presumes that organizations are goal-directed entities, and (b) a political model which presumes that direction is determined by external constraints on the organization and by commitments made by the members in the course of bargaining for resources. In his analysis, Corwin integrates political and rational aspects of organizations. The author, in an attempt to expand or modify  Corwin's theory, suggests a model called &quot;muddling through&quot; and recommends that organizations be viewed on a continuum rather than at either end of the continuum. Applying Corwin's theory to his experience with Teacher Corps projects, the author suggests that the difference between successful and unsuccessful projects seemed to lie in: (a) how adroit te staff were in dealing with political constraints, and (b) how the staff were able to deal with political crises in one aspect of the project while keeping other aspects on a rational basis.

        "description":"Changes in verbalized inquiry behavior of teachers and students who participated in the Mid-Continent Regional Educational Laboratory's Instructional Staff Development program in inquiry were identified. Teachers' verbal behaviors were analyzed in terms of their teaching strategies as related to three inquiry models. An expanded modification of the Flanders' Interaction Analysis Instrument with 34 subcategories was developed and utilized for data collection. Teachers in the program became more indirect in their influence patterns while still leading the inquiry sessions. Pre and posttests resulted in an increase in the number of specific inquiry behaviors and affective areas identified. This reflects a greater understanding of behaviors related to student-centered,  inquiry-oriented instruction. As a group, teachers showed a decrease in teacher talk while students exhibited an increase from a pretest of 17.5 to a posttest of 33.5. Teachers also increased their knowledge and application skills on interaction analysis from a mean score of 4.5 to 14.4 out of a possible 19 points on a prepost test. (Author)",

Two studies have attempted to answer the following question: Is there any evidence that a college student's personality is related to his preference for various instructional experiences? Jungian personality types were used. The first study found that the students tested held predictable views for and against self-paced instruction: intuitive students preferred self-paced instruction to more traditional group-paced teaching methods; sensing types liked more traditional methods of instruction. The present study sought to find if  associations made in the first study still held up and to determine what relationships, if any, existed between student types and each of the self-paced course modules. The instrument of study was a five-credit, self-paced course of 54 students in thermodynamics. It consisted of 20 self-paced instructional modules (packages). Three types of data-gathering instruments were employed: (a) a course evaluation form, (b) a module evaluation form, and (c) the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator which measures the differences in student personality and learning types.

The procedure recommended by CEEB determines if individuals with high and low scores (1) in the same course and (2) from courses at various levels, score differentially on the CEEB tests. If both these differences are statistically significant, high predictive validity can be inferred. An alternate procedure involves no such inference, but rather asks the student directly if he was correctly placed and, if not, whether he was placed too high or too low. Subjects in this study were taking Spanish, French, and German. Results of the new procedure showed 80 percent were correctly placed by the CEEB tests. A second alternative to the CEEB procedure was also  tried. Scholastic aptitude indicators and foreign language background variables were obtained from the students' permanent records and used in a regression equation to determine student placement. This equation placed 62 percent of the students correctly. Placement by the CEEB tests was about equally accurate in all languages, and was significantly better than placement by the regression equation. It is argued that the new validation procedure is a valuable alternative to the CEEB procedure because it does not rely on grades and provides different information. (Author)",

        "description":"The revision of the Strong Vocational Interest Blank (SVIB), the Strong-Campbell Interest Inventory (SCII), introduces Holland's theory of occupational types into the empirical structure of the SVIB. Emphasis on Holland's theory is evident throughout the SCII profile. Empirical coding of occupations was accomplished by: (1) scoring each of the occupational samples on the Holland scales; (2) correlating the Occupational Scales, the Basic Interest Scales, and the General Occupational Theme Scales; and (3) typing each occupation according to its highest General Theme scores while simultaneously considering the scale intercorrelations. The coded occupations were ordered on the new SCII profile in congruence with Holland's hexagonal model--Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social,  Enterprising, and Conventional. Most of the Occupational Scales ordered themselves around the perimeter of the hexagon according to Holland's theory. Occasionally, occupations fell into unusual categories, emphasized differences in code-types for men and women, or resisted easy categorization. The exploration of these unusual occurrences is useful for counselors and clients who wish to gain more information about vocational interests. (Author/RC)",

        "description":"Trait adjectives have both evaluative and denotative meanings. Evaluation of a trait varies with the context of other traits attributed to the person. The meaning-change interpretation suggests that denotative change in trait meaning underlies evaluative change. The evaluative-halo interpretation attributes context effects of single trait ratings to an amalgamation of trait and person evaluation. Two experiments contrast these interpretations. In the first, context effected judged implication of traits even where judgments were made to semantic scales which were denotatively unrelated to the test word. In the second experiment, test words were paired with contexts which either did, or did not, denote an aspect of the test word. Magnitude of context effects was not influenced by  test-context denotative relationship. Context evaluation alone affected trait evaluative ratings. Judgment appears to be influenced by the aspects of traits falling on the judgment dimension. Evaluative judgments are based on evaluative meanings. (Author)",

The EDS measures the degree of supportive environmental input through 16 items assessing occupation, organizational activities, and interpersonal relationships. The data were obtained in behavioral interviews with 128 prison releasees and validated against the Law Encounter Severity Scale, a five-part continuous criterion of criminal behavior. The EDS was found to be highly predictive of law encounters in terms of total score, clusters of items, and individual items. The results indicate the interpersonal relationships may provide the most important contribution to successful postrelease adjustment. The Maladaptive Behavior Record (MBR)  and Weekly Activity Record (WAR), response counterparts of the EDS which measure an individual's behavior in response to his environment, correlate moderately with the EDS.

Six methods of scoring pyramidal tests were evaluated with respect to score distributions, stability, and the degree of relationship among scoring methods and between pyramidal scoring methods and scores on the conventional test. For both the pyramidal tests and the conventional test, score distributions were platkurtic and positively skewed. Two methods of scoring the pyramidal tests consistently used an equal or greater proportion of the range of possible scores then the conventional test. The 15-stage pyramidal tests showed test-retest correlations which were only slightly lower than that for the  40-item conventional test. However, when the effects of memory were considered, the pyramidal strategy yielded more stable ability estimates than conventional tests of equivalent length. The correlation between pyramidal test scores and those on conventional tests ranged from .82 to .86. One pair of scoring methods was found to be perfectly correlated for properly constructed pyramidal tests; a second pair correlated almost perfectly. (Author/SE)",

Full scale and subtest scores were analyzed. A factor analysis of the WISC, MAT, and the two scales combined was conducted using an oblique rotation. Data from this analysis are presented and compared to those obtained in a 1959 investigation using the original WISC standardized population. The hypotheses that the present sample has a basically different intellectual structure from that of the normative group was not supported. The effects of disadvantage seem to be evident in the pattern of high and low subtest means, in which the lowest means are  on two subtests (Information and Vocabulary) which are both highly open to cultural and educational influence, and also the best subtests for predicting the academic performance of the group.

The present study proposes such a measure in the &quot;bentee&quot; (standing for benefit T-score) and provides evidence about its utility and form. Creation of a general &quot;bentee&quot; permits the design of a tree of values, leading by clearly defined steps from the highest values of society to the lowest, most directed, and definable objectives and test items. The mathematics of such a tree is analyzed, permitting the tracing of any subarea of performance in terms of its overall value. Two methods of assigning values, at a given level of the tree, are compared experimentally, using 101 sample judges from two regions of the U. S. It was found that the  values had clear and consistent rank orders when group means were considered; that the less elaborate token methods served as well as the latest technique; that the relative values for boy high-school seniors were only slightly different from those judged for girls; and that educators did not differ, as a group, from noneducators in their assigned values. Individuals, however, differed enormously from one another in their appraisal of educational values. (Author)",

The second part illustrates how the regression effect confounds the matched-pair type of design and this, too, is followed by mastery test instructional exercises. The user should be familiar with the basic statistical concepts of mean, standard deviation, correlation, and z-scores. (Author/SE)",

Using a sample of 2,568 students divided among grades 5, 8, and 11, a single subscale of each trait was developed for use at all three grade levels. Kuder Richardson Formula 8 estimates of subscale homogeneity are presented, along with data demonstrating the relationship of each subscale to Social Desirability scores, to measures of three divergent  traits, nd to chronological maturity (grade level). The validity of the conceptual model of psychosocial maturity, i.e., the arrangement of traits into three groups reflecting different types of adequacy, is tested empirically by (1) analysis of subscale intercorrelations, (2) hiearchical factor analysis of items, and (3) principal components analysis of subscale scores.

Do differences in academic achievement, grade level, sex, and race influence peer perceptions of black and white students as satisfiers of needs achievement recognition and succorance? Can interracial peer acceptance be predicted from intelligence, academic achievement, attendance, age, sex, self-concept of academic ability, race, years of peer interaction, and racial composition of the classroom? The sample consisted of 322 seventh and eighth grade students from an integrated Buffalo, New York public school. In June 1972, the Self Concept of Academic Ability Scale and the modified Syracuse Scales for Human Relations were administered to 14 seventh and eight grade classes. The remainder of the information was obtained from  school records. The most important finding is that race does not surface as a significant predictor variable for white social or academic acceptance. Grade point average seems to be a major determinant of acceptance, as it received the largest weight for females and was a secondary predictor for white males. Female (particularly white) acceptance was the most predictable from variables used in this study. (Author/JM)",

The IPSIP program involved the comparison of two treatment groups with a control group. Group 1 received a full-time classroom program and the parent education program. Group 2 received only the parent education program, and Group 3 served as a control group for the other groups. Each group contained both economically advantaged and disadvantaged children and similar racial balances. The IPSIP classroom curriculum provided a planned  sequence of learning events designed to impact the cognitive, social, and physical motor development of children. The parent education program provided for involving parents in the education of their children. The program provided for instruction in, and practice of behaviors which support learning. Children for the project were located in a changing community in northeastern Cincinnati. Most of the 223 children began the project at age 3 and continued through age 5. (Author/JM)",

The opportunity to incorporate the findings and products from previous studies by developing a behavioral management model was provided in March 1973, when the lab began its Mount Meigs Project at the Alabama Industrial School at Mount Meigs. Development of the behavioral management model at AIS began in EMLC Phase IV, focusing on fully individualizing the academic program to provide a foundation for the planned student incentive system. Baseline data were collected through all the phases of this individualization.. The incentive system, a token economy, was then introduced in March 1974, to improve the learning rate of  AIS students, as assessed by several learning measures. The study is also evaluating the relationship between social reinforcers--the personal interactions occurring during the administration of the token economy--and the more tangible reinforcers that are part of the structure of the token economy. In addition to operating the token economy, the EMLC continued its utilization/dissemination efforts during the reporting period. (Author/JM)",

Surveys were made of senior high school teachers from all senior high schools (grades 10-12) of Dade County, Miami, Florida, in February and June of 1970, involving 1,123 and 1,190 teachers, respectively. Rotter's Internal Versus External Control of Reinforcements scale and the Semantic Differential were used. The posttest only control group model was utilized to analyze data collected immediately after transfer and also four months after transfer. The nonequivalent control group model was used to analyze difference scores of a matched group of teachers involved in both surveys. It was found that immediately after  transfer, reassigned teachers were significantly more alienated than nonreassigned teachers. Alienation scores for teachers who were reassigned were not significantly different from those of nonreassigned teachers. Immediately after transfer, the self-ideal discrepancy scores for reassigned teachers did not differ significantly from those of nonreassigned teachers. Self-ideal discrepancy gain scores for reassigned teachers were significantly greater than those of nonreassigned teachers. (Author/JM)",

These studies were designed as an exploratory investigation to determine the extent to which grade-level achievement averages could be predicted using data from the third count (block statistics) and fourth count (tract statistics) of the 1970 Census, without including data on race or ethnicity. In particular, one of the original purposes was to determine whether evidence could be found of a differential effect on school achievement associated with concentrated urban poverty. The results of the study suggest that differences in achievement among the schools in the sample are associated with  differentials in the concentration of poverty and poverty-related characteristics. Stated differently, whether poverty and its correlates are relatively concentrated (or absent) in the urban neighborhoods in the sample is related to the degree to which achievement scores in local schools are unexpectedly different than would be predicted on the basis of a linear relationship between poverty and achievement.

The book is called \"The Student Pushout: Victim of Continued Resistance to Desegregation.\" The Office for Civil Rights in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare has been collecting statistical information regarding subjective determinations based on race that enter into disciplinary actions that result in students being pushed out of schools. The figures indicate that the percentage of minorities subject to disciplinary action, suspensions, or expulsions exceed their percentages in school systems. Not every suspended student is being pushed out, of course. The  disproportionate suspension statistics may actually reflect behavior. In one school district the school superintendent testified in open court that institutional racism was the reason for the disproportion. Black and other minority kids are being pushed out of schools across the country as the statistics from Dallas, Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, Boston, and Dade County, Florida, indicate. To the Office of Civil Rights and the Justice Department a disproportionate number of suspensions of minority students are \"red flags,\" signals that something may be wrong. Whether those two federal agencies responded properly to the \"red flags\" is open to serious question. (Author/JM)",

Data were collected in the 1969 Survey on Compensatory Education, a survey of national scope sponsored by the U.S. Office of Education. The survey secured data from school superintendents, elementary school principals, and elementary school teachers. Teachers answered questions about themselves and their classes in responding to a \"Teacher Questionnaire,\" and answered questions about individual pupils in their classes in responding to several \"Pupil Questionnaires.\" Survey data were secured from a nationally-representative sample of public school systems and  elementary schools which provided services, supported in whole or in part through Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, during the 1968-69 school year. Only students and teachers from grade 4 were considered in the present study. The results of this study suggest that much of the literature on the topic of race and social distance may not be applicable to classroom teachers. \"White female teachers rating blacks\" were most accurate, and \"black teachers rating blacks\" were least accurate. The most accurate evaluations were made by female teachers and by whites rating other whites. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This study analyzes the effects on 14- and 15-year-old black teenage girls of entering and participating in a specially designed work program. The girls were provided with supports in their work settings, well-defined tasks, supervisors as well as regularly scheduled peer interaction groups led by a young black woman considered to be an appropriate role model. The entire process of recruitment, selection, and certification was conducted by the Memphis In-school Neighborhood Youth Corps office. Two kinds of data were collected: (1) personality assessment on the experimental group and on the two control groups, and (2) external source data, consisting of school grades, school absences and tardiness, juvenile court contacts, known pregnancies, and on-job performance evaluations. The  selected experimental group were given work assignments as assistants to teachers and leaders in afterschool day care centers in poverty neighborhoods. They were directed by job supervisors in each center, and participated in regular discussion-interaction groups. In brief, the youth employment program, supported by peer interaction groups, produced positive outcomes for those included in it. At the same time, those who were not included in the program (or who dropped out) showed negative changes in school grades and self-concepts, as well as an increased perception of themselves as being at the mercy of chance or luck rather than controlling their own destinies.

The students who participated attended six classes which were selected to provide a balanced cross-section of students. The first step was the completion of an open-ended questionnaire designed to elicit racially-connected school problems and suggested solutions. A second questionnaire was developed using the problems most frequently mentioned by the different groups representing each race. Under each problem were listed solutions that were suggested by the respondents, as well as those suggested by the project staff  and two consultants. This second questionnaire was distributed to the participants asking them to evaluate each proposed solution to a problem on a five-point scale, or if they felt that the statement was not a problem, they could check that alternative. A third and final questionnaire was to be administered to the participants, specifying the most frequent response given to each solution. The third questionnaire was not approved by the principal and therefore was not administered. Even without the third questionnaire, this modified Delphi technique did provide a surprising degree of consensus concerning the solutions to most of the problems which were identified. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The purpose of this research is to investigate the relationship between the community's sociodemographic factors and the results of its effort to desegregate or integrate its school system. Two overall hypotheses are tested: (1) there is a positive correlation between each of three demographic variables--racial residential segregation, black school enrollment, and size of the community--and the rate of school segregation; and (2) residents of small communities, in comparison with those of large communities, are involved more in the issue of school integration and their attitudes are taken more into account in the decision-making concerns of this issue. In this study only elementary schools are considered. The population of the study consists of every small community of the  northern states. From census data for 1970 there were 249 places that met the study's conditions, but 19 were eliminated from the analysis. Because of technical problems and lack of data, the main discussion is based on the data available for 128 places. Two sources are used in this study: (1) \"Directory of Public Elementary and Secondary Schools in Selected Districts, Enrollment and Staff by Racial/Ethnic Groups, Fall, 1970\" (U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1972) and (2) 1970 census data. The former is used for computing the indexes of school segregation and enrollment measures, the latter for measuring the other independent variables. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This study sought to assess the record of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare in carrying out its mandate to prevent racial discrimination in school districts in the 33 northern and western states that did not at the time of the &quot;Brown&quot; decision have laws requiring or authorizing segregation of the public schools. Ten years ago, Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VI of which provided that no person shall be subjected to discrimination in any program receiving federal funds. When this inquiry was initiated, there were several alternative theories to explain the apparent lack of impact of Title VI on northern school segregation: either that HEW had not looked for or had not been able to discover any violation of Title VI in the districts it had  investigated, or that HEW had found violations in northern districts but had failed to act to redress the violations. At the end of this study, it was concluded that in many cases HEW investigations uncovered violations of the law, but the agency failed to take effective action to provide remedies to the victims of discrimination or to stem the flow of federal funds to districts which are in violation of the federal Constitution. In other cases, HEW failed to conduct any investigation at all in many districts where large numbers of minority children live and attend racially isolated schools. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This book is intended for both beginning and experienced teachers who face many difficult challenges in today's desegregated school. Teachers must come to feel and recognize the many contingencies of the desegregated classroom if it is to be a place for learning. Because social class segregates children as often as does race, the major question posed in this book is how teachers can integrate into one classroom children of different races and socioeconomic backgrounds. The how-to-do-it sections of this book are intended to help prospective teachers apply new information, sensitivity, and insight to specific day-by-day situations. The situations range widely from first-day welcome to absenteeism. Issues directly relating to these situations also are discussed: from the nature and  applicability of discipline to the appropriateness of curriculum. In addition to day-to-day expertise, teachers need a global perspective on integration if the nature of pluralism is to be understood and if integration is to work in the classroom. In a sense the international racism that obstructs world peace and the problems that face teachers in pluralistic classrooms are based on the same issues. For this reason the appendixes include one United Nations document, two UNESCO articles, and a brief excerpt from Pearl S. Buck's autobiography. The bibliography lists many materials and resource organizations teachers can use to sharpen their awareness. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This document presents, in two parts, ideas and information which were gathered from eight monthly seminars. Part 1, \"Developmental and Cross-Cultural Patterns of Youth,\" examines what is known about developmental norms regarding youth in general in respect to their attitudes at different ages towards rules and authority. It is found that in the societies studied youth look more alike than different on perceptions of what is a rule, what is a law, etc. and that age has a greater impact than ethnicity. There are, therefore, two important considerations for understanding the legal socialization of youth. First, we need to know how youth at different ages perceive \"the legal\" in these settings. Secondly, it is essential to also understand how adults view rules and issues because as  socializing agents, they are the modeling figures. Part 2, \"Social Contexts of Youth in Conflict,\" examines the following questions: What are the cultural norms and traditions? What are the patterns and goals of socialization? What are the political realities? What economic and work opportunities exist for youth? What is the impact of technological change on society and the individual? What status is conferred on youth by society? How does the legal system define and deal with unacceptable behavior? Each discussion focuses on a particular case in point, specifying the resource person who supplied the information on that case. (JM)",

        "description":"Many of the problems the schools seem to face are problems only marginally related to the curriculum--problems of racial difficulty, problems of class-adjustment. In discussing the educational priorities of city schools, it was generally agreed among the speakers that these matters would be thought of here as subordinate. That is, they would take the rather old-fashioned view that the school is still an institution dedicated to the training of the mind and that the priorities are still educational. The first speaker, Mr. Wilson Riles, was the Director of the Office of Compensatory Education in the California State Department of Education. The second speaker, Dr. Carl J. Dolce, began as an elementary school teacher, had also taught in high school, been a junior high principal, and  was on the faculty of the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Since 1965, he has been Superintendent of Schools, Orleans Parish School Board, New Orleans. The third speaker was Martin Mayer. He had been research director of a study of international secondary education for the Twentieth Century Fund and for 6 years was chairman of a New York City local school board. He has written several books. Post-presentation discussion covered such topics as: evaluation, t8e role of the school in social adjustment and teaching values, the Bereiter-Engelmann approach, and others. (Author/JM)",

The project has been established as an annex to Edison High School, an all male, comprehensive high school which has the highest dropout rate in the school district. Gang tension, racial problems, failure, and a lack of interest in education have led to a discouraging school climate. The components of the program are: instructional (classroom activities, curriculum development, and home contacts), reading and mathematics (remediation and consultative services for teachers), career development (job exposure,  experience, and training), and ancillary services (medical examinations, follow-up treatment, legal service). The project uses self-contained classroom at the high school level to personalize the educational experience. Through the coordination of the various components, subject area centered learning stations have been developed within the school, and work and community centered learning stations have been developed as outside learning stations. Three hundred thirty five students were enrolled in the project in September, 1973, 248 at the main project side and 87 at the Edison Component. (Author/JM)",

While the efforts of educationally disenfranchised communities to achieve some influence and control over the schooling of their children has slowed, it has not ceased. Such efforts can give direction to those who still seek ways to improve education for the poor. The first section of this focuses on the social context of teaching from the viewpoint of an anthropologist. The second follows through on the implications of individual learning from the standpoint of a psychologist. Three basic arguments are put forth: (1) that a new process-oriented education  for poor children cannot be implemented in schools which have failed to resolve the ideological tensions between oppressed communities and their educational institutions; (2) that the focus on children as targets of change in the war on poverty--a focus which did not include entire communities in programmatic efforts to eradicate poverty--created new problems without necessarily solving old ones; and, (3) that teachers cannot respond productively to the learning and thinking styles of children which are different from their own unless we develop new forms and structures for schooling.

Two studies are described in which students entering predominantly black colleges were asked to report retrospectively concerning their (desegregated) high schools' social environments. The studies employed two alternative methods for assessing dissatisfaction and/or seriousness of problems. One of the methods compared the discrepancies between \"perceived\" and \"ideal\" environmental characteristics. The other method involved ratings of the \"perceived\" conditions and the \"seriousness\" of any problems emanating from the conditions. The studies indicated that among the dissatisfactions and/or problems regarded as most serious by the students were: lack of  courses and activities relevant to the needs of black students; limited participation of black students in extracurricular, social, and other school activities; discriminatory attitudes and practices of teachers and others, especially with regard to discipline; opposition of some parents to integration; and lack of identification and loyalty to the school. The problems identified using both methods were similar in a number of instances, although important differences between the methods were noted. (Author/JM)",

With a view to giving everyone access to the cable medium and an opportunity to participate, advantages and disadvantages of three typical models of cable TV control are discussed: (1) private control, (2) public or community control, and (3) charterboard control. A major weakness in both private and public ownership is the tendency to project the views of the controlling group. Cable TV, however, is a valuable resource for the adult educator, and, in an era when people feel alienated, an opportunity to focus on community issues and relate more  personally with the viewer. Limitations regarding the use of cable TV for adult education include: (1) the problem of control, (2) lack of trained staff, (3) unimaginative programing, (4) lack of funds, (5) limited time available for citizen programing, (6) lack of audience involvement, and (7) lack of research.

This study examines male and female quit data and draws two primary conclusions. First, women are less likely than men to quit for job related reasons although women do quit more often because of household responsibilities. It is not necessarily true that total female quit rates exceed male rates. Second, female quit rates are their lowest relative to male rates during periods of low unemployment which suggests the importance of maintaining full employment to combat discrimination.

        "description":"The paper seeks to emphasize certain important dimensions of the economics of worker alienation which have been underemphasized, if not overlooked. Most satisfying jobs are not available without cost to someone. Workers often face a choice between job satisfaction and pecuniary rewards. With this context in mind., the author discusses several possible interpretations of &quot;alienation&quot; which fall within the boundaries of conventional economics. Basic economic principles help to clarify the concept of alienation and the policy questions surrounding it. It is also stressed that costs are involved in job rotation and job redesign. In many cases, workers face a trade-off between real income and job satisfaction. This trade-off has largely been ignored in much of the recent literature.  In such studies as Lordstown, a radical departure from previous patterns is not represented but simply a renewal of the long-term trend toward improved working conditions. &quot;Alienation&quot; is interpreted as a form of disequilibrium between production constraints and worker aspirations. A final recommendation suggests that future studies concentrate not simply on worker opinions but also on the cost trade-offs. (BP)",

Supervisors also rated the engineer's performance on each of the 10 specific criteria and two global measures. The ratings were intercorrelated and factor analyzed; the extracted factors were rotated using Kaiser's varimax method. The importance ratings by supervisors were found to be highly similar to the importance ratings by engineers, with three factors emerging from the ratings by each group: (1) administrative skill, (2) technical competence, and (3) design skill. The factor analysis of the performance ratings by supervisors revealed two factors: (1) interpersonal relations ability and (2) technical ability. It  appears that supervisors appraise performance by criteria similar to those they perceive as being critical to the type of work performed by engineers. (Author)",

Fifty-three percent were engaged in occupations consistent with their highest interest scores, although 32 percent were in occupations consistent with their lowest scores. Those in consistent occupations reported significantly greater job satisfaction, but no difference in self-assessed performance. The present study was undertaken not so much to demonstrate the validity of the KPR which it employes, but to explore the possibility that a set of homogeneous interest scales, administered 25 years previously to junior year high school students, can have any relationship to several occupational criteria. Similar studies were reviewed. Results from  the current study were interpreted to mean that counseling for future occupations should not be done from KPR scale scores at age 14, but that interests measured this early do bear a relationship to occupations observed 25 years later.

While it is not difficult to estimate the potential training requirements in the production sector alone, identification of occupations in allied industries is more complex. To make this determination, the Standard Terminology for Curriculum and Instruction in Local and State School Systems was used as standard reference to define such occupations. This was supplemented by the experience of Texas agricultural and agribusiness specialists who evaluated job titles used in classifying survey employment data from the 1970 Census of Population. Agricultural and related  employment was grouped by the following criteria: Group 1--agricultural or related competencies in industry, and Group 2--selected industries or occupations in which only a portion of the work requires agriculture or related competencies. Recommendations for additional training by the Texas labor force in the fields of production agriculture, land economics and real estate, gardeners and groundskeepers are proposed. Five appendixes are included. (Author/BP)",

The relentless advance of technology gives us the key to new, more versatile, vocational education. The health field, the area of environmental control, aviation, the aerospace industry, the physical sciences, and related engineering fields are all examples of developing areas with specialized needs to be met by the new vocational education at the postsecondary level. Secondary school vocational education must prepare students in all kinds of core knowledge and skills that are not purely abstract or academic but that have application beyond  a single occupation or occupational area. Enrollments in both secondary and postsecondary vocational education have been increasing, and more Federal funds have been allocated to this area. Vocational education has brought the schools into the adult community, creating a constituency--a builtin support group for further development in this area. (Author/MW)",

A more recent example are the intelligence/investigative programs that develop tactics of disruption; national  security can be protected without such practices.

        "description":"The Minority Mobility Project (MMP) was undertaken as part of a larger effort dealing with upgrading and upward mobility systems in the various settings funded by the Manpower Administration. The preface to the final report sets forth the broad purpose and achievements of the MMP. The first chapter presents the introductory nature of Equal Employment Opportunity Compliance and Voluntary Activities. The various contexts of the MMP are discussed, and how MMP activities contributed to broad objectives and specific operational objectives is reported. The second chapter reports on what was done and what was learned from the activities. Chapter 3 centers on the barriers to upward mobility of minorities and women in terms of what has been learned about the barriers, how they operate,  and how they are part of the employment systems. Equal Employment Requirements and Upward Mobility, chapter 4, ties together some of the material presented earlier. Nine specific summary observations are presented. The final chapter, Public Policy: Observations and Recommendations, translates in terms of broad policy and implementation, the contents of chapter 4. (Author/AG)",

        "description":"The study provides in one source the various State certification requirements for vocational stenographic-secretarial teachers in post-secondary vocational-technical schools in the United States, obtained from State Directors of Vocational Education through a questionnaire; the related literature is reviewed. A 12-page table summarizes certification requirements in individual States. Fifteen tables accompany an analysis and comparison of these certification criteria as they exist in all the States. The research found more differences than similarities among the States' certification requirements. These differences and similarities are detailed, and it is concluded that, while most of the States provide post-secondary vocational stenographic-secretarial education and while the  majority have Statewide requirements teachers must meet, there is little agreement among the States as to which criteria are most appropriate. It is recommended that a reciprocity plan for vocational business teacher certification should be developed, and that similar studies should be conducted to determine State certification requirements for all vocational business teachers at all educational levels. The questionnaire and a directory of State Directors are among the appendixes. (AJ)",

The overall objective was to determine the extent to which these institutions were cooperating and sharing programs, faculty, and facilities in the offering of vocational programs. Seven vocational institutional types were surveyed: area vocational technical schools, comprehensive high schools, public community colleges, private junior colleges, nondegree granting proprietary schools, associate degree granting proprietary schools, and senior colleges and universities. Several hundred individual institutions were contracted by mail and/or telephone. Findings indicated that while some cooperative vocational program activities are going on, the potential for such activities  is barely tapped. Recommendations for future cooperative programs are offered. Appendixes offer the cover letter, a flow diagram of the study, a questionnaire form, and a listing of the participating institutions.

The perceptions sought were of: dual-role conflict, advancement possibilities, and career aspirations. An equalitarian perception scale and a female demographic data questionnaire were sent to randomly selected college presidents and female faculty. The findings are presented in both graphic and tabular form, with textual explication and discussion. It  was found that both the college presidents and the women faculty members perceive some degree of role conflict in the women; administrators and women faculty agreed that women were not as likely to achieve positions of leadership as men, although the administrators perceived more opportunity for the women than the women themselves did. Administrators perceived in women faculty only moderate career aspiration; the findings from the women's sample upheld that perception. (AJ)",

        "description":"The study, involving 178 Mississippi vocational education teachers working in 12 different areas of vocational education who had been teaching three years or less, compared the work values and job attitudes which vocational education teachers hold toward teaching and students. Instruments utilized for data collection were a questionnaire pertaining to teacher's perceptions of teaching preparation, the &quot;Work Value Inventory&quot; by Super, and a vocational teacher attitude scale (included in the appendix) developed by the investigators. A composite rating for each subject's preparation for professional work was determined in nine performance areas; ratings were correlated with teacher attitudes toward teaching and students. Teachers' perceptions of their preparation to work in the nine  areas were also correlated with the work values teachers selected as important in motivating them to teaching. The results indicated that vocational teachers, as a composite group, were most highly motivated in their jobs by altruistic work values. Vocational teachers from different disciplines differed significantly in attitudes towards students. The hypothesis predicting similar work values for vocational education teachers was strongly supported. Specific study of prevocational teachers' work values was recommended. (EA)",

Questionnaires were mailed to all Mississippi vocational teachers with one to three years of teaching experience, State level supervisors, and teacher educators; 405 questionnaires were included in the study. A rating scale was utilized that consisted of five levels ranging from inadequate performance to competent performance; 94 performance tasks were assessed in areas of: planning of instruction, execution of instruction, evaluation of instruction, guidance, management, public/human relations, professional role, student vocational organizations, and program coordination. Only one group, program coordination, was  assessed at below the adequate level. Some specific recommendations derived from the study were the need for increased preservice experience in: &quot;actual&quot; school situations, team teaching approach, standardized testing, guidance related tasks, budget planning, preparing reports, student disciplinary actions, use of media, research studies, working with youth organizations, and program coordination.

Occupations requiring high school or college education and/or on-the-job training are listed, and the concepts required for most math-related occupations are itemized. Other materials include an outline of concepts and enrichment materials to be used  along with the Addison-Wesley textbook. \"Using Math in a Department Store\" is a sample lesson where the students not only learn basic questions with fractions, but they also learn that these skills are necessary to work in a department store. \"Bricklayers Use Multiplication\" cites four multiplication work problems. \"A 'Lube' Man Uses Math\" gives three job related math problems. \"Do You Really Need to Study Math?\" is a brief project summary.

        "description":"This brochure presents regulatory guidelines on sex discrimination with sections devoted to: general principles; sex as a bona fide occupational qualification; separate lines of progression and seniority systems; discrimination against married women; advertising job opportunities; employment agencies; pre-employment inquiries as to sex; the relationship of Title VII to the Equal Pay Act; fringe benefits; and employment policies relating to pregnancy and childbirth. Delineating sex as a bona fide qualification in occupational hiring is a major thrust of the document. Interpreted narrowly, occupational discrimination is manifested by (1) sex labels which tend to deny employment unnecessarily to one sex or another; (2) assumptions on comparative employment characteristics, such as\"the turnover rate is higher for women than men\"; (3) stereotyped sex characterizations (i.e., \"men are less able to assemble intricate equipment\"); and (4) preferences of coworkers, employers, clients, or customers. Authenticity or genuineness--e.g., an actor or actress--will be considered as a bona fide occupational qualification.

        "description":"Educational technology, new materials and methods, and a growing realization that each person learns in an individually unique way has opened up new potentials in correctional education. The delivery of education and training services is very difficult in a prison setting. However, the creative program manager can develop and implement an appropriate delivery system to meet the special needs of the population in a particular institution. Management by specific and measurable objectives, marshalling of internal and external resources, and highly individualized, learner centered, and flexible programming are the essential characteristics of an up-to-date correctional education model. Early and continuing linkages with the real world and intensive assistance during the critical  post-release period can reduce the degenerative impact of incarceration. Top level support and commitment to education and training are necessary in order that correctional education may serve the overall mission of any correctional system. (Six appendixes include an inmate data profile, a correctional education model, testing standards, learning center diagram, and Bureau of Prisons educational standards and checklists.) (Author)",

Two constants relevant to survival (people are dependent on their environment; people are dependent on people) form the basis for the concepts developed in the lessons; the series does not emphasize vocational decision making, but provides the early exposure to the world of work necessary to develop realistic identification with people and needs. Each lesson guide presents the concepts to be developed, the lesson topic, its focus, the location of  the television film, and background information. For each lesson, several in- and out-of-classroom activities are suggested.

        "description":"The report has described the results of a questionnaire survey covering task performance in the occupational area of hospital engineering and maintenance and the implications for curriculum development in personnel training. Survey respondents were selected from among personnel of 48 health care facilities in six cities, representing various sized hospitals and extended care facilities. The questionnaire consisted of a task list of 386 possible tasks that might be performed in hospital maintenance departments and was tested in a presurvey among maintenance department personnel at hospitals in the Los Angeles area. The national survey indicated that differentiations of tasks performed by maintenance personnel can be made among occupational titles and categories. A clear division  of labor existed between maintenance superintendents and maintenance workers, even in small facilities with few workers. Classification of personnel not administrative or craft specializing fell into three categories: mechanical, building, and general maintenance. Curricula for superintendents need to be management related and to include knowledge and skills necessary for task supervision. All maintenance workers need training in a common core of tasks with additional training to qualify in one of the three maintenance categories. (EA)",

The survey responses are tabulated and discussed in detail, and indicate that there is considerable overlapping of tasks by various occupational levels in the food service department; designation of tasks by an expert panel to a specific category of worker was frequently found  to be at variance with actual practice; many tasks were rated higher in difficulty by the panel than by personnel performing the task; and no discernible relationship was revealed between criticality, difficulty, and technical knowledge.

This is the goal of Project Trident, a comprehensive career education program being developed at Lincoln Community High School, Illinois. The project, in its planning year, is directed toward secondary level instruction and was designed in response to student and adult questionnaires. It emphasizes occupational counseling, a wide range of career choices, student self-direction, and flexibility of entry at various program stages. Behavioral objectives are identified in three Career Education Modules (CEMs) and are planned for the greatest degree of flexibility. CEM-1 provides career education information through a three-week core of  activities offered at the beginning of each semester using formal presentations and mini courses. CEM-2 provides career education experiences through classroom units in the academic classrooms throughout the year. CEM-3 provides career education experiences through an individualized self-instructional approach. Two final chapters discuss materials and aids and student movement through the career education program. (MW)",

Instructional information is contained in the three-part statement and four columns of the computer printout, i.e., prerequisites, component tasks, environment, and concepts. The coding establishes guidelines for use of the data with various handicapped populations: visually impaired, hearing impaired, mentally retarded, speech impaired, physically  impaired, and emotionally disturbed. Three organizational models are proposed as ways of organizing a career development program: (1) economic environment model, (2) curriculum topic model, and (3) occupational topic model. Either the multicluster or the one-cluster approach can be used with any of these models which integrate curriculum disciplines and the world of work. The report concludes with a sample commonality lesson plan based on Project CAREER data. (MW)",

In that segment, the goals of career awareness, exploration, and entry by all youth are addressed through the development of curriculum units and the Occupational Exploration Program. Of the more than 130 units developed, only about 12 touch on the dance and most of these occur in the elementary grades. More potential lies in the Occupational Exploration Program as learning materials are being prepared at the junior high school level. The Arts and Humanities cluster will include components on visual arts, music, drama, literature, and dance. Materials for the dance component are still in the planning  stage, but it is hoped that students who become aware of the dance in the elementary level units will be able to explore the dance-as-career in simulation modules at the junior high school level.

        "description":"In the past several years utilization of nonprofessionals in various extension programs has increased. In an attempt to determine what the role of the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP) nonprofessional is, the paper presents the findings of an analysis of critical incidents acquired from nonprofessional EFNEP extension aides working in selected areas of Kentucky in the course of an evaluation study. The specific purposes of the critical incident analysis were to: (1) identify the on-the-job behaviors and attitudes of EFNEP aides through critical incidents described by aides, (2) determine critical job requirements by tabulating and classifying the identified behaviors and attitudes, and (3) draw implications from these data for the training of EFNEP Extension  Aides. Findings led to the following recommendations: (1) training should be conducted on a one-to-one or very small group basis and (2) any training program for nonprofessionals should focus attention on not only involving the trainees, but all levels of staff responsible for the success of the program.

        "description":"The purpose of this research was to determine the relative roles of experience/learning and selected visual aptitude factors on the ability to detect and identify indications of defects in X-ray film of welds and other materials. Penetrameter Detection and Defect Identification Tests were developed to measure the ability of radiographic film inspectors to detect and identify weld defects. These tests and the Ortho-rater examination were given to Navy certified film inspectors. Test results and visual examination results were compared to determine the relationship between vision and film reading skills. Both film tests were readministered six months later to determine film inspector reliability. No significant relationship was found to exist between the selected visual aptitude  factors and film reading ability. Low levels of inter- and intrasubject reliability were found to exist on both the detection and identification tests, and a significant intrasubject relationship was found between identification test reliability and experience. This suggests that learning plays an important role in the acquisition of film reading skills. Further research in new training methods is recommended based on the above findings. (Author/MW)",

        "description":"A systems approach, a multiparameter stochastic model, that will project State vocational education needs is being developed in Washington State by cooperation of the Coordinating Council for Occupational Education with Dr. Samuel Cleff. The model has incorporated the Cleff Career Development Systems (CCDS), a job matching system used for individual guidance in subprofessional occupational selection that develops 16-point numerical profiles of jobs, training courses, and of people. A mathematical cluster of 750 CCDS job profiles resulted in 19 job profile clusters. Because of the behavioral similarity of jobs within a specific cluster, it was inferred that transfer of training would be high from one job to another within that cluster. Through profiling, a job or set of jobs can  be assigned to one of the 19 clusters. As labor market data can be reduced to mathematically related qualities, data collection, analysis, and model refinement can be readily pursued. The transfer of training inference also implies the possibility of cross-training students to perform well in several jobs within their matched job clusters. Profiling can be used for vocational guidance of students, curriculum and course planning, and for matching graduates with open jobs, as well as providing raw material for forecasting. (Author/EA)",

Program participants were selected on the basis of interviews with low income mothers and babysitters in the West Chester, Pennsylvania area who were potential and interested child-care workers, of low income families, and with no specific vocational training. Traditional group training was replaced by presentation of the training lessons individually by a  tutor in the participant's home. Test scores of the experimental training program participants on an objective instrument designed to measure knowledge of concepts and terminology relevant to early child development and behavior compared favorably with a similarly aimed program based on group sessions. Conclusions of an interview survey of experimental participants indicated that the program provided personal and vocational benefits that assisted participants for future child care employment and in working with their own children.

The guide has drawn on related training materials produced for a multi-state effort, \"Interstate Project: Planning in the SEA/LEA, the Next Step;\" in  addition, materials are included from a number of nonproject States. The guide is intentionally brief but is related to a source book which includes specific illustrations or examples to clarify the procedures outlined in this guide. (Author/AJ)",

The thrust of these proposals does not begin with a particular idea about how the interests of families might better be served by the schools, but rather seeks to determine whether there are mechanisms which might achieve that end. Consumer protection techniques are discussed, in detail, as viable forces to help change the position of families vis-a-vis schools. Each proposal is presented as having merit and as a potential complement to the others: however, each can stand independently as an approach to protecting the interests of families. Some areas discussed are: (1) the need for managing grievances between the parents and the schools, (2) the need for legal assistance when  adjudication of grievances becomes necessary, and (3) the need for organization of both parent and children's groups.

The first section of the book includes articles which attempt to enhance adult perceptions of young people, their attitudes and problems, and the diversity of motivations behind their use of drugs. Section 2 presents articles on specific drugs, both legal and illegal. Articles in Section 3 present a variety of current treatment program models and describe drug abuse research efforts. The final and most extensive  section of the book deals with matters relating to the specifics of the educational process as related to drug abuse. It is hoped that this publication will provide educators with valuable information about drugs and the drug scene, and will act as a catalyst in promoting the commitment and involvement needed to make the classroom an effective focus in drug abuse prevention.

Discussed also are selected difficulties and challenges faced by these families engaged in a process which requires the acquisition and maintenance of new behaviors. A potent force in this process has been the evolution of a multilevel family therapy program which utilizes the principle of an alternate living arrangement in conjunction with family therapy.

As the task force explored the subject of child abuse, it quickly realized the need for: (1) better state programs for the prevention, identification and treatment of child abuse; (2) more uniformity among state statutes relating to child abuse; and (3) more cooperation among states and among state agencies in exchanging appropriate information. To encourage states to focus attention on improved methods of reporting, preventing and treating child abuse, the task force asked Brian G. Fraser, staff attorney for the National Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Child Abuse and Neglect, to draft  suggested legislation. This booklet is the work of Mr. Fraser, drawn from his experiences during 1972-73. It represents a synthesis of the best of existing state legislation, plus additional language designed to strengthen state capabilities in working to solve the problems of child abuse. For those wishing further information, a bibliography and notes on legal references are included. (Author)",

Children have not been exposed to enough situations in which they become aware of their own feelings and to environments which encourage positive interactions with others. The purpose of this study was to develop some tools for creating environments conducive to developing a positive self-concept. The emphasis is on tying affective instructional objectives and objective assessment to an instructional sequence for improving the self-esteem of pupils in grades 3-5, particularly in schools undergoing much change. Results include 77 pages of activities and classroom management suggestions matched to 15 affective objectives. Thirty-two classes participated in this effort on an experimental basis  for 3 months. Three hundred and fifty students were pre-post assessed on the Bentley-Yeatts &quot;I feel . . . Me feel&quot; self-appraisal after assessment items and expectations levels had been identified for each of the objectives. While the limited instructional effort produced no startling changes in the self-esteem of the experimental students, research yielded valuable data on affective trends of children ages 5-9. In addition, ways were identified to insure a better fit between the objectives and the &quot;I feel . . . Me feel&quot; measure. (Author)",

Numerous studies have concluded, however, that these services are frequently uncoordinated, duplicative, wasteful, and ineffective. Yet when corrective actions are proposed, they deal only with fragments of the system. The Assembly Symposium on Services to Children and Youth was formed to serve as the focal point of responsibility for assessing the current conditions of children's services and generating and promoting changes in the system. The symposium was planned to extend over five phases, spanning a period of 16 months: The phases are: (1) advance data collection; (2) problem identification workshop; (3) task force studies of the major problem areas identified in  Phase 2; (4) mobilization of support through dissemination of task force findings and recommendations and a major children's services conference; and (5) preparation, introduction, and passage of a series of major bills supported by community and statewide organizations. This document summarizes the findings of Phase 1 and reports the findings of the workshop of Phase 2 by outlining specific problem statements and anticipated solutions.

The approach moved in several steps: (1) a detailed needs assessment and objective status assessment of on-going programs were undertaken; (2) a guidance model was built; (3) a program based essentially upon student needs was designed; (4) an implementation schedule and evaluation strategy for the program were programmed; (5) a task analysis to determine needed  staff competencies to deliver the program was begun; and (6) the design of in-service training programs and transportable practitioner training \"packages,\" was initiated.

The data centered on highest honors, high honors, and honors graduates during three recent graduation periods. Analysis of the data obtained through university records and through responses to a brief questionnaire was used to describe and generalize about the characteristics of honors graduates. The data indicated that the majority of these honors graduates were women who tended to receive their degree at a slightly earlier age than men. Nearly all of the superior students had demonstrated good scholarship before entering college. The ACT scores averaged far above the means for all college-bound students, with significantly  different means for the three honors levels. The proportion of honors graduates was found to vary significantly according to departments, with Mathematics and Communicative Disorders producing a consistently high proportion. Further profiling revealed that these students had come primarily from humble beginnings, and as college students took part in numerous college activities while maintaining heavy study loads. The authors point to the fact that the characteristics described in the study are associated with superior scholarship and do not necessarily imply a cause and effect relationship. The bulk of the document consists of data tables, accompanied by brief discussions associating the data with demographic variables. (Author/PC)",

        "description":"In an attempt to survey career attitudes of undergraduate women students, a pre-test/post-test research design was adopted. Questionnaire items attempted to measure career interests, the college role in forming or encouraging career choice, general personality characteristics, attitudes of respondents toward the college environment and their knowledge of women's employment patterns. The study admits to several limitations, including the fact that the questionnaire was given to a limited number of the undergraduate women in the U. S., and that the four groups sampled were not selected as a representative sample of all undergraduate women. Responses to the questionnaire did, however, point to a number of attitudes of the undergraduate women involved: (1) high career interests among  those samples; (2) the negative views of faculty, administration, and curricular response to these interests; and (3) the lack of knowledge of women's activities, underlying the need for women's study programs. The author suggests that, in view of the high attitudinal uniformity found in this limited study, colleges and universities undertake evaluations of their responses to the needs of the undergraduate women.

The theory assumes no special compounding or configurational process, and accounts for the learning of successive discriminations without the addition of any special process. The theory predicts the relative rates of acquiring simultaneous and successive discrimination, including the \"exceptions,\" and leads to correct predictions in a number of other paradigms. A computer simulation which embodies the context-sensitive theory confirms the predictions of the context theory of discrimination learning which has direct implications for research on types of learning process. Component, compound, and  configurational learning emerge as summary descriptions of performance in different situations, but according to the present theory are neither styles nor distinct types of learning since data from the various situations are predicted by a single process.

The Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory, Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, and California Test of Basic Skills were utilized in data collection and analysis. Also, an independent judge classified counselors into two groups, highly responsive and responsive counselors, for further analysis. Sample size consisted of 10 white female counselors and 10 black female counselors; each counselor counseled two male and two female black students for an average of 10 counseling sessions. The findings for this particular sample suggest the following conclusions: it is  the individuality of the counselor which has the greatest influence on the counseling relationship with black students, rather than the race (of the counselor), or sex (of the student), or personality (of counselor-student similarity). Also, both black and white counselors tend to underestimate the degree of unconditionality shown in the counseling relationship with black students. (Author/HMV)",

The industrial companies listed by Fortune Magazine as the 10 largest in sales and assets made up the corporate sample, and a listing of each of the companys' offices was obtained. A total of 15 companies and 1,074 positions were examined. The military sample included major positions in the Defense Department plus the major service commanders. Positions in the three branches of the federal government made up the political power sample. Results indicate that despite claims that women \"have come a long way,\" the  position of women within the \"power elite\" did not change during the period studied. (Author/HMV)",

Assertive training is defined as the facilitation of a set of skills designed to improve an individual's appropriate expression of his feelings, maintenance of personal rights and meeting of personal needs. The model described in this manual calls for eight two-hour weekly sessions. This format is viewed as optimal in that it allows group members opportunities to try out new behaviors in social situations between group meetings, and then to receive evaluative feedback in the safer group setting. The authors contend that the assertive training group, as a structured course, may be facilitated by a minimally-trained  person. Consequently the manual contains detailed instructions for the facilitator. Screening of participants is viewed as one of the most important variables in conducting an effective assertive training group because the group model provides a very structured and specific treatment. Participants with confounding psychological problems are viewed as inappropriate. Step-by-step course outlines are presented, as well as session notes for facilitators. (Author/PC)",

These influences result in the frequent inability of black youth to take advantage of opportunities that may be opening up for blacks in metro-east, through lack of example from &quot;significant others,&quot; faulty, or scanty information, or in some instances unrealistic goals. Another finding is the generally high aspirational level among black youth. Given a lack of opportunity or an inability to take advantage of opportunity, this  condition can lead to a highly frustrating and potentially explosive situation. Attempts by the community to improve the situation are described, resulting in programs and cultural enterprises by groups and individuals that involve the informal, primary-type relationships that prevail in black social life. It is recommended that counselors in the educational system become aware of black family structure and employ it as a model for counseling among black youth. (Author)",

The teacher-bias manipulation had no significant relationship to SAT performance on any of the testings, but teacher ranking was strongly and consistently related to SAT performance. The results indicate teachers are good predictors of student academic potential but do not bias students' achievement test performance. Two experimental studies were also conducted in order to examine developmental trends and mode of inducing bias on children's susceptibility to  experimenter bias. College students were trained to be experimenters in a simple motor performance task, marble dropping, in which experimenter-bias effects had been demonstrated previously. The major finding was a significant Age x Bias Condition X Sex of Subject (S) interaction indicating a general trend for older Ss to be more influenced by biasing effects of Es than younger Ss. The significant effects were unclear with respect to mode of biasing the experimenters. The test was disguised as a test to predict academic potential. (Author)",

Three experimental treatments were administered: (1) structured interaction materials; (2) group social modeling; and (3) a combination of group social modeling and subject participation. Study results were mixed. For males, none of the  experimental treatments showed significantly positive main effects, while for females the structured interaction plus modeling treatment did show significantly positive effects on two of the dependent variables.

        "description":"As part of the overall equal employment program, the Federal Women's Program was established, and annually examines areas of possible discrimination against women in Federal service. This series of reports analyzes the following: (1) the job series most used by HEW's several agencies, showing proportions of women regularly employed against the reservoir of those occupations in the national labor force; (2) the possibility of job discrimination in HEW in five different job series. Results indicate that HEW employs 11 percent of all women in the Federal Government, and that the 77,680 women employed in HEW constitute 62 percent of all the employees in the department. Women employees are a majority in the various agencies within the department except for the Center for Disease  Control and the Food and Drug Administration. The low ratios in these areas can be justified because the jobs within these agencies are in scientific fields where women do not predominate. A study of employees in five job series in HEW concluded that the presence of women in these fields was more than adequate when compared to their availability in the labor force (except social workers). The report concludes that if women within HEW are to achieve further equality of employment, they must seek training in fields where they are currently under-represented. (Author/PC)",

The project was conducted in three phases. Phase 1 employed a representative sample of children from the Lab School. The testing situation contained maximal university controls, permitting the testing of 28 dramatic dimensions per half-year intervals for ages 6-12. These data were compared to creativity indexes perfected by Torrance. Phase 2 employed similar procedures but  tested 260 subjects in their home schools across Florida. Phase 3 provided time for data processing and analysis. Major findings were as follows: (1) among Florida subjects, behavior increased with age (a finding the reverse of that discovered in New York), (2) Florida girls were more active than boys, and (3) the dramatic behavior correlated highly with the creativity measures. Other qualitative information was discovered. Finally, the results demonstrate the efficacy of the measures and procedures employed. (Author)",

Can acceptance of self and acceptance of others be shown to be related, as postulated, but remain distinguishable as separate constructs? Three constructs, self-acceptance, self-assessment, and acceptance of others, were selected for study so that their interrelationships could be observed. In order to determine what portion of systematic variance among subjects was attributable to valid assessment of the traits and what was due to method factors, each construct was measured by seven different methods. Subjects were 137 high school and college students, parents of high school students, and older adults who were  paid for taking the 3-hour battery of tests. The average convergent validity values were .54 for self-acceptance, .41 for self-assessment, and .40 for acceptance of others. The correlations among constructs using different methods showed strong discriminant validity when each of the two self-constructs was compared with acceptance of others. Although sufficient discrimination was demonstrated for self-acceptance and acceptance of others to warrant calling them separate constructs, the average correlation between the two of .21 was in keeping with their theoretical relationship.

Presented here are the efforts of cities and counties to control drug abuse, accompanied by comparisons with state actions where appropriate. A survey instrument was developed by the Drug Abuse Council, Inc. and distributed in 1972 to 409 cities and 313 counties, nationwide. Survey results for cities and counties were analyzed separately and were then further subdivided for analysis by size and by region. The five topic areas of the report are treatment and rehabilitation, education, law enforcement, administration, and funding. A major finding included the identification of nearly 1,000 methadone maintenance patients under the age of 18--a  surprisingly large number. Employment rates among individuals enrolled in state, city, and county operated methadone maintenance programs were found to be very low. The response by many public schools to student drug use was particularly disturbing, and while many jurisdictions provided statistics on the number of arrests for possession and sale of marijuana and heroin, few provided followup information on these arrests.

        "description":"This government publication presents statistics and discussion on teenage marriages, divorces, parenthood, and mortality. In sheer numbers teenagers account for a large share of the marriages and births, especially illegitimate births. In 1969, about one-third of all brides and 14 percent of grooms were teenagers; in 1968 17 percent of all births and nearly 50 percent of the illegitimate births were to teenage mothers. On the other hand, the proportion of divorces granted to teenagers is small. More significant is the large proportion of divorces granted to persons who married in their teens (46 percent for women and 19 percent for men). The total number of deaths among teenagers also is small, and the death rate from all causes combined is low. Motor vehicle accidents, however,  take a heavy toll from the teenage group; in 1969 the age group 15-19 years ranked a close second to the age group 20-24 years in more deaths from this cause than any of the other five-year age groups throughout the entire life span. These and other facts presented in this report on teenagers were derived from the vital statistics of the U. S. Bureau of the Census. Figures for marriages and divorces were obtained or estimated from data provided by states. Discussions of estimating procedures and of reliability of the estimate appear in the appendix to this report. (Author/PC)",

Nine RUS personnel were involved in the demonstration project and developed the following activities: (1) work on a statewide level to promote the usage of meaningful findings for program improvement; (2) work cooperatively with supervisors and administrators in solving vocational rehabilitation problems through research findings; (3) evaluate and interpret research findings for use in identifying new patterns for improved service delivery; (4) maintain informal contact with counselors in order to determine an adequate picture of their needs; (5) plan and provide  for temporary systems--institutes and seminars; and (6) conduct special studies for the purpose of determining program needs within the vocational rehabilitation department. Special attention is given in the report to the Research Information Center which helps to stimulate awareness and interest in research findings as well as in the maintenance of material from which new ideas for program improvement may be generated. The impact of the RUS project is discussed, and guidelines for the establishing of a rehabilitation agency information center are presented. (Author/PC)",

The primary goal is to train students to eliminate self-relevant thinking, and increase task-relevant thinking, i.e., to turn their attention from the self to the demands of the external situation. Three studies are described. The first involved 16 university students in three treatment conditions (Task-Attending, Task-Attending and Relaxation Training, and Self-Attending.) Results indicate that training in task-attending, with or without relaxation training, was beneficial to students' anxiety levels. The second study involved 48 test-anxious third and fourth graders. Sixteen children were placed in a task-attending training group, another 16 were in a placebo  treatment group while still another 16 were in a no-treatment control group. There was a reduction in test anxiety level for all groups, with the group given task-attending training showing the most improvement and the no-treatment group the least. The third study launched in Fall 1973 and continuing through Spring 1975 involves an ongoing project with university students, and examines effects of exposure to modeling video-tapes, and extensive task practice. The author believes test anxiety is only one aspect of a more general personality disposition of evaluation anxiety. (Author/HMV)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to determine how well children can identify the number of phonemic segments in spoken words and how this compares with their ability to deal similarly with syllables. The subjects were 46 preschoolers, 49 kindergarteners, and 40 first graders. Alphabetized class registers were used at each grade level to divide the children into two experimental groups, one assigned to phoneme segmentation and the other to syllable segmentation. The subjects were required to repeat a word or sound spoken by the examiner and to indicate, by tapping a wooden dowel on the table, the number of the segments (phonemes in one group, syllables in the other) in the stimulus items. The test trials consisted of 42 randomly assorted individual items of one, two, or three  segments which were presented without prior demonstration and corrected, as needed, immediately after the child's response. Testing was continued through all 42 items or until the child reached the criterion of tapping six consecutive trials correctly without demonstration. The results indicated that the test items were more readily segmented into syllables than into phonemes. Ability to perform phoneme segmentation did not appear until age 5, and then only in 17 percent of the subjects. (WR)",

        "description":"The pattern of errors of second grade pupils in reading isolated words was analyzed, particularly with respect to reversals of letter sequence and letter orientation. These occurred in significant quantity only among the poorer readers in the class. The two types of reversals were uncorrelated and, therefore, cannot reflect a single process. Sequence reversals were more closely related to other kinds of reading errors than were orientation reversals. The linguistic context as well as optical reversibility of letters is a determinant of confusions in letter orientation. Reading ability assessed by the analytic test composed of isolated words was highly correlated with reading proficiency on a conventional paragraphs test. This suggests that the problems of the beginning reader  have more to do with word construction than with strategies for scanning connected text. (Author)",

Earlier research with the Lindamood Auditory Conceptualization (LAC) Test identified this factor at each grade level, kindergarten through grade twelve, and delineated a LAC Test breakpoint score which was sharply discriminative of reading performance as measured by the individually administered Wide Range Achievement Test. In this study, over 1520 third grade students were tested on their ability to perceive number, identity, and sequence of phonemes in both isolated and syllabic relationship and to conceptualize the auditory stimulus with a sequence of colored blocks, as measured by the LAC Test. Performance was correlated with reading performance as measured by the  Cooperative Primary Reading Test (CPRT). The earlier findings were replicated. A comparable breakpoint score was sharply discriminative of reading performance, and a positive correlation was found between CPRT scores and LAC Test scores. This suggests that elemental phonemic analysis skills account for a significant proportion of the variability in measure of the most advanced skills in reading. (Author/TO)",

Results include concurrent correlation between letter, word, and text times ranging between .18 and .92 with a median of .77. Longitudinal correlations between grades two and six ranged from .21 to .96 with a median of .78 indicating a high level of developmental stability and strong relationships between the abilities to read letters or words rapidly at an earlier age and reading text rapidly at a later age. Multiple regression analyses indicate that letter time variance is associated with a median of 46 percent of text time variance, while additional skills affecting  word time variance is associated with a median of 27 percent of text time variance between grades two and six. These and the remaining results may be interpreted to indicate the existence of a developmental reading speed ability which is not primarily dependent on word identification or context-using skills.

A secondary portion of the experiment involved the use of non-story-related films with a third group of students as a positive reinforcement for good performance in daily reading exercises and good classroom behavior. The experiment lasted one school year. The eighth grade subjects were pretested and posttested with the Gates-MacGinitie Survey E, forms 1 and 3. Since the material in the basal reader did not fill the entire school year, supplementary materials were used to avoid decreasing the length of the experiment. The examination of possible difference between pretest scores and  posttest scores indicated no significant difference in favor of any of the three groups in vocabulary or comprehension. However, students in all three groups gained an average of one and one-half years in reading comprehension. (WR)",

        "description":"The problems with the premise that content area instructors should be teaching reading and study skills are many. Content teachers, particularly at the college level, disagree with the premise: \"If a student can't read, he doesn't belong in college\"--type of philosophy. On the whole, content teachers have never been exposed to a course on reading theory or skills. Many reading teachers and coordinators are not prepared properly to gain the interest or involvement of other teachers. But the biggest problem in obtaining the cooperation of other teachers in a developmental reading program is that reading personnel have turned reading into a course, or several courses, and in many cases reading labs and reading centers. Suggestions for making reading courses and reading teachers more  helpful for students and for content instructors include finding and using available research relating to reading in the content areas; providing services for subject matter teachers such as testing, conducting workshops for students and for staff members, making modules in vocabulary or comprehension, and explaining the program and offering materials for use in their classrooms; and developing credit courses and workshops in reading for teachers and students and using reading courses as preservice teacher training.

One group consisted of students whose performance was limited mainly by their ability to decode the printed symbols into a usable internal code, while the other group was limited more by cognitive factors centering on their inability to understand what they read. The information-limited boys were found to have an oral reading grade level over two years advanced beyond that expected from silent reading tests and from their verbal IQ, while the decoding-limited boys were average in all three areas.  Information-limited boys made more effective use of graphic and phonic cues while reading but were much less likely to conserve semantic information when they made reading errors. No consistent differences were found in the use of syntactic cues. (Author)",

In most of the studies relating E-I to verbal learning, the approach was to determine if there was an overall superiority for one of the personality groups. Differences in performance, even when obtained, do not prove that there are differences in learning rates. A stage analysis of paired-associate learning is one step in the direction of trying to localize the effects of E-I. Many researchers interested in the relationship of personality variables to verbal learning tasks are in essential agreement concerning the research strategy to be pursued. The shift is away from tasks such as paired-associate and  serial learning toward the free recall tasks and recognition tasks. These tasks provide tools to answer much more specific questions. The specific questions being asked include the relationship of anxiety, extraversion, neuroticism, and ego-involvement to clustering, filtering, categorizing, pigeon-holing, detection sensitivity, and decision criteria. Relationships of this type wil likely prove to be more valuable to our understanding of these personality dimensions. (Author/WR)",

The second is based on the improvement of memory due to basic mechanisms that may operate to produce marked increases in retentive abilities over the first few years of a child's life. The subjects were 45 kindergartners and 45 third graders randomly assigned to three experimental groups. The experimental conditions varied the amount of retention time between the original learning task and the retention tests. The retention intervals were six minutes, 48 hours, and four weeks. The learning task was a list of four paired  associates. In each pair, the response term was a high frequency, one-syllable English noun and the stimulus term was the Latin equivalent. The learning task and the retention tests were all conducted orally. The number of items correct on the three retention tests served as the dependent measure for analysis. The results indicated that when the degree of original learning is equated, children as young as five years of age can remember materials as well as third-graders over a retention interval as long as four weeks.

On the basis of fifth and sixth grade subjects' performance during the recall portion of that task, two groups of attenders were identified on the basis of visual error rate. Performance of those groups was then compared on a bisensory paired-associate task in which half of the bisensory pairs had the visual item defined as the nominal stimulus while half of the items had the auditory member so defined. Overall, the former condition was less difficult. An ordinal interaction was found in which the low  visual errors group outperformed the high visual errors group in the later trials of the visual stimulus condition.

An examination of the items in the subtests on vocabulary and comprehension suggested that at least 27 of the 82 items could be failed by pupils for reasons other than inability to read. The  materials intended for parents' use include samples of things parents can do to help with reading. The first samples are intended for use with younger children who are just beginning to read and contain activities for developing auditory discrimination, visual discrimination, and language development.

        "description":"This experiment investigated the assumption that children's learning and retention of prose material can be differentially affected by varying discrepancy from expectation (as established by an advance organizer). It was hypothesized that a passage which differed significantly from expectation would produce heightened arousal, which should in turn facilitate long- and short-term retention as measured by fact-inference comprehension measures. Furthermore, intermediate levels of discrepancy should produce better learning and retention than either the control or the completely discrepant extremes. From the data obtained, it was found that there was no significant effect on comprehension and retention due to passage condition. The retention interval effect indicated that forgetting  took place. There was also a significant interaction between comprehension type (literal versus inferential) and retention, suggesting that the learning characterized by one type of question was retained to a greater extent than that characterized by the other, or that probably the original learning of material relevant to one question type was greater than that for the other type.

The workshops were designed to acquaint the 60 participants with new reading techniques and to prepare them to return to their schools and pass these techniques on to the other teachers. Two methods were used to determine the effect these participants had on their school systems after 1 year: first, a reading survey was completed by the teachers in the schools where the workshop members taught and second, the workshop participants wrote a narrative summary of their year's activities. Data from the teachers indicated that their reading programs improved significantly, particularly with reference to the use of behavioral objectives and  reading programs for above and below average students. The workshop participants felt they had gained confidence, enthusiasm, awareness, and a sense of sharing with regard to the teaching of reading and were able to pass a degree of this on to other teachers in their buildings. Specific gains were made in establishing inservice programs, promoting individualized reading techniques, increasing the use of newspapers in the classroom, and developing resource banks and skill boxes.

A total of 30 teachers participated in the workshop. The workshop was evaluated by the participants through daily session evaluation checklists, a pre-post workshop content survey, and a workshop summary. The overall evaluation score for the workshop was 9.8 on a 10 point score. The responses on the pre-post workshop content survey indicated that the teachers gained knowledge of select aspects of reading techniques and concepts. Comments in the daily and overall  evaluations indicated that most teachers felt both a high degree of satisfaction with the workshop and that it had been a valuable part of their professional growth in the teaching of reading skills.

The first step suggested is to survey general reading ability within a school in order to formulate the direction the proposed lab should take--enrichment, developmental, corrective, or remedial. The second step involves determining philosophy and basic educational policy to be employed within the laboratory setting. Step 3 requires an initial analysis of skills needs followed by an on-going evaluation of progress based on daily performance, observable behavior, and development of positive attitudes. Step 4 involves determining which commercial and other  instructional materials would best aid the instructor and the student in meeting specific goals. The fifth and final step is the monitoring of students' needs and materials to allow for proper allocation of funds for further staff development as well as for future selection of materials. (WR)",

It also assures elementary students that their reading instruction won't be neglected as soon as they learn the alphabet. The Office of Education is working on the Right to Read program in all states, and the focus of these efforts is on the early years, in an attempt to prevent grave reading problems later, and on the elimination of illiteracy. The first move in this direction was the establishment of the Right to Read Office in 1969, which coordinated, observed, and evaluated more than 200 demonstration projects it  had funded to test the theories and practices of reading instruction. Title VII has established a National Reading Improvement Program to continue, expand, and follow up work begun by the Right to Read Office. The major emphasis of the new legislation's comprehensive program is on innovative reading projects, state programs, and areas of special emphasis. Information from reading programs like the ones in Chicago and Miami can be disseminated to other agencies. (SW)",

The subjects were 104 fourth-grade children attending two elementary schools located in middle-class residential areas. Twenty-six subjects were randomly assigned to each of two picture conditions. The other 52 subjects were randomly divided between two word conditions. The learning of the discrimination list consisted of picture pairs preceded by either relevant or irrelevant prefamiliarization training. In the relevant prefamiliarization condition, subjects were pre-exposed to the pictures which occurred in the discrimination task. In the irrelevant conditions, subjects were exposed to materials unrelated to the discrimination-task pictures. In the experiment  utilizing verbal materials, subjects learned a discrimination list consisting of word pairs after they received either relevant or irrelevant prefamiliarization training. A significant negative effect of prefamiliarization was found in both experiments.

        "description":"This study is both an interpretation and a translation of three modern Japanese plays, providing an artistic perspective on the radical reordering of experience and thought with which modern man must grapple in cross-cultural encounters. An introductory essay prefaces each play, providing a historical, critical, or appreciative perspective from which to read the plays. Selections include: &quot;The Golden Country,&quot; which tackles the theme of Japanese insensibility to Western concepts of God, sin, and death; &quot;Vanished,&quot; which appears to be European both in the recognition of nihilism at the core of human life and in the appropriation of a Christian theology of hope; and &quot;The Hour of the Rat,&quot; which attempts to revitalize traditions which have all but vanished from the surface of  Japanese consciousness. The translations constitute an important part of the study. (Author/RB)",

Educators must encourage and help students to function at their own levels as citizens in today's world. The curriculum must be life oriented to be meaningful, and it must be developed within available funds to be realistic. Teachers should involve students more in planning activities and in evaluating progress. Students should know why they are asked to undertake a certain study, what information they will gain from a particular experience, and what skills they are improving in and  which ones need more work. A teacher may take a simple folk tale like \"The Three Bears,\" which is a free resource, and with thought and careful planning involve students in thinking of other ways to present the tale than just reading and discussing it. Dramatizations, puppets, and flannel board figures may be possible media. Teachers might also be continually on the alert for worthwhile inexpensive learning materials and experiences that may be of interest to children. (SW)",

Imagery instructions significantly facilitated inferential comprehension on the short-term retention test but this effect disappeared a week later. On the other hand, imagery instructions significantly impaired long-term literal comprehension.

The test consists of twenty-five items of the three-option multiple-response type, with the stem of each item being a \"pattern\" sentence to be matched with one of the three options. A variety of syntactic structures and alternatives is involved, including options among infinitive, gerund, and noun clause constructions or among relative clause, adjective, participle, and appositive constructions; deletion or retention of optional elements; initial or final order of elements; and active or passive constructions. Some option sentences differ from pattern sentences in respect to one structural feature, while  others differ in respect to several features. Although the \"Agnate Sentences Test\" appears to have acceptable validity and reliability, a more refined instrument should be developed which focuses on the types of syntactic constructions and the quality of the option sentences.

OA students also need to develop their perceptions, imaginations, and abilities to express themselves in complex ways. One strategy employed to teach these advanced writing skills united memory, imagination, and form. After reading and discussing personal narratives, students wrote chronological narratives based on their memories about their parents. Next, they wrote of their own past experiences. Finally, they united their earlier essays in short story form, having come to an awareness that a story is made of memory,  imagination, and form. (SW)",

In random semesters from 1967 to the present, students in the beginning course in typography and graphic production at the University of Illinois were twice given the Maitland Graves test, an art-taste test. There were 142 males and 225 females among the first-test respondents; 118 males and 213  females took the second test. Test results verified the hypotheses. Granting the value of Maitland Graves's test, the raw data indicate that art taste--certainly an important ingredient in graphic design and visual communication--can be improved in the classroom.

This study deals with the respondent's recall of information contained within an advertisement as well as the subject's attitude toward the ad itslef and the product contained in the ad when the basic graphic design is manipulated--being either a circular, square, or triangular shaped advertisement. A mock-up of a new general readership magazine was developed with the manipulated advertisements for a new product inserted into three separate versions of the magazine. Ninety housewives and ninety college students were each shown one of the three  mock-up magazine versions in a personal interview, in-field situation and responded to the questionnaire immediately after being exposed to the stimuli. It was hypothesized that the circular graphic design would be most effective and that housewives and students would not differ in their reactions to the advertisement. The first hypothesis was given general support, while the second was not. Conclusions are drawn which relate to the study's findings and to future research in the graphic design area. (Author/TO)",

The variables were source orientation, message orientation, physical presence of source, and expected interaction with source. The subjects were 160 undergraduates at the University of Wisconsin, randomly assigned to conditions. In each session, the subjects completed source-message orientation scales and various disguised attitude assessment measures. They were given a brief description of the purported source of the message, and in one condition were told that the source wanted to discuss the message with them individually after the session. The subjects then  received the message from the source either in person or on a sound, color film of the source. The high message-oriented subjects, not the high source-oriented, changed their attitudes in the direction of the message more when the source was physically present than when he appeared on film. These results were discussed as indicating the need for more precision in defining source variables. (Author/WR)",

This study was a secondary analysis of data gathered during October 1973 by an introductory research methods class. Analyses were done on 524 undergraduate subjects and also on males and females separately. Only a modest six percent of the variance was explained for the sample. While high usage media, grade point average, and socioeconomic status correlated with occupational expectations, there was a dubious negative path from news  media usage to grade point average. The separate analyses for males and females revealed different paths accounting for thirteen percent and six percent of the variance, respectively. The inclusion of communication variables indicates that, with more refined measures, they may increase the prediction power of the Wisconsin model.

The utlimate concern was to better specify conditions which relate to a higher degree of accuracy between the three entities.

Until his death in 1927, Mesquita guided the newspaper's growth in all respects--editorial, political, technological, and economic. Julio de Mesquita Filho assumed leadership of the paper after his father's death. In 1930 &quot;O Estado&quot; backed Getulio Vargas for president, only to turn against him when Vargas' dictorial intent became apparent. In 1940 Vargas took over the paper and in 1945 the government returned the paper to the Mesquitas and &quot;O Estado&quot; immediately resumed its anti-Vargas stance, only to see Vargas' hand-picked successor elected to office. &quot;O Estado&quot; was a leader in modern production  techniques in the post-World War II period and also set high standards in employee benefits and working conditions. In the early 1960s, &quot;O Estado&quot; opposed the left-leaning government in power and supported the military takeover of 1964. Four years later the political climate, including institutionalized press censorship, was such that Mesquita Filho ceased writing editorials. At his death in 1969, &quot;O Estado&quot; was a prime target of government repression. (Author/RB)",

A brief history of the broadcast media and Canadian-American relations is presented along with reports which emphasize the vital role played by the media in establishing Canadian identity. Special attention is given to the development of Canadian cable television which has a special function within the broadcasting system. (RB)",

Political moves to the left in any country will hasten controls. Consumerism is militant in some countries, practically dormat in others. Although self regulation is strong in some countries, it is generally losing out to government regulation. Harmonization of laws advertising and its administration, though increasing, will be difficult to achieve in any meaningful terms. Successful advertisers are monitoring their markets, keeping pipelines open, putting emphasis on brands rather than on companies, following the International Chamber of Commerce Code, and avoiding paranoia and impatience with controls.

        "description":"It was the purpose of this study to provide a tool for designing and executing future research on panel data in which relationships between pairs of variables are observed over time so that contingent conditions can be controlled. The 360 subjects were selected from the telephone directory and surveyed at random about their responses to the Watergate hearings. The findings were heuristic in that they demonstrated the potential usefulness of this approach in the analysis of panel data and provided the beginnings of a plausible conceptualization of a political socialization process. The most surprising aspect of these findings was that significant changes in variables relationships were often related to a lack of mass media use or to low attention to Watergate. The conceptual  framework used in this study did not predict such results, which suggests that in some instances interpersonal communication, distrust of politicians, or Richard Nixon's image had more important effects for those who chose not to pay attention to the mass media. Future studies should consider the conceptualization of contingent variables for use in causal analyses of the type used in this study. (Author/RB)",

        "description":"A research team from the School of Journalism at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, designed a research methodology for tracing the flow of interpersonal communication in a community in a crisis situation. They devised a completely detailed research plan including advance arrangements, a trained research team, a suitable survey instrument, and arrangements for a standby sample. For the study, they selected nine test communities in Ontario and the Atlantic provinces. During the first year of operation, the team encountered a shoot-out involving the murder of a policeman and a subsequent manhunt in one community, and a severe blizzard immobilizing another community for 48 hours. While this paper explains the methodology rather than outlines the results, some of the conclusions  given include: (1) there is clear support for the multiple-step model; (2) evidence supports the idea of multiple-step flows without any involvement from the media; (3) there is some evidence that deviating chains originate around the scene of the disaster or very quickly after the impact of the event; (4) the longer the chain, the more likely the originating source will be a person involved rather than a media source; and (5) overhearing is a significant part of a long chain.

Some of the findings showed that there were significant differences between (1) speakers of black and white regional \"standards,\" (2) educated blacks and LSES black school children at both levels, (3) educated whites and LSES white second graders (but not senior high students), and (4) second graders and senior high black and white children. Differences attributable to education level and to race were statistically significant (.05) for all variables examined, and males  simplified with consistently greater frequency than did females.

The study was conducted in Wilkes County, Georgia, where all public school students in grades four through six attend one school. At the time of the study, mandatory statewide test results revealed that fourth-grade students were seven months below grade level and eighth graders were fourteen months below. Following a pretest, the American Newspaper Publishers Association (ANPA) Newspaper Test, Form J-1, 50 instructional modules were used for a period of 50  days in regularly scheduled social studies classes. Results from this second field test show that modular materials produced desired results. Elementary students scored highly significant gains in newspaper reading skills. Students did not differ significantly by sex. Gain was strongly influenced by prior reading ability. At two grade levels, race was not a factor in the amount of gain. Overall, results confirmed earlier studies that found the instructional modules to be effective. (SW)",

Any pregnant girl residing in the Waco Independent School District is eligible for admission by providing a signed statement from a medical doctor that she is pregnant and signed approval by a parent to attend the special classes. This paper is an outline of the program evaluation plan which is intended to assess the project's effectiveness in the following areas: (1) promoting  continuance in school, (2) improving the outcome of pregnancy, and (3) reducing the number of subsequent pregnancies. A comparison with control groups will provide the measure of effectiveness. The evaluation design will lend itself to direct and continuous feedback to the program and enable programmatic changes during the academic year. The continuous feedback from such a design will permit changes in the program to be made at the end of each semester rather than waiting until the end of the year. (RWP)",

        "description":"Traditional forms of psychotherapy have dealt with helping the client change in order to better cope with society. This speech suggests that another form of psychotherapy would encourage the therapist to work to change society. The author contends that since social conditions are often the cause of psychosis, social conditions ought to be the basis for some alternative forms of psychotherapy. He proposes that therapists see themselves as agents of change in a society which is dehumanizing and distructive of self, joy and responsible satisfaction. He identifies new personality problems produced by modern society and describes the modern well-adjusted personality. He also describes an agency which he developed in which concerned individuals devote their careers just to humanizing  themselves and second, to initiating projects and approaches which would direct their own disciplines toward humanizing societies and institutions.

The sample population consisted of self-admitted abusers of various drugs, identified shortly after entering the Air Force. The subjects (N=4688) were located through the Drug Control Office at Lackland Air Force Base. Variables studied were race, hometown, Aptitude Index, years of education, age or time of enlistment and performance in the Air Force. Study results indicate that: (1) A positive relationship exists between the extent of cannabis use and abuse of other drugs (hallucinogens, amphetamines, barbiturates, opiates, and volatile substances); (2) The percentage of cannabis users is proportionally greater in the North-Northwest and Far West-Pacific Coast than  in the Mid-Atlantic, North Central and Far South - Southwest areas; (3) The greater the cannabis abuse, the more likely the subject is to have lower aptitude and fewer than 12 years of education; (4) Cannabis is the drug of preference among whites although Black users abuse it more frequently; and (5) Cannabis users have lower performance ratings and promotion rates compared to the control sample.

        "description":"A private corporation conducted a study for the United States Air Force in 1973, investigating the long term effects of drug use on general mental ability. The air force personnel selected for participation in the study were 3741 known drug users and 6772 controls. Subjects received requests to sign a form allowing their high schools to release their transcripts and test scores to the Air Force. Signed releases were forwarded to the high schools who in turn sent transcripts and test scores to the Air Force. Scores of the various general ability tests which subjects had taken in high school were converted to a standard form and compared with scores on the Airman Qualifying Examination (AQE). Results indicate little or no significant change in mental ability as a result of drug  use. Such differences as did exist cannot be stated to be a function of drug use per se; the fact of drug use seems far more important than any other variable. Peer group influences on drug users and the attitudes of the drug user group toward the Air Force, and possibly toward the AQE, could have differed sufficiently from those of the control group when the subjects took the AQE to cause the slight differences in mental ability observed between the two groups. Extensive (n-46) data tables follow the body of the report. (Author/NM)",

        "description":"This paper explores the ramifications and limitations of communication theory and decision theory in analyses of the developmental process. To date, change theory has been of only limited use as a basis for analyses of process in specific developmental efforts and for comparative studies among projects. It is possible that a more adequate basis for analyses of process requires a concommitant concern for theories of communication and decision-making. Concern with decision-making has often focused on who makes decisions and the status of the decision-makers. Such studies have generally assumed recognized decision points and deliberate decision-making rather than decision by default or nondeliberate decision-making, that is, the failure to identify decision points and to recognize  the delimiting nature of those decisions being made. An examination of the nondecisions may be more fruitful than of the decisions and decision process. The author considers the interface of decision-making, nondecision-making, and communication, and their interface with change theories, with particular emphasis on their relevance to the developmental process in two naturalistic urban settings. Desired outcomes include the clarification of possible new ways of looking at the developmental process and the stimulation of research on such areas. (Author/RWP)",

The effectiveness of two processes of social influence, expert power and referent (modeling) power, were measured in three different age groups-early adolescence, middle adolescence, and adulthood-in a drug education program. Learning of factual information and attitude change served as dependent variables. Results indicated strong age--specific effects. Expertise was most effective with adults, modeling most effective with early adolescents. Relationships between effectiveness and age level were monotonic. Implications are drawn for the study of adolescence, the study of attitude change, and the design of drug education programs. (Author)",

The purpose of the model was to involve the students in activities in the homes in which they lived during the quarter, the local community and the school itself, beginning the first week of the quarter. This was accomplished by: (1) planning activities every week; (2) assisting the students in meeting new friends; (3) meeting individually  with the students regularly; and (4) having each student complete two attitudinal questionnaires bimonthly.

Raters scored the response units of clients and therapists and labeled as complementary the following elicitation-response sequences: Dominance followed by submissive behavior; submissive behavior followed by dominance; friendliness followed by friendliness; and hostility followed by hostility. Comparisons between outcome groups showed no differences in therapist complementarity during the early stage (as predicted); a significantly lower level of therapist complementarity for the successful group during  the middle stage (contrary to prediction). Furthermore, during the early stage of therapy more disturbed clients elicited greater therapist complementarity (as predicted). Two significant points are: (1) No single level of therapist complementarity is associated with successful, as opposed to unsuccessful, outcome; and (2) The therapeutic timing of complementarity levels is crucial to facilitate constructive client change.

The personality need factors which seem to contribute most to the relationship with general college student satisfaction were autonomy, heterosexuality, deference, endurance, order, nurturance, and abasement. Most of the factors also correlate with religiosity.

A two-way analysis of variance revealed a significant main effect for group size and no significance for training duration. These findings were interpreted in terms of group dynamics. It was proposed that larger groups provided more positive counseling experiences for modeling and/or smaller groups produced more inhibition due to greater peer  influence.

All of these modes generally employ a factual approach. The author contends that none of these modes has been very successful.

Behavioral objectives for the students were written in the areas of word recognition skills, vocabulary skills, comprehension skills, speed and accuracy skills, and composite reading skill ability. Approximately 190 sixth graders were assigned to six classes and met each school day for 55 minutes. The teaching strategies involved teaching the student at his own instructional reading level, allowing the student to progress at his own rate of accomplishment, sequential reading instruction, and discussing with the students prior to the beginning of the program changes that were  being made in the program. The materials used in the project consisted of published basal nongraded texts, skill books, and comprehension kits. The conclusions indicated that the program was beneficial to the majority of students, that more books and skill books were needed to meet class needs, and that while not all of the objectives were achieved there were indications that each of them would have been if the project had been in effect a full year.

        "description":"Getting into print is a matter of writing something that someone else wants to read, and writing it so clearly that it can be read easily and effectively. Some aspiring young authors think that getting published is mainly a matter of knowing the editor. Rather than knowing the editor, you should first know your purpose in writing. Second, know your intended audience. Third, know appropriate publications. The criteria by which manuscripts are evaluated are usually not difficult to discover. Check the information in a journal's masthead or somewhere in the vicinity of its table of contents. General criteria almost always echo the audience being served--or that is the intent of the criteria. Do not send a manuscript to more than one publisher at a time. Cover letters usually don't  do any harm, but they probably don't do much good either. If a cover letter is needed to explain some circumstance that is not obvious in the manuscript, then use a cover letter. Otherwise, a manuscript either stands on its own or it doesn't. The format of the paper should follow the requirements of the journal to which it is being submitted. If a manuscript is accepted for publication, it is not uncommon for a year to pass between the time it is sent and the time it appears in print. (WR)",

Methodologies for determining levels of reading in career fields were reviewed, as were readability measures which could serve as integral parts of reading requirements methodologies. The most desirable methodology had to be objective, valid, inexpensive and easy to apply, and not overly time consuming. The methodology decided upon involved the application of a readability formula to random samples of reading materials taken  from five technical courses at Lowry Air Force Base. The Forecast formula was selected as the readability measure. The results indicated that the methodology selected could be applied quite easily to entire Air Force career fields; once the representative sample of reading material has been collected, it is an easy matter to determine readability; and the Forcast formula appears to have the greatest potential for use in the field.

The project was carried out in one inner-city middle school--seventh and eighth grades--(Rhodes Middle School, Philadelphia). The aims of the project were to use television as a means for children to read and for drawing administrators and teachers into utilizing the television teaching technique. The Individualized Television Reading Program was used by four teachers and 850 students over a 5-week period. A survey determined the students' favorite programs, which were then video-taped and their scripts obtained. Classroom exercises in which the script was the basic resource enabled the students to use the television dialogue while working on skill lessons for reading. The project  appeared to be successful, generating positive response from students and teachers, reducing absenteeism and discipline problems among the experimental group, and eliciting requests for the program from other schools in the city. Although the interest was high, and expansion of the program into many schools was assured, there appeared to be a need for additional evaluation to ascertain reading achievement and motivation to learn in measurable terms.

The subjects, 137 first graders, were randomly assigned to treatment groups and were given four types of tests: the learning test trials used to evaluate progress during the learning session; a 24 hour test used to evaluate retention of the words; a posttest used to evaluate retention of the words over a longer period of time; and a transfer test used to evaluate the ability to recognize unpracticed words that used the same initial and final elements as  those used in the practiced word lists. The analyses of the correct answers made on each source of cue combined with each list type resulted in three sources of variation which were significant or approached significance on all tests. The main effect of high and low ability grouping, minimal and maximal contrast list types, and sex was significant. (WR)",

Two years of research has led to three conclusions: literacy is a construct which is meaningful only in a specific cultural context; literacy is two-dimensional, rather than uni-dimensional; and literacy is a construct which is directly related (in a mathematical sense) to success in adult life. To define success the APL uses an index which is a composite of income, level of education, occupational prestige, and a measure of expressed personal  satisfaction with one's vocation and general status in life. In order to estimate population parameters and to perform a final validation of the items and objectives, a national survey on the areas of occupational knowledge and consumer economics, conducted by Opinion Research Corporation according to APL specifications, has just been completed. The results suggest that far more adults are \"illiterate,\" in the sense of being able to apply skills to problem areas which are derived from pragmatic adult requirements, than was expected. (WR)",

When applied to communications theory, entropy increases not only with noise but with the density of information--particles of possible meaning crowded into a channel at too high a rate for the receiver's decoding ability. Entropy is lowered by redundancies (familiar information) which allow the receiver to anticipate and thus comprehend what will be said next. Entropy is a metaphor in physics and chemistry and a metaphor built on a metaphor in communications theory, where the idea of noise substitutes for the unavailable energy, which is then calculated mathematically and not  measured empirically. By examining the idea of entropy, rhetorical theorists can avoid the particular limitations analogical thought tends to establish and explore qualitatively the factors that tend to disorder and to order in rhetorical systems.

This approach recognizes the differences in language ability discussed by James Deese in \"Psycholinguistics,\" who associates formal, highly structured speech with middle and upper classes, and restricted speech of limited syntax with the lower class. With the guided method, the teacher aids students both in learning sentence structure, grammar, and syntax, and in developing evaluative judgment and self-confidence. Free writing advocates may  use the Ken Macrorie method of requesting spontaneous writing for a specified length of time, emphasizing the avoidance of phony pretentious language. A fine balance is necessary between encouraging creativity and imposing discipline as needed by students for realizing their potential. (JM)",

Evidence to support this thesis is presented from two perspectives--the level of reading difficulty of the tests and the restricted dialectal characteristic of the language used in the tests. The Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT)-Verbal readability test results are discussed in relation to Chicanos and Southern nonmetropolitan blacks. The dialectal features of admissions tests are discussed in terms of their range of verbal and discourse skills and the analytical skills involved in the SAT-Verbal are compared with a framework of basic discourse and semantic skills.

Such study can contribute to an understanding of the ways in which people misuse and manipulate language for their own ends. The underlying belief system of the speaker, what linguists and philosophers call presuppositions, determines the choice of syntactic construction and specific words in a given utterance. The term \"style\" presupposes that there is not a single way of saying what we have to say, but in fact that we have available to us many possible choices for expressing outselves. The choice of style, however, is limited by our presuppositions, our estimation of  our audience, and the contextual limitations dictated by our cultural expectations. Two linguistic areas that relate to analysis of style are syntax and word-choice. Syntactic exploitation refers to the use of sentence structures that permit deletion of linguistic material when deletion occurs in contexts where the reader is unable to recover the deleted material. Exploitation through word-choice can be divided into two types: the use of words for their emotional effect, their connotations, and for labeling; and metaphors. (WR)",

Moreover, attempts to overcome this difficulty by conducting classes in which students discuss the work freely often degenerate into cliche swapping and the cataloguing of superficialities. One solution to these problems is to take advantage of students' immense experience with the popular arts, considering literature as anything with a strong verbal element--including music. Students' internalized knowledge of these arts provides great enjoyment and an understanding of their structures. Thus, effective descriptive criticism in literature study can both proceed on the assumption that all works are contrived from similar  conventions and structures, and lead to comprehension, discussion, and appreciation of less familiar areas.

It also presents a variety of class exercises which include problems in logic built from hypothetical murder cases, vocabulary drills, and working with such concepts as truth, falsity, validity,  invalidity, the probable, the possible, and the major concept of mystery fiction: paralogism, the art of telling the truth in such a way that the reader is induced into coming to a false conclusion. The subsequent reading units consider plot, characterization, and setting and atmosphere. A review of the structural elements is the next unit, using in-class discussion of short stories. In the final unit, the students read, study, and prepare critical essays for each of two novels. (TO)",

Because so many English majors will spend part of all of their professional lives teaching, their training at both the undergraduate and graduate levels should prepare them for teaching, but it does not. Writing is what English majors who teach know least about, and that is what they will spend most of their time teaching. One solution to the need for more teachers in remedial courses involves using English majors as tutors. Another approach to a remedial English course is to involve students in a team-teaching venture. The advantage of peer-tutoring and team-teaching is that students learn from each other, and this  provides an opportunity for remedial students to improve their reading and writing skills while the English major acquires valuable teaching experience in the initial stages of education, long before he is responsible for several classes of students.

        "description":"Social revolutions, which frequently use the press as a propaganda weapon, have been rare in Latin America despite the striking social inequalities of the region. Only three classic socioeconomic revolutions have unfolded in the hemisphere--in Mexico in 1910, in Bolivia in 1952, and in Cuba in 1959. Bolivia attempted to effect radical reforms through the democratic process, until the military seized the revolution in 1964. The press was decisive in fomenting and implementing the Bolivian National Revolution (1952-1964), guided by the political group known as the Movimiento Nacionalists Revolucionario (MNR). It is this phenomenon that this study examines. The Bolivian National Revolution would not have succeeded if the MNR had not aroused and sustained the social conscience of the  small middle class through newspapers and literature. &quot;La Nacion,&quot; official newspaper spokesman of the revolution for 12 years, declared, &quot;Traditionally, the MNR is a party of journalists. The founding staff was (in 1941) almost totally composed of newspapermen. As the years passed, those men occupied high functions in the government and in diplomacy, but almost always as a consequence of their activity displayed in the press.&quot; (TO)",

A review of the literature on conferencing led to the hypothesis that students who had individual conferences would improve their writing significantly more than those students who did not. In both the control group and the conference group, the same amount of reading and writing was assigned each week. The results of this study indicate that it is questionable to invest the amount of time spent in six conferences, as was done in this study. Beyond the first two conferences the data indicated the students did not learn any more than if they spent the time in class. (RB)",

        "description":"The workshop method of teaching a college literature course has proved an effective means of stimulating independent student work, promoting teacher-student conferences, and providing for peer criticism. Discussions of both some specific principles of literary criticism and the historical background of the period to be studied introduce the course, which continues with student reading assignments followed by a short assigned paper. Student-teacher conferences then focus on these papers while the next reading and writing assignments commence. During the subsequent workshop sessions, good and bad passages from various papers are read and criticized, giving students simultaneous discussions of the literary works and their treatments of it. Individual papers receive explicit  comments, but no grades. The final grade is based on the five papers the student considers to be his best. Since good writing--thought organized to a purpose--is compatible with any discipline, this workshop method may be used to advantage in any academic department. (JM)",

The language of many black people reflects both pidgin English--minimal communication produced by a conflict between seventeenth-century English and West African languages, and West African language structure--lacking verb or noun endings. Black English features, as seen in a typical example of one black student's composition papers, consist of few inflectional verb and noun endings, and the unusual use of derivational morphemes. To effectively help in the  development of black students' writing, teachers' usual compulsive concern for correct mechanics should be replaced by an emphasis on students' writing more coherently (especially in theme development) and interestingly in their own dialect. (An appendix includes the black student's paper and an examination of Black English morphological examples.) (JM)",

Summer institutes designed specifically for community college teachers, and increased attendance at national conferences such as the College English Association and the Conference on College Composition and Communication provided further information. As a result, a flexible M. A. program has developed with these degree requirements: (1) six four-hour English courses, (2) five of the four-hour specifically community college courses, (3) an internship in  teaching, (4) reading knowledge of one foreign language, and (5) a comprehensive written exam. In addition, experienced two-year college teachers are being used, graduate courses are offered at night, University of Florida faculty travel to community colleges to teach, and a close relationship has been established between the university and the community colleges.

Three scales measure those three factors, with each scale being scored on a five-point basis and the highest possible score being fifteen. The measure scores written responses to questions about selections from three stories, each of which has three to five questions particular to it. The estimated reliability of the whole test, if three additional selections and sets of questions are used, is .89. Correlations between scales range from .63 to .88. Correlations between story selections range from .54 to .78.

The list of 22 topics in NRMS came from a survey of several guides on books for teenagers. To explore the reliability of the scale, five groups of students, with over 400 in each group, were asked to use the scale on a different novel each member of the group had recently read in school. The average agreement over all themes ranged from 70 to 84 percent. Additional reliability data came from small groups of English teachers who used the scale on the same five novels on which the students had reported. Teachers and students agreed on the presence or absence of 17 to 22  of the 22 themes.

Each scale is scored 1, 2, or 3, depending on how much of the scale element is present in the narrative, with the highest possible score being 54. Scales were selected on the basis of a review of literary theory and criticism and previous research in children's writing, an examination of previous composition scales, and an analysis of a large number of children's narratives from grades 4 through 6. Concurrent validity was provided by the correlation of narrative scores by three judges using a quick-impression Q-sort and three different judges using GNCS, resulting in a  correlation coefficient of .80.

Many pedagogical practices in speech communication have remained unchanged for 50 years; however, the past decade has seen the development of a trend to specify the outcome of speech communication instruction in behavioral terms. The formulation and implementation of behavioral objectives requires the adoption of the behaviorist perspective. The behavioral view of stimulus and response, cause and effect, and independent and dependent variables provides the underlying rationale for the notion of behavioral objectives and clearly places this approach to communication education in the  archaic realm of causal determinism. While maintaining that the statement of the objectives is a needed and necessary task of any teacher for the purposes of classroom organization and accountability, the statement of the objective in behavioral terms is inappropriate for the teaching of much of the content of the communication discipline.

        "description":"A critical review of the small group literature is undertaken in an attempt to identify those characteristics which distinguish the dyad, the two-person group, from larger groups. Comparisons of dyads to larger groups are made in five categories of major small group variables: influence processes, affiliation processes, role differentiation and variability, task factors, and communication patterns. Ten important empirical and conceptual distinctions are analyzed, and the major limitations in the research are noted. Three implications of the unique nature of the dyad are suggested: results of research based on large groups may not be generalized to dyads; results based on dyads may not be generalized to larger groups; and in spite of several similarities between dyads and larger  groups, the distinctive features of several major dyadic components serve to distinguish the dyad as a unique communication system.

Relation, to Buber, is the direct and immediate response where two people share mutually with one another. It is this kind of interaction that is sought in the use of theater games where players are urged to act in relation to what the others are creating. The resulting improvisations become, in time, a spontaneous kind of ensemble acting wherein each is part of the whole, a unity. The philosophy of Buber and the games theory of Spolin combine to aid not only the teaching of acting but the teaching of all subjects through the technique of self-discovery. (RB)",

The recommendations of the group fall into two categories: problems which need solving to improve the ability of speech-communication teachers in community-junior colleges to better meet the needs of the community, and steps which the Central States Speech Association (CSSA) can take to promote this problem solution. Some of the problems identified in category 1 include: development of materials to aid remedial students of speech-communication as well as students who use English as a second language; development of ideas, methods, and promotions which will extend the speech-communication teacher into the community to create more student  demand for courses at the two-year college; promotion of more forensics tournaments to draw high school students to community-junior college speech programs; and development of workshops to service specific needs of the community. Recommendations in category 2 include: CSSA and State association providing more leadership, promoting exchange between community-junior college instructors and four-year instructors, and publishing a journal oriented to practical concerns of teaching techniques.

        "description":"Improving the economic condition of the Negro was a fundamental concern of both W. E. B. DuBois and Booker T. Washington. It was Washington's view that the Negro should be willing to perform menial tasks as a means for gaining a foothold in the economic structure. He counseled the Negro to start at the bottom. Washington's philosophy centered on education, patience, and then eventual advancement. The distinction between DuBois and Washington on education was one of degree. Washington minimized the importance of a college education while duBois called for a group of well-educated black leaders to work in Negro communities for the advancement of the others in the community. As an issue, education to advance the Negro economically indicates a similarity between the two speakers. The  basis for the debate is clearer on the issue of social status. Washington did not deal with most of the inequities and instead tended to assure the white Southerner that the Negro did not want social integration. DuBois openly discussed the problem and regarded it as fundamental to the rights of man. The debate suggests several important implications for the study of minority rhetoric. It would appear that if a black leader wishes to be supported by whites, his viewpoints must avoid direct threats and demands. (WR)",

The paradigms that exist in the field of communication are discussed, and the inability of most of them to cope with the full range of communication transactions that researchers want to know something about is pointed out. The metaphor presented for the new structure for understanding the communication process considers all communication to be an environment. Also presented are illustrations of how context analysis works--the method of identifying the significant characteristics as a whole, the subsystems of which it is composed, the larger system within which it functions, and  all the significant relationships among them. Finally, the speaker presents questions related to how media environments work. (WR)",

        "description":"This paper presents an approach to setting and evaluating experiential objectives for instruction in interpersonal communication. The first step suggested is to establish a set of experiential goals most likely to evoke personally meaningful student learning. Sample goals include: (1) the use of observation to identify and report on behaviors of other students, communication behaviors of people on the job, and communication behaviors of people in situations comparable to those in which they would like to improve; (2) creatively writing a short story, play, or poem, and/or doing a drawing; and (3) teaching someone about interpersonal communication by interviewing another student and tutoring him to meet his needs, and/or creating a game or exercise to help another learn a skill in  communication. The procedure for evaluating students' work involves commenting on how well the experience was used for learning, and the procedure for grading should be based on how much effort was made to undertake potentially worthwhile experiences. It is suggested that the instructor can best accomplish this by deciding on a minimum set of experiences that will most likely cover the basic essentials of the course. (WR)",

The last two papers provided input for consideration of the practical problems in transition from old to  new teacher preparation models. Some of the recommendations resulting from deliberation included careful specification of the competencies in communication that teachers seek to develop in children, increase in the quantity and quality of communications addressed to teachers, improved training of teachers, and the organization of university instructors politically to effect changes in local school settings, State departments of public instruction, and national agencies and organizations.

Using the approach developed by Ernest Bormann, the rhetorical critic examines man's symbolic reality and reacts to it by looking for strategies that are inherent in certain dramas. Conspiracy dramas are popular in America and provide a means for explaining the method. In analyzing a rhetorical vision that has a conspiracy plot line, the one predictable character in the drama is the super-hero. The conspiracy drama employs three predictable modes of action for the super-hero: to piece together the conspiracy, to uncover the secret plans of the villain, and to punish the conspirators. (This method of rhetorical criticism is applied to the Indian  movement of the 1960s, which failed to gather the attention gained by other movements during the same time period.) (RB)",

The first is the principle of equifinality which explains the activities of open systems. If the researcher views society as an open system, he frees himself from the client approach since society generates its own innovation and diffuses it through internal processes. The second principle is mutual causation. The concept of mutual causation is crucial to an understanding of innovation diffusion in rapidly changing societies since it allows an examination of complex interdependent sets of communication behaviors. Finally, the notion of purpose in modern systems theory explains how open systems strike a satisfactory balance between  deviation-amplifying processes, such as the diffusion of innovation, and deviation-counteracting processes. Through the exercise of choice, systems evolve in healthy fashion and avert the communication disintegration which Toffler believes is the inevitable byproduct of an accelerating rate of technological change.

The present document explores this philosophy which takes into account the wide range of physical, intellectual, and emotional differences among pupils who are between childhood and adolescence. Among the labels applied to these pupils are transecents and emerging adolescents. While no attempt to categorize them is wholly satisfactory, these students are generally identified as those in grades 5 or 6-8, or as 10- 14-year-olds. The major portion of this presentation covers middle school historical roots and present trends, philosophy, ideal program characteristics, and staff. Recurrent themes include individual attention and continuous progress up the &quot;school  ladder.&quot; Various transitional and exploratory functions of the middle school institution are examined.

For the sake of convenience as well as for improved analysis, the paper divides the statutes into three broad categories of community use of school property, general purpose use, and use at board discretion; however, the similarities among these categories become readily apparent. Highlighting trends in recent court decisions and the issues involved, the second part of the monograph  covers case analyses and clarification of State statutes in the areas of tort liability, leasing and selling, deed clauses, and constitutional issues.

Three themes recur throughout the monograph--that there is a dynamic relationship between educational politics and societal change, that political culture is a powerful determinant of the style and structure of educational politics, and that professional and employee interests dominate in the governance of education. The first part of the monograph addresses conceptual and methodological approaches to the study of educational politics. The authors then examine the main arenas and salient issues in  educational politics. Local, urban, State, and Federal educational politics are discussed in subsequent chapters. The monograph concludes with a summary chapter that suggests implications and directions for future research in the field. An extensive bibliography is included. (Author/JF)",

        "author":["Weiner, Stephen S."],
        "description":"Educational voucher plans envision the creation of diverse educational options among which informed parents may make a choice for the schooling of their children. One specific voucher plan--the \"regulated, compensatory voucher\" plan advocated by the Center for the Study of Public Policy (the CSPP model)--has given rise to a federal effort to create and evaluate local school district demonstrations of a voucher concept. Only one demonstration is under way at this time--the Alum Rock Union Elementary School District (K-8) in San Jose, California, which began a \"transition model\" voucher demonstration in September 1972. Essentially a summary of some of the major implementation problems encountered in the OEO-Alum Rock demonstration, this paper examines briefly the degree to which  the Alum Rock demonstration departs from the model espoused by the Office of Economic Opportunity. Examined are two major sources of modification of the CSPP model--the process of negotiation between OEO and the Alum Rock District which led to the initiation of the Alum Rock demonstration and the process of implementation within the District itself. The Alum Rock demonstration was initially conceived as a voucher experiment designed to empower parents. In operation, however, it has turned into a project involving a substantial decentralization of authority, coupled with a limited form of open enrollment, that has largely served to empower teachers.

Survey data reveal a positive relationship between perception of and/or participation in the committee and feelings of direct and representational influence over and identification with school decisionmaking. However, while participation in the citizen committee seems to increase citizen feelings of control over school decisionmaking, the case studies demonstrate that, in fact, these committees have no influence.

There is also little available evidence regarding the permanence of the nongraded organization among schools that adopted the innovation. The project considered here developed and validated criteria for the nongraded school idea. Nongraded schools in every State were surveyed as to the extent to which the criteria were present in their programs. Data were also collected relating to the organization, implementation, and persistence of the idea. Additionally, perceived reasons for discontinuing a nongraded program were surveyed and analyzed. Outcomes of the study offer clarification of the nongraded concept, the extent to which  this form of school organization exists, and reasons for apparent success or discontinuance. (Author)",

        "description":"This paper focuses attention on the critical importance of zoning and housing to education. It covers the causes of undersirable housing patterns, the apparent effects of these patterns on educational achievement, and possibilities for positive action to reverse the negative effects. Although examples are drawn from Santa Clara County, the thesis applies as a model of what can happen wherever large concentrations of poor people develop. Undesirable housing patterns are caused by: (1) zoning and construction practices that tend to reinforce economic and minority segregation, (2) overt discrimination against minorities, (3) the shortage of low cost rental units and dependence on local initiative for more low cost housing, and (4) lack of overall planning in urban renewal projects.  These patterns can be prevented by the expansion of low income housing distributed throughout the comminity; the adoption and enforcement of fair housing legislation; and the continual revision of zoning, housing, and subdivision regulations to further the goal of a heterogeneous community.

Followup data will be requested from these young adults at intervals over a projected total period of 6-8 years. These data will facilitate the identification of major branching or decision points that affect educational and life patterns in the immediate postsecondary period. Additionally, these data are intended to provide valuable information for planners, policymakers, and educational researchers as a basis for improving the educational system by making it more responsive to students  and their needs. The report first describes the planning and development of the study and then presents a brief description of the characteristics, plans, and attitudes of the students as they were about to leave high school.

According to the \"breakthrough\" view of research, curriculum development and curriculum practice exhibit a deductive applied relationship to curriculum research. The obvious fault in this view is that it ignores the milieu of value claims about what is ideal and what is best under the circumstances and, instead, makes the assumption that a research \"is\" has the power of a practical \"ought\" prescription. The general problems for research are those of elaborating the practical circumstances and practical possibilities entailed by particular theories and lines of research, the matching of these into more or less compatible mixes, and the making available of this work to practitioners. The principal aim of  curriculum research is less with the generation of new knowledge than it is with the improvement of school practices. The principal function of teachers in curriculum decisionmaking is to arrive at a defensible basis for choice among an array of alternatives. The preparation of these alternatives remains as a research and development problem. A second line of research is in the field of graduate level instruction in curriculum. This field is in need of theoretical development of terms and frameworks useful in readying research findings for use by education students. (Author/DN)",

On June 28, 1971, the Los Angeles City Board of Education mandated that a school-community advisory council be established in every regular elementary and secondary school in the district. To evaluate the performance of those councils, survey questionnaires were sent to all school principals and advisory council chairmen; and to selected council members, parents, teachers, community representatives, and students. This report contains (1) a presentation of the statistical information compiled from all the respondents who returned one of the questionnaires; (2) an analysis of the open-ended response questions in  an effort to summarize the many points of view in terms of identified strengths, weaknesses, or recommendations; and (3) an attempt to evaluate council effectiveness based on such factors as council structure, involvement, cooperation, and experience.

Gwaltney, Andburg, Blumberg, Weber and Amidon, and Marquit have studied the differing perceptions of supervisory behavior by teachers, supervisors, and administrators. Gross and Herriot and later Goldman and Heald have identified specific aspects of administration and supervisory behavior which have considerable impact on teachers' attitudes toward general supervisory and administrative behavior patterns. Trask and Croft have described the state of supervisory practices in certain districts and the adaptations made by teachers and principals to supervisory expectations. Ziolkowski attempts to determine differences in supervisory  practices in schools rated high on teacher effectiveness and in those rated low on teacher effectiveness. More recently, Wilson and his associates, in studying supervision from a sociological point of view, have developed a new concept of supervision--comprehensive planning. The research objectives and findings of these and other studies are reported in this review. (Author/DN)",

It describes in summary form the major school finance changes made in 1973 by Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Montana, North Dakota, Utah, and Wisconsin. State legislative sessions in these States produced substantive enactments aimed at equalizing either educational opportunity or the tax burden or both. To distribute resources to school districts equitably, States are using a modification of &quot;district power equalizing&quot; (DPE). Under DPE a State would guarantee the revenue yield per pupil from a given local property tax rate. Where the actual revenue raised by the rate in a district is less than the guarantee, State funds would make up the  difference; where actual revenue is more, the State would recapture the excess. The recapture feature is generally either eliminated or restricted. The report also reviews property tax relief and reform efforts underway in Maryland, Oregon, Florida, Vermont, and California. It considers efforts being made to take into account the needs of tenants in property tax relief packages. (Author/DN)",

        "description":"There exists a body of theory and assumption that runs squarely at odds with that which has provided the ideological underpinnings of educational administration as it has been developed over the past two decades. The ideological conflict between these two views rests on two fundamentally different ways of looking at the world. One is the established view both in the study of organizations generally and in the study of educational administration in particular. The philosophical basis of this natural systems view is realism--the world exists and is knowable as it really is, and organizations are real entities with lives of their own. The philosophical basis of the alternative phenomenological view is idealism--the world exists, but different people construe it in very different  ways. Organizations are invented social reality. This paper outlines the phenomenological view and recommends its application both in organization and administrative theory. The author concludes that no general science of organization and administration is at hand and that the possibility of training administrators through the study of organization theory has been seriously overestimated. He suggests that research into organization problems should consider and begin to use the phenomenological perspective. A selected list of references is included. (Author/DN)",

While the application of these methods is generally appropriate, differences in subject matter highlight the problem of inferring political theory from numerical data. In this paper, several different political models for explaining trustee voting behavior are postulated--models which, in fact, have identical representations in terms of recorded votes and, hence, factor patterns. Further, actual voting records of two boards are analyzed in order to illustrate two different types of voting behavior. Explanations for these differences require additional knowledge concerning variables other than the votes themselves. Finally, there is a  discussion of some of the modes of analysis currently in use, with recommendations as to the best alternatives. (Author/DN)",

Findings indicate that, of the measurable factors affecting the quality of local educational opportunity, district size is most critical. Districts of minimal size are generally inadequate to the task of providing the broad range of educational programs and services demanded of today's schools. Overly small teacher-pupil ratios, limited facilities, and disproportionate administrative costs cause operating costs per pupil in small districts to run higher than those in larger districts. The unequal distribution of local school revenue resources is a second serious problem  in Illinois. The quality of educational programs, services, and personnel offered by both the sample's dual and unit districts ranged from very limited to comprehensive in scope. The appendix contains detailed enrollment and finance data for Illinois school districts by county. (Author/DN)",

More research into the decision making functions of boards was needed, and one opportunity to do further research was presented in an upstate school district in New York. A moderately sized city with a K-12 school population of 3,200 changed from an appointed school board to an elected school board. To establish if the former appointed school board had made decisions in a manner different from that of the current elected school board, content analysis of school board minutes was used. Five broad areas of school functioning were used to classify the demands recorded in the school board minutes. A 6-month period in 1968-1969 under the appointed board was compared to the  identical six month period in 1970-1971 under the elected board. With several exceptions, the school district under the appointed board seemed to be the mirror image of the district under the elected board. (Author/JF)",

From this project three papers resulted that outlined a potential dissemination model designed to be useful to local educators in communicating elements of any educational accountability model. The model was tested in 1974. This limited test was aimed at investigating the reactions of participants at the local level to attempt to train them to disseminate elements of the model.

        "description":"This paper argues that research on innovation and organizational change should shift its focus from the impact of individuals to that of organizational structure and environmental factors. The results of two research projects carried out in 1968-69 and 1969-70 on organizational change in school districts are presented to support the premise that complex organizations with heterogeneous environments are more likely to initiate and sustain innovative behavior than are simple organizations with relatively homogeneous environments. Some organizational policy implications suggested in light of the findings are that deliberate attempts should be made to build differentiation and complexity into an organization's structure, interorganizational committees on innovation should be set up,  and channels of communication should be opened to an organization's environment.

Groups of first-year students from 20 different high schools in Victoria, Australia, were selected for comparison during one school year across three categories: open and traditional, metropolitan and rural location of groups, and school size. Differences over time were assessed by using an analysis of covariance technique, and differences between the two groups were assessed by t-tests. Research findings indicate in part that open groups were,  toward the end of the school year, significantly more positive in their attitudes toward high school than were the traditional groups, and that open groups were also significantly more collaborative. Although the groups showed no significant difference with respect to preferred activities, the open groups did fall well below the performance levels of the traditional groups in creative thinking early in the school year.

A wide range of studies has demonstrated that the family's socioeconomic status and racial background, as well as the socioeconomic and racial composition of the school's student body, are correlated with both student achievement and mean school achievement. The high correlation between family background and school composition in both individual and mean school achievement, however, does not demonstrate that these variables are the cause of differences in achievement. The small number of exceptions at least suggests that a significantly higher achievement is possible in low SES schools, and  that significantly lower achievement sometimes occurs in high SES schools. Similar exceptions to the major regression line demonstrate that reasonably high achievement is possible in low SES black schools. The present research is an attempt to identify some factors that may explain the differences in the level of achievement among schools with similar socioeconomic status and racial composition.

Usually such efforts have a specific time orientation. Planning is further related to policy in the sense that policy is a legitimized procedure or course of action. The logic suggests that planning should precede procedure specification and formal policy action. Computer simulation is a relatively new approach to the study and further understanding of complex entities and situations. The computer program is the embodiment of the real world event or entity of interest. Its primary advantage is the computer's capability of storing, manipulating, recombining, and reporting the past, current, and  future states of numerous variables which together comprise the total behavior of a complex event or system. In this sense, the computer exceeds the intellectual capacity of the average person who would experience difficulty comprehending the totality of input variables, interaction effects, and current states of the system.

The strategy is known as the &quot;Advocate Team&quot; approach. The advocate team is a small, carefully selected group of people who assume responsibility for developing and recommending a plan which is preferred over a number of seriously considered alternatives. In some applications of the techniques, more than one advocate team is assigned to solve the same planning problem. The teams used in Kansas City were expected to generate and assess seemingly viable program alternatives and to determine their comparative value when viewed in terms of available opportunities and recognized constraints. Further, advocate teams were expected to provide the strongest possible  rationale for their final recommended courses of action and to deliver a usable product by an established deadline.

The survey results indicate that the amount of innovative effort per pupil is dramatically and inversely related to size of district. Individualized instruction and team teaching were the innovation types cites most frequently as the most significant in 1970-71.  There is a strong tendency for showcase innovations to be directed to the elementary level, with considerably less emphasis on senior high schools and very little attention paid to middle or junior high school years. Teachers are by far the highest participants in innovations, and internal resources generally received more usage than did external resources.

Accountability must be construed as a two-way relationship between and among all participants at all levels of the educational process.

The analyses of survey data from 3,450 students in 14 urban high schools show that a school's stability (rates of truancy, vandalism, and protests) is related to its procedures for deciding rules as well as to the content of the school rules.

        "description":"In October 1973, representatives of six groups of Tennesseans reflecting professional and lay opinion about education were asked to identify what they considered to be the most critical current issues in Tennessee education. The most frequently mentioned responses in this initial phase of the survey were used to construct a listing of 10 key issues, which listing was printed on a business reply card along with instructions for ranking the issues in order of importance. In a second phase, the survey instrument thus developed was sent to a larger sample of the same six groups of Tennesseans. A remarkably high degree of association was found to exist among the opinions of the six groups of Tennesseans with regard to the relative importance of the survey issues. The 10 critical  issues as identified and ranked by the professional and lay groups were: (1) financing education--including salaries; (2) teacher competence; (3) vocational education programs; (4) discipline; (5) lack of concern by pupils, staff, parents, and public; (6) size of classes--overcrowding and overloaded staff; (7) improvement of general curriculum; (8) inadequate facilities; (9) special education programs; and (10) administrative reform and/or reorganization.

They differ further in their interest in dealing with administrative problems, filling leadership roles, developing curriculum, and carrying out instructional research. These differences make worthwhile the investigation of alternate staffing concepts. Such an investigation should examine existing staffing programs in schools to determine the strengths and weaknesses of staffing theories, as well as their implementation in schools. It should examine the costs of such programs in relation to alternative staffing patterns and seek evidence of changes in  pupil performance that have been associated with different staffing patterns.

The objectives, suggested activities, and materials are usually organized sequentially according to the following levels: preacademic, primary, intermediate, prevocational, and vocational. The following are arithmetic skills specified for levels: facts and processes, money, time, and measurement at preacademic through intermediate levels; reading/writing numbers and measuring/counting skills at the prevocational level; and activities such as computing costs of utilities from utility bills  at the vocational level. Skills focused on in language arts are speaking, listening, writing, visual discrimination, vocabulary, comprehension, and reading at preacademic through prevocational levels; and listening, spelling, and oral and written communication at the vocational level. The following are among activities offered in the other five subject areas: setting up a classroom bank with play deposit slips for learning how to save (preacademic and intermediate levels) in the area of social living and management of materials; developing a skit on bus manners (vocational level) in the area of transportation; playing a circle game (primary level) to learn physical and mental health; playing games with a miniature traffic light (preacademic level) to demonstrate safety; and assisting in a  neighborhood service center (vocational level).

        "description":"Whether grouping children into special classes on the basis of IQ scores is educationally defensible was investigated using 492 educable mentally retarded (EMR) students, 12-15 years of age, during two field tests (1971-73). The curriculum used was the Me and My Environment biological sciences program. The following three test instruments were developed and administered: the Cognitive Development/Problem Solving (CD/PS) Test of Developmental Level, teacher ratings of students, and student performance measures for program units 1, 2, and 4. Analysis of data was achieved through 28 regression analyses involving 17 variables such as the student performance measure, the four CD/PS subtests, six teacher ratings, demographic variables, and test class data. Results showed that it is  possible to measure levels of cognitive development with the CD/PS Test without the measure of IQ. Factors of IQ, age, sex, and ethnic background accounted for little or no explained variance over seven replications. Implications included exploration of strategies such as developmental tests for assessing performance abilities of EMR children.

A protable minicomputer was used to present \"old letters\" (usual lower case letters) and \"new letters\" (letter-like figures consisting of vertical lines and shorter horizontal lines) on a screen alternately in 10 trial blocks during 21 days. The computer automatically calculated a student's response latency and errors for four conditions (successive and simultaneous old and new letters). Results of statistical analysis indicated no significant differences between the groups in their central processing of information on the four task conditions, and  significantly higher latencies for the EMR group. Both groups improved with practice. The differences in attention, orientation to the stimulus response selection, and speed of motor activities were thought to account for the differences between normal and EMR retarded children.

First contacts with parents are said to be improved with communication techniques that involve the positive view, an attitude of giving, perception of parents' feelings, recognition of each child's differences and parents' expectations, and ability to interpret the program. The guide suggests the kinds of information the School might use to build family profiles. Guidelines are given for the following parent involvement strategies: family members as volunteers, the newsletter,  observation of school activities, home followup reports to parents, sharing the learning accomplishment profile with parents, informal verbal feedback, individual conferences, individual home programs, materials-making workshops, group meetings, ideas for brothers and sisters, and information and referral services.

Mathematics clinics are seen to serve two purposes: helping individual children overcome their special mathematics learning difficulties, and training teacher/specialists in clinical techniques of diagnosis and remediation. Few teacher education institutions are thought to adequately prepare teachers to deal with learning problems in mathematics, though statistics show that up to 35% of elementary school students are underachieving in mathematics. Among the purposes of the Arizona clinic are devising instructional materials appropriate for training  teacher/specialists and developing theoretical models and procedures for diagnosis and remediation. The clinic's student clinicians and professional personnel provide diagnosis and implement remedial work for school children clinical operations are integrated with a graduate course which focuses on diagnostic-prescriptive procedures in school mathematics. A chart shows mathematics learning center operations over a 21-week period from preliminary publicity through the final exam. (DB)",

The following recommendations are reported: States should adopt a common language pertaining to certification; universal reciprocity should be endorsed by all States; all teachers of the mentally retarded should meet standard minimal certification requirements; minimal requirements should show competency in areas such as basic knowledge and teaching methods;  teacher training institutions should be responsible for judging the teaching competence of graduates; and teacher training should be governed by standards for admission, advancement, retention, and due process.

Typical behavior and developmental characteristics as well as child rearing suggestions are given for the following age levels: infancy, 2 - 4 years, 4 - 8 years, 8 - 12 years, and over 12 years. In opposing the tendency to institutionalize Down's children early in life, the author notes a survey which showed that three fourths of the families who keep the child at home make a good adjustment. Guidelines for selecting an  institution and reasons for later placement (such as behavior problems) are provided as is the suggestion that residential hostels are more suitable than large institutions for adult retardates.

It is noted that Louisiana Law requires public education of all exceptional children between 3 and 21 years of age with IQs above 25. Reported is a 1973 survey which had the following findings: (1) almost half of Louisiana children identified as needing special education were not receiving it; (2) most children receiving special education services were in public schools; (3) private and public agencies other than public schools offered more services to the trainable mentally retarded than any other group; (4) special education needs of the physically handicapped,  emotionally disturbed, learning disabled, and visually impaired were not being met by either public schools or other agencies; (5) public schools emphasized services at the elementary level with few programs for preschool and secondary students; (6) private and other public special education agencies placed a greater emphasis on preschool and secondary levels than did the public schools; and (7) most children receiving special education in the public schools were placed in special classes with very little use made of techniques such as mainstreaming. It is recommended that an additional $23.4 million be provided for special education services during the 1974-75 school year, that an additional 34 evaluation teams be established at university special education centers, and that an  additional 74 speech therapists, 903 special education teachers, and 2,138 aides be provided.

It notes functions of six scientific research ophthalmological institutes, 100 medical institutes for training medical workers, research laboratories, scientific societies, and institutions such as  children's eye hospitals. Glaucoma, which causes blindness, and nearsightedness, which leads to eye disabilities are cited as problems, preventions noted are examinations of the over-40-year old population and attention to favorable conditions for visual work. Children are said to receive eye examinations in preschool and schools. Research on eye damage is seen to have resulted in safety and sanitary measures in factories and on farms with subsequent reduction of eye damage by a factor of six.

        "author":["Goodstein, H. A."],
        "description":"This paper reviews evaluation and research activities of Project MATH (Mathematics Activities for Teaching the Handicapped) during 1972-1973, and discusses evaluation of curriculum materials for educable mentally handicapped (EMH) populations. It briefly describes field tests in six cities involving our 100 teachers (primary through junior high levels). The field tests, concerning number and operation strands, involved program evaluation, collection of biodemographic information, teacher tracking of daily instruction, computer processing, and a questionnaire for teachers. The paper also describes concurrent curriculum review, another review by mathematicians, and implementation of research studies. The following issues are considered: (1) Researchers tend to make evaluation  designs that overestimate the amount of data necessary for revision. (2) Researchers tend to overestimate usefulness of empirical data for curriculum evaluation. (3) The \"representative\" field test has a hallowed position it may not deserve. (4) The nature of the educable mentally retarded population restricts usefulness of evaluation designs that rely on pupil change data. (5) Demonstration of effectiveness decreases with increased magnitude of the curriculum being developed. It is suggested that many issues thought to require large-scale field tests could be determined with a few carefully controlled research studies, and that mechanisms and criteria be developed to select the best sequence for studies. It is noted that Project MATH people have decided to stay with small sample, short  duration studies. (MC)",

The value of a parents' group is seen to lie in the purposeful use of group dynamics and group processes by trained leader. Discussed are the role of the group leader; the process of selection including factors such as size of group, organizational setting, nature of the children's handicaps, and specific categories of parents; and group goals (primarily supportive in nature). Suggestions are given for managing the external structure of the group's dynamics in the areas of setting, number of meetings (12 to 15 sessions are recommended), spacing of meetings (weekly or biweekly), group size (10 to 15 members), and meeting  time and place. Guidelines are offered for managing the internal structure of the group's dynamics in such situations as silences, direct questions, and expressions of hostility and for making the most of each phase of group development as well as positive and negative impact of group members on each other. Briefly discussed are parental concerns such as intense anxiety about the handicapped child's future. Listed are 23 suggested readings. (DB)",

        "description":"The effectiveness of three methods of physical education programing for improving the physical performance and reducing undesirable behavior of 96 emotionally disturbed boys (ages 8 to 14 years) was studied in an 8-week summer camp setting. Subjects were initially diagnosed and grouped by psychiatrists as aggressive, hyperactive, or withdrawn. Stratified randomization was then used to assign Ss to the treatments of physical fitness, general coordination, specific coordination, and control. Pretest and posttest data were collected in 3 motoric areas (strength, endurance, and coordination) and 15 affective areas (subscales of Devereux and Quay instruments). Covariance analysis indicated that while specific coordination procedures yielded superior performance on the motoric  measures, little change in affective aspects was noted among the four treatments.

The guidelines are said to emphasize process rather than content of decision making in an effort to encourage innovation, provide for flexibility, and develop continuing programs of professional development. Assumptions of the guidelines are said to include extension of the right to education to all children. It is explained that the guidelines were developed from results of regional conferences and a DELPHI survey. Presented for each guideline are the guideline statement, alternative statements, rationale for the guideline, and positive and negative examples of guideline applications. Guidelines in the area of recruitment/selection are  concerned with selection from a broad base, effectiveness with children, mobility of individuals into new positions, criteria, the selection process, evaluation, exceptional citizens, and experience. Guidelines concerned with preparation are divided into the following categories: needs assessment, resource analysis, curriculum and methods, practicums, evaluation, and personnel. Guidelines for certification are presented in terms of criteria, renewal, range, evaluation, reciprocity, and experimentation. Suggested guidelines for professional performance deal with individual accountability, participation in evaluation, institutional support of inservice education, the right to perform within ethical standards, and grievance procedures.

The chapter on cable television considers principles of cable television, the model for a cable television cooperative, steps in establishing the cooperative, television training and production workshops for deaf people, program production by agencies other than cable television operators, and distribution models for the cooperative. Among conclusions noted is that cable operators are willing to telecast but reluctant to produce programs for the deaf. Discussed are aspects of original television programing derived from a national survey of programing needs of deaf  people and activities of the Deafness Research and Training Center. Conclusions and recommendations center on increasing the production, dissemination, and evaluation of television programs appropriate for deaf viewers. Alternative visual supplements including sign language inserts and captions are compared. It is concluded that use of the insert is easier and cheaper for the broadcaster, while captions can be understood by more people. Research is urged in all areas of television for deaf people. Local broadcasters are encouraged to produce original materials for the deaf, modify regular programs, and rent specially modified programs. Local deaf communities are encouraged to ask broadcasters for special programing. Publicity brochures, illustrations, and survey results are appended.  (DB)",

It is noted that blind students should be coached, instructed, and encouraged in the same manner as sighted students although additional safety precautions should be employed. Psychological implications for the blind student learning to ski are given to include building confidence through mastery of graduated experiences and imagining various positions and terrains. Instructors are advised to allow students to feel all parts of the ski while learning nomenclature, to converse with students prior to instruction, to begin slowly and never forget safety, to stay close to the student, and to provide a marker for the student to wear to caution other skiers. It is suggested that  instructors lead the partially sighted and follow the blind, alert students when to unload from a Poma lift, take certain positions to aid students in riding the chair lift, and ski backwards holding student's ski tips for teaching wedged turns. Suggested for training instructors to teach the blind is blocking vision of one instructor, who then follows directions of another instructor. (MC)",

Findings for six hypotheses indicated: (1) that a positive relationship existed between the number of occupational aptitude patterns (OAPs) obtained on the General Aptitude Test Battery (GATB) and the NATB; (2) that the mean number of OAPs identified by the NATB was significantly higher than the mean number of OAPs identified by the GATB; (3) that all aptitude scores (on both tests) except on clerical perception were  significantly related to full scale IQ; (4) that there was no difference in relationship between verbal IQ and cognitive aptitude scores by students on both tests; (5) that there was a positive relationship between performance IQ and all aptitude measures of the GATB and NATB with the exception of the clerical perception and motor coordination measures; and (6) that there was a significant relationship on both tests between reading score measures and aptitude scores for intelligence, verbal ability, numerical ability, and motor coordination.

Noted are aspects of the FEFP Act (1973) such as requiring change from instructional units to full-time equivalents (FTE) as the basic revenue allocation unit for funding the 15 special programs. Discussed are the funding histories of the Department of Education (DOE) and the Department of Health and Rehabilitation Services (DHRS), and the case study methodology involving interview schedules and data report forms. Given for the 10 districts are conclusions and recommendations  regarding assignment of students and teachers, identification and classification of students, initiation and deletion of special programs, and provision of programs in rural areas. Reported for the five residential institutions are advantages and disadvantages of the FTE program related to teaching staff, curriculum design, program availability, and identification and classification of students. Major results are given to indicate cautious optimism regarding improvement of school programs by FEFP, and advantages of FEFP in areas such as reduced teaching load and improved programs in institutions. Ten tables summarize responses to questions, comments, and recommendations by administrators, coordinating principals, special teachers, speech therapists, counselors, and DHRS personnel.  (MC)",

        "description":"The second of two volumes presents descriptive and statistical data collected in a study to determine the impact of the Florida Education Finance Program (FEFP) on special programs for exceptional children in 10 school districts and program development in five institutions. Case studies of the 10 districts give county code designation, date of interview, numbers of personnel interviewed, a description of the school setting, and staff findings in areas such as student identification deadline, change in size of special education (SE) classes, due process in student assignment to SE classes, FEFP emphasis on SE, full-time versus part-time classes, hiring and assignment of teachers, and allocation of materials. Tables summarize answers to questions such as &quot;What programs do you plan  to offer next year?&quot; and responses by administrators, SE coordinators, regular teachers, visiting teachers, and psychologists. Case studies of the five institutions involve statistical data and descriptions in areas of teaching staff, curriculum, student assessment, program availability, and identification of classification of students. Noted are teacher certification levels and additional salary comparisons of institutional and district educational personnel. Attention is directed to study limitations such as data based on personal opinion without supporting data, and operation of FEFP for a period of three and a half months prior to the study. A glossary of terms such as cost factors is included. (MC)",

Reviewed are the historical development of special education since the revolution and the commitment of the Soviet government to the education of handicapped children. It is explained that handicapped children are educated in special boarding schools for the deaf, hard of hearing, blind, partially sighted, mentally retarded, speech handicapped, motor handicapped, or multiply handicapped. Mentioned are criteria for acceptance at the special schools and the provision of general education, vocational training, and guaranteed jobs to all  children of special schools. Explained is education of teachers in departments of defectology and the remuneration which is 25 percent higher than that received by teachers of normal children. Stressed for the retarded are individualized instruction and development of good work habits. Stressed for the deaf is language and speech development through use of specialized equipment and techniques. Stressed for the blind and partially sighted is compensation for the disability through use of optical or tactile aids. Stressed for the deaf and blind are self-care skills and communication skills.

        "description":"Intonation patterns of Black English were studied and compared with those occurring in White English and formal Black English. It was found that: (1) the Black English corpus was characterized by a wider pitch range, extending into higher pitch levels than either the White vernacular or the formal Black English of the adult information; (2) a falsetto register was used in Black English more often than either White English or formal Black English; and (3) more rising and level final contours were used in Black English, while White English and formal Black English used more falling final contours. This study provides evidence, never previously reported, of the use of intonation alone in Black English to serve a grammatical function of marking the dependent clause of a conditional  sentence, without concomitant use of the lexical item \"if\". It is concluded that intonation cannot be studied apart from the social situation. The majority of the intonational characteristics found in the Black English corpus can be traced directly to systematic differences between black street culture and white \"mainstream\" culture, rather than to any systematic differences in phonology per se, and may be accounted for as resulting from different \"social rules\" for speech with black street culture.

        "description":"The linguistic relativity hypothesis is the view that the language a person speaks influences his perception of the world. This hypothesis is frequently misunderstood to be a question of the influence of language on culture, when in reality it emphasizes the influence of language on the cognition of its speakers. This distinction between culture and cognition needs to be made clear, since the time dimension is different; the relationship between language and culture is diachronic, whereas that between language and cognition is synchronic. Lately, the hypothesis of linguistic relativity has lost influence because of the growth of interest in linguistic universals. Acceptance of one does not dictate rejection of the other, in that the two deal with language at different levels of  abstraction. Experiments conducted to test the hypothesis of linguistic relativity have contributed to its loss of credibility, in that they have contained conceptual and methodological shortcomings. However, certain psychological concepts, such as selectivity and distortion in perception, offer sound support for the hypothesis. For future use, the hypothesis needs to be restricted in definition, emphasizing that language is only one of many factors influencing individual perception and cognition. (LG)",

This paper is part of a larger work on negation in which it is argued that a language system is a dynamic system based on oppositions (with predominant binary oppositions) where negation is latently present in weighing distinctions and discerning essentials from unessentials (i.e., in the lexical system, in denoting concepts) and before uttering judgments (i.e., in syntax). The theories of the following linguists are discussed in the present work: (1) van Ginneken, (2) Gebauer, (3) Travnicek, (4) Jespersen, (5) Mathesius, (6) Vachek, and (7) Skalicka. Otto Jespersen's \"Negation in English and Other  Languages,\" which explains a fluctuation in the development of negative expressions, is treated in some detail.

Past education projects which have been affected by the application of linguistic principles are Breakthrough to Literacy, which involved the recognition of linguistic competence, and Literary Stylistics, which employed linguistics for understanding literary effects. The potential contribution of linguistics to language education is high. However, there are difficulties of implementation which must be overcome. The primary difficulty in the use of linguistics is the amount of formalism the subject contains, prohibiting its application to  classroom teaching. Thus, what teachers need is not linguistics, but functional \"language awareness\" as employed in the Language in Use Project. However, \"language awareness\" must be based on \"linguistic awareness,\" which involves establishing training criteria for teachers that will close the gap between formalism and functionalism.

The basic claim of these non-English-speaking children is that in refusing to meet their learning needs, the district is violating their right to adequate educational opportunity under the equal protection clause of the Constitution. The social, economic, and political discrimination against the Chinese and Mexican-Americans forced them into an isolation that has resulted in large communities of non-English-speaking students in California and the Southwest. Since language is an integral part of the ethnic culture of the students involved, discrimination based on  language is one manifestation of discrimination based on national origin. In the Lau case, the Ninth Circuit Court ruled that there could be no state action unless the school district had had a specific intent to discriminate. However, the Supreme Court on other occasions has found a seemingly nondiscriminatory policy to be a violation of equal protection when it had a discriminatory impact. It is possible to find both the teachers and the funds to implement the required programs, and the question now is to what extent the courts will become involved in the education process.

        "description":"Four hypotheses concerning the linguistic structure of yes-no questions and their answers are considered as hypotheses relating to the abstract structure of yes-no questions and to this abstract structure in all human languages. The universal base hypotheses are the following: (1) The abstract representation of all yes-no questions includes two disjunctively connected declarative sentences, symbolizable as X or Not-X. (2) The abstract representation includes a component paraphrasable as I ASK YOU TO TELL ME. (3) For a semantic subclass of yes-no questions, those called &quot;biased&quot; ones, the abstract representation includes an additional declarative sentence. (4) Answers and questions are in a member-to-class relationship with each other. Eighty-five languages form the data base  against which these hypotheses are tested. The structure of all yes-no questions is shown to be, on some level of representation, complex rather than simple. The underlying X or Not-X structure is shown to be subordinated to a sentence paraphrasable as I ASK YOU TO TELL ME. The underlying structure of tag questions differs from that of neutral yes-no questions since it contains an additional copy of the suggested answer. Evidence is also found to support the fourth hypothesis. (Author/PM)",

The goal of this theory is to make precise and explicit the ability of native speakers to produce utterances of a particular language. In generative phonology, the level of the phoneme is redefined to match the deeper level of abstraction aimed for in the most efficient conception of phonological processes. It is the task of the phonological rules to account for the predictable aspects of pronunciation whether they relate to alternate pronunciations of the same basic morpheme or different phonetic forms that a sound can take. These rules, made to look like \"mathematical formulas,\" provide an explicit means of capturing the general  principles of various phonological processes: 1) assimilation, 2) neutralization, 3) deletion, 4) coalescence, 5) epenthesis, and 6) redistribution. The incorporation of distinctive features into a generative phonology allows the linguist to state explicitly important generalizations about the phonology of a language. (PM)",

        "description":"This work asserts that contrastive analysis should be regarded as a technique of research and not limited to error prediction and material preparation. Introductory observations are made on the state of the field, the domain of contrastive analysis, contrastive analysis and transfer, and contrastive analysis and foreign language instruction. In considering the psychological reality of contrastive theory, the established theories of error predictability and interference are shown to be unsuitable, because in the learning of a foreign language, the native and foreign grammars interact, forming a \"super-grammar,\" the evidence for which is drawn from psychology, theoretical grammar models, and linguistics facts. To support the validity of the \"super-grammar\" theory, current  contrastive analysis approaches are demonstrated to be deficient because they separate the components of languages in order to contrast them, thereby ignoring the fact that language learning involves the internalization of the structure of a language as a whole. Because this kind of analysis is faulty, a new, more comprehensive approach is necessary, one which answers the question, \"How are syntactic structures organized to convey meaning?\" rather than \"How are syntactic structures organized when viewed in isolation?\" This new view considers extralinguistic factors as well as linguistic factors.

However, there is a growing awareness of the similarities of the various types of English teaching, as well as a recognition of the need for communication among teachers. Well-designed TESL or TEFL curricula, regardless of the type of program, share certain objectives and principles which emphasize the need for integration of the student into the target language community through carefully designed linguistic and cultural instruction. The differences in the varying TESOLD programs can be summarized as follows: (1) ESL teachers of immigrants and residents deal with the problems of acculturation to the English environment; (2) bilingual teachers face the complex problems arising from an experimental  method; (3) teachers of students with Black English dialects confront the problem of an ethnic identification that is threatened by language standardization; (4) ESL for transient foreign students deals with the need for partial acculturation for the accomplishment of immediate goals; and (5) adult education programs cope with complex problems due to the variety of students. In all these programs, the most important variable is the prepared teacher, whose enthusiasm and interest are the primary motivation for the students. (LG)",

The underlying objective of most of these analyses has been to reveal the systematicity of adult errors in an effort to understand the process of adult second language learning. This paper deals with errors from a different point of view, namely, from the listener or reader's point of view. The question asked is, which types of errors cause the listener or reader to misunderstand the message intended by the EFL learner? Based on the judgments of native English speakers about the comprehensibility of hundreds of sentences containing errors of EFL learners all over the world, linguistic criteria for determining the communicative importance of learners'  errors are suggested. Areas of English syntax that cause important communicative errors usually neglected in most EFL training materials are discussed. The paper concludes with the application of this particular error analysis approach to the EFL classroom. (Author)",

The theory of the board can be likened to that of a supreme court. Both are designed to achieve the ideals of constitutional independence and policymaking protected from the passions of the majority of the moment. Much of the history of the American college and university is told by the relationships that boards of trustees create to administer their trust. The four distinct stages that take place when a board-university  relationship becomes troubled are presented, along with historical examples of exceptional regents administration. (Author/PG)",

In education, the increased burdens on the public treasury will have to be met through increased taxes.

        "description":"This paper examines the no-growth phenomenon in higher education. A framework is presented for viewing what is occurring in higher education as it seeks to resume a dynamic state of growth. Borrowing from Schumpeter's five categories of innovations by which business firms seek to gain a competitive edge over their rivals, an analytical framework is developed, and the current activities of higher education institutions and agencies vis-a-vis no growth are examined. The authors conclude that higher education is attempting to develop new products, i.e., new courses, programs, degrees; new methods of production, i.e., improving instructional and noninstructional productivity; new markets, i.e., new sources of students; new productive factors, i.e., dollar resources; and is  reorganizing and restructuring the enterprise.

Three options for meeting criteria set forth in Section 1202 were: (1) creation of a new commission that would meet the criteria; (2) designation of an existing State agency or State commission that already meets the criteria; and (3) augmenting an existing State agency or State commission to meet the criteria. Responses from every State are presented, including the desire to establish; option chosen; HEA programs assigned; commission name, address, telephone number, and principal staff officer;  representation on the commission for general public, public 4-year institutions, public community and junior colleges, public vocational schools, private nonprofit institutions, proprietary institutions, and others.

Last year over 80% of the major fellowship awards went to men. There are many reasons that women are not found in higher numbers among fellowship applicants. One of the strongest is that the image of the fellowship recipient is male. Another difficulty is that information about many programs is informal, passing through word-of-mouth networks. Three recent developments are helping to change the situation: Title IX of the  Higher Education Act; The Airlee House Conference which adopted a series of recommendations for opening up fellowship programs to greater participation by women; and the foundation that funds the fellowships. The succeeding sections concern 3 fellowships that have changed--Rhodes, Nieman, and White House Fellows; how to apply for fellowships; and how to choose the right fellowship. (Author/PG)",

He emphasizes the pivotal nature of that role, arguing that because the institution's basic activity is public business, the management of it must clearly link reasonability with public accountability. He supports the prevailing faculty view that trustees have little business in the classrooms. He suggests that one function of the trustees should be to bring a broad experience of the world to bear on academic decisionmaking. At the same time, however, the businessman-trustee should recognize that there are special elements in academic life that may require some specialized experience as well. The board can make itself felt most effectively in academic matters by focusing  its attention on people, on a responsible concern for the nature and welfare of the faculty body. Finally, trustees should also take the trouble to keep themselves informed about broad issues in education and about affairs of their own institutions. (Author/PG)",

To increase the chances of lectures being good, they should be fewer, and to offset their deficiencies they should be regarded as only one component of a combination of methods used in teaching a particular course. The displacement of lecturing from its central position in teaching makes time available for more dialogue with students in tutorials, for more student initiative in the library, the laboratory, and the field, and for improving the whole package of teaching methods used in the course. In what follows is an account of the way in which the transition was made in the teaching of one particular course,  Climatology, starting from lectures to become something quite different using extempore lecturing, prepared lecturing, notes for the student, readings, illustrations, tapes, free choice assignments, assessment of the student, and the student's assessment of the course. Appendices include the final evaluation of the course by the students, comparison of the different kinds of students and their course marks compared with other courses they have taken, and the ABCDE method of marking essays.

The population sample for the study included 122 accredited postsecondary institutions in Florida and 41 other accredited proprietary and vocational schools. The study was conducted through the utilization of two specially developed, forced-choice instruments and the Delphi technique. Results indicated it was possible to  establish near and/or sufficient consensus for 15 of the original 18 statements pertaining to the conceptual makeup of a 1202 commission for the State of Florida. This was considered more than enough to design and develop a general model or paradigm of a State Postsecondary Education Commission (1202) for the State of Florida.

Growth poses a variety of problems for the education systems that experience it and for the societies that support them. These problems arise in every part of higher education--in its finance, in its government and administration; in its recruitment and selection of students; in its curriculum and forms of instruction; in its recruitment, training, and socialization of staff--growth has its impact on every form of activity and manifestation of higher education. This essay argues that the problems facing higher education can be understood better as different manifestations of a related cluster of problems, and that they arise out of the transition from one phase to another in a broad  pattern of development of higher education, a transition from elite to mass higher education, and subsequently to universal access. Underlying this pattern of development are growth and expansion. (Author/MJM)",

The study revealed that most colleges had borrowed money in the past for construction. About two-thirds of those foresaw further construction, and one-half of those who planned to build also planned to borrow to meet part of the cost of that construction. Both the lenders and the colleges included in the study still believed philanthropy to be an important source of funds for meeting the cost of college construction projects. The paper presents attitudes of colleges and lenders about long-term loans to private colleges. It sets forth models for government-related loan guarantee programs and tax-exempt bonding authorities, as well as presenting detailed instructions  on completing a financial feasibility study for presentation to prospective lending institutions.

Three weeks were allotted for the opinionnaire to be returned. Of the total sample, 62 opinionnaires were returned before the cut-off date. Results indicated: (1) From a selected sample of U.S.C. student leaders, 72.6% of the students believed selection to Who's Who to be of &quot;great&quot; or &quot;some&quot; importance. (2) Student opinion also revealed that leadership recognition and future employment interests were the two  reasons most frequently expressed for Who's Who importance.

As a result of the 1973 preliminary Information Exchange Procedures (IEP) field test, some 45 colleges and universities across the nation developed compatible unit cost data and related information and compared themselves with one another. Twelve representative campuses were contacted to find out how planners and managers on those campuses made use of the newly available information. Emphasis was placed on three questions: (1) What specific portions of the information or data items were most useful? (2) Who used the data? (3) What specific decisions were affected or what actions resulted? Each of the 12 institutions that contributed to this document developed the same standard set  of new data, used the same NCHEMS software packages in the process, and developed the same new analytic capabilities. Some of the more important new data developed and published by the institutions are: direct cost per credit hour by discipline by level of instruction, full cost per credit hour by discipline by level of instruction, number of credit hours produced per FTE teaching faculty by discipline by level of instruction, number of exchange FTE student majors by degree program by student level, direct annual cost per exchange FTE major by degree program by student level, full annual cost per exchange FTE major by degree program by student level, and total direct expenditures displayed by subprogram of the NCHEMS Program Classification Structure.

College grades, however, have not been shown to be related to later-life accomplishments. The research reported here focuses on the accomplishments of young adults two years after college and relates college admission data to these accomplishments. The adult accomplishments were found to be uncorrelated with academic talent, including test scores, high school grades, and college grades. However, adult accomplishments were related to comparable high school nonacademic accomplishments. This suggests that there are many kinds of talents related to later success that might be identified and nurtured by educational  institutions. As we evaluate college outcomes in terms of postcollege student behaviors, we may have to reappraise the central role previously assigned academic talent. (Author)",

It deals with the constitutional issues raised as well as showing that higher education is interstate commerce within the meaning of the antitrust laws. The report analyzes the state exemption to antitrust laws and concludes that recent decisions have limited this exemption to such an extent that the State System would be held to be within the scope of the antitrust laws. Under the Sherman Act the most difficult parts of the prima facie case are proof of conspiracy and market definition. In a Clayton Act prosecution the most difficult task is to show that higher education is a commodity and that the State Board of Higher Education is a person, although  showing the substantive acts of tying and price discrimination is easy. The Federal Trade Commission Act is the most promising for attacking the present State System because the act is supposed to deal with cases where substantive actions are clear but technicalities prevent prosecution under other acts. Research indicates that although an antitrust suit against the State System would certainly be called a long shot, it is indeed feasible and has a firm foundation in case law. (Author/MJM)",

        "description":"To increase the supply of doctors, the government has become directly involved in physician education. Of the $673 million appropriated for health manpower programs in 1972, 55% was for medical schools. Legislation to date has emphasized expansion of medical education output in the aggregate, but increasing attention has been directed to the composition of the output with regard to the type and location of practice and to the equality of educational opportunity for ethnic minorities and women. This paper examines changes that have occurred in the medical education system concurrently with the growth of Federal programs designed to influence that system's output. The data indicate that the system has responded very favorably. Capacity is expanding rapidly, discrimination against  women has apparently disappeared, medical schools are seeking out and admitting qualified individuals from minority groups, and financial barriers to medical education have been lowered.

Beyond the leadership of communication lies the leadership of ideas of what the university ought to try to do if it wants to be more than a training station or cultural ornament. The author's prescription for leadership has three parts. The first is that the leader needs to guide himself in terms of the best he can be as a person of reflection and originality. Second, the educational leader should be more knowledgeable than his faculty and his fellow administrators about what is going on in higher education. Third, the administrative leader, if he would lead, needs to spend most of his time studying and releasing the potentialities of the human beings with whom he is  working. Planning is nothing more or less than the willingness to think out what is most important to do in education. (Author/PG)",

Illinois was one of the pioneer states in extending financial aid to private higher education institutions, beginning with the enactment in 1957 of a state scholarship program. As a result of the health services Education Grants Act, grants for operating and capital purposes are available to private medical, dental, nursing and allied health care programs on the basis of increased enrollment of Illinois residents. For the 1972-73 academic year, monetary awards to students attending private institutions totalled $29.4 million, nearly 60 percent of total  awards. This is a 60-fold increase over a 14-year period. State appropriations for the Health Services Education Grants Act have increased from $8 million in fiscal 1970 to $15.7 million for fiscal 1974. A major question for state government in the future will be the means of financially supporting the private higher education sector without undermining its independence. This is a goal dictated both by the economic self-interest of state government and in pursuit of an accepted and admirable philosophical goal of diversity in higher education. (Author/PG)",

        "description":"State aid to private higher education goes back to the beginning of higher education in this country. The forms of financial support for private higher education run the gamut from contracts for special services to general student aid available to students at both public and private institutions. By far the most important from the standpoint of the amounts of money involved are student aid and direct institutional aid. In addition to what might be described as general scholarship or grants including tuition equalization grants, a number of states offer scholarships or grants in special areas including medicine, dentistry, law, nursing, allied health fields and teacher education. Another related but distinguishable form of state support for private institutions that has been  increasing over the last 3 years is what might be described as the development of contract relations. A fourth area of state support where it is constitutionally possible has been the development of Facilities Bonding Authorities. Eleven states now have such bonding authorities that enable institutions to borrow funds for construction on the basis of tax free bonds. If there is to be continued and increasing state concern and financial support for private higher education, it should be the result of effective planning for postsecondary education as a whole with clear recognition of the integral role of private higher education to the total picture.

Stage 2 was the coexistence period when public institutions were developed. Stage 3, 1950 to the present, is the paradox stage, with increasing competition plus increasing cooperation between the private and public institutions in Connecticut. The policy toward private education is the commitment to keeping the public and private systems in balance. Some of the programs that give identity to Connecticut's policies in private higher education include: (1) presenting grants to individual independent institutions for each Connecticut student educated; and (2) a statewide talent assistance program involving private and  public institutions to seek out disadvantaged, especially black and Spanish-speaking, students. In looking ahead to the interface of public and private higher education, the evidence seems to be increasing that public funding for private higher education is an excellent investment.

Fifteen other papers from representatives of various nations suggest five elements of university autonomy are essential--not as special privileges, but as the basic  conditions that enable the universities to perform effectively. They include: (1) The university should have the right to select its own staff. (2) The university should be responsible for the selection of its students. (3) Universities should be responsible for the formulation of curricula for each degree and for the setting of academic standards. (4) Each university should have the final decisions as to the research program carried on within its walls. (5) The university should be responsible within wide limits, for the allocation among its various activities of the financial resources available. (MJM)",

Highlights indicate (1) Women tend to be less concentrated than men in the four major fields (electrical, mechanical, civil, and chemical) and more strongly represented in such others as engineering sciences, computer, and industrial engineering. Among minority men, Orientals and Blacks appear to have a preference for electrical engineering, while the American  Indians and Spanish Surnamed are noticeable more likely to be found in civil engineering. (2) The Orientals and women have a noticeable higher percentage of master's and doctor's degree candidates, and the American Indians have the highest percentage in bachelor of technology programs. (3) Orientals and Caucasian women are more likely to be in the top third of the class while Blacks and Spanish Surnamed are more likely to be in the bottom third.

Twenty states currently have some form of formal statute that covers employees in postsecondary institutions. However, in several states the provisions do not cover teaching staff but only staff employees. Of the thirty states without some form of enabling postsecondary legislation, 27 have had legislative activity in this area since 1970. In 18 states that have extensive public employment legislation, nine used a created public employment relations board to administer the legislation and nine used their existing private sector labor boards or commissions as the regulatory agency. Thus, one can see a slow and  progressive upward trend in collective negotiations activity in postsecondary education as state after state passes legislation. (Author/PG)",

The officers selected pursue courses lending to a master's or doctorate degree while receiving full pay and allowances, tuition, travel, books, and other related expenses. Although the overall ratio of officers with doctorates to validated positions did not appear to be excessive, there were imbalances in the ratios in certain disciplines.

        "description":"This document reports on the financial condition of 48 liberal arts colleges. Emphasis is placed on the deficit picture between 1970 and 1973; income and expenditure trends for the 48 colleges; implications of the decline in expenditure growth; needed measures of inflation and real resource growth; indicators of financial and academic health in higher education. Data for the 48 colleges confirm that 1970 marked a turning point. Accelerating expenditure growth outstripped income growth, thereby producing more numerous and larger deficits from 1967 to 1970; these trends were reversed from 1971 to 1973 as expenditure growth declined dramatically. Expenditure trends suggest that \"quality distress\" may replace \"financial distress\" in the 1970's. Surpluses are increasing, but real  resource growth has come to a virtual halt at these 48 colleges. Survival may become the dominant operating principle, with quality deterioration a byproduct.

Faculty and students in search of academic power, who had previously thought that it was to be had at the price of endless ennui in campus committees, are claiming seats on the governing boards. The need for vigorous governing bodies resides within both public and private institutions alike. The board of trustees must also be independent of the academics as it is of the politicians. Governance must be exercised both within and without. Externally, the college or university accounts for itself to a group of lay trustees who hold it responsible for society's needs. It is also responsible to a group of peer  institutions who grant it accreditation. Internal governance involves administration and faculty and generally in major matters requires ratification but not reconsideration by the trustees. Boards of trustees must be saved from becoming either instrumentalities of the State or appellate gatherings of the academy. (Author/PG)",

An important factor is that States must support the low-tuition principle in colleges and universities. The best student aid program ever devised is low-tuition. Closely related to the matter of low-tuition are the State appropriations to higher education. If the State appropriations process is an orderly and fair process, colleges and universities can develop reasonable expectations of State funding. These expectations are necessary for planning, development, and for the consistent execution of college policy. A responsible financial attitude on the part of the State can eliminate breaches of personnel  procedures, faculty programs, and deterioration of morale. (Author)",

It is to this question that this reprint addresses itself. Presidents should be strong in the sense that they are willing to deal with boards whose enthusiasm leads them into areas where they do not have competence. One of the most difficult problems the president has to face is the trustee who has been responsible for significant past gifts to the institution or who obviously is capable of substantial future gifts and who attempts to use the power of the purse to influence  decisions. Only effective and enlightened leadership from the president and board of trustees can handle critical issues in a way to insure that the public wisdom will continue to be an ally on the side of higher education.

These challenges are evident in the need for adequate and suitable resources and their effective use. This paper deals with generic academic planning constructs. The effort is to develop a conceptual framework within which relationships of a college's academic operations can be viewed as a coherent system. The need for the development of a holistic approach becomes evident as one  observes how college academic planning and management have met the problems of growth with improvised decisions based on inadequate information. The generic academic planning constructs are only variables to be considered in the enterprise of academic planning. The emphasis is that planning for an existing enterprise is definitely a process not of creation but of identifying and articulating that which exists and then molding those dimensions into a well understood and directed whole.

A further section discusses research in applications involving a combination of the four basic modes. Briefly, the conclusions of the review were that CAI can be an effective instructional tool, that students generally learn more rapidly but retain less with CAI than with traditional methods, that CAI is more effective for low ability students than for middle and high ability students, and that both  students and teachers are highly enthusiastic towards CAI as a means of instruction.

A communication game device was used to present children with sets of four referents on separate screens. The referents were either nameable pictures, abstract figures, people figures, or relational figures. One child of each pair described a referent, and the other child selected the referent described to him by pushing the button under the correct figure. The only variable pertaining to the subjects which was found to be significant was age. Sex, I.Q., birth order, and socioeconomic level were not related to performance. Large individual differences in performance were  noted and suggested as a base for further study. Errors varied according to referent type. Context redundancy and descriptive salience reduced errors. Errors decreased across trials for the people referents. Cautious optimism is expressed regarding the training of referential communication skills. The game device was felt to be an effective method of structuring educational interactions. (JG)",

Research was conducted in Texas schools and encompassed three phases: a field experiment to measure learning effects; attitudinal surveys among teachers, parents, and children; and a process evaluation of the Education Service Center Carrascolendas staff members. The field experiments consisted of viewer and nonviewer groups of Mexican-American children, grades K-3. Criterion referenced instruments designed in Spanish and English were administered which compared viewer and nonviewer scores. Combined viewers made a significant gain score increase in the Spanish areas of history, culture, and reading; and in the English areas of history, culture, and  science. The content areas which had the least impact in Spanish and English were math and self-concept. Survey elicited attitudes indicate increased improvement in the use of Spanish and English by children and greater pride in the Mexican-American culture. Attitude items on which viewers made significant gains over nonviewers dealt with speaking Spanish and teacher approval of school work. The process evaluation summarizes activities and describes the services and interaction which were provided. (Author/WCM)",

Both technological and conventional alternatives are considered: degree of physical decentralization of the system; mix of instructional methods, including conventional instruction and the use of technology; time spent by the student in school in hours per day and days per year; the curriculum mix; and promotion, retention, and certification procedures. The costs of the alternatives are discussed, followed by a brief review of what is known about the alternatives in terms of their effects on student learning.  Performance and cost information are then drawn together into a mechanism for evaluating alternatives in terms of a simple model of student progress through a school system. The paper concludes with two appendixes: the first surveys the literature concerning the benefits of education, and the second uses the developed model for an example cost-effectiveness analysis of elementary education in Indonesia.

At BIP's (BASIC Instructional Program) core is an information network which embodies the interrelations of the concepts, skills, problems, remedial lessons, hints, BASIC commands, and manual references. With the data stored in the student history, the network enables BIP to model the student's state of knowledge and to make problem selections with some relevance.

(One of the more successful networks now operating is the Ohio College Library  Center.) Communication between network units may be by facsimile (which is most expensive), telephone, TWX, microwave network, or satellite. Access may be by interlibrary loan or copy.

The same film was shown to both groups; at its conclusion, a posttest consisting of 10 or more items related to the film seen and another not seen was administered. The posttest performance (items correct and time required for  administration) of transported students was compared with that of a similar age-grade class which was not transported.

Essentially, the conceptual model stipulated that it is not desirable to own a gun, kill wildlife, or hunt. The question items were administered to three sample groups who did not see the film, and to two sample groups who did see the film. The responses were summarized using a standard &quot;scalar distance&quot; computer program which produced an item profile in terms of the deviation from the model answers. The rsults indicated that the subjects who saw the film gave  responses which were more deviant from the model than those who did not see it. It was suggested that it may be necessary to compare adult ideals in terms of attitude with what really is. The responses of the sample suggest that the attitudinal model proposed and assigned to &quot;The Hunter&quot; was not in harmony with that of the population tested. (Author)",

The method employed in the study involved pretesting and posttesting a sample of 70 primary and intermediate EMH children on the content of a filmstrip. Statistical analyses of the data indicated that samples of five students gave results that were within the parameters of decision established by the Computer Based Project (Syracuse, N.Y.). When the sample size was increased to 10, the standard findings for increased sample size were supported, i.e., scores were within smaller ranges, variance between groups was reduced, and gains were more standardized. However, the investigators concluded that  samples of five subjects seem to be large enough to establish estimates of population parameters within the limits of four out of five times. Larger samples do not add appreciable data or substantially change the outcome of decisions obtained from the samples of five. (Author/WCM)",

        "description":"Incorporated in the media evaluation model developed by the Computer Based Project (Syracuse, N.Y.) is a procedure whereby independent samples are used to obtain baseline responses to cognitive question items. Items from two films are intermixed and presented after showing only one of the films; thus, the sample audience responds to questions from both the unseen film and the film which was seen. This study sought to determine whether the procedure affects the responses of the samples. Statistical analyses are performed on the data gathered from educable mentally retarded (EMR) and normal samples receiving mixed questions sets. This is in contrast to EMR and normal samples receiving questions only on the film seen. The results indicate that there seems to be an effect of mixing  items which results in lower scores for EMR children on the criterion items for the film seen than when only items pertaining to the film were asked. One explanation for this finding is that greater respondent frustration can be expected from the mixing of relevant (film seen) and irrelevant (film not seen) items, resulting in a lower number of correct scores.

This study, based on the findings of a previous investigation, attempted to demonstrate a method for training young children to respond to test items presented in an automated system. The study consisted of four phases: (1) initial training, (2) first film, (3) pilot group, and (4) other groups. The results of the study suggest that, by adapting the materials and question items used to the capabilities of the subjects (i.e., by dealing only with simple and concrete information), primary grade EMR children can  benefit from the content of primary level films with a minimum of assistance. Furthermore, it is suggested that there exists a need for more careful consideration of: (1) the appropriateness of films, (2) the format of question items, and (3) the possible benefit of more frequent training sessions and/or cooperation within the classroom so that learning can be reinforced, transferred to new situations, and practiced.

A selection of five films, all prerated according to standardized techniques and designated appropriate for primary level students, were presented for viewing by a primary class of heterogeneously grouped EMH students. It was expected that the wide range of academic abilities and social maturity would be reflected in the type of response that the class as a whole would make to the films. A situation was therefore created whereby attempts were made to subjectively predict the type of film to which the class would make the most positive response. The quality of response was measured in terms of attending behavior, length and  content of the film, and the number of correct answers to the accompanying question set. Observation data revealed that primary EMH students benefitted from exposure to all five films. It was concluded that subjective judgement regarding the educational value of films for heterogeneously grouped EMH students at the primary level tends not to be reliable. (Author)",

        "description":"This study investigated whether or not Sights and Sounds, a filmstrip-record series originally designed for speech-hearing handicapped children, could produce perceptual discrimination learning of familiar sounds in primary level educable mentally retarded (EMR) children and whether EMR children were susceptible to perceptual learning via application of the stimulus Response (SR) concept of paired-associate learning. Twelve EMR students were randomly selected from three primary schools. Subjects were divided into experimental and control groups. A pretest, a treatment sequence, and a posttest were administered. Students were exposed to filmstrips which presented 12 familiar sounds, then were asked to identify the associated scenes in a test booklet. Data were analyzed using the  Latin chi-square and the t-test. The results indicated that the filmstrips could produce auditory perceptual discriminative learning in EMR children at the primary school level of development. (Author)",

        "description":"A study was undertaken to develop a body of knowledge which might bridge the communications gap between the more formal communications establishment and the eclectic alternative television movement. Information was gathered mainly through personal experience, and by survey and interviews. The analysis was carried out during the period from late 1972 to early 1974. This M.A. thesis offers five conclusions and recommendations: first, Federal funds should be made available to community groups to develop programs and stimulate public access to, and utilization of, media. Second, cable television should not be viewed as the only means of distributing local programing. Third, cable television should continue to be considered as a major means of distributing alternative television.  Fourth, video is not the only tool for alternative television, Super-8 and various other inexpensive film formats should be more fully explored for television program production and usage. Finally, it is the software produced, not the tools used, which is the major reason for community alternative television innovative approaches. (WCM)",

The manual search outperformed the machine on precision, novelty, uniqueness, and dollar cost per citation although this was based on partial cost data for the manual search. There was little difference in recall between the two methods. For this subject area, &quot;Chemical Abstracts&quot;, &quot;International Aerospace Abstracts&quot;, and the Automatic Subject Citation Alert service were found to be the most effective sources for overall recall precision, novelty, and uniqueness. RECON and MEDLARS were found to be the most efficient in  terms of times and costs. The study concludes that while the manual search had a slightly better overall performance, both modes are necessary for a comprehensive multi-disciplinary literature survey. (JG)",

The teaching of the program content and the supervision of demonstration projects was the responsibility of a team of specially appointed lecturers supported by members of the Department of Educational Communications at the University of Hawaii, Honolulu. This faculty designed a series of experiences which included eight objectives. During nine months, candidates were expected to complete graduate level courses in Educational Communications. In addition,  candidates engaged in directed field internships two days a week which involved media demonstration projects. These terminal projects provided practical insight and experience in planning for the systematic dissemination of media procedures and information. (WCM)",

The simulation process was a small office and screen where either a static or dynamic program depicting a &quot;problem day in the life of a principal&quot; was shown. Each participant had a reading of his galvanic skin potential and heart rate taken before, in process, and after the simulation session. The before and after readings were combined into the base rate of the individual. The study sought to find significant differences in physiological activity between the two groups and between the in process and base rate readings. Utilizing galvanic  skin potential frequency scores, no significant differences were found; but when the ratio of the galvanic skin potential amplitude and frequency scores were taken, there were significant differences both between groups and within individuals. In addition, the heart rate activity was significantly different between groups and within individuals. (WH)",

Project CORES began in the efforts of three men who felt a more systematic investigation of simulation effects was needed. The criteria felt most sensitive were the physiological activities of galvanic skin potential and heart rate. A simulation chamber was constructed in the form of a small office with a screen where a program could be projected. The research project utilized the Project CORES facility with an added measure of concept meanings, the semantic differential technique. The concept meanings formed a pre- and posttest for a single group, N=32, going through the simulation sessions. A positive relationship between the degree of involvement  as indicated by physiological activity and change in concept meaning was evidenced. (WH)",

The studies reasoned that highly explicit presentations of film-mediated operations can be imitated by observers, and that once imitated, they are internalized and can serve as modified mental skills. Two laboratory experiments provide empirical support. A field study of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in Israel sought to determine if, in fact, a mass medium can produce cognitive changes. The absence of an adequate control group was solved by the methodological technique of multiple regression. A few of the findings of this complex study are that media can be made to affect mental skills, and that given sufficient novelty and cognitive stress, media does  cultivate specific abilities. Second, television is an important force in cognitive development, although little is yet known about exactly how this takes place, with whom, and under what conditions. Third, the distinction made between formats that accomplish the function of modeling skills has received empirical support; and finally, the findings show who learns more through modeling and who from skill activation.

The results of this survey and a literature search culminated in a basic statement of principles, goals, and definitions. One of the more important results of the study was the definition of levels of needs of users: basic, course related, and discipline related.

A review of the evolution of cable TV, CATV, two-way television and the interactive cable concluded that the equipment and technology is available now but is very costly. Many examples of various combinations of telephone and CATV usage were found to be in experimental stages. A survey was mailed to the local area, Atlantic City. The results indicated a relatively high interest in library services but not sufficient to override the consensus of national leaders who feel that the market for this complex and expensive technology has not yet developed. It was recommended  that local libraries make use of existing CATV channels as they are granted and develop the &quot;consumer research&quot; needed to justify the expense of the more elaborate and complete two-way systems.

The objective of a case study--to illuminate a decision or set of decisions--is ideal for instructional media projects. Researchers can enter a situation after the fact and benefit from their perspective in time. Central to the case study is the researcher who should bring to the situation historical and political science skills for a wholistic view. In case studies documents, interviews, observations, and secondary analyses are the main data sources; and  researchers are urged to make greater use of documents, interview the right people, and make observations more objective. Addressing an audience and focusing on key decisions will help make a case study useful. Examples of both good and bad case studies of various types are appended. (WH)",

This study also investigated the relationships between frequency of electronic media production and media staff, in-service workshops, and library expenditures. A high percentage of responding schools reported no involvement by the media staff, teachers, or students in the four types of electronic media. Schools reporting full-time media personnel, in-service training, available equipment, and adequate funding reported  a higher frequency of electronic media production than schools without such resources. Recommended are the development and maintenance of appropriate production services, all with qualified media personnel, adequate facilities and equipment supported by ample budget. (Author/WH)",

The summary of main findings and recommendations were the result of various master state plan surveys, questionnaires and studies. It was found that: the development of a statewide public telecommunication system is frustrated because of a lack of hardware in schools; little or no preservice training for teachers and administrators; low annual operating budgets for educational television stations together with an obsolete method of funding public school TV programing; and the lack of current instructional technology of any real consequence. Further, the existing system appeared to lack a comprehensive mission, and the existing policies and programs were found to retard the  innovative uses of technologies other than television broadcasting. It was suggested that the relationship between the Commonwealth and media organizations be carefully defined and managed. The study recommended limits be placed on the Virginia Public Telecommunications Council (VPTC) although the Council was directed to determine day-to-day task and resource applications. Also recommended was a special role for the public schools. (WCM)",

Approximately 296 presently employed librarians, media specialists, and combination librarian-media specialists were identified as needing additional training beyond the bachelor's degree. The respondents anticipated hiring 151 media-library related personnel at the bachelor's level and 79 at the master's level in the next five years. Approximately half of the people needed in these three occupational areas will be in the areas of  media or combination library-media. The most significant survey factor indicates that many school administrators are unaware of the growing trend for media-library personnel to be trained with joint skills.

At the beginning of the first class period and at the last class session prior to the final examination, students were asked to rank their acceptance of each of 30 objectives by placing six objectives in each of five categories ranging from most acceptable to least acceptable. Test scores for each of the five groups of objectives were then individually ranked and summarized, using the Kendall Coefficient of Concordance \"W\", corrected for ties in ranks. The study concluded  that there is not statistically significant (.05 level) relationship between the student ranking of the behavioral objectives as to their acceptance at the beginning or at the termination of the course and their consequent scores on a final examination or test of recall one month after the final examination.

One promising solution to this problem has been to harness the capabilities of the computer as an instructional training device. To be cost-effective, computer-based instruction must maximize individual student attainment of training objectives, while simultaneously minimizing training time and costs. Adaptive Instructional Models (AIM) constitute the means by which effective training can be accomplished with a minimum expenditure of student time and instructional resources. The report describes the purpose and function of AIM. Additionally, seven adaptive instructional  models are analyzed, and recommendations as to model application in Air Force technical training courses are made. (Author)",

The project concentrated on designing testing procedures in group paced instructional programs to provide information to student, teachers, parents and administrators which could be used in both a formative and summative evaluation. The three objectives of the project were: (1) to adapt the Comprehensive Achievement Monitoring (CAM) design for an individually paced program of instruction that contains a series of units through which students progress in sequence; (2) explore the applicability of computer-assisted instruction evaluation technique to criterion referenced testing (CRT) for individually paced instruction; and (3) to field test the adopted CAM design in a high school earth science course. The  results showed quite strongly that the students whose learning activities were controlled the most showed the greatest gains in achievement levels. Gains were measured by the CAM tests and by standardized tests given at the beginning and end of the course. The results show this population of students are not able to work independently with CRT data and direct their own study activities. This finding confirms less formal studies completed in previous years. (WCM)",

Sixty-four faculty members and graduate students were surveyed, and twenty faculty members were interviewed. Many areas of information retrieval problems and the different ways anthropologists use their literature and libraries were explored, and results showed that differences between the various sub-groups of the study population were relatively unimportant. Forty percent of the faculty members did not often use libraries. Few anthropologists made use of abstracting and indexing services, but most were relatively satisfied with available library collections, although they found them to be inadequately organized and too  scattered. Major retrieval problems were not finding enough multiple copies and difficulties in obtaining unpublished material. Eighty percent of the faculty members felt library research would be more important in the future. (Author/WH)",

The committee was charged with the responsibility of creating an instrument to gather information on the opinions and habits of the Senate's constituents in relation to the entire spectrum of Senate activities, with the understanding that responses were to be limited to the Third Senate only, thus providing an equal vantage point for appraisal for all participants. A questionnaire was designed for this purpose and distributed on a broad basis to all full-time, professional instructional and noninstructional faculty, to all members of the student government association council, and to student members of Senate committees and  subcommittees, as well as to student presidents of campus organizations. Detailed results of the survey are presented in this document utilizing a format which gives a descriptive overview of each section, commentary on the numerical totals and percentages, some direct quotations from both faculty and students and, in most instances, the survey questions themselves.

        "description":"This study was undertaken to serve as a potential model in the evaluation of career programs. Most models for program evaluation consist of three phases: input; (e.g., the number of students enrolled); the process (e.g., availability of equipment, staff, etc.); and output (e.g., students who are able to gain employment). This study focuses on graduates and asks them to assess defined components of the process and output phases beyond those usually included. It was contended that the employed graduates of a career program could well serve as evaluators because they are in the unique position of being able to relate their programs to their job requirements. It was also contended that supervisors of career program graduates should be included in the program evaluation model because  they are particularly able to provide an assessment of job performance. Thus, this study focuses on two phases of the program evaluation model--process and output, extends the components of these phases, and utilizes opinions of both graduates and their supervisors.

Career education deals with all three domains of learning--cognitive, affective, and psychomotor; job development deals with the individual application of these cognitive, affective and psychomotor skills to a specific occupation. The job development concept implies occupational mobility, and it entails career education as a process in which job development is an intermediary stage. Job development also calls for the coordinated efforts of school guidance and school instructional personnel. Occupational information should be included in the regular curricula. An  open-ended curriculum allows for novel combinations of courses, leading to occupational training not otherwise possible. Program development begins with the identification of the specific problem, followed by the design of a suitable program. Implementation of a well-designed program includes ongoing measurement of the program's progress and an overall appraisal of the total process of the program. The difficulty of planning, designing, and implementing a job development program varies with the degree of the college's commitment to the concept. (DB)",

        "description":"During the spring of 1972, Educational Testing Service joined with the California State Legislature's Joint Committee on the Master Plan for Higher Education to engage in a study of 116 California State institutions, of which 69 were public community colleges. One purpose was to study the goals of the institutions. Using the IGI--Institutional Goals Inventory--students, faculty members, and administrators were asked to respond to a series of statements concerning \"what is\" and \"what should be\" the goals of these colleges. The results are summarized in this speech, which also includes a rationale for the study and a brief statistical history of the growth of community colleges since 1900. (Author/SGM)",

        "description":"In this essay, discussions are presented of the current setting within which statewide planning for community/junior colleges is operating, the \"impact\" of the \"1202 Commissions\" proposed in the Federal Higher Education Amendments of 1972 (P.L. 92-318), simultaneous related special interests in information, and salient implications for community/junior college education. In relation to the current condition in the U.S., five observations are made: (1) the colleges and universities are on the defensive; (2) there is an intensifying interest in \"accountability\" of higher education; (3) there is a redefinition of the educational enterprise to recognize the validity of the concept of \"postsecondary education\" as opposed to \"higher education\"; (4) the assumptions on which long range  planning for postsecondary education is now being projected are changing; and (5) more attention is being given to the needs for adequate information and data for decision making and planning. The \"1202 Commission\" proposals--the designation of a commission to represent broadly all postsecondary agencies and institutions in each State and to be responsible for developing a comprehensive plan for the State--have had a large impact even in face of a stop action from Washington. Conclusions are drawn, and recommendations are made. (DB)",

Interviews were conducted prior to mailing the questionnaire to employers, graduates of the program since 1970, and instructors. Results of the study showed that the instrument did enable recommendations to be made related  to the data obtained. A common core of subject matter was determined. The relative evaluations of the three groups surveyed showed no significant discrepancies; there was, however, some difference in the individual item evaluations, with graduates and employers being in close agreement as to what is important in the curriculum.

The course work in this early childhood teacher education program is defined by the following features: students direct their own learning; courses are practicum-centered, performance-based, and developmental; and the classroom supports the development of teachers who are open to change in themselves and others. Built into the teacher education model is a support system for teachers in the  community consisting of graduate fellows in the program who teach part time in their home schools. Program evaluation consists of regular feedback from staff and students, comparative evaluation of the new teacher education courses as compared with more traditional courses and use of an Open Classroom Observation Inventory designed to document the degree of openness in a teacher's classroom.

To help parents learn about child development, the  various parent groups are asked to complete eight sessions in any two of the following areas: Learning Experiences, Self Concept, Social Skills, Developmental Environment, and Stimulation. While the main thrust of the project deals with curriculum for the participants, emphasis is also given to the building of cohesive groups through the token reward system. Objectives for the third operational year of Project Patrol, outlined in this report, include the evaluation of Patrol children in kindergarten and the consolidation of the project into a replicable model for use in other areas.

Forty \"Ss,\" aged 3-5, were presented a series of 23 stories describing an event which had occurred to a same-sex child (O). \"S\" was asked to indicate \"how O felt\" by pointing to one of five faces which \"S\" had previously identified as Happy, Sad, Afraid, Mad, and Neutral. With each stimulus story, \"S\" was also asked to show how he felt. A counterbalanced design was employed in which half the \"Ss\" were questioned regarding their own affective state prior to indicating how O felt, while the remaining \"Ss\" responded to O's affective  state first. Order of questioning had no effect on \"Ss\" responses. Results indicate that: (a) young children are capable of correctly identifying the affective states of others (57 percent); (b) their self-responses are generally unrelated to their O-responses (69 percent); (c) \"Ss\" typically described themselves as Happy (67 percent) regardless of the emotion described in the stimulus; and (d) errors tend to be random, i.e. unrelated to either the particular affective state described in the story or to their S-response (80 percent). Neither empathy nor egocentrism account for \"Ss\" performance on this task; rather, \"Ss\" appear to have a cognitive understanding of O's affective state. (Author/CS)",

Expectations for performance in reading and arithmetic were studied. Both middle class and lower class (black and white) children have higher expectations than their subsequent marks warrant, but the discrepancy is much greater for lower class children. These expectations are remarkably resistant to change over the first-grade year, but the limited evidence now available suggests that expectations are modified to conform with marks rather than the reverse.

The historical part of this report indicates that the project began in 1966 with a small-scale study of teacher behavior and children's responses in a few classrooms in a Harlem school district. This study led to the development of a reserach instrument and suggested the overwhelming need for program improvement. In 1966-'67 the curriculum was compiled in rough form and implemented on a very limited basis. Data from this period focuses on language development, a major emphasis of the curriculum. 1967-'68 was a year of broadening the implementation effort, as four teachers used the program with in-depth training. The  curriculum was revised during this year, as it became a 2-year intervention approach. The field study was backed up by much data collection, including a detailed project to determine intervention effects on auditory discrimination. By 1968-'69 the program had developed a comprehensive curriculum package, and the report focuses on problems encountered in changing teachers' methods and attitudes. A content analysis of the curriculum discusses internal inconsistencies on theoretical issues, language arts training, views of play, teaching strategies, motor development, and behavioral objectives. Appendix A is an independent assessment of the curriculum, Appendix B describes the goals, procedures, and history of the parent project, and Appendix C is a description of the curriculum prepared for  an educational conference.

Another purpose was to train a capable field staff and develop quality methods for gathering the data. This report and the supporting statistical analyses undertake three tasks: (1) To assess the spring 1973 measurement battery and field data collection procedures, and to compare them with the fall 1972 battery and procedures to see if progress has been made on problems indentified in &quot;Interim Report II,&quot; (2) To identify changes in items and whole scores that have occurred from fall 1972 to  spring 1973 for families who participated in both data collections, and (3) To determine if preliminary relationships identified in fall 1972 between children's performance and aspects of their home environment have been replicated and clarified in the spring 1973 data. Based on the outcomes of these analyses of spring 1973 data, recommendations about the final National Home Start Evaluation measurement battery will be made. (Author/CS)",

Two major goals of the work reported in this section (Volume 1 are: (1) to arrive at an adequate definition of &quot;disadvantage,&quot; or more specifically, those kinds of factors in childhood for which Federal intervention seems warranted, and (2) to review the kinds of scientific evidence that might justify and direct government intervention. The section has six chapters. Chapter 1 is an introduction to the study, with discussion of the approach that is used. The notion of discrete public purposes as determinants of the larger goals of Federal programs is  explained. Chapter 2 presents a historical review of American public programs, focusing around the public interests that are commonly behind the programs. Chapter 3 discusses research evidence that supports early intervention, as well as conflicting views on this issue. Chapter 4 analyzes data concerning connections between childhood events and outcomes in adolescence and adulthood. Chapter 5 reviews measurement indices available for evaluation of educational, child development, and family programs. Finally, chapter 6 offers a discussion of the health issues involved in intervention on behalf of children which parallels the preceding analysis of psychological and family intervention. (DP)",

Data was available from a total of eight test administrations, given in the period between prekindergarten and fourth grade. All drawings were coded according to content areas and other specified characteristics. Analysis of results of the 6-year study clearly show that the many facets of the changing world of the child are paralleled by changes in his drawings. Three major areas of change were identified: (1) realism, (2) sophistication, and (3) conformity of content. Discussion focuses on the processes responsible for such  change, and the potential of the DAC as a research tool. A statistical appendix comprises more than five-sixths of this document. (DP)",

        "description":"Twenty-eight 4- and 5-year-old children were interviewed in the ninth and tenth days of the 1973 Israeli war to determine their factual knowledge about the war and their interpretation of the war. The factual questions focused on the children's knowledge of people, places, and objects most frequently reported in the news. Questions on the interpretation included &quot;Who is winning?&quot; and &quot;When do you think the war will end?&quot; The children's responses mirrored those of their families and the media. In general, the responses of the nursery school children were less accurate. Children were not able to philosophize about war, but responded in very personal terms. All children gave negative responses concerning the Arabs. It is suggested that adults should encourage children to ask  questions and to express their fears. Earlier contact between young Israeli and Arab children may help allay fears and hostility between the two groups. (SBT)",

The construct of self concept is discussed with regard to common uses, measurement, and experimental development. Descriptions of relevant studies are presented according to their experimental designs or methods of statistical analysis. Correlational analysis of variance, mean differences, and discrepancy studies are reviewed. Also, self concept and achievement research that focuses on ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic status, and sex differences is included. It is concluded that the literature clearly indicates some significant relationship (at least associational) between some aspects of the self and scholastic achievement. The nature of this  relationship is unclear, as there is little evidence of causation and there is little uniformity in definition and approaches to measurement of the self concept. (DP)",

        "description":"This discussion of teacher expectations attempts to delineate the research steps that are needed to convincingly validate or invalidate the Pygmalion Effect. Five elements of expectancy effects are identified: (1) Information provided to teachers, (2) their expectancies, (3) behavior, (4) children's achievement and (5) intelligence. An examination of each of these elements and the linkages among them, in reference to the existing teacher expectancy research, suggests numerous alternative hypotheses and explanations to those in the literature. The literature review analyzes each study in terms of effects demonstrated, teacher characteristics, and the linkages investigated. Reinterpretation of these reports indicates the existence of &quot;class 2&quot; linkages, for example, student  achievement influencing teacher behavior and expectancy rather than &quot;class I&quot; linkages in which the teacher expectancies influence the child's performance. The ethical and practical dangers of expectancy research are emphasized, particularly with regard to unfair criticism of the teacher. The need for careful interpretation of such research is based on the methodological, as well as logical and empirical uncertainty of the area. Finally, the report suggests four areas of research that would be most helpful in clarifying the issues discussed. (DP)",

        "description":"This review of studies comparing early childhood education models focuses on the trends and problems of this kind of research. The 8 \"qualitative\" studies reviewed, all pertain to aspects of instructional theory centering around teacher-child interaction. In the 19 empirical studies discussed, a dichotomy between \"structured and unstructured environments\" was commonly utilized, but relevant definitions varied widely across studies. It is argued that the real issue is being masked: the comparison of small group-individual training sessions versus naturalistic classroom-whole group instruction. Language training appears to be the dominant area of training being reported, but there is insufficient discussion of language-cognition relationships and possible maturational aspects of  language development. Research conclusions have been inconsistent regarding gains by low socioeconomic level children in relation to higher socioeconomic groups, lending uncertainty to the quantifiable nature of these gains. Comparison studies are criticized for their global use of crucial terms (i.e., model), and for their biases, as reflected in the opinion-laden reporting of data and observations. Finally, it is suggested that the trend toward competition among models (i.e., \"finding differential effects\") be reversed so that evaluation can be based on manipulation of parameters within each model.

Three approaches to early childhood programming are presented: the behavioristic-learning theory perspective, the Piagetian cognitive-developmental, and the developmental-interaction approach. The differing assumptions on which they are based, the differing ways in which they draw on and utilize psychological concepts, and the ways in which they therefore involve young children in qualitatively different encounters with people, problems and ideas in the school setting are examined and critically evaluated. The final section of the paper is concerned with a summary statement of the issues  arising in the discussion of the three approaches to early childhood education, including a consideration of some of the problems that must be confronted in the task of evaluating effects of differing modes of education.

The report focuses on the following questions: (1) Why did this program of experimenting with early childhood education happen to get launched midway in the early 1960s?, (2) What were the goals of the program, the hopes for it, and how realistic were these hopes? (3) What have been the accomplishments of Project Head Start and of the related investigations and developments that launching Head Start served to inspire?, (4) What have the public reactions been to what has been called the 'failure of Head Start'?, and (5) What have we learned that will be of use in the future? It is suggested  that the challenge for the next decade in early childhood education rests on the construction of ordinal scales for assessing development taking place between the sensorimotor phase and the achievement of concrete operations. In total, this report is a comprehensive, descriptive, 'state of the art' analysis of the major early childhood programs of the sixties. (CS)",

Begun in 1966, this program organized a formal system of family day care homes initiated and supervised by the government; this is an extension of the former system of licensing privately initiated family day care homes. From the Danish experience, a number of principles emerge which appear to be relevant to the United States. It is possible for the government to conduct a program of surveillance for quality control and to establish a minimal standard of care for each child. A family day care home system has the special advantages of being an important source of strength to the family, offers a rewarding career for women who prefer to work at home, and has the  possibility of rapid expansion. It is suggested that because of children's needs and parental preferences more than one type of day care service should be offered. (CS)",

The committee's responsibility to promote conditions for sound child development includes determination of number of child care institutions and kindergartens needed and assessment of the quality of existing institutions. State funding is granted on the committee's recommendations. In community matters such as town planning, housing, traffic, and entertainment the committee also has much influence as they consider what provisions have been made for children. To protect the child, the  committee can also serve as an advocate for the child in his own home. The committee has the authority to co-opt any specialist they deem necessary in the consideration of a case; however, the final decision rests solely with the committee itself. In recent years, the committee has put great emphasis on preventive measures through a family guidance program. Fundamental to this advocacy program is an attitude concerning society and the child: the child is everyone's responsibility. Furthermore, any citizen with a particular interest in children is expected to volunteer for service on a Child and Youth Welfare Committee. (CS)",

It examined alternatives and resolved issues related to the development, organization, and operation of RESA's that serve non-metropolitan school districts. The conference was organized around 3 clusters of issues: (1) legislative and financial arrangements that provide RESA's with the authority and financial support they needed to be effective; (2) the roles and role relationships RESA's should seek to develop; and (3) services and service giving strategies that are most needed and most effective. Several alternatives were examined for their  comparative consequences, both on the operations of RESA's and on the districts and students they seek to serve. These alternatives came from 2 sources: the varied patterns of operations represented and reported by conference participants, and the papers and the 3 general sessions of speeches delivered at the conference. Papers were presented in 4 simultaneous discussion groups, with an observer in each to report on the discussions. This publication, which contains a complete report of the conference proceedings, includes the conference program outline, the speeches, the conceptual papers, and the report of the discussion group observers.

Rather, it discusses ways in which available information, such as the 1928 Meriam Report, can be used to initiate program development. Emphasizing that educational opportunities for Native American children must be developed on the middle ground between life in Native communities and established educational institutions, the paper states that the clear need in \"Indian education\" is for curriculum and program development. Future research efforts should objectively monitor the effectiveness of curricular approaches rather than rediscover  the symptoms. Local control of reservation schools and contracting Johnson-O'Malley monies directly with tribes are desirable, but are only intermediate goals at best. The primary question still remains one of educational programs, after control or influence are attained. Also, because of the diverse conditions among Native American communities, a wide variety of approaches and materials are needed. Every school which serves Native American students should have the programmatic capability of making them feel comfortable in the learning environment and of enhancing their chances for a higher quality life.

The report, prepared by the Program Analysis Section of the State Department of Social Services, analyzes the racial makeup of welfare recipients during 1 month each year, usually October. December was chosen in 1973 because it was the last month for which information was available for the adult programs, which were converted to the Federal Supplemental Security Income program in January 1974. The report consists of tables showing the ratio of Indian recipients in each program and the proportion of money expended for their grants. The  programs are: Old Age Assistance, Aid to the Blind, Aid to the Disabled, Aid to Dependent Children, and Foster Care. A summary of the Indian recipient rate by program for each of the last 20 years is presented, showing the trend in welfare assistance participation. Information by county has been compiled for the reservation and nonreservation counties. The total state population, Indian population, and ratio of Indians by county according to the 1970 census is a new table for this report. In South Dakota over 80% of the Indians live on state reservations, which are: Cheyenne River, Lower Brule, Pine Ridge, Rosebud, Crow Creek, Yankton, and Sisseton (the last 2 are open reservations).

        "description":"The testimony of John C. Rainer, Director of the American Indian Scholarship Program, before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior and Related Affairs (May 1973) examined the Senate's reduction of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) appropriation for 1973-74. Rainer explained that the $19,938,000 requested for the year, $10,000,000 less than the 1972-73 appropriation, was inadequate to fund the projected 18,000 American Indian students entering college at that time. As support for his plea, Rainer cited Presidents Nixon and Johnson in their call for Indian self-determination. In line with this, 48 tribes are now granting scholarships to their young people, but can continue to do so only as long as adequate funds are available. Also, Rainer said that the 1972  Education Act was a laudable effort, but objected to Indians competing with all minority groups in the United States for the scholarship fund. He explained that the only legal basis for scholarship assistance to other minority groups was their U.S. citizenship; Indians, however, derived their legal position from a special relationship with the U.S. government established by treaties and land cession. Rainer concluded that the proposed BIA budget cut amounted to a halt in the Congressional effort to increase funding and training for many young Indians to be assets in their respective communities and in the Nation.

        "description":"The indigenous people of the North face many complex problems as they learn to cope with an invasion of culturally alien and numerically dominant groups from other areas. Their educational systems have theoretically been organized on principles of democracy and responsiveness to local community needs, but it has become obvious that existing programs are designed to accommodate the language, culture, economic system, and interest of the dominant group from the South. During the mid-1960's, a group of Alaskans and Canadians investigated the conditions affecting educational programs in each of the circumpolar nations with a view to suggesting alternative educational schemes. As a result, in 1969 a conference was held in Canada under the joint sponsorship of the Arctic Institute of  North America and the University of Alaska. The conference was organized around 4 basic areas and their relationship to education in the North: (1) economics; (2) administration; (3) pedagogy; and (4) culture. This book is organized along similar lines, but with modifications that update some elements of the subject. Conference participants came from the 7 circumpolar nations of Canada, Denmark (Greenland), Finland, Norway, the Soviet Union, Sweden, and the United States (Alaska). Part 5 of the report covers UNESCO experiences in cross-cultural education. The appendix lists conference participants. (KM)",

        "description":"Little of the profits produced by American agriculture stays in rural America. During 1973, the farmer received less than 46 cents of every food dollar spent at the supermarket even though food prices continued to soar. Farm subsidy payments, originally designed to protect the small farmer's income, were diverted to corporate giants, large farmers, or, in some instances, royalty. Food price and farm income increases did very little for the small farmer in 1973. Thus, the number of farms continued to decline (an estimated 100,000 people left rural America). Agribusiness corporations received 71% of all profits from the U. S. food industry. Also, the country's 2,809,000 farmworkers are suffering from low wages, seasonal work, limited coverage under protective labor legislation,  increased mechanization, lack of alternative job opportunities, few marketable skills, poor education, and critical health and housing needs. Such organizations as the United Farm Workers of America, Southern Mutual Help Association, National Coalition for Land Reform, National Sharecroppers Fund, and Experimental Farm and Training Center are working on these problems, showing that reform and revitalization in rural America are possible.

Some of their problems include uncertain jobs, changing work locations, seasonally induced intermittent work periods, traveling to distant areas, temporary and often inadequate housing, low earnings, fewer educational opportunities, and lower educational attainment. Their only hope of alleviating these problems remains in congressional action to: (1) change current laws which exclude farmworkers from social protections and (2) amend the Immigration and Nationality Act, thus  reducing the excessive and potentially endless supply of workers from Mexico. Yet, the migrant's crucial need is for a more active and effective policy by the Federal Government to: (1) mitigate the extreme severity of migrancy and (2) determine and implement measures which will help to eliminate migrancy.

        "description":"Discussing psychology for Africa, particularly rural Kenya, this paper presented two implications for the country and people interested in its affairs. First, although urbanization and &quot;Westernization&quot; are perhaps the most salient aspects of modern Africa, there is little understanding of how family relationships and child care are affected by these processes. The second implication examined the use of differences between black and white babies as evidence for racial superiority, arguing that precocity as a generalized phenomenon is not an accurate way to either conceptualize or investigate African infant development. Infant motor development has become almost a standard focus of African research, starting with Gerber in 1958, but it was not until recently that data were reported  to indicate that any differences exist between African and European development. Serious problems remain, however, arising from the use of standard Western infant development tests. It was reported that the early precocity of African infants begins to decline at approximately 18 months, until by the third year they score reliably below Western infants, but it is rarely noted that many of the test items introduced during the second year are distinctly Western. The study concluded that the motor precocity phenomena which are reliably known at present can be adequately explained by the variations in child care and training practices. The theory that there is a general precocity which is &quot;related primarily to genetic factors&quot; fails to acknowledge, and has difficulty in accounting for, the  discrete patterning of precocity and deficity.

At one time, 98 percent of the U.S. depended on the rural economy. Interrelated developments such as the input of ideas, enterprise, mechanical innovations, the opening of new and fertile lands, and the formation of new settlements contributed to early rural America's vitality and strength. While the countryside provided the material and human resources, urban centers were converting raw materials into a product. New markets began opening up for products and services in the urban areas. An interdependence and balance existed between urban and rural economies, but now the rural economic framework is no longer a viable  structure and has not been for many years. Today, many communities are dying in the rural areas. If rural America is to develop in concert with the rest of the nation, a new kind of economic and social framework needs to be created, including enterprises which can raise the economic level and make it more compatible with the times and conditions of the rest of the nation.

Data indicated that pregnancy in the adolescent, especially under age 16, is associated with high incidences of toxemia, anemia, contracted pelvis, prolonged labor, and a high maternal death rate. It is also the largest single reason why female students drop out of secondary schools. Considering the relationship between teenage pregnancy and poverty, the paper focused on adult female attitudes toward sexual and contracepting behavior for single, never pregnant, teenage girls. A questionnaire was administered by public health nurses to 50 black Aid for Dependent Children (AFDC) clients in rural Georgia. The study population, which was socioeconomically homogeneous,  included 15 respondents who were 19 years of age; 19 who were between 20 and 29; 13 between 30 and 39; and 3 above 40. Eighteen were single; 16 were married; 16 were separated (2 widows were included). Vincent's hypothesis of normative contradiction held for single and separated respondents in their permissive attitudes toward premarital sex and negative attitudes toward illegitimacy. The results seemed to suggest that premarital sex attitudes were more related to the respondent's sexual behavior than to age or role position. It was also noted that the results of this study cannot be taken as representative of low income blacks. (KM)",

        "description":"The document examines appropriate units for studying changes in familial relations and rural-urban ties, including the importance of the increasing interdependence of rural and urban contexts in family interaction. There have been two broadly contrasting approaches to the problems of urbanization and family change in Africa: (1) &quot;one-way&quot; model which postulates a generally progressive, undirectional Westernization and nuclearization of families as urban migration, industrialization, and other modernizing influences increase; (2) &quot;alternation&quot; model which concentrates on the interplay of tribe and town within a variety of urban settings. These two approaches often work at cross purposes, or explain different sets of data, even though both share a common set of analytical data.  Since these models use the urban social system as an explanatory variable, it is then essential to show that such &quot;urban&quot; factors are not also found to some degree among similar rural residents of the area from which men have migrated. The paper also examines some of the processes which generate household form among urban and rural samples of men and their families in Kenya. The major process of social change which influenced the study design is defined as the interaction by urban migrants in rural-urban networks of kin. An Abaluyia subtribe in Western Kenya, 230 miles from Nairobi, was chosen as a rural base. This area (Kisa) has a high proportion (55 percent) of its adult males working away in urban areas throughout East Africa, mostly Nairobi. As yet incomplete, these data evaluate  whether or not the network is an arbitrary research creation. (KM)",

        "description":"In recent years there has been increasing interest in the effects of bilingualism on cognitive growth and on the bilingual's attitude toward himself and his 2 language communities. One of the most widely quoted studies on bilingualism is that of Peal and Lambert (1962) who dealt with the relation between intelligence, attitude, and achievement in English as a second language for French Canadian children in Montreal. This 1972 study investigated whether the results of that study, which examined urban middle-class children who shared a western European background with their second language community, could be applied to village Eskimo children learning English. Fifty -six 10 year old Eskimo children in 6 villages in southwestern Alaska were tested and their families interviewed.  All testing and interviewing was done in Yupik dialect by natives of the area. The conclusions of the Peal and Lambert study were not found to be directly applicable to Eskimos, although there were some similarities. For village children, attitude, in terms of desire to emulate the white's way of life, is related to the mastery of form, but not to the mastery of the content, of English. Attitude toward self emerged as a significant factor affecting the performance of Eskimo children on measures of mental ability and in achievement in the meaningful use of English. (KM)",

Conducted at the Grove Elementary School (fictitious name) in Sonora (fictitious name), California, the study divided students into four categories (Anglo boys, Anglo girls, Chicano boys, and Chicano girls) to see if teachers extend differential treatment. Fifteen classes (grades 1-6) were observed for 214 hours. Teacher-pupil interaction was studied in seven categories: reward, punishment, control and management, teacher assigning academic-prestigious and nonacademic-prestigious tasks, and nontask academic and nonacademic teacher-pupil interaction. Data were collected through standard ethnographic  techniques (participation, observation, and interviews), modified interaction analysis schemes, questionnaires administered to the school personnel and the fourth, fifth, and sixth grade students, critical incidents, enumeration, census data, and an Occupational Interest Inventory. It was found that: (1) teachers interacted more with Anglo than with Chicano students; (2) Anglo boys ranked highest in all seven interaction categories; (3) Anglo girls came second in four of the seven areas; (4) teachers interacted least with Chicano girls in all categories; and (5) teachers interacted more with boys than girls in all areas.

        "description":"As an agent of the sociocultural system, the school is a formal means of cultural transmission, conveying values, skills, attitudes, cognitive skills, and behavior patterns necessary for membership in society and survival of the sociocultural system. For Mexican Americans and other immigrants, the school also has the responsibility of acculturation. Conceived, established, managed, and staffed largely by white middle class Anglos, the school is more or less an extension of the Anglo child's family. But for the Mexican American child, the school is a source of stress, alienation, cultural confrontation, and oppression. This paper discusses the school as it relates to the Chicano community. A discussion of the Chicano child's background includes: (1) the importance of religion in  every aspect of life; (2) the family as the main source of support, security, affection, and identity; (3) the ideal male role of machismo; (4) the common values of honor, self-respect, and self-sufficiency; (5) parents as role models; (6) competitiveness in school; and (7) the home life and traditional Mexican culture which are in sharp contrast to the mainstream and the school culture. Among the 17 educational policy recommendations are: making schools bilingual and bicultural; recruitment and training of more Chicanos in schools; and extensive re-education of all school personnel.

Primary objectives were: (1) improvement in reading skills, (2) development of cultural awareness, and (3) meeting the special educational needs of Indian children. The evaluation covered 6 basic areas: reading performance, self concept, special education, student group and individual participation, cultural awareness, and management objectives. Various tests were administered, such as: the DISTAR Mastery Tests; Wide Range Achievement Test; the Primary Self Concept Inventory; and the Self  Appraisal Inventory. Some of the findings were: (1) little positive change, and in many instances a retrogression, in self concept; (2) reading readiness patterns were at or above grade level in all but 1 of the kindergartens; (3) little or no growth in most of the 7th and 8th grades; (4) field trip participation by all sites; (5) an expansion of special education services; and (6) success with the DISTAR program as far as the mastery tests were concerned.

These students, recruited from the Southeastern and Southwestern United States, transfered to the university to complete their junior and senior years. Maximum enrollment in the project was 16. In June and August of 1973, 11 students completed academic training and graduated; 3 failed to maintain the university's academic standard; 1 resigned for personal reasons; and 1 joined another Indian Teacher Training Project. The program was divided into: academic training, professional training, internship teaching, and  community involvement. Training was done on the university campus, in two Indian schools and one public school system. This paper presents an overview of the program and some implications for its continuation. Principle questions considered relate to the degree of \"Indianness\" among the Indian student teachers, the differences between Indian student teachers in Indian and non-Indian schools, and the advisability of developing or continuing special programs for Indians as prospective teachers of Indian children.

Session 4, the implementation of rural manpower delivery plans, focuses on institutional barriers, decentralization and revenue sharing, State support, and equity for special groups. The conference summary sees the future of rural manpower systems in the development of linkages between rural and urban areas and a modern-day labor exchange capable of dealing with a diverse clientele and their problems.

Data were collected on 48 students and involved general intelligence; sex; IOWA TESTS OF EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT scores on the BACKGROUND IN THE NATURAL SCIENCES TEST, READING IN THE NATURAL SCIENCE TEST, QUANTITATIVE THINKING TEST and the Composite score; personality types as determined by the MYERS-BRIGGS TYPE INDICATOR; score on selected PSSC test items;  scores on Part, unit and final tests constructed to evaluate understanding of concepts found in the materials; and rate of completion. Concepts in the areas of mechanics and wage motion were emphasized in the physics materials, with the processes of science being an integral part of the materials. Data analyses revealed that individual personality types showed no consistency in correlating significantly with program test scores or rate of progress; the sample was scholastically inclined when described by scores on the Iowa tests; the more able students achieved greater success with the materials than did the less able.

Eighteen hypotheses are identified which focus on the expected relative natures of perceived knowledge structures of the various agental groups and their relationship to the types of curricula used. These hypotheses are used to provide a context within which to view relevant research. In this review the definition of &quot;psychological structure of knowledge&quot; accepts in principle the underlying theoretical positions of Ausubel and Dyer. A schema is presented illustrating the flow of knowledge structures as they encounter various transformations and interpretations from the raw unstructured events of  the environment enroute to those of the mature student, and attention is drawn to the distinction between the processes involved in structuring the various science curricula. A 104-item bibliography is included with the paper. (Author/PEB)",

The novelty of the prediction model is that it estimates and predicts on the basis of knowledge of materials and quantities before they become a part of the solid waste stream. The project elected to test feasibility in the area of residential solid waste. Because of the complexity resulting from the countless items that enter the average home, it was felt that this area of study would most likely highlight the weakness of the technique. Results of the study seem to indicate that the model performed quite well. Although the approach involves certain difficulties in implementation and  maintenance in the residential sector, this is not necessarily true for the commercial sector. Stories deal more in bulk than residences do, and consequently, complexity is reduced. Details of the model and a discussion of its advantages and shortcomings are presented. (JP)",

S. Public Health Service, entered into a joint experimental windrow composting project in 1966 with the Tennessee Valley Authority and the City of Johnson City, Tennessee. A high-rate composting demonstration plant was also established at Gainesville, Florida under a solid waste management grant. The objectives of these projects were to investigate and demonstrate the economic and technical feasibility of composting municipal refuse. The operational experience gained there and elsewhere are presented in this report. Important conclusions drawn from this study are: (1) composting,  properly practiced, can be a nuisance-free way to recycle organic wastes without significantly polluting water and land resources; (2) composting municipal refuse is technically feasible, but it costs more than sanitary landfilling and can cost more than incineration; and (3) the process cannot succeed with results from sale of salvaged or final compost because of a small and unpredictable market. The final conclusion was that waste disposal by composting is not the total answer, but rather one approach to be considered in a solid waste management system. (JP)",

Until recently, no systematic analysis of the relationship between packaging and solid waste disposal had been undertaken.

Part I discusses packaging materials, consumption data from 1959 to 1966, and the outlook for the period from 1966 to 1976. Part II, concerned with disposability, analyzes the collectability, the resistance to disposal and processing, and salvageability and re-use of packaging materials. Part III explores mechanisms to mitigate the problems that arise from this type of waste: how  research, education, incentive programs, taxes, and regulations can reduce the quantity and reduce the processing difficulties of this disposed material, yet save the natural resources from which packages are made.

A group of teachers enrolled in an Intermediate Science Curriculum Study (ISCS) in-service course were asked to administer a Self-Directed Rating Scale to their ISCS students. Data were collected from a total of 1108 students and were analyzed using analysis of variance tests and t-tests to determine significant differences among the  variables measured. When students were compared in terms of their relative degree of success in the program it was obvious that students who were more successful perceived themselves as being more self-directed. Experience in the program had a significant effect on how students perceived their ability to direct their own learning activities. In general, girls in this sample saw themselves as more self-directed than did boys. (Author/EB)",

The structured mode was identifiable with the teaching strategy typical of a curriculum such as Science--A Process Approach. The teacher controlled specific arrangements of apparatus, the method of investigation, the amount of data to be collected, and directed pupil discussion toward a specific objective. Four classes of grade 6 pupils were required to complete two sets of activities modified from a process based elementary science curriculum. In both treatments, introductory and summary class discussions were conducted, and pupils  worked in pairs. Two achievement tests were used as a pretest and posttest for each set of activities as well as a preference scale, in modified semantic differential format. The independent variables were treatment, sex, IQ, creativity, personality (extraversion, neuroticism, and dependency), and socioeconomic status. In general, subjects achieved better when taught in the structured mode. It was also found that subjects exhibited a significant preference for the structured mode and that preference was significantly related to class and IQ. (Author/EB)",

        "description":"Reported is a study of classificational preference of 250 school children ranging in age from 3 to 8 years old. These subjects showed typical diversity in academic experiences and intellectual aptitudes. The research procedure involved presenting a subject with a set of colored paper shapes and asking him to sort the objects into subsets. The review of literature indicated that the 4-to 7-year-old child would tend to sort by color and that older children would tend to sort by shape or form. The data consisted of a count of the number of subjects who sorted by form and those who sorted by color. Comparisons were made between the age and sex of a youngster and his history of preference. The analysis of the data led to the following conclusions: (1) youngsters in all age groups  tested (including preschool) had a strong tendency to sort colored papers by form rather than color; (2) this preference was evident for both sexes; and (3) even in those sets biased against shape as a criterion for grouping, form was still chosen over color in a ratio of 2:1. It was suggested that this preference for form over color as a criterion for classification develops before formal schooling. Suggestions supporting this include influence of television programs.

Increased emphasis is placed on decision making by the candidates. The program began in 1971 as an informal teacher education program between the University of Illinois (Urbana campus) and High School District 214 (includes 8 high schools and nearly 20,000 students). It has since expanded to include other Illinois universities and several elementary school districts that &quot;feed&quot; to High School District 214. The Cooperative Teacher Education Project (CTEP) concept includes  inservice education as well. Several methods for data collection have been employed, as well as methods for analysis of these data. The analysis of follow-up data, spring 1973, reveals strikingly different patterns of job taking by CTEP and traditionally trained teachers. Many more CTEP graduates took teaching positions following graduation, generally in highly competitive schools. (Author/EB)",

An extensive review of the literature, including many journals outside the field of education, was carried out. Results of the study include: (1) there is very little evidence for a Unitary Stage of Formal Operational Thought; (2) since this is so, it was considered impossible to define an age of acquisition of Formal Operational Thought; (3) there is evidence to show that schooling has an effect on the age at which subjects become able to perform formal operational tasks; and (4) specific  science curricula do not seem to effect change in performance on formal operational tasks. The results of the review of literature suggest that the idea of one stage of Formal Operational Thought may not be useful in the attempt to understand adolescent thought and to design high school science curricula.

Seven questions related to the 1968-1969 ISCS test Probing the Natural World, Volume I were studied. The investigations of these questions was undertaken in two stages: (1) a pilot study using six classes in one junior high school, and (2) the major study which involved the testing of 28 seventh-grade ISCS classes at five junior high schools. The pilot study findings indicated the need for a revised test. In addition, achievement over the school year was examined using a repeated measure design. Item analysis data were used to see what changes in the psychometrics of the two  instruments occurred as a result of revision. The Hotelling t-test was used to see if the revised ISCS test had a reduced correlation with reading as compared with the 1968-1969 ISCS test. Reading comprehension was found to be an important factor related to achievement on both the original and revised tests. The findings indicated that the oral-demonstration technique is a valid method to compensate for lack of reading ability. (Author/EB)",

The population for this study included 10 BSCS teachers who had enrolled for two semesters in an instructional program designed to make teachers aware of alternative skills and strategies of inquiry; to recognize those used in their own classrooms; to select, practice, and implement selected strategies; and to plan instructional activities to develop inquiry behaviors in students. This Instructional Staff Development (ISD) Program was designed for experienced teachers interested in improving inquiry learning in their classrooms. Each participating teacher was videotaped in one randomly selected class before and after instruction in the ISD program. Verbalized behaviors were  coded using the Revised Inquiry Analysis Instrument. The \"Self-pairing\" of observations technique was used with measurement of the same individuals before and after treatment. Results showed the percentage of total teacher talk was significantly lower in the inquiry setting and student talk higher. Variety of verbal influence behaviors used by students was greater. The percentage of time spent verbalizing \"data analysis and interpretation\" and \"procedures\" was significantly greater in the inquiry setting. (Author/EB)",

This research provides empirical evidence for one culture, the Kpa-Mende. Anthropological field methods were used to collect data to develop a base from which to ask meaningful questions about natural phenomena. The sample schools in general were found to offer relatively little explicit science instruction concerning natural phenomena of major concern to the Kpa-Mende. Classroom instruction tended to emphasize more abstract scientific concepts. Students were interviewed concerning the explanation for 12 natural phenomena. In the pilot study, using a three-point grading for school answers, the student responses without home explanations were found to be  statistically more like the schools than those with home explanations. The main study ranked the phenomena according to the percentage of fathers who discussed a single culture item at home. A correlation of the adult percentage with student grouped scores was not significant. A correlation of adult percentage with those of students expressing the same explanations was significant at the .05 level. It was noted that many of the students failed to use school information. Strategies need to be developed to sensitize teachers to nonschool learning. (Author/EB)",

It was assumed that such a strategy would enhance a future teacher's understanding of science concepts and processes in addition to developing more positive attitudes toward science. The course is described as different from other available courses in three aspects. First, a philosophy of teaching elementary science was considered during development. Second, course content was selected according to the particular needs of elementary teachers. Preference was given to topics which were considered to honestly reflect the content of the discipline and still possess application value for teachers. Third, instruction  incorporated competency-based strategies. Terminal objectives were explicitly stated at the beginning of each topic; a self-paced modular format allowed for individual differences in achieving and demonstrating competence. Course content, student evaluation, course evaluation, as well as changes in the understanding of science concepts and processes are presented. (Author/EB)",

Mathematical structure was defined as the relationship between concepts within a set of abstract systems. The word association technique was used to measure the existing relations (cognitive structure) in S's memory with respect to the probability theory present in the text. The purpose of this study was to measure the influence of content structure (mathematical structure) of the text on the Ss' cognitive structure. Control and experimental Ss (N=34) were high school (grades 9-12) subjects recruited from study halls and mathematics classes in one high school. Experimental Ss (N=20) studied the probability text while the others studied a programed  text on an unrelated mathematical topic. For subjects in the experimental group, a strong similarity between the representation of content structure and cognitive structure was found. The structure methodology used in this study appears to be applicable to many aspects of research on learning mathematical structures and might be a helpful tool in formative evaluation of mathematics curricula. The data on content structure and cognitive structure seem to suggest ways to improve the text to further student learning of structure. (JP)",

The vocational students who were the subjects of this study exhibited similar characteristics, having IQ's ranging from below 70 to 105 and reading levels from second to ninth grades. Treatment for the experimental group differed only in one respect. During the lecture that initiated each daily module, each student in this group was given a copy of the behavioral objectives to be used as a study guide. A student was to consider his efforts in completing the module successful when he was capable of doing all the tasks specified by the objectives. Following the completion of eight modules, a  two-day test requiring manipulative demonstrations of the skills taught was given. Analysis of variance was used to determine significant differences between treatments and among ability groups. Prior knowledge of behavioral objectives produced significantly better performance by all in terminal achievement, critical operations, residual achievement and attitude toward instruction. The Iowa Test of Educational Development ability levels affected performance. Significant F ratios showed positive attitude gains for the experimental population. (Author/EB)",

It was conducted using 29 student teachers, 15 of whom were arbitrarily assigned as the experimental group. This group participated in instructional sessions designed to assist them in implementing a special program - Elementary Environmental Attitudes Program. The instructional model for teacher training consisted of a multi-media presentation of a series of colored slides correlated with audio-tapes of music and monologue. Discussion periods followed each session. The basic research design was Campbell and Stanley's non-equivalent control design. Pretests for both experimental and control groups consisted of: Environmental Semantic Differential for both children  and adults, Environmental Concern Inventory for children, and a questionnaire on Environmental Problems for the teachers. The posttests consisted of the same instruments as well as a student questionnaire. Analysis of the data was made by comparison of means of pre- and posttest scores using ANOVAR (Veldman, 1967). Certain scores on the Semantic Differential seemed to provide more selectivity and discrimination with regards to attitude change than any other instrument. The study indicates the possible potential for use of color slides as a medium for recognizing attitudinal change. (Author/EB)",

Selection of teachers resulted in three groups: (A) those forced to adopt the new syllabus, (B) those who voluntarily adopted the new syllabus, and (C) those who helped develop the syllabus. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal (pre-post) designs were used to test hypotheses formed. Data were collected from students and teachers. Adoption of the new syllabus did effect the predicted changes. Group A teachers did not employ teaching behaviors advocated to the same degree as did teachers from Groups B and C. Some fluctuations of  teacher educational opinions did occur on initial experience with the new syllabus, but overall this variable seemed to be relatively stable, with differences across groups being detected. Results of tests suggested students perform best on the tests designed for the syllabus used by their teacher. The study failed to detect differences across groups or time with respect to student ability to employ the processes of science. (Author/EB)",

Emphasis was placed on the processes of learning employed. An instrument was developed consisting of verbs or phrases describing various behaviors performed by a scientist when doing science. Such activities included observation, measurement, hypothesizing, predicting, interpreting data and other mental and tactile operations. The instrument was administered to students at the end of their first year. They were asked to rate each operation on: (1) its importance for medical and dental students; and (2) the extent to which they actually did perform each activity as a result of their involvement in the Basic Medical Sciences curriculum. Data were  analyzed using a two-way multi-variate analysis of variance, with the principal contrasts consisting of medical versus dental students and ideal versus actual experience. Striking differences between the two sets of ratings were observed indicating that many of the processes judged important were not commonly exercised during the first year of study. It seemed that students' perception of their actual experience was learning about science by memorizing and organizing great bodies of information. (Author/EB)",

It includes two basic categories of modules: (1) content modules, providing background in specific subject areas; and (2) teaching strategy modules, dealing with the methodology of individualization and specific teaching behaviors. The Individualized Teacher Preparation (ITP) modules focus on evaluation of student progress, carrying out effective inquiry, helping students adjust to their role in individualization, and organizing the classroom for individualization. The  production and dissemination of these materials are described in this paper. The Project has organized a network of area field consultants to aid in organizing in-service efforts using the ITP modules. This network of consultants ranges across the continental United States.

Frequencies and descriptions of systematic errors in the four algorithms in arithmetic were studied in upper-middle income, regular, and special education classrooms involving 744 children. Children were screened for adequate knowledge of basic facts and for receiving prior instruction on the computational process. Systematic errors contain a recurring incorrect computational process and are differentiated from careless errors and random errors. Errors were studied within levels of computational skill for each algorithm. Results showed that five to six percent of the children made systematic errors in the addition, multiplication, and division algorithms. The figure was 13 percent for the subtraction algortihm. One year later 23  percent of the children were making either the identical systematic error or another systematic error. (Author/JP)",

The essay presents four phases of a value clarification strategy and definitions of student verbal statements associated with these phases. Four teacher interrogative behaviors relevant to the design of and implementation of the \"value sheet\" are identified. Six formats of the value sheet are presented with examples of each format provided. The instructions on how the classroom teacher can construct his own value sheets are presented. As used in this essay, the value sheet is defined as a planned learning activity designed to encourage students to express, examine, and organize  their values and feelings; and as a planned activity that can be employed as part of on-going inquiries in the science classroom. Value clarification refers to language patterns employed by students, used as a basis for inferring that they are comprehending, conceptualizing, and valuing knowledge about man and society.

The program must be flexible enough to meet the individual needs of its participants and must make them capable not only of coping with change but also of using various methodologies to plan and regulate change. A general curriculum component should deal with the principles, procedures, analysis, and organization of curriculum development and with curriculum theory. Important aspects of a curriculum program are components providing familiarity and competence in decision-making; systems analysis; the organization of educational institutions; communication of educational ideas, materials, and resources; educational  psychology; and the dynamics of a community. Research experience, intern experience, a dissertation, and competence in a discipline area must also be included.

Four areas of particular disadvantage are stereotyping in books, athletic programs, industrial arts and home economics programs, and administrative policy, which entails hiring female principals and designing buildings with facilities for both sexes. Discussion of these concerns is illustrated by exhibits from textbooks, memos, statements of policy, letters, and bibliographies of alternative literature emphasizing women. A list of 43 specific problems within those four areas, summarizing the content of the report and  giving suggestions for solutions, is keyed to the discussion and exhibits for easy reference.

The major portion of the newsletter is devoted to the presentation of a simulation game, called Carenton Connector or Bypass Game. A newspaper, map, citizen questionnaire, and information cards constitute a simulation which encourages high student involvement in solving real community problems in planning and in environment. Career clusters related to the simulation are discussed. An Education Information System proposes a total  school-community approach in gathering and cataloging useful, potential problem-solving information for community goals and problems. An article on a remedial physical education program is followed by a column voicing parent opinions and activities. Topics of past issues include human relations, math, foreign languages, inservice teacher training, and testing and evaluation.

        "description":"Curriculum as a field of study emerged in an intellectual climate in which the idea of social control was dominant. The intent of this paper is to look historically at the integration of the idea of social control into curriculum discourse, to indicate its dominant position as the underlying assumption of most early curriculum work, and to suggest the importance of this fact for contemporary curriculum thought. Section I marks the historical formulation of the idea of social control in American thought. Sections II and III outline the theories of Ross and Elwood, contenders of the two basic viewpoints of overt and covert social control. Section IV looks at the social context in which the idea of social control was developed, while Section V deals with influences in operation on  curriculum such as developments in the field of psychology. Section VI presents the views of other formative theorists in the emerging field of educational sociology. Section VII considers whether that initial orientation toward social control still remains. It is observed that the idea of social control continues to dominate and that the function of this orientation historically and perhaps today has been to restrict certain segments of the nation's population in the name of social homogeneity.

Introductory remarks comment on the basic items of the questionnaire used to collect the data and discuss some of the problems within the survey format and its statistical analysis. The overview and analysis justify the survey on the basis of the current state of law and citizenship education as well as prevailing attitudes toward law and lawyers. Noted from the results of the survey are the following conclusions: that few programs make any  attempt to involve students as participants in the legal or political process; that state departments of education are very inactive in this field; that most of the outstanding projects stress instructional techniques that encourage thought; and that few projects receive federal money through Title III or the United States Office of Education or from the large national foundations.

Most units are developed with the use of case studies. The course is divided into the following six units: Overview of Our Political System; Political Parties and Elections; Executive Process; Legislative Process; Judicial Process; and Decision Making at the Local Level. An introduction to the teacher's guide includes behavioral  goals, skills, key concepts, rationale, and teaching strategies.

Purposes of the study were to obtain measures of student attitude toward economics at the beginning and at the end of the introductory courses, and to estimate the direction as well as the extent of changes in attitude over the time period when the students were enrolled in the course. Among the major findings are the following: (1) student attitude toward economics tended to deteriorate over the time period when the students were enrolled in the course; and (2) the demand for economic knowledge and instruction in economics  was lower at the conclusion of the course than at the beginning. To determine whether the QSATE-O was valid for the population of students with whom it was used, a predictive validity problem was constructed and tested. The reliability of the instrument was also measured. Results indicate that the instrument was a valid measure of student attitude and that it operated in a highly reliable manner. The original and revised forms of the questionnaire on student attitudes toward economics and a summary of statistical procedures used in the study are included in the report. (RM)",

        "description":"Predicated on the premise that social justice cannot be achieved without social action, that change does not occur without change agents, and that the only significant reforms in schools are those promoting social justice, it is argued that teachers who are reformers in education must be willing to pay their dues. Traditional approaches to reform are available so long as one remains within the bureaucratic structure, and not all rewards for promoting change are positive. On the whole, there are a few models to inspire students in education to become more oriented to reform. It is those involved in reform at the college level, however, who gain experiences to prepare them to be truly effective teachers. As a reform effort is a political act, reformers must recognize the risks of  being perceived as different and the difficulty of bridging the gap between rhetoric and implementation. The emphasis on job security in education and a surplus supply of teachers lessens the attractiveness of challenging the educational status quo. If one wishes, therefore, to be a reformer, one will pay some dues both personally and professionally. While not everything that happens to the reformer is necessarily negative, hard work and frustration must be expected. (Author/KSM)",

Examples from the past include the Social Darwinism which dominated American thinking during the nineteenth century; the iron law of wages, that the income of the masses could not rise above a minimum level necessary for existence; the premise of natural inferiority which throve in anthropology and ethnology during the period of imperialism; and the various accounts of Reconstruction in the United States. The concept of a culture of poverty put forward in recent times falls  into the same trap. Social scientists have a special responsibility to understand the implications of their work; to act on that understanding; and to detect bias in the thrust of their investigations. (Author/JH)",

As solutions are sought for environmental problems and attempts made to adjust our way of life to an environment finite in space and resources, the method must be a humanized one.

Criteria for assessing potential music students often reflect achievement rather than aptitude; objective tests are often too atomistic and narrow in scope or are too subjective and dependent on culture and training. By defining musical aptitude as the ability to conceive the structure of acoustic material, and by placing that definition within a model representing the areas of important variable correlation with musical comprehension--areas of sensory discrimination, musical aptitude and some correlated factors, and personality--a basis for a culture-free test of aptitude was derived. The test  was administered to 30 music institute students, ages 10-18, and consisted of recognition of a second series of sounds as a segment of a first series of sounds. Analysis of the results, which correlated .60 with teacher's ratings, have motivated further study which will consist of a lengthened test, the use of the test in selecting institute students, and the correlating of musical ability with general intelligence and spatial ability.

The education of the population scientist, therefore, must integrate demography, sociology, anthropology, psychology, political science, information science, management science/operations research, reproductive biology, and human ecology. The population scientist must be educated in his roles in the collection and organization of knowledge about the sizes of subsets of the  human population and in the management of those sizes. Existing graduate programs at various universities across the country display a miscellany of approaches and emphases; most programs are not taught within a single department, and few or none require management science.

Ninety-two elementary and secondary teachers randomly selected from participants in two social studies conferences were asked to describe in writing an incident in which they were faced with a dilemma. Tables present story categories assigned by teachers (decision-making justice, dissent, and equality), interpersonal involvement, the perceived antagonist, and solutions to dilemma situations. Implications drawn from the data suggest that this sample of teachers seemed unable to perceive a situation from another's viewpoint and resolved conflict by authority or avoidance. It is observed that values education materials can be of little avail  if teachers are unable to perceive or understand the viewpoints and positions of others. (Author/KSM)",

The maps of 60 high school students from Nogales, Arizona, and 60 from Nogales, Sonora, were analyzed according to number of map features included, percent of features for each continent, frequency of country identification in South America and Asia, perceived relative sizes of the continents, and the accuracy of forms of the continents. The data were examined to discover cultural influences on map differences, and other influences such as proximity, size and shape of countries and continents, and currency in the news of particular countries. Results indicated a tendency for Mexican students to have a better conception of South America, while the American  students were more aware of many Asian areas. Both groups saw North America and Europe as the most important areas of the world, suggesting the importance of their cultural roots there. (Author/JH)",

The effects of their having received an award are summarized and then broken down by teaching level (primary, intermediate, junior high, secondary, and higher education) and by degree of award. Responses deal with promotion, salary increases, recognition from employers, public recognition, publications, outside employment, effect of school curriculum, effect on winner's teaching, assistance to other educators, participation in council or center programs in economic education, and interest in awards programs. Representative comments from the winners  are included. The award appears to have had a beneficial impact on the recipient, his associates, and his school. The importance that the winners attach to recognition of their achievement by their peers and school administration is particularly evident among the responses. (JH)",

The introduction presents an overview of MACOS, the major hypotheses tested, and the design and function of the observation instrument. Chapter 2 reviews the literature on MACOS, emphasizing the learning theory on which MACOS is based and the relationship of cultural background to scholastic achievement. Chapter 3 discusses observation findings, analyzing classroom lessons, nonverbal activities, and classroom atmosphere. Chapter 4 presents pre-posttest results and the item analysis and analysis of variance performed on the Man and Animals tests and the Netsilik Eskimo tests. Chapter 5 concludes that the major teaching styles and classroom  atmosphere did change and that there was a clear movement toward a more student-centered classroom. MACOS did fulfill several of its pedagogical aims, such as development of inquiry skills, use of primary sources, increased communication, and promotion of open-ended discussions. Pre- and posttest results showed a definitive improvement on posttest scores. Students' scores varied significantly according to socioeconomic areas and on attitudes toward basic concepts. Appendixes include the observation form, notes and data, tests and accompanying data, and chi-square test on semantic differential items. (Author/KSM)",

Remaining sections of the guide are devoted to a study of specific minority groups--American Indian, black American, Asian American, Mexican American--from the standpoint of their social organizations, including the family, its customs and traditions; the social history of the group in America; and its  contributions to American society. These sections may be used separately or comparatively. All of the lessons are designed in a flexible manner for use at any elementary grade level. Each lesson provides objectives, activities, and resource materials.

The major emphasis at present is on the theoretical aspects of political socialization using data from the unit on conflict. Future plans for curriculum  development include the organization of a consortium, continuing development of a comprehensive K-8 curriculum in social studies, and continuing basic research on political socialization. Appendixes to the report include lists of members of the committee and cooperating school districts and excerpts from the report on the committee's \"Bill of Rights\" project. (JH)",

Although selected for the use of professional educators, such as secondary school teachers, counselors, and curriculum planners, much of the material can be read by mature junior high and senior high students. Selections include current and historical information, statistical data, problem identification, and analysis that should prove useful in explaining to  students some of the major dimensions of the work system and the broader economic and social world. For schools interested in establishing a world-of-work economic education library, the contents of the bibliography are grouped into categories of essential, highly useful, and valuable books.

Although long ignored, moral education, as the British call it, is being emphasized as the pressures on and needs of children in a fast-paced society have become evident. Professional organizations have conducted workshops on the topic of values education. On the \"how to\" level, the Americans have produced a variety of programs, curriculum materials, and teacher guides that are of use to the social studies teacher. Sources of such materials include the Social Science Education Consortium's \"Data Book\" and the November 1973 issue of \"Social Education.\" A variety of books in education dealing with increasing options in teaching are relevant to moral educators. Projects such as \"Man: A Course  of Study\" include extensive teacher training programs. As values education gains a legitimate place in the curriculum, teachers will feel increasingly free about incorporating a value orientation into other parts of their regular curriculum. (JH)",

        "description":"The problem of the desegregation process in public schools, beginning with the Supreme Court decision Brown v the Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, is that it is conceived of as an artificial climate imposed by ratios and busing rather than a learning situation wherein ethnocentricity is developed as a positive attribute. Integration, however, is an experience of heart and mind wherein different racial and ethnic groups exist in an atmosphere of mutual respect and understanding. To achieve integration, educational systems have spent little time or resources in preparing staffs for teaching in an integrated climate. The results have often led to misunderstandings, fear, and hostility among both faculty and students. The first step in moving toward an integrated school climate  would be to establish positive intergroup relations among professional educators. From there other problems and alternatives could be discussed. These include the need for the establishment of objectives and criteria for student evaluation based on diversified cultural backgrounds, the encouragement of rational inquiry into controversial issues in the classroom, and the stressing of diversified value systems to students. Other problems such as the need for new curriculum and methods of instruction could be openly discussed. The net result would be a new humanistic approach to education. A key ingredient to achieve this integrated classroom environment is the attitude of teachers. (Author/DE)",

Traditional categories of special education have been de-emphasized, and a systems approach has been applied within a conceptual model to guide the integration of didactics with practicum activities. The conceptual model is constructed upon the building blocks of (a) instructional methodology; (b) experience/practicum; and (c) educational  management. Internal evaluation involves a continuous monitoring of practicum experiences based upon the observation of pupil-teacher interactions. Competencies are judged by the demonstrations of performance criteria at each step of the practicum experience. External evaluation is performed by advisory groups and consultants and through special workshops intended to provide feedback for program evaluation. (Author/JA)",

The entire module consists of this guide, a protocol film, and testing materials. The student guide contains: (1) instruction in the use of protocol modules, (2) a discussion of the concept of group alerting and its use in deterring disruptive behavior in the classroom, (3) lessons for recognition of instances of group alerting in classroom situations, and (4) practice exercises for applying the concept of group alerting in simulated teaching situations. The principle which underlies the concept of group alerting is that teacher behaviors designed to keep students alert will increase on-task behavior and reduce deviant behavior in the  classroom. Three techniques of group alerting are noted: (1) questioning techniques--the teacher frames a question and pauses before calling on a reciter rather than naming a reciter and then giving the question; (2) recitation strategy--the teacher calls on reciters at random rather than calling on them in a predetermined sequence; and (3) alerting cues--the teacher alerts nonperformers that they may be called on.

The entire module consists of this guide, a protocol film, and testing materials. The student guide contains (a) instruction in the use of protocol modules, (b) a discussion of learner accountability and its use in improving classroom management, (c) lessons for recognition of examples of teacher use of learner accountability, and (d) practice exercises for applying learner accountability in teaching situations. The concept of learner accountability is based on the principle that when the teacher uses specific strategies to hold the student accountable for his work during class, they will increase student work involvement and  reduce the frequency of disruptive behavior. Three techniques which will increase classroom management are: (a) goal-directed prompts--the teacher focuses on the student's goals by asking him about his work plans or work progress; (b) work showing--the teacher holds students accoutable for their work by having them show work or demonstrate skills or knowledge; and (c) peer involvement--the teacher involves students in the work of their peers by having them respond to another student's recitation or work activity.

The entire module consists of this guide, a protocol film, and testing materials. The student guide contains: (a) instruction in the use of protocol learning modules, (b) a discussion of transitions in the classroom, (c) practice lessons for recognition of smooth classroom transitions, and (d) practice exercises for applying the techniques of a smooth transition in simulated teaching experiences. The principle upon which this module is based is that management techniques used by the teacher either facilitate or interfere with the smooth transition from one  classroom activity to another. Three types of teacher behavior which interfere with smooth transitions are: (a) stimulus boundedness-the teacher is deflected from the main activity and reacts to some external stimulus that is unrelated to the ongoing activity; (b) thrust--the teacher bursts in suddenly on the children's activities in a manner that indicates that her own intent was the only determinant of her timing and point of entry; and (c) flip-flop--the teacher starts a new activity without bringing the original activity to a close and then returns to the original activity.

The entire module consists of this guide, a protocol film, and testing materials.

The principle underlying this module is that teacher behaviors which demonstrate a teacher's awareness of what is going on in  the classroom tend to increase student work involvement and decrease disruptive student behavior. Four teacher behaviors are noted: (a) desisting--the teacher demonstrates \"withitness\" by telling students to stop the deviant behavior, being sure that the desist is directed at the initiating student and that it is administered before the deviant behavior spreads; (b) suggesting alternative behavior; (c) concurrently praising--the teacher avoids direct confrontation with the disruptive student by concurrently praising the nondeviant behavior of other students; and (d) describing--the teacher describes or has the disruptive student describe the desirable behavior which the student usually exhibits or should exhibit in place of the deviant behavior.

The two authors believe that human relations is very important in education and that the open classroom actually depends on the openness of the teacher. The authors hold in common the view that the open classroom teacher (a) must pay attention to process as well as content; (b) should have a bias for group decision making; and (c) is helped by experience with group exercises, games, simulations, and psycho-social learning experiences (PSLE). In the first section of the book, one author relates his experiences as a teacher of educational psychology and describes the difficult but rewarding effort to have students assume  responsibility for themselves and their own learning. The second author describes 16 PSLEs he has used in workshops for teachers and analyzes each according to whether its chief purpose is to simulate a conflict situation, a problem-solving situation, a situation involving leadership, or a situation involving a change in self-concept.

Problems discussed include the following: (a) professional educators ignore the problem of ethnic pupils' school achievement; (b) teacher behavior fosters pupil behavior that fulfills the culturally derived expectation; and (c) teachers hold biased stereotypical views of minority pupils. The discussion on assessment strategies includes the following topics: (a) assessment of cognitive and behavioral skills, (b) behavioral assessment strategies, (c) behavioral objectives, (d) instructional strategies on designing a  learning environment, and (e) evaluation as a tool for collecting data to optimize the system. The author concludes that training institutions should facilitate an educational policy which promotes the following: (a) conducting scientific analyses of learning tasks and designing teacher functions to maximize the probability of achievement, (b) redesigning teacher function with the CBTE model, (c) instructing teachers in the pros and cons of reinforcement practices, (d) designing internships for teachers, (e) providing instruction on teacher expectancies of minority pupils and the ramifications of teacher behavior, and (f) instructing teachers in the evaluation of pupil performance on a pre-post performance continuum.

The study also aimed (a) to identify the subjects' deviations from standard English and to select the most socially stigmatizing items, (b) to prepare and evaluate lessons dealing with those items, and (c) to identify and list those aspects of teacher behavior which contributed to the students' performance. The subject group consisted of 25 black male students of average ability from a large inner-city high school. The students were exposed to a 20-day treatment composed of lessons developed by the investigator. Students were tested four times during the study, and the data derived from these tests  led to the conclusion that urban high school students can master standard English when the following conditions are met: (a) the teacher establishes a rapport with the students which puts students and teacher on the same side; (b) specific goals are set with the students' cooperation; (c) rules are agreed upon mutually; (d) subject matter contexts are based on topics of interest to the students; (e) the help of natural class leaders is enlisted; (f) the teacher exercises firmness with flexibility; (g) the students' attention is directed to a few surface features of the standard dialect; and (h) the teacher understands the students as individuals and as members of a cultural group.

Educators continue to seek new materials and different approaches to reading instruction for students who read below their grade and expectancy levels and who need a remedial program. Reading, like speaking and listening, must be considered a language process. The reader must operate in response to real, meaningful, grammatical language if he is to have all the information available to him in proper interrelationship, and he must be able eventually to reconstruct and comprehend a passage. Those instructional materials and strategies in which learning is viewed as an accumulation of bits and pieces are unjustified and ineffective. For materials to be  effective they have to be based on a thorough knowledge of reading as a language process. Remedial reading materials should, then, incorporate aspects of the native language developed naturally in a reading program. (HMD)",

        "description":"This study describes behavioral response--both its theoretical specification and its estimation--which relates health service utilization and expenditures to a number of variables: demographic, psychological, economic, medical, and policy-related. By incorporating these behavioral relations into a recently developed microsimulation model, national and area demands for health services can be aggregated and contrasted for alternative health insurance schemes. The study uses data on individuals from the 1967 National Center for Health Statistics Interview Study and attempts to estimate the relationship between the demand for health services and various economic, demographic, and psychological factors. The study is composed of six chapters. Chapter 1 reviews the relevant health  economics literature and draws inferences from this theory for use in the model. Chapter 2 describes previous quantitative demand studies which make use of microeconomic data bases. Chapter 3 describes the derivation of the theoretical context of the theoretical and empirical considerations. Chapter 4 discusses the 1967 study used as data base. In chapter 5, behavioral equations are estimated from this data base and the empirical results are discussed. Some concluding observations constitute chapter 6. (Author/JA)",

In the overview, IGE is defined as a comprehensive system to produce higher education achievements through providing for differences among children according to what they have learned, how rapidly they learn, and their learning style. The seven components of IGE are described. They are as follows: (a) instructional programming, (b) organization for instruction, (c) curriculum materials, (d) a model for measurement and evaluation, (e) home-school communications, (f) facilitative environments, and (g) research and development. Graduate courses were gradually developed  to meet the needs of the teaching staff in IGE schools. These needs included leadership skills, curriculum materials to carry out instructional programming, and information about multiunit organization. The description of graduate courses includes a summary of course content; rationale, structure, and staffing of courses; and a description of the performance-based format. Appendixes include a chronology of IGE related events, graduate courses descriptions, and selected performance-based learning modules. A 7-item bibliography is included. (PD)",

In order to unify and integrate the teacher preparation experience, (a) the development of attitudes, skills, and understanding needed by a professional teacher must stand as the goal of the entire program; (b) theory and practice should not be academically separate but integrated particularly in the realistic setting of schools, pupils, communities; (c) teacher  developmental centers should become the locus of the major portion of a student's learning experience; (d) experts in all the relevant disciplines should be communally involved, operating as teams with a common student group for a significant length of time; (e) the critical field aspects of undergraduate programs should be pursued intensively, with a minumum of the equivalent of two semesters; and (f) the undergraduate and graduate programs leading to the two prevailing levels of teacher certification should be planned and operated as a whole, and experienced by the student as an integrated unit.

        "description":"This paper reviews studies of teacher anxiety (stress and tension) with a focus on the incidence, sources, and effects of anxiety, and methods of reducing it. Previously, global definitions of anxiety have been used, and assessment has been largely restricted to paper-and-pencil measures. The incidence of anxiety among teachers, both beginning and experienced, appears to be remarkably high, and its causes are usually associated with a variety of personal, social, and physical events. The functional relationships between these events and teacher anxiety and between teacher anxiety and other teacher behavior as well as pupil behavior are unknown. It is recommended that teacher anxiety be conceptualized in performance terms and measured directly in classroom situations through  external observation and self-observation. Data from such techniques would provide the basis for investigations of functional relationships between particular events and teacher anxiety as well as between anxious teacher behaviors and student performance. Promising techniques for reducing teacher anxiety, such as systematic desensitization, are considered. It is suggested that such techniques be incorporated in teacher education and evaluated experimentally. (Author)",

        "description":"This preliminary study was designed to help two teachers who felt excessively self-critical to increase their positive self-thoughts and decrease their negative self-thoughts, i.e., to improve their self-esteem. An intensive experimental design involving four phases was employed. Each phase--Baseline, Thought Stopping, Positive Intervention, and Follow-Up--lasted approximately 2 weeks. During all phases of the experiment the teachers observed their positive and negative self-thoughts with the help of wrist counters. Classroom observers coded instances of overt positive and negative behavior by the teachers. A positive intervention, which used stimulus cues to prompt positive self-thoughts, was effective in increasing the positive thoughts of one teacher. The results of thought  stopping (subvocalizing the word \"stop\" to inhibit unwanted thoughts) were mixed. The reported changes in self-thoughts were supported by two self-report measures and, to some extent, by the external observations of teacher and student classroom behavior. Some indication was found that self-observing does change the behavior being observed. (Authors)",

After some modifications of the program, the effects of the training on selected teacher and student behaviors were assessed by two experienced elementary teachers. Changes in three teacher behaviors (contingent praise, positive nonverbal responses, and negative commands) and their effects on four student variables (inappropriate verbal behavior, inappropriate nonverbal behavior, on-task behavior, and classroom noise) were examined using a multiple-baseline design. Self-observation was found to be associated with increases in positive teacher behaviors when those behaviors were being self-observed. The accuracy of the teachers' self-observation ranged from a mean of 41  percent to a mean of 88 percent. Self-observation by teachers was associated with some positive changes in certain student behaviors. In general, the effects of self-observation on the teachers were not maintained after the teachers discontinued observing and recording their behavior. (Authors)",

To the culturally and linguistically different, it offers the hope that the monolingual, monocultural nature of American schools will change in ways that will allow them more equal opportunity. Competency-based education has two attractive features for the linguistically and culturally different: (a) it assures fairness because it is a collaborative effort involving the school and the community and (b) its evaluation method is diagnostic and prescriptive rather than judgmental. The Community, Home, Cultural Awareness, and Language Training (CHCALT) model  is an example of a competency-based program designed to meet the needs of the linguistically and culturally different. The model was developed for Teacher Corps and is to be implemented in the School of Education at San Diego State University as a program for a Specialist Credential. The CHCALT teacher training model is divided into four basic components: (a) Philosophy of Education for the Culturally and Linguistically Different; (b) Sociocultural Awareness--Home and Community Based; (c) Oral Language and Assessment Techniques; and (d) Diagnostic and Prescriptive Strategies.

Sixty-one female and 544 males were interviewed concerning occupation, income, education, place of residence, distance traveled, and the size and nature of the recreationist groups. Findings reported are as follows: (a) a certain degree of affluence and sophistication is characteristic of Toledo Bend users; (b) men predominated in the Toledo Bend sample of users; (c) persons from age 25 to age 54 were slightly over-represented;  (d) white Louisiana residents age 25 and over with an upper-level education were over-represented; (e) most Toledo Bend users earn a family income of $10,000 or over; (f) urban residents were over-represented; (g) distance has a positive relationship with the length of time spent at Toledo Bend; and (h) most respondents were members of groups. The results of this exploratory study indicate that Toledo Bend already serves as an important recreation facility and has the potential to meet the growing demands of the population.

FTPP worked with 13 cadres in 13 different school communities; developed,  evaluated, and corrected five different district summer training programs; trained 314 teachers who were degree students; and provided in-service training on an on-going basis for approximately 2,500 educators in the Chicago Public Schools. The program has produced curriculum materials, audiovisual materials, literature describing the project, research reports and articles in professional journals, and program replications in the United States and abroad. The project will produce a monograph detailing the experiment and has produced a cadre of about 50 staff members who will assist other institutions to train professionals to deal with urban educational problems.

Sixty eleventh-grade students were selected on the basis of language scores on the California Achievement Test and randomly assigned to one experimental and two control groups (Control I and Control II). Experimental and Control I students received three week's training in language arts and teaching techniques. Experimental subjects tutored fourth-grade students in language arts for nine weeks, and Control I returned to their regular classes. Control II students did not receive training nor did they tutor. The three groups were pre- and post-tested on the  language section of the California Achievement Test, Piers-Harris Children's Self Concept Scale, and the School Interest Inventory. Results of an analysis of covariance, using pretest scores as covariate, while not significant, showed interesting trends in the areas of self-concept and school sentiment. Tutors were found to be valuable assets in the classroom and represented a viable addition to the existing curriculum. (Author)",

The author feels that many problems were experienced because of a failure to establish a common conceptual understanding of the term &quot;competency.&quot; The author distinguishes between &quot;technical teaching competencies,&quot; which are skill-like competencies essential to professional performance, and &quot;professional teaching competencies,&quot; which are complex  professional behaviors that no two people ever perform the same. The author adds, however, that he and his colleagues place &quot;personal attributes&quot; ahead of teaching competencies.

The major outcomes of the project were (a) a practical, cost-effective behavior modification program that reduces discipline problems, increases student motivation, and accelerates academic achievement; (b) an effective and low-cost teacher training system in the utilization of behavior modification techniques; and (c) a model for exporting the program that is cost effective and that provides the consumer school with the capability to train, support, and monitor the program with minimum outside assistance. Section one of the paper describes the operation of the behavior modification program in 20 schools in  Atlanta, Georgia and includes data on its programmatic and economic effectiveness. The second section describes the procedures used to train the teachers involved in the project. The final section is a discussion of the role of the school principal in the school-wide implementation of behavior modification. (Author/HMD)",

The survey instrument provided for rating of the undergraduate education sequence, pre-student teaching field experiences, student teaching experience, and overall competency development by means of six-point scales and, in the case of some experiences, a six-point frequency scale. In general, respondents felt that foundation courses had little or no value. Methods and elective courses were also criticized for being irrelevant and not applicable to classroom practice. The  majority of respondents suggested an expansion of the field experience program, more actual participation in the schools, and greater involvement with classroom teachers and students. Respondents felt that more time was necessary for the development of competencies required for classroom teaching and that toward this end student teaching should be expanded to two semesters. It is recommended that (a) a concentration in elementary education be established; (b) students be engaged in an introductory education experience as early as possible; (c) the field experience program be broadened and enhanced at all levels; (d) that 5- and 6-year specialist training programs be developed; and (e) training programs be separated into early childhood, elementary, middle, and secondary level.

The basic concept underlying the proposal is that facilities which are functionally related  should be administratively related as well. The concept involves the use of public rights-of-way across private land to connect existing and planned facilities such as parks into a coordinated administrative unit. The concept provides access and increased use without the burden of large fee purchases. The proposal itself consists of (a) an introduction that discusses the setting for the proposed demonstration project and the state and county policy framework; (b) an outline of the demonstration project; (c) a discussion of the administration of the trails system; (d) a survey of the demonstration project area including a general shoreline survey, coastal geology, coastal ponds, botanical resources, observed wildlife, places of historical, archaeological, and legendary interests; and (e)  bibliographies.

        "description":"The purpose of this investigation was to determine the relationship between the perceived health threat of various substances and the non-usage of such substances. It was hypothesized that non-usage behavior is related to the perceived health threat of a substance upon the individual. Specifically, non-usage increases as the perceived threat increases. To test the relationship, a mail questionnaire survey of a random sample of the University of Nebraska student body was conducted. Subjects were asked to estimate the perceived health threat to them of a number of health substances ranging from milk to heroin using a five-point scale for each substance. The mean score for each was calculated and a rank order developed. A rank order correlation was then calculated to assess the  degree of relationship between the perceived health threat and the pattern of non-usage. A significant relationship in a positive direction was found between perceived threat and non-usage. This finding seems to indicate that the greater the perceived threat, the greater the non-usage behavior for a particular substance. The result suggests that drug education programs which focus on efforts toward increasing the perceived health threat of a particular substance might enhance the possibilities of discontinued usage or continuation of non-usage patterns of such substances.

Since there is little research evidence that causally links teacher behavior with pupil behavior, the simultaneous use of both product measurement and process measurement is advised. (Author)",

Extensions of the concepts of difficulty and discriminating power from the dichotomous case to this ordinal category situation allow determination of these parameters. Assuming the trait being measured is distributed normally, stage difficulties or boundaries are deviates corresponding to cumulative proportions of subjects at each stage. Item discriminating powers are determined by the one factor loadings of the inter-item correlation matrix. Maximum-likelihood estimates of a subject's trait level can be determined from the parameters of each situation  presented and that subject's answer pattern of stage scores. Data gathered in interviews to determine the level of moral development according to Lawrence Kohlberg's six-stage theory takes the above form. Results indicate that for different dilemmas, certain stages of reasoning are more easily attained than others, and when particular moral issues are analyzed across situations, an \"entry\" issue for various stages is indicated corresponding to Kohlberg's theory.

Regression equations which were developed to predict achievement scores on the basis of district characteristics accounted for about half of the variance in achievement scores among districts.

        "description":"Although emphatically not against the concept of educational accountability, the National Education Association (NEA) feels that a redirection is needed in the implementation of such a system. Because of error, especially in testing minority and poor children, accountability programs should never use test results as the major source of data but should rely on multiple indexes. When testing is used, the NEA emphasizes the diagnostic capabilities of tests and warns against comparing students, schools or teachers. The NEA believes that teachers should be given the freedom to exercise professional judgment, to set learning goals for individual students, to assess the achievement of these goals and to establish the instructional procedures for attaining the desired learning. To expand  and reinforce these comments, two NEA papers are included with this document: &quot;Criteria for Evaluating State Education Accountability Systems&quot; and &quot;Testimony Presented by the National Education Association to the Panel on Evaluation of the Michigan Assessment Program.&quot; (RC)",

The ratings of the one hundred and six goals by fifty-three California elementary school principals obtained during a field testing were used to provide the standard against which the results of the subset ranking procedures was to be compared since the sampling of each group was largely incidental and no provision was made for equating or randomizing administrators between the two rating groups, differences observed might be influenced by extraneous variables. The  subset ranking procedure (SRK) yields results that are equivalent to those obtained with complete rating or ranking procedures. However, it seems inappropriate at this time to either recommend or reject the use of the SRK or any other subset procedure as a substitute for complete rating/ranking procedures until the potential problem of rater dissatisfaction can be investigated.

To establish the reactions of school-adjusted adolescents to the pictures, three semantic differential factors--constriction, potency, and activity--were selected. Scores for both constriction and potency were expected to be higher for adolescent-adult situations than for adolescents alone, and scores for activity to show an interaction between sex of adolescent pictured and sex of respondent. Respondents were 50 boys and 50 girls 13 to 16 years old from predominantly urban schools in New York and New Jersey. Sixty-eight children were classified as  white; none had salient adjustive difficulties. Adjective intercorrelations were factored and four pictured situations selected to test hypotheses. There were no differences in constriction scores for the two kinds of situations and no interaction effects in activity scores. There were significantly higher potency scores for adult-involving pictures. Further, boys were more active than girls, and adult-involving situations more than adolescents alone. These adolescents see adults as facilitators rather than as sources of constraint. (Author)",

The distributions are the Normal, Uniform, and Double Exponential. It was found that the F-test is robust to violating assumptions of non-normality for sample of size 10, 15, and 20 but the power of H-test is affected by the shape of the population distributions. The power of the H-test increase faster when all samples are drawn from Double Exponential distribution than the power of H-test drawn from all Normal or all Uniform distribution. It is also found that the  power of H-test is greater than the power of the F-test when all samples are drawn from double exponential distribution and the combinations of double exponential and normal distributions. The power of H-test is almost identical to the power of F-test when 2 samples are drawn from the double exponential and one sample is from the uniform distribution and when 3 samples are drawn from 3 different shaped distributions. The power of H-test is less than the power of the F-test when all samples are from normal or from uniform distributions. (Author/BB)",

Task analysis may be related to content analysis in two different ways: (1) it may be used to identify the probably intended outcomes of existing content; and (2) it may be employed to design effective instruction, and thus to determine instructional content. When used for the latter purpose, the distinction is important between content which has a purely mathemagenic function, and content which is itself to be learned. When the intended outcome is an intellectual skill, verbal propositions provide cues for retrieval and other learning processes. In  contrast, when the intended outcome is information, verbal statements must be learned as propositions, so that they can later be recalled and stated by the learner. (Author/RC)",

Chapter V provides a treatment of criterion-referenced and mastery item analysis and revision procedures when items are scored in the classical correct/wrong manner. Chapter VI treats an alternative to the classical procedure for administering and scoring items. This procedure employs the subjective probabilities typically associated with confidence testing in order to obtain pseudo-classical  scores. These scores, which have not been considered elsewhere, appear to be very useful for item analysis purposes in that they have most of the advantages and few of the disadvantages of both classical scores and subjective probabilities. Chapter VII provides an analysis of a set of data collected to illustrate many of the statistics and procedures discussed in Chapter V and VI. One of the appendices provides the manual an extensive test scoring and item analysis program that uses student subjective probabilities as input. (Author)",

This evaluation determines what effects, if any, participation in the program had on the student, and comments on these effects in terms of the intended and expected outcomes of program participation. The data was collected through interviews and questionnaires from 48 cooperative and 21 control students. The findings of the study conclude that: (1) the MCEP enhanced the high school curriculum; (2) the value of the  vocational experience was determined greatly by the nature of the work assignment; (3) the trainees were at a disadvantage by being placed in special classrooms apart from other students; and (4) the trainees need counseling while participating in the program, as well as at the time of study.

Except for unusually fast responses to test sentences beginning with an end term, reaction time was a monotonic decreasing function of remoteness; the more remote the shorter the reaction time. This result contradicts several current models of how meaningful information is stored. First, it contradicts any model which argues that subjects do not store deducible  information. Information pertaining to the deducible remote pairs is stored along with the information that was actually presented. Second, it contradicts any model which describes the form of the stored information in terms of inter-item associations. A model which can account for the result is presented. (Author)",

New York University was to introduce its faculty and students to the public school setting in an attempt to relate theory to the realities of junior high school teaching. At the same time New York City school personnel were to be involved in the processes of positive change within the classroom and between school and community. In addition, community persons from the Bedford-Stuyvesant area, where the school was located, were to be trained to assist in the education of neighborhood children. A central feature of the  Clinic for Learning during the first year of the program was the &quot;cluster&quot; system in which 17 regular seventh grade classes were realigned in six clusters of 85-90 children each. The Clinic for Learning was found lacking by Junior High School 57K officials and, likewise, by Clinic for Learning personnel. It was this joint recognition of &quot;failure&quot; that eventually spurred an evaluation of the Clinic for Learning by the Center for Urban Education. The purpose of such an evaluation was to assess the causes for failure. (Author/JM)",

Cost analysis can be viewed as an application of the economic concept of system analysis. The analysis always moves from a base that represents the existing capability and resources. The problem is to determine the resources needed to acquire some specified capability. System costs are generally identified and grouped in a model as (1) research and development cost, and (2) installing and operating cost. The model under discussion here was developed to evaluate the Community Learning Center program. Cost analysis was essential to determine the expected costs of the Community Learning Center as well as other projects within the center for a  given expected benefit. Cost analysis was also necessary to identify the costs for a potential buyer to use the model. During 1969, CUE operated two Community Learning Centers: one in an impoverished Puerto Rican neighborhood in the South Bronx and the other in a black ghetto in Brooklyn. In each center the following programs were conducted in an experimental basis: Leadership Development Program, Parent Participation Workship, and School-Community Seminars. (Author/JM)",

To serve the special needs of the Indian population, $1,047,500 was allocated for some 19 of these institutions. This figure includes staff salaries for faculty, curriculum development, counseling, recruiting, and financial aids officers. Despite the impressive growth in numbers of Indian students, faculty, support services, curriculum, and budget, though, the total commitment of higher education institutions to the Indian student is not nearly adequate to meet their needs. Topics of discussion include: (1) the Indian student; (2) Budget: what share does the  Indian get? (3) Native American Studies; (4) Areas for further research--dropout rate, success of Indian students in relation to Indian-oriented curriculum, skills needed on California Indian reservations, etc.; and (5) 4 appendixes--arriving at the figures, selected statistics, reasons for dropout, and staff totals.

The dimensions analyzed were theological position, social-political perspectives, patterns of professional involvement, perspectives on ministerial activity, social origins of the minister, and organization features (characteristics of congregations served). Major findings were an association between theological liberalism and liberal-permissive views on a wide range of issues; that theological  persuasions are linked to social origins, modes of professional training and practice, perspectives toward the ministry, and organizational settings; and that denominational affiliation is an important delineator of organization sets.

The program's objectives were, first, to provide bilingual education for pupils who have limited English speaking ability and, second, to give English speakers the opportunity to become bilingual and to broaden their outlook and understanding of other people. The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, in both English and Spanish, was administered to students in grades K-1 in September and again in March. The Metropolitan Readiness Test, Form A, was also given in kindergarten while the Metropolitan  Achievement Test was given in grades 1-5. Also used was the Inter-Americana Spanish reading test, the Prueba de Lectura. Educational achievement for the students improved to some extent throughout the year. Tabular data covered teachers, schools, and pupils; dropouts; results of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, the Metropolitan Achievement Test, and the Pruebra de Lectura and inferred Self-Concept Judgment Scale results.

        "description":"The document is an evaluation of the Bilingual Instructional Project in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd grades of 4 elementary schools in the Harlandale Independent School District, San Antonio, Texas, during the 1968-69 school term. Evaluation of the 1st grade included a mental ability and readiness test--pretest and posttest. At the 2nd grade level, the Science Research Associates Achievement Test in Reading was given as a pretest and the Inter-American Series was given as a posttest. For the 3rd grade, the Science Research Associated Achievement Test in Reading was given as a pretest and posttest. Eight conclusions are given--e.g., there was no discernible difference in language achievement by 2nd and 3rd grade pupils between the bilingual and the control groups as measured by reading  tests in English. The 11 recommendations encourage better organization, better planning, leadership that is more readily available, closer support by the principals, and more materials. A closer evaluator contact with the program is also recommended. (For related documents, see RC 007 266, 267.) (FF)",

The analysis was confined to a 5-year, intragenerational mobility panel from 2 Illinois regions--Putnam County and segments of 3 other adjacent counties in north-central Illinois, and a portion of Iroquois County in central Illinois (the control region). In 1966, the Jones-Laughlin Steel Corporation developed a large steel mill in Putnam County. Then, in 1966, 1967, and 1971, area probability surveys of household heads were conducted. For this study, only those in the 1966 and 1971 surveys will be used. During the 5 year span a marked reshuffling of occupational structure occurred in both regions. In Putnam, 74.5% remained stable,  while 11.5% moved upward and 14% downward. The control region displayed similar results, with 71.4% remaining stable. The findings provided little, if any, support for suggesting that mobility has disruptive consequences. The Durkheimian mobility hypothesis pointing to manifestations of anomia, stress or social isolation was not evident. (KM)",

Data were from an ongoing study of an industrialized rural area. High School students were surveyed to monitor changes in attitudes, plans, and behavior from 1966 to 1971. Major findings were that there was a differential turnover between college and non-college plans, that students with a given level but different histories of aspirations were similar in selected background characteristics such as family status, significant others' support, and income aspirations, and that the two-state, discrete-time Markov model  predicted the changes in educational aspirations for the students sampled.

Previous findings indicated that area of residence was a factor in determining civil rights attitudes. Therefore, it was expected that ministers serving southern rural congregations were more prejudiced than their urban counterparts. In addition, other factors such as age, level of education (seminary-nonseminary training), and religious fundamentalism were assessed as variables. Data were collected by questionnaires employing fixed alternative response items. The sample consisted of 118 white, male ministers attending the Mississippi Methodist Annual Conference in 1969. Scaleogram analysis was used to construct 6-item indexes measuring prejudice and  religious fundamentalism. These and the remaining independent variables (residence, age, and education) were dichotomized. The analysis revealed that the best predictor of prejudice was education, followed by fundamentalism, residence, and age. Suggestions for further research were offered. (Author/KM)",

Twenty village Eskimo students and 20 urban white students from the ninth grade, equally divided by sex, attended 2 college guidance and information sessions. The instructor (a 26-year-old white female) behaved in a warm style in one and in a neutral, impersonal style in the other. Three measures which determined differences in verbal expression and learning in the situations were question-answering, question-asking, and learning. The number of words in the student's reply to 4 questions about a class served as the question-answering  measure; the number of questions the student asked about information given to him on 2 unfamiliar colleges served as the question-asking measure; and the student's verbal responses to 8 questions measuring information acquisition served as the learning measure. Among the findings were: both Eskimo and white students tended to learn significantly more in a nonverbally warm situation, with Eskimo females showing the greatest increase. All groups had about the same scores when the warm treatment was used first. (NQ)",

Skill substructures are seen as a separate conceptualization, and only the item features are considered in this paper in generating candidates. Components of description, comparison, and classification items include: elements, variable names, values, observation or measurement procedures, describers, correlational  rules, and criteria for forming element subsets. Procedures for item generation are: (1) adoption of conventions for describing items in terms of tasks and content, (2) defining tasks, and (3) specification of content domains for tasks.

An editorial opinion argues that science curricula developed in England should not be adopted unchanged in overseas countries (such as Iran), but should be carefully adapted and modified to suit national requirements. The section entitled &quot;Physics Notes&quot; describes two sets of apparatus for measuring moments of inertia and force on a conductor. The section dealing with biology outlines two techniques suitable for use in the classroom for determining the energy content of foods. One technique is recommended for student use, while the other is more suited to teacher demonstration. &quot;Chemistry Notes&quot;  provide suggestions on the apparatus used for the preparation of producer gas, and &quot;Trade News&quot; give information on equipment available from supply houses together with a list of the names and addresses of the major supply companies.

Since ultimate aims of cross-cultural learning tend to be described in abstract terms, the fundamental issue had to do with specifying and clarifying these aims: terminal and enroute training objectives, assesment of outcomes, and design and implementation of learning strategies. In addition, the study investigated the relative importance of and interrelation among the domains of affect (feelings), behavior (activity), and cognition (knowledge) as they relate to adaptation. Four project tasks are identified and graphically described in each of four chapters which (1) outline a  general characterization of the adapted Peach Corps volunteer, (2) recommend a new set of cross-cultural training objectives, (3) provide suggested guidelines or improvements for cross-cultural training/learning, and (4) present the cross-cultural learning measurement system, including instruments, scoring keys, and instructions.

It encourages student awareness, role playing, and problem-solving by having students propose and decide on alternate ways of structuring a new city, with their final plan compared to that of the actual city of Phoenix, Arizona. The nine-lesson approach outlines for each lesson its aim, procedure, materials needed, time allotment, supplementary materials, and future assignments. Lessons concentrate on a study of the urban environment  through &quot;Conflict,&quot; a simulation game, site features, city design, the concept of change, population, land use, and the development of a model city. Numerous enrichment activities are suggested and elaborated upon, greatly enhancing the unit and promoting its usefulness in an interdisciplinary instructional program.

        "description":"The study was undertaken to assess the needs of Alabama's industry for chemical technicians and to determine the kinds and levels of skills required by major employers. Of the 75 organizations responding to the questionnaire with usable data, 62 were private industries, 6 were testing laboratories, and 7 were federal agencies. Generally, the study indicated that the tremendous progress made by science has moved the professional chemist further into research, thus providing excellent employment opportunities for technical institute (two-year) or junior college graduates with training in chemical technology. These opportunities exist primarily in the petroleum, air pollution, water treatment, food, drug, chemical, glass, soap, rubber, paint, textile, power, steel, aluminum, and  plastic industries. Respondents estimated that the need for chemical technicians in Alabama will almost double by 1976. The study presents an overview of the State's manpower needs for chemical technicians, makes future projections, delineates the skill/knowledge requirements desired by major employers, and describes current recommendations concerning the structure and content of an appropriate curriculum.

The report is primarily concerned with the degree to which operational and management process objectives are being achieved in each of four components: instruction, staff development, materials development, and community involvement. Comments are directed toward the already completed product objectives as they relate to experimental groups at both the fifth- and seventh-grade levels. A variety of methods were employed in the analysis procedure: student pre- and posttest scores; on-site visits; individual discussions; records of project activities; questionnaires; rating scales; and reviews of  reports submitted by teachers and staff. Summary statements indicate that the project has been extremely successful in utilizing its expertise, staff, and facilities; stated objectives have been met at levels consistently above what was expected; the environmental knowledge of participating students has improved significantly; and students have changed their attitudes towards the environment in a more positive direction. However, community development was not proceeding as planned, primarily in relation to the creation, continuation, and integration of local and central advisory committees. (BL)",

Campus and program development discusses the outdoor site, classroom preparations, and project ideas built around the history of conservation, plant life, animal life, nonliving elements of the environment, light, water, weather, temperature, soil, minerals, and fire. Trails, signs, amphitheaters,  ponds, weather stations, and models that can be built or developed at the outdoor learning facility are enumerated under teaching aids. The final section suggests additional projects which can be undertaken with little preparation necessary--leaf identification, snow study, animal food habits, habitats, fireplace construction, cooking, compass skills, insects, clouds, measurement, growing plants, seeds, birds, trees, soil study, moisture and rain gauges, pond life, food manufacturing, decomposition, climbing plants, and woodlands.

This paper is concerned with three areas of discussion: (1) the number of teachers studying Open University courses; (2) the courses available or planned in science and technology; and (3) the integrative features of Open University science and technology courses. The survival rate of teachers appears to be marginally higher than that of other occupational groups, with teachers comprising 42 percent of the continuing students in 1972. A chart outlines the courses available in science and technology together with the credit awarded for each course. Many of these courses are multidisciplinary in content,  integrative in approach, and relate the subject to the social context. The author concludes that science and technology courses of the type being taught in the Open University could make a significant contribution to the education of teachers of integrated science.

The introductory remarks deal with some of the consequences of introducing package-deal science courses in underveloped countries and, in particular, discuss the introduction of Nuffield Combined Science in Iran. The section entitled &quot;Biology Notes&quot; provides a detailed examination of the criteria to be considered in selecting suitable microscopes for student and teacher use at all levels of secondary education. In the section dealing with chemistry, teachers are cautioned about the hazards of storing the explosive mixture of copper and sulfur powder. Tips are provided on the construction of simple  science apparatus in the workshop, and brief notes inform teachers of equipment available from supply houses. (JR)",

        "author":["Paulson, James A."],
        "description":"Three different strategies of choosing items for presentation in a simple list learning situation are compared. The instructional task was to teach the correct response to a number of stimulus items, using a paired-associate teaching procedure. Only one item could be presented on a given trial and the total number of trials was limited. The optimization problem considered was to find the best strategy for deciding which item to present a subject on a given trial, based on his performance on previous trials. The optimization criterion was the number of items retained on a posttest. Three progressively more sophisticated models of the learning process, the linear model, the one-element model, and a forgetting model, suggested different candidates for the optimal procedure. This  paper is devoted to the derivation of theoretical expressions for operating characteristics of interest for each of the three strategies. These expressions, based on the most adequate model (the forgetting model), then permit direct numerical comparisons of the predicted performance of the three strategies for specified values of the model parameter. If the material to be learned was relatively easy, then the theoretical differences between the strategies were relatively insignificant. If the material to be learned was difficult, then the theoretical differences between the strategies were quite significant. The differences depended on the parameter values of the forgetting model in a systematic way. (Author/DT)",

This report is a completely revised edition of a previously published preliminary volume (ED 067 220). The results cover the performance of Blacks, of respondents with differing levels of parental education, and from different types of communities. Blacks performed between 11.8 and 15.8 percent below the national average at the four age levels tested: 9, 13, 17 and young adults (26-35). When results were adjusted for disproportionate type of community, parental education, sex, and regional representation, the median results for Blacks  were still below national results, but by amounts substantially less than those which do not take the balancing factors into account. The residual disadvantages were between -7.7 and -11.0 percent for the four age groups. Blacks performed best on those science exercises most dependent upon daily experience and common knowledge, and poorest on those which involve a detached research attitude toward the objects and phonomena of science.

        "description":"A quasi-systematic strategy of devising rule sets for problem solving is applied to ruler and compass geometrical constructions. &quot;Lower order&quot; rules consisting of basic skills and &quot;higher order&quot; rules which govern the selection and combination of lower order rules are identified by an analysis of problem types; three types of construction problems are used to generate three specific rule sets. A second level of &quot;higher order&quot; rules, determining how various aspects of the individual rule sets can be combined, results in generalized rule set which describes solutions to a wide-range of instruction problems. This model seems intuitively to reflect the kinds of relevant knowledge that might be applied by successful problem-solvers. The results are suggestive of how the construction  of at least certain artificial intelligence systems might be systematized. The results also identify the knowledge underlying reasonably complex kinds of problem solving which could be used as a basis for explicit instruction. (JP)",

Also, the three types of activities should incorporate experiences which are direct, simulated, audio-visual, visual, audio, and abstract. Based on these directives, activities are written for two levels. Section One for grades 9-12 covers environmental activities in the areas of art, home economics, language arts and reading, math, science, and social studies. Each unit denotes its title, grade level, content area, concepts, performance objectives, activities, discussion topics and questions, resources (or materials needed), and evaluation procedures, followed by  a list of resource or reference materials and a rating scale or checklist. Section Two for grades K-8 and Section Three for grades 5-8 utilize a similar format. In addition to the six previous subject areas, a few units also incorate activities related to music, health, and physical education. Approximately 30 units are suggested in each section.

In contrast to the current model of the American teacher as boss, lecturer, intrusive conditioner, and reinforcer, under existential education thought, the teacher would be the receptive, Taoist helper in the teacher-pupil relationship, trying to provide harmony to  the conflict \"the Self\" encounters in his human existential predicament. As long as the three orientations of logical positivism, operationalism and pragmatism continue to influence educational thought, then education has no choice but to look toward the behavioral sciences. Now, according to existentialist thought, the behavioral sciences do have an opportunity to unify subjective with objective knowledge and thus assist education in developing more profound understanding of the relation of the individual to the group.

Two questions central to discussing any educational system which purports to be a conscious force for cultural change are posed: Can a society conscious of its own cultural beliefs exist? Can this societty deliberately change to a new cultural orientation? The assumption is made that these questions are answered positively and the author explores the difficulties that such a hypothetical society would have in using its formal educational system as a vehicle for cultural change. The impact of technology and of formal education on cultural change is developed. Alternative combinations of these conscious  educational impacts are described. As ideal types, these serve to illustrate the major properties a future educational system serving as an active force for cultural change might exhibit. (Author/SHM)",

A review of reported curriculum research focuses on these topics: teacher education institutions and curriculum development; teacher participation in national curriculum programs; teachers and decision-making in curriculum development; barriers to curriculum development by teachers; benefits of teacher participation in curriculum development; and levels of teacher participation in curriculum projects. A profile of participants in the Project Canada West curriculum study details personal and professional characteristics of the teacher-developers. Activities of the participants, following ten stated principles of  curriculum development, are described. Data from an evaluation questionnaire completed by the teachers is presented and summarized in tabular form. Studies on the Project Canada West method of curriculum development show it to be an effective way to conduct curriculum development at the local and regional levels. (SHM)",

        "description":"The contraditions within the systems of school support and school policy-making make it difficult to find a manner of governance of the social studies program which is protected from extraneous influence and yet avoids creating a buffer between the schools and the democratic forces to which they are responsive. State and federal governments previously have been reluctant to assume control of the schools, leaving this power to educators in local school districts. Increasing state financing and concomitant growth of state authority at the expense of local school administrators are likely to prove significant in the particular curriculum area of political education. The type of political education favored by state authorities is that which produces the subject citizen, as opposed to  the participant citizen, and maintains the status quo. The structure of school control needs to be based on models which remove political education from direct state control and which broaden participation in its governance. Models for the governance of political education include: the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education, the British Broadcasting Corporation, and &quot;parochiad&quot; bills.

        "description":"The primary purpose of the Georgia Anthropology Curriculum Project is to present the organizing concepts of anthropology in curricula suitable for use in elementary and intermediate grades. The philosophic premise of the Project is that a conceptually structured curricula is the most effective means of helping students to acquire a base of knowledge for categorization and organization of phenomena. Project value assumptions deal with the nature of the learner, the organization of the material, the methodology of instruction and the nature of the content. The role of ethnic studies as part of anthropology is pointed out, as is the preoccupation with ethnic studies in general in the United States. The major issue in ethnic studies is felt to be whether it should be used to  politicize a particular group in the school population. A project model program should not focus on self identity, be preoccupied with ethnic groups in one country or culture, or have a retrospective emphasis. A suggested model which permits a reconciliation of core values of the national culture with respect for ethnic diversity is the cross-cultural curricula development approach. (Author/KSM)",

This paper sets forth several cases which illustrate that people can be an attractive form of investment. No attempt is made to calculate the dollar value of such intangibles as increases in IQ, self-image, and family and individual stability. Consideration focuses on the size of an investment, the amount of earnings and savings which offset the investment, and rate at which that occurs. Exemplary cases include descriptions of an occupational training program for mentally retarded educables and trainables, vocational  training for handicapped youths, welfare recipients manpower training, a program for confined juvenile delinquents, and treatment for convicted felons. The conclusion is reached that man is the crucial environment and investment priority. (Author/SHM)",

        "description":"An evaluation of the MACOS social studies curriculum program was conducted during 1969-70 in six elementary schools. Three schools were randomly chosen to participate in the MACOS program while three others served as a comparison group. Teachers of the former schools received training in the appropriate procedures for utilizing the relevant methods and materials to implement that program while teachers in the latter comparison group continued with their regular social studies program. Nineteen comparisons were made after the MACOS program had been conducted for one school year to determine how well students in the MACOS program learned material specific to that program; how well they learned those elements which are common to both the MACOS and the regular program; and how the  attitudes of students and teachers were affected by participation in the MACOS program. The results indicate that the material specific to the MACOS program and the common elements of both programs learned better by those in the MACOS program. In the area of attitudes, the students in the MACOS program had a more positive view of themselves as social studies students' and teachers perceived these students as more interested in social studies. Of the 19 comparisons, seven of the differences were statistically significant, and all seven of these comparisons favored the MACOS group. (Author/SJM)",

These instances typically involve the behaviors of children and adults as they appear in the classroom or in other community settings in which teachers might be expected to interpret behavior for purposes of education. Description is given of this protocol materials effort which is essentially a training program for project directors. The materials being produced, primarily films, cover the  following subject matter areas: educational psychology, reading, literature, language acquisition, Black English, social psychology, teaching analysis, and social studies. Appendices list the eleven pilot projects which were funded initially and described a progressive evaluation system, developed by Richard L. Turner, which currently is used in training project directors as they develop protocol materials. (Author/SHM)",

The first of two ways of conveying more meaning to the student through multimedia techniques involves an integrative experience, such as sound/slide or film presentations accompanying a lecture. The second way involves a freestanding sequence, an individual unit which makes a complete statement about some area of concern. At Simon Fraser, the students are encouraged to discover multimedia alternatives to the written essay through non-credit media workshops. The workshops cover the  areas of graphic and sound arts, photography and videotape.

        "author":["Hurst, Michael E. Eliot"],
        "description":"The definition of geography as the study of man and the realities of his socio-economic milieu is the thesis on which this course in urban geography is based. The functions of the university are observed to be: 1) to ensure economic and cultural continuance; and 2) to advance knowledge and ways of knowing. The first of these functions appears to place the university in a position which is conservative or supportive of the status quo, while the second tends to induce criticism that is merely academic and removed from real material problems. This alternative approach is based on a definition of urban geography emphasizing society as a totality. After mentioning a suitable tenor and available resources, the course is outlined in seven sections: methods and teaching techniques, the  city in history, the city as an economic place, the city as a cultural place, the city as a political place, suggested areas for case studies, and the city of the future. The purpose of the course outline is to provide background, a philosophic and analytic framework, upon which to organize a course on the city. Each section describes the coverage of lecture and seminar topics, and suggests pertinent films. (Author/KSM)",

It is a competitive game played on a hypothetical mid-latitude diversified farm in a capitalistic system. The player is faced with a series of decisions which will determine his success or failure, such as land acquisition, crop selection, optional investment, soil bank, crop insurance, and commodity features. Rules and examples of these decisions are described. The decision-making process is discussed, along with techniques for adjusting the game to students of varying levels of sophistication. Tables indicate hypothetical expenses, yield per acre, prices, yield and price variations, and disasters. A financial sheet is  provided to simplify organization and computation. A teaching package accompanies the game. (Author/KSM)",

A basic skills laboratory, diagnostic procedures, individualized reading and math programs, minicourses, work experience, and field experience were part of the student-centered approach. Formal and informal measures were used to evaluate objectives: standardized tests measured reading and math; surveys marked attitudinal and behavior change. Test findings indicated gains in both reading and math. A positive change was observed in attitude and behavior. This alternative to secondary education was considered  successful; continuation with minor changes was suggested.

Serving as the vehicle to bring about greater community involvement and participation, the school provides a program of education for people of all ages by utilizing the facilities and programs of the public school and the community. The majority of the 1800 students per week live in south Phoenix, and reflect the ethnic and racial balance of the community. Four programs meet the needs of people by offering adult education and G. E. D. preparation and testing programs, college and university extension courses, informal general interest activities, and community forums. A full time director and secretary and 90 part-time personnel consisting of certified  instructors, agency people, community residents, and supplementary personnel comprise the school staff. The overall operation of the school is formally evaluated once a year focusing on how well the goals and objectives are carried out, and informally evaluated throughout the year. Two significant changes since the project first began center on the use of the school facilities and increase in the number of people who are attending activities at the school. (SJM)",

A music and dance summer camp and a music and dance dissemination workshop were also developed. The evaluation reports indicate statistically the number of children who have participated, a measure of behavior changes that have occurred, and an evaluation of curriculum developed. Measurement of progress in the primary music classes was evaluated by a 23 item checklist. Instruments were developed to  measure student performance in the Orff program, the secondary level guitar and ukelele program, and the elementary dance program. Tables show that all classes demonstrated most of the attempted objectives. Student attitude was measured by a Face Attitude Scale and responses showed a highly favorable attitude. Questionnaires on the camp and curriculum showed a positive parental response. (KSM)",

Five hundred public schools of the state were surveyed in order to assess the status of social studies offerings. Although the teacher education graduate is better prepared today than in past years, many teacher graduates still do not receive adequate preparation. The good ideas that already exist need to be implemented rather than revamping the program. Several changes can produce quality social studies education. For example, 1) advanced courses can concentrate on the varied needs of students in the various social science disciplines, rather than focusing on the field of  history as they now do; 2) recent findings of educational research involving techniques and curriculum can be applied in professional education classes; and 3) administrators can review teacher background in order to assign them to areas where they are qualified to teach. The overall status of social studies in the state is perceived as being slightly below the national average. Following the paper are data on general core of offerings, status of the social studies in Oklahoma, hours required for certificate, subjects offered in the junior and senior high school during 1970-71, number and enrollments in public and non-public schools, and other information.

Emphasis in each approach is placed upon training students to develop a different view--to see and do things that will have impact upon the student's life in the future. Implications of this educational approach for the special student are discussed. A program of advanced placement which meets the individual  needs of students is suggested. The factors related to the author's conception of advanced placement are: 1) opportunity for active exploration by the student into the social world and the world of social ideas; 2) methods of control and evaluation; 3) program flexibility to meet individual needs; 4) provision for opportunities for community-school cooperation and communication; and 5) emphasis on the mode of conduct of the student rather than the concept of reaching a special goal.

In order to carry out the objectives: 1) seminars were held to provide teachers with instruction and training in the background knowledge and techniques considered helpful for conducting student field trips to historical sites and museums; 2) materials were developed which included numerous booklets dealing with  historical sites, instructional film-slide programs designed for teacher inservice education and instruction for students; programs for teacher conducted field trip orientation; and booklets describing 40 historically important resources; 3) the project director engaged in a series of presentations before numerous groups in an effort to disseminate information about the project; and, 4) as of the second year 1500 pupils were taken to resources on 43 field trips.

Findings indicated that although there was no measureable change in pupil attitudes toward social studies  in the living classrooms, pupil participation in classroom discussions were significantly higher than in control classes. Other significant findings were that pupil marks in social studies were significantly higher than the previous year and, further, that in a standardized city wide test the students in the living classroom achieved scores similar to 8th grade classes in non-Title schools -- an indication that the project did improve pupil achievement.

The author presents a repertoire of creative and peaceful conflict resolution approaches in a copyrighted appendix. Techniques are described and contrasts are drawn with current social studies curricula. Some of the effects of teaching part of the repertoire to some high school students is reported. The proposed creative, peaceful approaches to international conflict are organized into six categories based on what dimension of a conflict is mainly involved: the parties involved, the bases of conflict, the location, the timing, the nature of the involvement, and the causes. It is suggested that the value of including conflict resolution in social studies curricula is that creative,  peaceful approaches can provide options that can reduce the necessity for a persisting stalemate, can reduce the need for tension to continuously escalate while negotiation continues, and can reduce the likelihood of exhausting all the promising nonviolent strategies for dealing with a particular crisis.

The evolution of schools formed by groups outside the public system and established under the jurisdiction of the Toronto Board of Education is traced. Development is described in terms of the financial, legal and administrative arrangements made by the schools and the Board. Legal consideration of governance of these alternative programs, budget considerations, questions concerning teachers and pupils, and problems of building accomodations are discussed and an informal evaluation of the success of these programs is made. A bibliography includes references and  suggestions for further reading on alternative schools. (SHM)",

The major objective of the guide is to establish for teachers acceptable content and materials which focus generally on human development but more specifically on topics of physiological growth and drug education. Student goals stress learning not only the facts about the body, but also the development of health attitudes toward normal changes. In regard to drug education, students learn that present behavior influences future health. The guide is arranged into two major sections by elementary and secondary grade level. Each section includes: 1) guidelines for program development; 2) behavioral  objectives; 3) teaching suggestions; 4) activities; and 5) suggested resource materials.

Representative samples of the constituents concerned with the program participated in audio and video taped interviews and answered questionnaires. Characteristics of the current program as perceived by teachers, students, and parent reflect the range of feelings about the program. Perceptions expressed dealt with student reaction to the separation of the sexes in classes, repetition of some drug information, teachers' avoidance of topics concerning value questions and controversial issues, the need to involve community resource people in the program, and the  students' need for help in personal problems. Teachers identified the need to synchronize and coordinate the program within the grade level and from one grade level to another. They also expressed a need for an in-service training program for course preparation which would increase length and content. Impressions of the evaluation team show that the program was implemented with minimal difficulty; that students viewed the courses as similar to other courses and have accepted the program without difficulty; and that although parents had the opportunity to learn more about the program few availed themselves of the opportunity; however, parents in general favored the course. For a description of the program see SO 006 168. (SJM)",

Simplifying the complexities of multilateral trade to a few basic decisions and acts, the cognitive objectives are to develop in the student: 1) an understanding of regional economic specialization based on factor endowment; 2) commodity and capital flows in singular global economic systems; 3) investment decision-making and associated risk; 4) the costs of internal and external distortion of free trade; 5) the interdependence of nations engaged in trade; and 6) the comparative disadvantage of some Third World countries in the global trading system. The game is tailored to 36 students, divided into teams  representing nine different countries. Appendices contain a summary of the countries, their economic background, an international trade export-import balance sheet and asking prices for each country. The game is divided into two rounds. Instructions for round two and demand cards for each country are provided in appendices. A final evaluation exrcise summarizes each country's trading strategies and results. (Author/KSM)",

Questionnaires administered during the winter of 1970 (376 mailed; 147 of those returned sufficiently complete for use in the survey) generated the following personal information: a majority of high school and junior college instructors are under 40, married, white, and protestant. An analysis of professional background and qualifications indicates that the majority of both levels attended universities in the South and have a weak background in sociology. However, junior college instructors are more likely than high school teachers to hold a graduate degree; to have a major or minor in sociology; to maintain contacts with  professional sociology organizations and journals; and to have previous teaching experience at lower levels. Special problems in teaching sociology concern textbooks and teaching materials, student attitudes, inadequate background of teacher, scheduling, and conflict with administration, faculty, or community. There was agreement among respondents that sociology teachers should possess special qualifications, and participate in community affairs. (Author/OPH)",

The first article discusses the need to study process in perceiving order within the world's spatial complexities.  The second underscores area differentiation as a means of understanding differences and linkages among peoples. The third lends insight into geography's unique use of the map as a method of analysis and expression. The fourth presents the case for a unified view of the elements of physical geography.

The disciplines are considered resources for providing the key concepts, insights and methods of inquiry enabling students to gain a better understanding of present and past societies and cultures. This approach to curriculum development is suggestive rather than prescriptive. A brief list of affective concepts and a list of social studies processes and skills precede the main part of the framework. Emphasis is upon listing major cognitive concepts from the seven  social science disciplines. The concepts are followed by a list of generalizations. Examples are then provided to illustrate the development of single concepts into performance objectives and suggested strategies.

        "description":"This Scrapbook is a description of how eight 12th grade students, with help from the professional staff of the Social Science Education Consortium, planned and put on a community environmental fair in Boulder, Colorado. The Boulder Experiments Fair grew out of an environmental education project conducted by SSEC and funded by the Office of Education. The name of the entire project was the Student-Assisted Development of Materials for Environmental Social Studies (SADMESS). Divided into two groups, SADMESS worked on two major projects during their 16 months at the Consortium--a book, \"Sunshine Unfolding\" (SO 006 207), and the Boulder Experiments Fair. This book describes the fair from the very early brainstorming sessions to the final post-fair feedback. Some of the chapters are:  Getting Organized; Getting the People; Getting Permission; Getting the Work Done; Getting it all Together; and Getting Feedback. The final report of the SADMESS project is described in SO 006 208. (OPH)",

The purpose is to examine the possibility that philosophy might in fact provide a foundation for educational practice; that philosophy would provide practical knowledge concerning what ought to be done so students and teachers could deal intelligently with social reality in an effort to bring about change without the use of force. After some initial definitions of politics and ethnics, the theme of this essay is developed in four parts. An analysis of ethical theory believed relevant to the current crisis in education is followed by an analysis of political theorizing thought to be relevant to the educational crisis. Consideration of the relationship, if any, between  ethics and politics is described, as is the consideration of the implications of the theoretical discussion for educational practices. It is argued that practices allowing teachers to help students deal with society in an effort to bring about needed social change and action would include values clarification techniques, the methods of the social and physical sciences, and the dialectical method.

The participants felt strongly that a survey of what actually existed in the field was necessary. The Center undertook this task. Letters were mailed to 1500 selected teachers publishers, colleges and universities, curriculum projects and voluntary organizations. Five hundred replies were received, most requesting to be kept informed of progress made in the undertaking. This annotated bibliography represents only a first step in the curriculum collection. The teaching materials are not new, but those deemed the most  visible and available to teachers particularly interested in teaching about war, peace, conflict, or change. Content, objectives, strategies, method and usability at level were considerations for surveying teaching materials. Two of the thirteen projects annotated in this guide are the Amherst Project and the Harvard Social Studies Project. A list of organizations concerned with these subjects is included, as well as a list of the consultative group. (Author/OPH)",

This means each student teacher is gradually inducted into the duties of the professional teacher through a series of continuous and meaningful experiences that vary according to the specific needs and talents of the individual. Student teachers live in the communities in which they are student  teaching, devoting full time to their assignments for a minimum of one quarter. Supervising teachers are chosen on the basis of their past teaching performance, human relations skills, and demonstrated interest in teacher education.

Ss included seventh graders who classified themselves as never-smokers on an initial survey and who participated in all three surveys over a 2-year period. The initial survey consisted of a 44-item attitude-belief form similar to the Likert form. Ss later classified themselves according to their subsequent smoking behavior as either smoker, ex-smoker or never-smoker. An analysis of variance technique was used to determine whether attitude-belief differences existed among the three groupings. Results indicated that female never-smokers who remained never-smokers had more favorable attitudes toward nonsmoking than those who  became smokers or ex-smokers. Significant differences for male data were found on the pleasure, influence, and health disease factors. These results suggest that attitudes and beliefs of initial never-smokers may serve as indicators of future behavior. It appears, also, that items of an affective rather than a cognitive domain are more useful indicators. (Author/JB)",

        "description":"This study analyzed wrist, elbow, and hip actions of golfers who were accurately driving a golf ball a maximum distance. Electrogoniometry and cinematography were used to measure wrist, forearm, elbow, and hip actions during the downswing of 10 low-handicap golfers who were attempting to drive a minimum of 225 yards within a 50-yard corridor. Elgons were used to measure movements of the elbow (flexion-extension), forearm (pronation-supination), and wrist (Adduction-abduction, flexion-extension) at selected angles of the arm relative to a vertical line passing through the shoulder. Lateral and horizontal hip movements were recorded with a specially constructed analyzer. Motion pictures (64 frames/second) were taken in order to measure shoulder joint positions. Electrogoniograms  were analyzed at selected positions: top of backswing; at the position in the downswing where the left arm was horizontal, 45 degrees from vertical, 22.5 degrees from vertical, and vertical; and at the position in the downswing when the ball was contacted. It was concluded that there was no common pattern of action among the low-handicap golfers, but that there were certain common characteristics relative to the timing and sequence of specific actions.

        "description":"The relative rates of strength recovery subsequent to bouts of rhythmic or sustained isometric exercise were investigated. The 72 undergraduates who served as subjects were tested seven times within the framework of a repeated measures design. Each testing session involved two bouts of either rhythmic or sustained isometric exercise separated by a rest interval of 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, or 320 seconds. Strength recovery was evaluated by comparing the level of strength expressed at the conclusion of the initial fatigue bouts, final strength, and the initial strength measure of the second exercise bouts. Analysis of variance and related statistics indicated that a) significant strength decrements of similar magnitude were produced by both types of activity; b) the group of  subjects who initially performed rhythmic exercise consistently stronger than those performing sustained exercise; c) strength at the end of the first exercise bout was significantly lower than final recovery strength; and d) initial strength and final recovery strength failed to differ significantly. Although not in complete accord with previously published results, these results show that the patterns of strength recovery subsequent to rhythmic and sustained isometric exercise were similar.

The subjects were 63 male college students enrolled in beginning golf who had played no more than three rounds of golf during their life and had received no previous golf instruction. Before instruction began, each group was given written copies of the general rules of golf and received one and one-half hours of group discussion regarding rules, etiquette, and general playing procedures. Group one (S=37) was taught the basic fundamentals of golf by the traditional method of starting with the eight or nine iron; this group practiced with eight or nine irons for the duration of the semester. Group two (S=26) was taught the basic fundamentals of golf by beginning with the number three wood and practicing with it  for the duration of the semester. It was found, through analysis of variance, that the mean nine hole and mean eighteen hole scores for the two groups were not statistically different prior to or following the instructional period. Comparison using the t-test revealed significant score improvement, indicating that either method could be used as the primary teaching tool in beginning golf classes at the college level.

Fifty-two university students practiced two novel skills (ball toss and fli-back paddle ball) 5 days per week for 2 weeks. Prior to beginning practice, each subject was measured on 26 basic motor ability items. Factor analysis was employed to isolate basic factors underlying each practice sequence and the gross motor performance traits. Ten stable factors were isolated, including two that described practice for the novel skills and eight that involved gross motor performance. Comparisons of the factor loadings among practice stages for each novel skill across the eight motor performance factors suggested the  following conclusions: a) no relationship existed between gross motor factors and performance on the fli-back paddle ball skill; b) gross motor factors were related to performance on the ball toss skill during early, but not late, stages of practice; c) different gross motor factors related to performance on the ball toss skill as practice continued; and d) performance on the ball toss skill should be assessed only after several practice periods to prevent score comparisons.

In addition, the project included an analysis of demonstrations as a technique for dissemination: a follow-up study investigated decision-making behavior and the utility of a visit to a center. It was concluded that the demonstration sites were successful in making  contacts with educators and stimulating interest in Minicourses. Other conclusions of the project included the following: a) interpersonal communication is the preferred channel for information on innovations; b) decision-making process varies greatly among schools--few generalizations are possible; c) the skills of those conducting demonstrations and their knowledge of schools in the area were critical to success; and d) the short-range success of an educational innovation may be highly related to its congruence with customary school budgets.

An intercorrelational matrix was constructed for the factor analysis of the data using the principal axes method. Seven factors having eigenvalues above 1.000 and accounting for 65.17% of the variance were isolated. The first of two test batteries developed included the test items that loaded highest on each factor and were as follows: Clarke's strength composite; McCloy's endurance ratio; Wells' sit and reach; Bass' balance on a stick,  lengthwise; wrist flexion and extension flexibility; arm flexion on the back flexibility; and modified push-ups. The second battery, developed for more administrative feasibility, included items that loaded high on each factor and eliminated composite scores and ratios. The items in test battery II were grip strength; 300 yard run; Wells' sit and reach; Bass' balance on a stick, lengthwise; wrist flexion and extension flexibility; Arm Flexion on the back flexibility; and modified push-ups.

Shortly following the exercise, however, most subjects report that they could have worked longer--indicating a memory loss or escape from pain previously encountered. This study was an attempt to examine the physiological parameters at the time of these subjective feelings of fatigue to learn if motivation to exercise would change with changing physiological measurements. An experienced athlete in good health but untrained for competition was asked to exercise in a series of tests. Results indicate that psychological motivation is influenced by physiological parameters that fall within rather narrow ranges; the question is, Which comes first? Heart rate,  ventilations, oxygen uptake, and body termperature levels are controlled by factors other than a desire to end the exercise. Physical training probably takes long periods of time because of the time needed for slow biological adaptation to take place. Motivation relates to the capability of the body, acting as a feedback system, to inform the higher centers of break point levels. The desire to be a good athlete must be coupled with the biological capability to adapt to exercise. (Authors/JA)",

A questionnaire was administered to 411 male and female participants in a voluntary sports program at the University of New Mexico in the spring of 1972. The data were treated by means of cannonical correlation, a multivariate procedure which handles a large array of variables in sets rather than individually. It was concluded that preference for specific sports is contingent upon a number of background and  environmental factors being present and possibly interacting. Furthermore, this study revealed that by showing how a number of variables interrelate in a manner which permits the linking of these results at a higher theoretical level, a framework can be generated which may aid the systematic analysis of this phenomenon at both practical and theoretical levels.

Classes were randomly selected from six strata; 226 students ultimately completed the questionnaires, which were designed and administered by the investigator. On the basis of specific findings of the investigation, two general conclusions appear to be warranted. First, students who elect physical education at the university have extensive background  in both instructional and organized extracurricular programs of physical activity--a finding supportive of the hypothesis that structure begets structure. Secondly, the homogeneity of responses to questions regarding the subject's identification with visible groups of students and their respective participation in social and campus activities constitutes a basis for the hypothesis that students who elect physical education at the college level might constitute a distinct subculture of the total student population.

A 6-minute submaximal exercise test was administered to all subjects using a Monarch bicycle ergometer; the fasting body weight and eight  skinfold fat measures were obtained from all the subjects, using Lange Skinfold Fat Caliper. Results indicate that 30 minutes of jogging produced a significant reduction in resting, exercise, and recovery pulse rates. A significant reduction occurred in skinfold fat measures, and body weight. (Author/JB)",

        "description":"This study investigated the effect of a competitive football season on the personality dimensions of high school varsity football team players (N=50) Personality data were collected using the Cattell 16 P.F. Questionnaire. Each player was ranked according to general football ability on the basis of a coach's rating. The t-test was used to compare a) the initial and final sten scores of the total group, b) the high- and low-ability groups (N=12 each) initially and finally, and c) the initial and final sten scores of the high and low groups. It found that a) when the total group was compared initially and finally, no significant differences were observed; b) at pre-season testing the high- and low-ability groups differed significantly on factors relating to maturity and  trustfulness; c) at post-season testing the high and low groups differed significantly between initial and final testing on the same factor suggesting the observed personality modification was restricted to the high group; and e) no significant differences existed between the pre- and post-scores of the low-ability group on any of the 16 personality factors. It was concluded that the personality of high-ability varsity football players may undergo subtle modifications during a competitive football season while the low-ability players appear unaffected in terms of personality modifications.

Research and comments, pro and con, regarding different methods of grading are reviewed. The two major methods discussed are letter grades (they provide feedback and are of value in the selection of students for advanced education, but can promote cheating and unimaginative student behavior and can mix heterogeneous learning factors that have different weightings) and pass/fail grades (they make students more relaxed and provide a better learning atmosphere, but do not distinguish among students of different abilities and are used by some teachers to avoid evaluation altogether). Also  considered are pass/no record (or credit/no credit) grades, written evaluations, self-evaluations, the contract system, and the mastery approach or performance curriculum. This paper recommends a pass/fail grading system or some variation of it, supplemented by other evaluation procedures. (Related documents are SP 006 875, 006 876, and 006 877.) (JA)",

The program is structured, interdisciplinary, and oriented towards social reality and the future. The sequence falls in the junior and senior years. Each semester contains a substantive and a methodological phase. In the substantive phase, lectures present the fundamental ideas and structure of each discipline. The  methodological phase deals with the relationship of the social sciences to the classroom curriculum and consists of two parts: the curriculum materials workshop, which bridges the gap between lectures and laboratory, and the curriculum laboratory, where students work in committees with case studies. The committees, based on the orientations of the sequence, are the social reality, social problems, environment, and systems committees.

        "description":"This presentation is rooted in several years of multidimensional research into the behavior of teacher and pupils; that is, more than a single technique is used simultaneously, each assessing a different dimension of the interaction. One promising outcome of findings is the possibility of measuring pupil growth by means of observational systems. Not only does this technique reduce the amount of reliance placed on paper-pencil instruments, but is far more descriptive since it assesses pupil behavior (growth) during the learning process, over a longer duration of time, and at several subsequent intervals rather than during a single assessment. Furthermore, the notion of systematic observation tends to open up the parameters of growth measurement. Pupils can be observed/assessed as  they behave and interact in a natural, relatively threat-free situation. Finally, techniques of this sort complement the spirit of self-evaluation and self-improvement as they relate to teacher competence and accountability, since the teacher is given \"handles\" for controlling his behavior.

It has a strong human relations thrust--the Personal and Interpersonal Development component--which enables participants to improve their own personal and interpersonal skills and learn to work with others in small- and large-group situations in a variety of settings. The PEP field centers are the bases for the professional coursework and accompanying supervised classroom practice engaged in by students. In-service training for  participating field center teachers is also conducted in these centers. Other types of field centers are planned: a) Teacher Service Centers for classroom teachers who wish to participate in various staff development activities and b) Portal Schools where assistance and training are provided for new teachers.

Over a year's time the girl's pattern changed from a) no weight shift to a shift of weight with a step toward the ball, and b) from initiation of the motion with horizontal adduction of the striking arm to initiation of the motion using simultaneous pelvic and spinal rotation. Two major changes observed in the boys pattern were a) progressively longer stride toward the ball and b) a  progressively greater pelvic and spinal rotation.

        "description":"Data collected from one high school was evaluated to exemplify how the psychometric method was applied to the Ford Training and Placement Program (FTPP). Evaluation of the FTPP relied on both affective, paper-and-pencil measures and classroom observations. It was the concern of this investigation to discover differences between Ford and non-Ford subjects. An analysis of convariance design, with pretest scores covaried out, revealed few significant differences in posttest scores. A difference in three personality measures seemed to support the validity of the teacher selection process. The lack of other differences between Ford and non-Ford individuals may not reflect shortcomings on the program so much as the inappropriateness of the measures used. A tighter connection between  program and evaluation would have made an adequate summative evaluation possible. (Author/JA)",

        "description":"A historical method of inquiry can be applied to an experimental teacher training program, specifically, the Ford Training and Preparation Program (FTPP). The historical method requires gathering a lot of loose ideas and events that have been part of the project and hanging them together in an integrated way. To achieve this, two organizing principles, the teleological approach and the systems approach, are utilized in constantly shifting focus to detail the development of the FTPP. In the teleological approach the program has an inherent purpose or end that can be found by studying an article by the founder of the FTPP on how to train school personnel. This article is called the program's &quot;metatheory.&quot; The systems approach views the same article as having logical constructs,  derived from systems theory, for approaching the training of teachers. In this approach, the article is called the program's &quot;theory.&quot; These two approaches comprise the best way of explaining the components of an experimental program within a historical context.

In Phase One, a 150-item written test and a 50-item written test based on taped stimulus material were produced. Each test consisted of five-choice multiple-choice questions. In Phase Two, the tests were administered during May-July 1972 to a sample of 129 college students who were completing work on a Master's Degree in Guidance and Counseling. Five institutions were represented in the study. In addition to taking the tests, each candidate completed a self-report Questionnaire Data Form. Several types of analyses were carried out, including two item analyses (one for the written test and one for the taped test). An intercorrelation  matrix showing the correlations between the test and their various subscores was also obtained. Ten stepwise regression analyses were run, each being based on a continuous variable derived from the questionnaire and used as a dependent criterion variable, with the written and taped tests used as independent variables. Feedback from the candidates about the tests was, in general, positive. Results are provided as related to item and test characteristics, intercorrelations among the subscores on the written and taped tests, and relationships between questionnaire data and test scores. A table presents multiple correlations of combinations of taped and written subscores with criterion variables. The Questionnaire Data Form with scoring specifications and the Test Evaluation Form are  provided. Tables in an appendix present intercorrelations among the taped test and written test, reliabilities of the subscores for the two tests, and zero-order correlations of the tests subscores with criterion variables.

Of the 10 scales of the questionnaire, five deal with the &quot;preparatory&quot; orientation to college, and five relate to a general &quot;exploratory&quot; orientation. The five preparatory are Achievement, Assignment Learning, Assessment, Affiliation, and Affirmation. The five exploratory are Inquiry, Independent Study, Interaction, Informal Association, and Involvement. Descriptions of these scales are given. Estimates  of scale reliability were derived through the calculation of a coefficient alpha statistic. With one exception, the reliability estimates are in the .70 to .80 range, as based on responses of 2,468 undergraduates. Low to moderate negative correlations were found between the preparatory and exploratory scales. Several analyses related to the validity of the SOS scales are reported. The SOS has potential use in a variety of research modes, both in a descriptive and experimental context; some of these uses are discussed. Administering the SOS is described as to availability, scoring, costs, reporting format and optional analyses. Normative data for aid in the interpretation of the SOS results and for institutional/curriculum comparisons are provided in eight tables. An appendix provides  scale descriptions, component items, and item-scale score correlations. (DB)",

The completed Phase I of the project was devoted to an identification of learners' needs and a determination of the criticality of those needs. Activities planned for Phase II are discussed in this report. These activities are aimed at the development of a method (test instruments and procedures) for making an annual assessment of the progress of schools in alleviating the specific learning needs of students. Criterion measures and the parallel assessment instruments will be restricted to &quot;Learning Skills&quot; in reading and mathematics in grades  4, 7, and 11. An attachment to the report provides Suggested Criteria for Determining the Quality of an Educational Needs Assessment Strategy. These criteria are outlined as to organizational strategy and operational strategy.

        "author":["Lewy, Arieh"],
        "description":"The employment of judgment as an evaluation tool at the early stage of curriculum development is advantageous. The reasons why this is so are: (1) writers exhibit more readiness to change elements of the program during the early stages of curriculum development; (2) there is great economic advantage in using such an evaluation tool; and (3) utilization of expert judgment may decrease the time needed for program development. The limitations to the utilization of judgmental data are related to what to judge, specifications and outcomes, specifications and planned activities, planned and actual activities, and actual activities and outcomes. The present paper does not contain a detailed list of questions that may be presented to experts, but rather concentrates on indicating several  aspects of the program that can be judged. Four major aspects of the fit of planned activities to the program specifications are content, presentation, learning apparatus, and relatedness to stated objectives. Prediction of future events relate to actual activities, student interest, difficulty level, teachers' reaction, and community reaction. The selection of experts for judging the fit between the program specifications and the planned learning activities should be made on the basis of logical considerations. Three methods of examining the validity of judgmental data are: (1) to quantify the degree of consensus obtained among experts with regard to different issues; (2) the employment of the \"shuffle test\"; and (3) by experimental validation.

        "description":"Using the College Student Questionnaires (CSQ), Part I, data on student performance of two different entering classes at eight colleges were studied to identify the characteristics of freshmen women students associated with overachievement/underachievement during the first college year. Overachievers were defined as those whose overall average was higher than that predicted from the standard battery by .618 standard errors of estimate or more, and underachievers were those with a comparably lower than expected freshman average grade. CSQ, Part I, contains sets of items (or scales) designed to assess: motivation for grades, family social status, independence from family, independence from peers, liberalism, social conscience, and cultural sophistication. In all, 16 replications of  the analysis were carried out. For each item in each analysis, the direction of the difference between over- and under-achieveing groups in their percentage responses to the various options was noted. The study results, which are provided in tables and graphs, showed that: (1) mean Motivation for Grades was higher for overachievers in all comparisons; (2) mean Family Social Status scores were higher for overachievers, who tended to have parents with higher educational and occupational attainment; (3) in 15 of 16 comparisons, Independence from Family means were lower for overachievers; (4) results for Peer Independence suggest that college-specific effects may be involved; (5) Liberalism results also suggest a college-specific effects; (6) Social Conscience means were higher for  overachievers in 14 of 16 comparisons; and (7) means for Cultural Sophistication suggest no pattern of differences.

Six validity studies involving data for classes entering Vassar during the period 1963 through 1971 reveal a relatively consistent pattern of relationships between Freshman Average Grade and the admissions tests scores. In each study, the best single indicator of probable performance during the freshman year has been either the CEEB Achievement average of the Converted School Rank. The  SAT-V was the third best single indicator, and the SAT-M provided information of least value. However, the combination of scores provides a better indication of probable performance than any single score. The most recent validity study of the scores of Vassar's Class of 1975 (324 women and 170 men) confirm the findings of the previous six studies. The findings of this study also showed that the combination of all four academic predictors is slightly higher for women than for men, and the aptitude measures tend to be more closely associated with freshman grades among the women than among the men. Eight tables provide the data for the various studies. (DB)",

        "description":"Criterion-referenced testing is designed to determine the student's ability to perform a specified skill within a comprehensive task. To measure the student's degree of development or growth, a teacher-made test is used. This test is used as criterion-referenced in the measuring of a student's degree of achievement of specified behaviors within a delimited parameter. The test becomes normative based when the teacher assigns a numerical quantity to each paper for the purpose of grade distribution. With criterion-referenced tests, measuring growth can be accomplished through either positive or negative behavioral observations. With established behavioral objectives, teacher-made tests and classwork are excellent for criterion referencing. For the skilled psychometrician, normative  based testing is a limited sampling of behavior that is done according to specific prerequisites. Norm testing focuses upon sorting and selecting students for placement into the educational curricula. By doing a detailed analysis of errors made on normative testing, the examiner can obtain a more detailed picture of the child than by using the actual standard score only. Thus, the skilled examiner is better able to relate testing observation to behavior displayed within the classroom setting, as well as viewing each test or subtest as to its component parts of incoming stimulus, understanding stimuli or expressive reaction. The skilled teacher must also, through observation, view a given task in the form of task analysis. From this, both the examiner and the teacher can determine the  instructional level for the child and agree as to the remedial approach to be used. (DB)",

        "description":"The needs of Ohio schools were assessed in relation to the area of Family Life Education, including education in sexual behavior, the prevention of alcohol, drug, and smoking abuse, and related social problems. The study was carried out in two phases. The first phase developed the methods for assessing the needs of Ohio schools, which involved defining &quot;need&quot; and developing the procedures for carrying out operations indicated by the definition. To determine the developments desired, one task force located and prepared summaries of studies of non-constructive and constructive behavior related to the four areas, and located tests to probe for critical factors. Another task force examined recent research, thinking and practice as to optimal school experiences and selected the  curricular offerings to be examined. From the reports of the task forces, the items to be assessed were assembled, and are presented in terms of a General Overview and Developments Desired in Detail. A survey was conducted to ascertain the influence of the learning experiences on knowledge and attitudes of children and to determine the knowledge and attitudes of teachers as related to the areas in which the students were tested. A total of 11,590 students (6,283 beginning 7th graders and 5,307 beginning 12th graders) were tested. Teachers, principals, and curriculum coordinators were surveyed. The results are tabulated and discussed. It is concluded that, in the areas of the social problems of youth with which the survey was concerned, the student receives little help in understanding and  identifying the difficulties that give rise to abuse behavior.

Chapter I, Introduction, discusses historical considerations and provides an overview of the report. Chapter II contains a comprehensive but concise description of the technical procedures employed in the study, which utilized a two-prong attack. The first prong was to identify what the various segments of North Dakota's population felt were educational areas requiring further attention; and the second prong was to document evidence that would prove whether or not these problem areas could justifiably be identified as critical educational needs for Title III, ESEA. Chapters III and IV present the results of the first prong of the  attack; Chapter III presents the results of a pilot study conducted in late spring of 1969 in the northeastern region of the state. The purpose of the pilot study was to make possible the testing of the procedures and the instrument developed for the needs assessment study. Chapter IV presents the results of the statewide needs assessment conducted in late Fall 1969. Chapter V presents the results of the second prong of the attack, consisting of a series of brief reports by experts in approximately 30 highest ranking educational needs. These reports contain data comparing the status of each need in North Dakota with its status in other states or nationally. The reports conclude with recommendations as to whether each need is critical for Title III, ESEA. Chapter VI summarizes the  information of the proceeding chapters.

To measure social intelligence, paper and pencil tests were developed which were &quot;situation free.&quot; These tests employed &quot;stereotypic behavior of individual others.&quot; The stimuli used in the behavioral tests were photographs of people, artists' drawings, and cartoons. The types of responses were generally limited to marking on an answer sheet or writing a response. A series of tests for behavioral creativity that did not use paper and pencil, answer sheets, or writing were developed. Four types of performance tests were developed and administered to a sample of 30 people along with the paper-and-pencil tests. A new set of tests, approximately 25 to 30, was developed  for behavioral production. Conclusions reached as a result of two validation studies are that people with high verbal intelligence don's need behavioral intelligence to perform well on the tests, and individuals with lower intelligence to perform well on the tests, and individuals with lower intelligence sometimes still achieved very high behavioral scores. Studies have also been done relating social intelligence to certain demographic variables. A study investigating the prediction of academic achievement correlated the behavioral-cognition tests with grades at a junior college; correlations of about .50 were found with achievement in various course grades. Three studies of the use of behavioral-cognition tests for predicting vocational success are discussed. Portions of the tests  relating to factors of behavioral intelligence and factors of social creativity and their tests are provided. (DB)",

The methods used were group norms, length of plateaux calculated from the schemata norms, and performance curves based on group norms and on schemata norms. The second aim of the research was to study the individual differences in the process of solving a problem between subjects with training and subjects without training. The performances of 38 experimental subjects were compared with the performances of 38 control subjects individually matched before the experiment. These  comparisons were made on the basis of 12 problems, 3 pretesting and 9 posttesting. The methods used to measure their performance were schemata norms, length of plateaux, individual performance curves based on schemata norms, and convex sets based on schemata norms. The third aim of the research was to study whether the educational level had an influence on the process followed by a subject in order to solve this type of problem. Results of the first study showed that the main effect schemata and the main effect content are statistically significant, as is the interaction between schemata and content. Schemata norms give more useful information about the problem-solving process followed. The second study results were that experimental subjects show a \"better\" performance than control  subjects. The third study showed that the college student's process is always better than that of the high school student. The length of plateaux is shown to be a good measure in the characterization of process. (Author/DB)",

        "author":["Wilson, Kenneth M."],
        "description":"To determine whether it is necessary for eight College Research Center (CRC) member colleges to use 16 distinct sets of weight in combining four admissions tests scores into predictive composities, a standard set of weights were developed and tested for effectiveness in predicting Freshman Average Grade (FAG). The basic sample in which weights were derived were women entering CRC-member colleges in Fall 1965; complete data were available for 2,523. Within each college, students with complete data were ordered from high to low with regard to FAG, and those in the upper and lower 27% were assigned to High Achieveing and Low Achieving groups, respectively. A multiple discriminant analysis resulted in four discriminant functions: the principal discriminant function exhausted  approximately 91% of the discriminating power provided by the four test scores, with raw-score weighting as follows: .22 (SAT-V) + .13 (SAT-M) + .62 (Rank) + .74 (Ach Av); the second function accounted for an additional 6%, with raw-score weightings as follows: .44 (SAT-V) + .23 (SAT-M) + .20 (Rank) - .84 (Ach Av). Means and standard deviations of the two discriminant scores for each of the 16 college/level of achievement scores are tabulated. Results indicate that, within each college/school-type subgroup, a composite score based on application of a standard set of weights to the four admission scores correlates as highly with FAG as composites based on group-specific weights for the respective subgroups.

Particular note is made of evidence that the CEEB Achievement Average contributes substantially more than do the SAT scores to prediction of college performance. Results of multiple correlational analysis, which are tabulated, show that: (1) a Predicted Grade Index (PGI) based solely on School Rank and the average of CEEB achievement test scores is as closely related to actual grades as PGI based on all four scores, including the SAT's; (2) with predictions based on the SAT's the accuracy of the prediction can be improved by adding Class Rank, and CEEB Achievement Average scores  add information not supplied by SAT&quot;s or Class Rank; (3) standard score regression weights from multiple correlational analyses show that: (a) weights for Rank and Achievement Average are, by and large, greater than the weights for SAT-V or SAT-M; (b) weights for Rank and Achievement Average are positive; and (c) weights for SAT-M have negative signs, with negative weighting for SAT-V occurring less frequently. As a result of the suppression effect of the SAT's, it is recommended that operational prediction formulae for CRC-member colleges be based solely on the Achievement Average and Converted Secondary School Rank.

Subjects for the studies were college men and women selected on the basis of heterosexual anxiety and inhibition. The first part of the paper is concerned with assessment. The behavioral assessment procedures developed include: (1) direct sampling of heterosexual interaction behaviors; (2) self-monitoring of naturalistic heterosexual interactions; (3) peer-ratings; and (4) self-report measures of anxiety and skill. Data on the reliability and validity of these measures are reported. A discussion of behavioral and cognitive components of heterosexual anxiety is given. The treatment programs developed are based on the idea of behavioral practice in the natural environment. The  basic program involves \"practice dating\" in which male and female subjects are matched for a series of practice dates with different partners and involves no therapist contact. The results from two studies involving variations of this basic procedure are presented, which suggest that this simple and economical treatment program is quite effective. The paper concludes with a general discussion of behavioral treatment strategies for interpersonal anxieties and inhibitions. (Author/DB)",

Specific objectives of the study were to: (1) provide information about the design and development of R/EAL, including determination of reading criteria, establishment of task analyses, production and selection of individual test items, development of test format and procedures, and completion of the final version of R/EAL; and (2) provide information about the validation of R/EAL, including procedures and data on reliability and validity for a select sample. Following field testing of the R/EAL, a revised version of the instrument was developed, which contains  reading criteria selected from common daily reading materials; includes tasks related to each criterion developed based on the reading functions required to deal with the individual criteria; and presents all directions and questions in aural form via individually operated cassette players. The methodology used for validating R/EAL, including sample selection, testing procedures, and item analysis, is described, and data relating to individual item and total test statistics, factor analysis data, reliability, and validity are reported. The reliability and validity figures on R/EAL tend to support its use as a viable assessment instrument for functional literacy.

The study is based on students who entered CRC-member colleges in September 1966, who earned a freshman year average during academic 1966-67, and for whom scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test, the average of CEEB achievements, coverted rank, a cumulative high school average, and averages in high school English, languages,  mathematics, sciences, and social studies were available. The results indicate that the overall high school average, as compared with the Converted School Rank, yields higher simple correlations with freshman year average in 10 of 16 comparisons, and approximately equal or only slightly lower coefficients in the remainder of comparisons, and when combined with three standardized test variables, yields higher multiple correlations with freshman year average in 9 of 16 comparisons, and approximately equal or only slightly lower coefficients in the remainder of cases. When averages in five subjects are treated rather than the cumulative high school average, results indicate that the more detailed information about the high school record shows promise of improving predictions of freshman year  performance and has value from the point of view of gaining insight into the aspects of the high school record most closely associated with college freshman performance.

The criterion-referenced measure is useful when one is interested in whether an individual possesses particular competencies and when there are no quotas as to how many possess that skill. It is particularly useful in assessing competence in licensed professions since tasks in these areas must be performed at specifiably high levels of competence. Criterion-referenced assessment is also important to any subject area where future academic success is dependent upon cumulative information or skills, such as in mathematics. The norm-referenced measure should be used when selectivity is required, such asin choosing the most able candidate to fill a position  or when only a limited number of candidates can be selected for vocational training or academic pursuit. The criterion-referenced measure points out whether an individual possesses particular skills or competencies, but the norm-referenced measure is better able to indicate how well the individual performs in his competent area. The criterion referenced measure aims to discriminate between successive performance of a given individual, while the norm-referenced measure aims to discriminate between individuals within a particular group on a given measure. Criterion-referenced assessment, along with feedback and remedial procedures, can help teachers realize the goals of mastery learning with their students. (Author/KM)",

The test is not intended for use in chronological grade placement. The test consists of a group of pictures of objects and activities, a series of simple words, six brief stories (each consisting of only a few sentences), a series of multiple-choice word opposites, a group of shapes and numbers, and a series of arithmetic problems.

Performance data on eight Navy ratings was collected from ships of LANTFLT and PACFLT. This report is the last in a series of technical reports on the statistical analysis of that data. A statistical analysis is provided on performance related data for electronic maintenance personnel sampled from 21 ships. Four different performance estimators, as functions of critical incidents, were evaluated. A detailed explanation of the distributional properties of the performance estimators is presented, and an explanation of the factors that lead to the adoption of a curvilinear regression analysis for analysis  of the data is discussed. The results of the statistical analysis indicated that a certain combination of the performance data possessed moderate validity for appraising the absolute level of technician on-the-job performance on the EM, ET, FT, and IC ratings. Application of the technique to technicians in the RM, ST, and TM ratings was tenuous, but still appropriate, while none of the performance estimators seemed to be applicable to technicians in the RD rating. For this reason, it would seem that the appropriateness of application of this technique to other ratings warrants investigation, perhaps by the approach employed in this report. In any event it has been observed that the technique possesses sufficient merit to be recommended for more widespread use within the U. S. Navy.  (Author)",

The evaluation involves 10 basic steps: (1) the professor allocates to the 10 categories the percent of effort he sets as his goal for the coming semester or year; (2) the professor completes the goals and objectives for all categories; (3) the department  chairman evaluates the effort allocation and goal intent statements; (4) if discrepancies are noted in step 3, the chairman and professor eliminate or reduce them; (5) the Overall Evaluation Form is completed by the professor and then by his chairman; (6) during the year or semester, the student evaluation form is administered to all the professor's students, the professor submits samples of his tests, and evaluation forms are sent to his advisees; (7) after the year or semester, the professor completes the \"description of activities and processes\"; (8) the professor then completes the \"accomplishment\" section, the \"products and accomplishments\" section of each category, and a self evaluation; (9) the chairman evaluates the discrepancies between goals and accomplishments; (10) on  subsequent cycles through the system, the professor tries to reduce discrepancies.

These are American Negroes and American Caucasians, or in today's terminology, blacks and whites. Some data relevant to the design of programs of social action suggest the following: The mean intellectual deficit of the black group is a general one and not restricted to measures stressing the use of standard English. The mean intellectual deficit occurs early and changes very little between the first grade and high school graduation. A third and closely-related set of data shows that black schools are not substantially inferior to white schools as measured by the usual economic and demographic characteristics. There is no basis  in the psychology of learning or of human abilities for an assumption that environmental deficits can be quickly and easily overcome given freedom of opportunity. If one starts with groups of black and white women who are about equal in intellectual ability at a level well below the national norm, the offspring of the blacks will have a lower mean than the offspring of the whites. These data are admittedly distressing. There appear to be no easy solutions. It is quite clear, for example, that the preschool period is very important and is also presently beyond the reach of the public schools. Families and local communities must assume more responsibility at this atage. (Author/JM)",

The program, since its inception, has been student oriented. Therefore, each staff member had as his prime responsibilities the  development of the student in his actual academic and social endeavors. Initially, the staff had to meet with district personnel to gain an understanding of their respective jobs and functions. The second phase involved direct work with students. Counseling and testing sessions were established. Tutorial sessions were started. A stronger black students group was established. Students were encouraged to use the community office as an educational and vocational resource center. In addition, all student groups, large or small, meet there with the staff, providing guidance whenever needed. Field trips, above and beyond those for a particular academic class, were started.

Put simply, we need to know what constitutes racial and ethnic differences, and why such differences are important. As in the study of the individual in society, there are two basic components in analyzing race and ethnic group identity: the characteristics of the identities themselves and the societal context within which the identities are important. These two components are only distinguishable in an analytic sense. The most  important characteristic of these identities is that they are group identities. The distinction between group and individual identity leads to the observation that the assimilation process may be different for groups than it is for individuals. American society has continually defined basic human rights and economic and social opportunities according to racial and ethnic identities. Racial conflict has persisted throughout American history, marked by lynchings, urban riots, and other forms of violent confrontation. There has also been a revived awareness of other racial and ethnic identities; a consciousness of differences among white ethnic groups has, for example, resurfaced. (Author",

The objective of this group was to serve as a model in clarifying problems incident to school desegregation which had been identified in the respective local school communities. Development of solutions and implementation of methods for attacking these problems in a constructive manner was needed. Attitudes, situations, and problems were examined while the pupils were learning leadership techniques to effect solutions to problems. Many of the pupils came into a close relationship with  people of diverse cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds for the first time in their lives. In this situation they assisted one another in developing methods of solving the problems common to the school system, as well as the problems that addressed themselves only to a particular school. At the same time, the individual school group built a team to go back to its school and help train other people, as well as to implement solutions to the problems in its local school community. Not only did the camp environment provide an informal, pressure-free situation, it enhanced the opportunity for growth by mixing experiences and backgrounds of all those who participated in the program.

The evaluators constructed survey questionnaires and administered them to the participants and a comparison group at the beginning and end of the Institute in order to assess whether or not the goal of modified teachers' attitudes toward equal educational opportunity  was realized. It was found that while all the participants agree that the potential of each child should be fully developed, the assumptions underlying their notion of potential (ability, endowment, innate capacity, and the like) changed as a result of the Institute. The teachers shifted their attitudes toward ability in a number of significant ways in response to the Institute. For example, the proportion of teachers who believe that native intelligence is not fixed genetically but is responsive to environmental influences during the first formative years increased.

        "description":"Numerous investigations of the relationship of oral language skills to the acquisition of reading show that the nonstandard language of the child accounts, at least in part, for classroom failure. Even a teacher who is well informed about the nature of nonstandard language and its relationship to reading and academic success requires a valid oral language test instrument to evaluate his students and plan accordingly. One test which has been used successfully with over 1,500 students from different cultural and ethnic background throughout the United States is the &quot;Gloria and David Beginning English Test Six.&quot; This sentence repetition test has been found highly reliable for evaluating language in terms of language dominance (Standard English, Negro Nonstandard English, or  Spanish); and Standard American English comprehension, production, phonology, inflections and syntax. The purpose of this study was to determine if 50 tapes are required to adequately train someone to use the test. The research design involved evaluating the oral language performance of ten black children at three different times and correlating these ratings with the mean ratings of 15 linguistic experts. Since the author of the test felt 50 tapes would be required to train one teacher, the study was constructed around this number. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Racial identity and its meaning is as necessary to the black researcher as are the tools of his profession. With the rise in racial awareness, identity, and pride in Afro-Americans, there has been concurrent understanding of the hypocritical values which are transmitted through education, and a growing repudiation of them. There must be a concerted effort within education to utilize the minority professional as a key to institutional change. Through minority consultants and researchers, different educational needs can be recognized, customized programs designed, and evaluations relative to varying needs be conducted. Black teachers and researchers, unhappy with the kinds of tests and personality inventories which are available for use with black children, must be willing to  devise their own methods of assessment. The second step of seeking approval from the profession is a necessary and essential one. As most black professionals have competence through knowledge of their white peers' operational difficulties in achieving reform they can and must also serve as catalyst, interpreters (of white values to blacks), researchers, consultants, and program analyst. Black consultants and organizations must establish themselves as reservoirs of talent, knowledge, and insight in establishing creative ways to develop, test and \"spot the bugs\" in new programs as they operate in urban schools. Black scholars must challenge those who cling to the supremacy of their \"scientific\" authority. (Author/JM)",

The purpose was to test the notion that crisis, under certain management conditions, may result in positive change or development. The procedure consisted of two parts. The first considered the extent to which student unrest-related crises occurred in the Public Schools of Philadelphia and their effect upon the system. The second part examined in greater detail the inputs to the system, the process by which they were used, and the outputs which resulted from a single recent major system crisis linked to student unrest. A version of Good and Scates' phases of a case study was used as a model to organize  part two into four sections--(1) the status of the situation; (2) the collection of data; (3) an overview of the process; and, (4) an examination of the outputs. Three general results are reported: (1) the crisis was promptly identified as such, and dealt with accordingly; (2) the immediate crisis was resolved, and steps were taken to develop and implement strategies for avoiding similar occurrences; and (3) the process employed by the Superintendent of Schools in dealing with the crisis situation indicates a systems approach, a development orientation, and an understanding of crisis management.

        "description":"In order to look at the issues involved in decentralizing urban school districts, we must consider a number of things. Among these are the method of selecting the members of the local shcool boards; the amount of power of the community boards; control of financing and budget; curriculum; and the hiring, firing, and rewarding of teachers. In many ways the fight over decentralization is a good way of looking at the whole question of the adequacy of the educational system in the urban community because decentralization is an attempt to deal with the systems that have led the local residents to demand improved education. The main obstacles to decentralization of schools in New York City are an entrenched bureaucracy in the New York City school system, a very large and powerful  Teachers' Union, and the political ramifications which accompany the process of decentralization. The main benefits are lessening of the administrative lethargy of the centralized bureaucracy and ease of responsiveness in meeting the needs of local communities. Local board members have gain expertise and skill in dealing with the political realities of urban education through the on-the-job training process that they have gone through. It will take time, effort, and some changes in power relationships for decentralization to be an effective mechanism for improving the quality of urban education. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study of fourth-grade students in the New Orleans Public Schools during the 1972-73 session was to achieve a better understanding of the characteristics, reasons for suspension, and self-concept of students suspended from low socio-economic schools. The idea that poor self-concept as-a-learner is a significant factor which differentiates the suspended student from the non-suspended student was conceptualized and tested. The study used a non-experimental design involving the use of ex post facto research. This design involved the pairing of 41 suspended students with 41 non-suspended students on the variables of age, sex, race, grade, and socio-economic level. Student self-reports on the Self Appraisal Scale and the teacher-student ratings within each group.  The findings indicate that fourth-grade students suspended from low socio-economic schools are generally black males who are overaged for grade placement, deficient in academic skills, borderline or below in mental ability, and frequently absent from school. The suspended students' self-concept as-a-learner mean scores were significantly lower than those of the non-suspended students on the FKS. (Author/JM)",

The minimal goal was to create curriculum strategies leading to students' recognition and understanding of their attitudes, whether racist or not, and the consequences of such attitudes. A more ambitious goal was to promote necessary attitudinal changes: this is a continuing goal. The intent of the Social Science and English teachers engaged in the development and use of multicultural curriculum materials is to &quot;tell it like it is&quot; concerning the experiences of racial minorities. The goal is to help young people who are the students understand how one aspect of their social world operates and how in American society certain attitudes, actions  and institutional structures have subordinated particular persons or groups because of their color. Perhaps of equal importance is the necessity of helping students become aware that the subordination of colored peoples came into being mainly because of the benefits provided to those who did the subordinating and that racism in its many facets persists mainly because it still yields significant psychological, economic, and political advantaged to millions of white Americans--and even to a few non-whites. The curriculum is developed along two vectors: (i) exploration of the causal relationships in inter-group problems; and (ii) exploration of selected aspects of American history and culture in terms of minority subcultures.

Thirteen original projects moved into their third year of operation during 1971-72 and five new &quot;replication&quot; projects began operation during the year. The students in these effective demonstration programs showed a rate of achievement reached in few compensatory education programs anywhere in the nation. These programs were designed with the goal of raising the performance level of these students to reflect a normal distribution of achievement. This objective was achieved in almost all cases. The few  programs that were not successful were terminated. The programs were unique in many ways. They were planned and developed by the staff of each participating school. The principal, the project director, and a carefully selected staff of teachers, aides, and volunteers made decisions at the school level. Students with varying abilities were grouped together heterogeneously. They were usually taught individually or in groups of two or three at least part of each day by the teachers and assistants. In most programs, each student spent some time each week in a learning laboratory where he worked with highly trained teachers and assistants in specific learning activities designed especially for him. Curriculum was developed and prescribed as needed and was based upon a careful diagnosis of  learning disabilities. An emphasis on success was the key to the program. (Author/JM)",

Districts that offered English as a second language reported that their objectives were achieved more often when locally developed instructional materials were used with individualized instruction rather than when available commercial instructional materials were used in large-group instruction.

Major objectives included improvement in pupil behavior, learning, and personal health. Improved parent attendance at school meetings and parent conferences, more positive attitudes towards the school, and increased communication and cooperation between the home and the school were objectives achieved. Greater understanding and acceptance, knowledge, interaction, and positive attitudes helped to reduce isolation between different racial, social, cultural, or ethnic groups.

This study examines the impact of self-concept on academic achievement. It was hypothesized that: (1) reinforcement of behaviors important to academic success increases achievement; (2) as academic achievement improves, academic self-concept becomes more positive; and, (3) social rewards (verbal and written praise) are more effective than economic or token rewards (small amounts of money) in improving academic achievement. Forty-two black students with scores below the average of their class on achievement and self-concept measures were selected for this study from grades four, five and six in  one school. Teachers rated the students' intellectual development on a four-point scale both before and after treatment. The students were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups for 12 weeks. Group one received intensive tutoring and counseling combined with token reinforcement. Group two received intensive tutoring and counseling combined with social reinforcement. Group three received no counseling or reinforcement. The subjects were pretested on academic and self-concept measures, received their respective treatments, and were retested. The tutoring-counseling was carried out by the experimenter in one-hour sessions twice a week for each group. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"We have tried to address two questions: \"What has been the trend of socioeconomic opportunity for black and white men in the U. S. during the past decade?\" and \"what has been the trend of racial discrimination in the socioeconomic achievements of black men?\" Using 1962 Current Population Survey data, we estimated a simple three-equation model of socioeconomic achievement for black and nonblack (hereafter, white) men at ages 34-44, 45-54, and 55-64. The model takes educational attainment in years of schooling to depend on father's occupational status, father's educational attainment, respondent's farm background, and respondent's number of siblings. Respondent's current occupational status depends on the four background variables and on educational attainment. Finally, the  respondent's income depends on the background variables, educational attainment, and occupational status. We have found that the socioeconomic opportunities of all men in the labor force, and especially of blacks, have increased in the past decade, but the opportunities for white men to hold high status jobs may have leveled off. Black-white differences in educational attainment, occupational status, and income have been reduced substantially, but there remain large residues of discrimination against blacks in all three areas of achievement. These made up as large a proportion of the total racial gap in schooling, occupational status and income in 1972 as they did in 1962. (Author/JM)",

In a study in 1969-70, children who received breakfast and lunch at school showed significant improvement in hemoglobin concentrations. Children who received lunch alone improved but not to an extent that was statistically significant. Children with high hemoglobin levels showed better performance in the Kahn Intelligence Test(KIT) and, in the youngest age group, in simple and disjunctive reaction time tests. Improvement in KIT occurred in children who received breakfast and lunch. In studies the next year, the nutritional status of kindergarten children was found  to be better than in the previous year. Children who received breakfast and lunch did not improve significantly as compared to the control children who also improved. Children who received breakfast and lunch improved significantly in performance in the disjunctive reaction time and in continued trials of associative reaction time. Improvement was greater in subjects whose initial hemoglobin values were low. These studies indicate a relationship between mild levels of nutrient deficiency and performance tasks demanding attentiveness and alertness. (Author/JM)",

Half of the families in the Cairo area have poverty incomes, according to federal standards. Unemployment at 9 percent is nearly double the national average. About a third of the city--county population gets some kind of public assistance. More than one half of Cairo's dwellings are classified as deteriorating or dilapidated. How did Cairo get that way? Certainly uncontrollable economic developments contributed to the material decline. But disastrous race relations have blighted human resources essential to progress. Testimony before the Commission show that over the decades, blacks have comprised roughly 30 percent of the county and  40 percent of the city population. But no black had ever served on the county Housing Authority, the Cairo Public Utility Commission, Building Commission or Library Board. There were blacks in city office jobs. Admittedly, many American &quot;people&quot; are bored with race as a topic. But what color are these &quot;people?&quot; In Cairo, is their median family income 6400 dollars (white) or 2800 dollars (black)? Do they live in big-city ghettoes where jobs are always in short supply but drugs are plentiful? Do residents of Cairo's segregated public housing feel that the topic of racism has been exhausted? And the imposing body of civil rights law, how well does it work to change the quality of lives. These are some of the questions that brought the Commission to Cairo. (Author/JM)",

We have designed an approach which extends beyond \"ethnic studies,\" to a more comprehensive rubric that we call \"ethnicity in education.\" It pursues three major activities: (1) devising new curriculum materials; (2) raising the consciousness of teachers and other school personnel; and, (3) designing programs. Last fall we wrote to the 50 state education agencies, requesting information on the status of their activities in the ethnic studies area. Thus far, we have heard directly from about 40 states. With the help of additional statistics gathered by  HEW's Office of Education we compiled a preliminary report: In some states, there is no apparent interest whatsoever in ethnic studies. In others there is a considerable amount of legislation and policy on the books, but limited evidence of implementation. And in still others, with no law or policy, there is a tremendous amount of local activity. Thirty-three states publish materials including curriculum guides, teaching supplements, bibliographies, textbook listings and audio-visual aids which they distribute to local school boards. Twenty-six states have formal policy statements on ethnic studies which are purportedly implemented by local school districts. Moreover, 13 states currently have laws on the books which mandate the inclusion of ethnic studies in the curriculum, and four more  have passed bilingual laws. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This report presents the current status of a series of studies oriented toward the assessment of perceived life quality. A conceptual model developed here proposes that a person's overall sense of quality of life is understandable in terms of a combination of affective responses (i.e. evaluations) of life \"domains.\" Life domains are of two types: role-situations and values. Although not tested by results reported here, it is hypothesized that the role-situations are evaluated in terms of the values, and--conversely--vice versa. However, one of the important results which is reported is that additive combinations of affective responses to domains provided moderately good explanations of people's overall sense of life quality. In an attempt to identify an appropriate set of  domains, an extensive scan of several types of sources eventually led to the writing of 123 items to which people have been asked to give affective responses. Data came from several surveys of American adult. The surveys were each based on nationally representative probability samples which yielded between 1000 and 1500 respondents. Through a variety of mapping and clustering techniques, the 80-odd items from this total pool which had been included in surveys in May or November, 1972 were grouped into a smaller number of semi-independent clusters. These \"clusters\" (many of which include just a single item) constituted the domains of the model. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"There has been a long-standing controversy concerning success values in American society. While one position maintains that success values are more or less uniformly distributed throughout the class structure, another position holds that the amount or kind of success to which people aspire shows a consistent and positive relationship to their position in the class structure. A third position states that those who hold that the basic values of society are common to all classes are correct, because the members of the lower class do share these values with other members of society. Similarly, those who hold that the values differ from class to class are also correct, because the members of the lower-class share values unique to themselves in addition to sharing the general values of  society with others. The purpose of this paper is to attempt to test the validity of such a synthetic approach. Three types of success values are involved in the present research, educational, occupational, and income aspirations. Questionnaires were administered to 707 male high school students, grades nine through twelve, who were drawn from four different school systems in Western Massachusetts. An effort was made to secure adequate representation of all social classes, major religious groups, curricula (college preparatory vs. terminal), and grade levels. This objective was achieved, except for an under-representation of terminal students. No set of universal, i.e., non-class-differentiated values was found. (Author/JM)",

The purpose of this study is to reexamine earlier findings and explore more deeply the dynamics of school desegregation and community reaction. In brief, the Commission found that one reason why many people are uneasy about desegregation is their fear that it will result in a poorer quality of education for their children. It is necessary to prepare carefully and sensitively for desegregation. The technical problems of achieving desegregation, such as determining the most appropriate desegregation technique and dealing with the problems incident to increased busing, have proven to be far less formidable than previously believed. Many  school officials, in their concern to facilitate a successful transition to desegregation, have tended to consider the needs and desires of the white community alone, sometimes assuming that minority parents will welcome desegregation on almost any terms. The way in which school officials, civic leaders, and the news media respond to disruptive incidents can serve either to preserve an atmosphere of calm or heighten tension even more. There is a sharp contrast between the reaction of communities to their own experience in desegregation and their expressed feelings concerning desegregation as a general proposition. Finally, the effects of the controversy at the national level concerning busing and school desegregation have been felt in a number of communities visited by Commission staff.  (Author/JM)",

Recently many more choices in instructional materials and equipment for ABE programs have become available so evaluation should be based on sound procedures. Special talents and outlooks are required for ABE teachers, who may benefit from preservice and inservice programs. Paraprofessionals may also be used. ABE programs must be sold to prospective students, so directors must know and practice effective  sales techniques. An inviting climate for learning can ease the transition and hold students. Programed instruction and other forms of individualized instruction are particularly helpful. Guidance must be provided and accurate records and budgets kept. Annual evaluation is helpful. (MS)",

The purposes of the groups were to draw basic information from specially prepared reading and audio-visual materials and to stimulate participants to think better for themselves through discussion. Discussion leaders were community volunteers trained in special workshops. Meetings were held in private homes in the community for eight to twelve sessions of about two hours. Groups averaged sixteen to eighteen participants. The program grew with funding and other support until it serviced annually over 1,500 participants in 77 British Columbia communities on an annual budget of $25,000. The program was discontinued when  the University sponsor ruled that Extension Programs must be self-supporting. An effort to reintroduce the program at a later date was short-lived.

(OSA) and Human Interest Regarding Employment/Minorities Action Coalition (HIRE/MAC) to train black construction workers and organize them into a self-supportive construction cooperative. JMDP evolved in three stages. The first phase was the construction of an experimental modular home. The second involved program development, operation, and change of direction from modular to conventional house building. A major difficulty was found in meeting the training needs of the men. The third phase was the actual building of a house, characterized by increasing labor dissatisfaction and lack of coordination between the many organizations involved. It is concluded that JMDP was  a qualitative if not a notably quantitative success. A small and cohesive group eventually survived and profited from the experience. As a pilot program the project offers valuable background for similar ventures. (MS)",

The economic outcome at the work place of union activity affects compensation levels, lifetime economic advancement, and the structure of employment. The success or failure of trade unions often depend on the manipulation of economic constraints outside the bargaining relationship, such as control over entry into the labor market, restrictions on non-union competition, and regulation of product markets. While unionization generally raises earnings, its effects are particularly strong for poorly educated workers and black males. Unions stabilize work through systematic assignment of apprentices, more regular employment of older workers, redistribution from the senior to  the less senior, and the reduction of voluntary turnover.

Cooperative students also showed a much higher percentage of employment and higher employment in clerical and office positions. Other measures showed no significant differences.

The data demonstrate the ASVAB is an effective instrument for use in the military high school testing program and may be used satisfactorily, as is AQE, to assign enlistees to technical training. Three of the four selector aptitude indexes of the ASVAB (General, Administrative, and Electronics) evidenced their appropriateness by having higher validities for their appropriate courses than any of the other ASVAB aptitude indexes. This sort of specific validity  did not obtain for the selector index of the Mechanical cluster.

The model matrix developed is an operational tool providing means for defining, evaluating, and refining context, guidance activities, and other support services associated with career education based on authoritatively derived concepts regarding self, culture, and career. Four critical concepts inherent in the matrix are the eight elements of career education, the cumulative effort of sequencing learning experiences, the  unifying of academic and vocational curriculum through career education, and the fragmentability of career education into manageable parts. Two conferences held in March and June 1973 by the Institute for Educational Development critically reviewed the developmental program goals from an intellectual and a utilitarian viewpoint.

In this study three mutually exclusive models are postulated to account for this phenomenon. Using synthetic cohort data from 834 employed non-farm males, strong support was found for the proposition that the importance of the initial entry point in the labor force on current occupational status decreases as the length of time spent in the labor force increases, and the rate of this loss increases with time.

Resultant changes in occupational structure may be assessed through study of five major areas: market participation, sectoral relocation, work specialization, occupational upgrading, and bureaucratization. Introduction of a large-scale production facility to a rural area was studied (along with a control group) for its impact on the area work force. Its effects were marginal in terms of market participation and work specialization but more pronounced in regard to sectoral relocation and occupational upgrading (especially in white-collar occupations). There is some support for the proposition that rural development  increases work bureaucratization. The apparent lack of major impact of industrialization may be due to the brevity of the research period (1966 to 1971), the effects being too localized to measure with available data, or, most likely, the dilution of effects through wide dispersal within the region.

The curriculum will eventually be made available to all elementary teachers as well as all secondary teachers in related subject areas such as Health and Biology. During the school year, 227 staff members attending a series of four-session workshops, screened numerous drug abuse instructional programs, and  made presentations about the problems of drug abuse to civic groups. It is planned that, during 1972-73, there will be a continuing emphasis on teacher training, curriculum development and the offering of a training program for district counselors similar to a practicum in drug abuse counseling.

As the Crime Commission Report provided no models for these bureaus, many types evolved. This study locates and describes numerous programs and procedures, and the influences significant in shaping the nature of bureaus in different communities. A minimum of 200,000 youth received services from approximately 140 bureaus in a one year period of 1971-72. Typical programs have five or six full-time staff members and utilize, or plan to utilize, volunteer services. Individual counseling and referral are reported as the most important bureau service. Two-thirds of  the programs are in urban, core, or Model Cities neighborhoods. All ethnic groups are serviced; 60% of cases are boys, 40% girls. School, law enforcement and self are primary sources of referral. Physical facilities tend to be in reasonable and useful condition, although neighborhood conditions tend to be poor. The most pressing problem is funding. The report describes 58 bureaus and makes recommendations for developing priorities and policies. (Author/NMF)",

The study also examines community-wide organizations in four metropolitan areas which use extensive networks of communication to advance black-white integration. The report concludes that increasing evidence points to low socioeconomic level and low educational level as major factors in white resistance to having black neighbors, but other factors such as fear of intermarriage, fear of lowered  property value, and fear of crime still operate.

This investigation focused on the behaviors and attitudes of a group of 23 male college sophomores who were academic underachievers, and a matched group of overachievers. Longitudinal interview data and test data were collected. The results supported the hypotheses that underachievers would be significantly more likely than overachievers to report and display \"irresponsible\" behaviors arising from impulsivity and anxiety over achievement in work situations. Cluster analyses of subjects' scores on the Omnibus Personality Inventory and Opinion, Attitude, and  Interest Survey, together with interview data suggest the possibility of subgroup approach to underachievement. In addition, excerpts from the interviews illustrate the kinds of complex interactions that underachievers have with work, with teachers, and with those trying to intervene. (Author)",

The log of a counseling graduate student from Louisiana State University who worked at HEAD to fulfill his practicum requirement provides an insight into the daily experiences encountered at HEAD. The log describes the orientation program, volunteer training, drug problems, venereal disease lectures, emergency telephone calls, and community requests for resource  information.

        "description":"This booklet urges social agencies to focus more attention on older children who have not previously been considered for adoption and describes a San Diego adoption program for older children in which the psychological difficulties faced by these children are discussed. The booklet offers suggestions for the social worker in earning the child's trust, handling separation, and building on the child's past experiences. It stresses the importance of foster parents, community, and social agency working together in programs for older children. In discussing methods and techniques for treating older children, the pamphlet focuses on the interview session, the handling of feelings, the use of treats, and the utilization of visual aids. The booklet also includes flexible guidelines for  placement of older children in foster and adoptive families. (Author/LAA)",
