        "description":"The development of devices used to coin agent and instrument nouns in Hebrew was investigated among 60 children aged 3, 4, 5, 7, and 11. The prevalent word-formation device in Hebrew is the triconsonantal root combined with vowel patterns. Other available devices include suffixation, conversion, and compounding. Questions designed to elicit innovative nouns were posed to the subjects. It was found that different word-formation devices were preferred at different ages, with suffixation preferred by most subjects beyond the age of 4. The results are compared with those of a similar study of English-speaking children in order to distinguish language-specific from universal response patterns. For example, the low incidence of compounding by Hebrew-speaking children is attributable to  its lack of utility in Hebrew. The more varied set of devices available to Hebrew speakers for coining nouns makes the task of acquisition more complex and prolonged than for English speakers. Children in both studies were able to coin agent nouns before instruments, relied on fewer devices for coining agent nouns, and used suffixation as the preferred device. (RW)",

        "description":"Evidence of semantically based orderings of phrasal coordinations in child speech is explored. Speech samples from two children are analyzed to show that such sequences occur frequently, are internally consistent, and are part of children's active repertoire of referential and expressive acts at an early age. The samples were obtained from one child between the ages of 18 to 27 months and another between 36 to 41 months. The evidence suggests that early in child speech, word order in coordination lends itself to iconization of several types of semantic distinctions. Children acquire a principle which states that a preferred ordering exists for semantically distinct constituents of phrasal coordinations. Further, such an ordering iconically encodes the subjective primacy of one  referent by placing it first in the coordination. The need for longitudinal data on spontaneous speech accompanied by information on gestures, focus of attention, and parents' speech is cited. (RW)",

        "description":"Children's acquisition of agent nouns within a framework of morphological structural principles is explored. Language acquisition has been conceptualized as a process of parameter setting in which the learner is richly endowed with a vocabulary of primitives and rule schemata. Exposure to the primary data will be filled in from the range of options allowed by universal grammar. It is argued that while it may initially appear that learners are using rules that are incorrect for analyzing the particular data, these rules actually fit into the larger system the learners are acquiring. Children's use of morphological structural principles in agent noun acquisition was evaluated in an experiment involving 21 children between the ages of 3 and 7. The results were consistent with the  hypothesis that children's grammars reflect morphological structural principles within a framework which takes into account the logic of learnability. (RW)",

Three bilingual program evaluations in foreign countries are described in terms of their different contexts and approaches in order to raise issues about bilingual education program evaluation.

Most research on reading in a bilingual setting involves college students in the United States or younger students in other countries, while research on writing in a bilingual setting is only beginning to emerge. The review focuses on the nature of literacy, reading, writing, and the interface between reading and writing. Specific topics include: the distinction between oral and written language, language and context, learning to read and write, factors contributing to the acquisition of literacy, the relationship of first language literacy to acquisition of second language literacy, transfer of skills across language, second language oral proficiency and reading achievement, and teaching  practices and materials. In conclusion, literacy involves language which moves beyond the scope of interpersonal communication with its contextual cues. For children whose second language is not English, initial literacy instruction in the native language may provide the necessary basis for acquiring literacy in English.

The majority of Koreans in Los Angeles have been in the United States less than 10 years. A high percentage are from middle class and professional backgrounds. The traditional hierarchical family structure is being challenged by the younger generation that has been educated with the American values of independence and individual freedom. This conflict between children and their elders is frequently aggravated by lack of communication caused by language differences. Organized community efforts to maintain Korean language and culture include Korean churches, Korean language schools, Korean language mass media, bilingual education  in public schools, and business and social organizations.

For each of these domains, communication inadequacies, planning authorities, plans for alleviating inadequacies, and efforts at implementation of plans are identified. Perceived language inadequacies in the provision of services to the Spanish-speaking community have been addressed by a wide range of interacting planning authorities. Federal language planning activities are most often in the form of court decisions followed up by laws or regulations. Legal claims based on language discrimination must be backed up by a demonstration that substantial rights are diminished by lack of bilingual services. Other  language planning activities include publication of textbooks to teach Spanish to personnel who serve Spanish speakers, bilingual signs and other information sources, and the training and use of interpreters. It is concluded that the most effective plans specify who is to implement the plan, who is to monitor the process, and what guidelines are to be used. Lack of definition and specification leads to disjointed implementation efforts. (RW)",

Becoming biliterate and fluently bilingual in a European and an Asian language involves several complications not involved in acquiring two European languages. The biliterate in such a situation must learn two different orthographies and learn to apply sociolinguistic rules to interaction in two widely different cultures. The review focuses on children who are learning to read in a second language following a change in country of residence. The topics discussed include the linguistic relationship between the first and second languages, orthography, exposure to written material, the effects of age on second language learning, and the  sociocultural effects of biliteracy. Balanced biliteracy is difficult to achieve when the second language is that of the dominant culture. However, the benefits of balanced biliteracy include pride in ethnicity and flexibility in the cognitive and cultural domains. References are appended. (RW)",

This criticism has been partially due to difficulties in obtaining hard data in bilingual settings, such as the lack of test instruments for bilingual children, the lack of appropriate reference groups, and the deficiencies of traditional evaluation models. The special problems involved in evaluating bilingual programs are described along with emerging solutions. Major problems have been encountered with the three most common evaluation designs: the control group model, the comparison group, and the norm reference group. Alternative evaluation design models include multi-year studies and designs in which children serve as their own control group.

These two needs reflect the distinction between listening for comprehension and listening for acquisition; they must be accounted for in the curriculum, materials, and teaching methods of ESL classes. Research has described the listening process as one of predicting, sampling, hypothesis-creating, and checking. By explaining these strategies, focusing on them separately and sequentially at first, and teaching ways to control them, the instructor can lead students to become more self-confident and independent in their listening abilities and to comprehend real language  messages before they actually acquire comparable knowledge of the target language. Extending these techniques to the second type of comprehension would mean a change in the focus of traditional types of exercises. Through the use of the listening strategies described above, the exercises would focus first on understanding the message and then on the language forms. Strategies and techniques based on the model are described and sample exercises are appended. (AMH)",

In 1976, 115 third graders were tested in reading, verbal ability, and aural comprehension in both English and Spanish. Attitude toward language and school and demographic data were also recorded. The following year data were collected on English reading tests, teachers' ratings of pupil performance in five subject areas, and individual scores on an observation instrument measuring classroom participation. The data were subjected to a series of analyses that sought to identify reliable predictors of success and to determine the extent to which English proficiency alone could  serve as a valid predictor. The analysis suggested that third grade reading skills in English do not offer definite predictive power with regard to classroom participation after transition. Further analyses indicated that English vocabulary skills play a strong role in prediction of success in English reading. These skills plus time-related variables are useful in predicting success in subject matter areas. The particular contribution of all variables varies according to the subject matter area concerned.

        "description":"The paper being reviewed puts the vernacular in the perspective of the linguistic repertoire of a speech community. It is suggested that the repertoire as a single system should be seen on a societal or individual level rather than on a linguistic level such that various codes are selected by members of the community according to socially determined rules of appropriateness. Labov's work suggests that for purposes of comparing different communities, whether bilingual or monolingual, the term \"vernacular\" should be restricted to a technical usage, applying only to the first-learned spoken languages of a group of speakers. Research on native New Yorkers' speech, comparative studies of children's speech in Philadelphia and New York, and Benji Wald's own work on the phonology of  Swahili are offered to back up the critique. This approach to the vernacular avoids the problem of variability in judgment as to what is the vernacular. A second critique centers on Kachru's discussion of code-mixing. Instead of asking when there would be a new code, as Kachru does, the critique would ask when do we know we have a code in the first place. In addition to Kachru's call for a typology of constraints found across codes, the critique would add an appeal for a typology of constraints to distinguish code-mixing or switching in different multilingual communities.

Papers and authors addressing the background and present state of Quebec science education are as follows: &quot;Science Teaching at the Secondary Level: An Evaluation&quot; (Louis Ste-Marie); and &quot;Science Teaching: An Answer or a Question?&quot; (Marcel Risi). In addition, comments are offered by Graziella Levy concerning developments at the secondary and primary levels and by Alexander Liutec concerning the present and future situation of science education in the English sector. Future directions for science teaching in Quebec are addressed in &quot;What Sort of Scientific Education for What Sort of Society?&quot;  (Jacques Desautels). Graeme Welch also discusses the future directions for science education and suggests that science teachers must assume responsibility for reinforcing linguistic, mathematical, and cognitive skills development of students. Future directions in Quebec are also addressed by Germain Gauthier, who identifies some important characteristics of the social and educational environment in Quebec and outlines possible approaches to science education. The topic of popularization is discussed by Pierre Sormany with regard to the accuracy of scientific subject matter in popular texts and approaches to interest students in science. A concluding statement by Gilbert Lannoy summarizes the scope of the comments and papers presented in the symposium, and additional summaries are  presented of these presentations and of discussions. Appended materials include a symposium program and a paper, &quot;Science Teaching in Quebec. Why? For Whom?&quot; (Raymond Duchesne). (SW)",

        "description":"The relationship between high technology companies and educational institutions in northern Santa Clara County, California, a major center of technologically sophisticated industry, was studied. Attention was directed to the way that educational institutions in Silicon Valley are changing to meet the demands of a transforming technology. Over 100 interviews were conducted in 1981 with the officials from education, industry, and government, and documents were reviewed. It was found that public schools have been the least responsive and that elite institutions of higher education, especially Stanford University, have the most responsive to the demands of the high technology economy in Santa Clara Valley. Community colleges and four-year universities are making efforts to develop or  expand programs congruent with the needs of science-based local industry. These institutions are struggling to find the staffing and resources needed to establish and maintain the programs. Industry managers who were interviewed generally did not believe that an infusion of funds was necessary to upgrade and redirect the public school curricula. Executives were more willing to donate funds, personnel, and equipment to community colleges and universities because students were closer in age to starting employment and because funds could be easily targeted to specific programs. Rapidly developing industries like electronics have special characteristics that create strain for industry-education relations. Undergraduate student enrollments in engineering and computer science are growing in  Santa Clara Valley, but the current output of students from undergraduate and graduate programs is not keeping pace with the demands of rapidly growing industry.

        "description":"The relationship between high technology firms and educational institutions in the Boston metropolitan area was studied. Attention was focused on the responsiveness of public schools, community colleges, and four-year colleges and universities to the demands of the industry for technically trained personnel. The influence of companies on educational policies and the development of links between the two institutions were also explored. Information was gathered from: personal interviews with 130 officials from education, industry, and government; a survey of 158 secondary mathematics and science teachers at high schools on Route 128; reanalysis of a national survey of American high school seniors in 1980 commissioned by the National Center for Education Statistics; and review of  documents and reports. It was found that there is considerable interest on the part of students and school administrators at all levels of education in courses and programs of study that would lead to technical careers. However, the capacity of educational institutions to respond to student interest is limited by budgetary considerations. A shortage of staff and equipment exists in all programs. Industry support for the schools is concentrated mainly on baccalaureate and postgraduate degree programs. There are a few cases of mutually satisfying cooperation programs between the companies and other sectors of education; but, for the most part, school-industry ties are fragmentary, weak, and of short duration. It is concluded that despite new interest in industrial-education partnerships, it  is highly unlikely that corporations will be able to provide schools with the resources traditionally supplied by government funds. A bibliography is appended. (Author/SW)",

        "description":"The origins, situation, and performance of about 100 college teachers who received their doctorates in geography from 1 of 30 major U.S. universities were investigated. Quantitative and narrative information was obtained from the teachers, colleagues from their departments, and students and through site visits. Three main topics were studied regarding the origins of the new teachers: (1) the extent and rated value of various types of prior developmental experiences as teachers (e.g., teaching experience, education courses, teaching preparation programs); (2) the relationship between these prior experiences and subsequent performance as teachers; and (3) the sorting process (i.e., who went where and why). The situation of the new teachers was examined in relation to the following  variables: type of contract (tenure or nontenure track), work load, degree of identification with the institution, ability to find intellectual companionship with colleagues, and social similarity to students. Each of these variables was found to have an effect on both the performance and the professional satisfaction of the new teachers. In regard to new professors' performance, attention was directed to educational goals; teaching prototypes; teaching methods; and evaluations of their teaching by students and colleagues, and by themselves. Consideration is given to the new teachers' reactions to their first year's experiences, their other academic accomplishments, and their plans for the following year. Recommendations are offered for graduate departments, graduate students, departments  receiving new faculty members, and beginning college teachers. (Author/SW)",

        "description":"Rhode Island College's innovative program of baccalaureate education for registered nurses is described, and guidelines and materials used in the program are included. The federally funded project was designed to: identify the competencies the registered nurse (RN) applicant brings to the program and place the student accordingly; develop a flexible curriculum that can be individualized; and implement the program with 30 RN students each year. For the entering RN student with diploma or associate degree background, there are three parts for the junior-level nursing course: four written examinations, Clinical Performance Examination (CPE), and a written paper on a current nursing issue. The four written examinations concern care of the adult, care of the child, psychiatric mental  health, and maternal and infant care. The CPE is a 2-day practicum administered in the acute-care setting with an adult client. It is designed to test in the clinical setting the student's ability to meet junior-level objectives that cannot be fully evaluated through written or other methods. The CPE is outlined in terms of criteria for client selection, activities to be completed, and grade assignment. Supplementary materials include: forms for the CPE; guidelines for the placement process at the senior level; learning activities form; advanced placement process; and a paper presented at a 1981 nursing workshop entitled &quot;Adult Learning/Teaching: Implications for Curriculum.&quot; Appended materials include: a list of rules for effective adult learning; a list of behaviors as objectives of  graduate study in adult education; a list of programs of study for nursing majors; forms for attitudinal testing and evaluation by the student; and a glossary.

        "description":"The work and findings of the Southern Regional Education Board's Nursing Curriculum Project (NCP) for baccalaureate programs, which included faculty development programs for primary nursing care and clinical electives, are discussed. The historical background of primary care in the baccalaureate nursing program is traced, and characteristics of practice are defined for the baccalaureate and master's level. Four faculty development projects were established in the southern region to assist faculty learners to expand their concepts of primary care, view the commonalities of nursing practice as they vary with the setting for practice, and learn new methods necessary for practice in primary care. The four nursing programs were located at Emory University, Mississippi University For  Women, Texas Woman's University, and Virginia Commonwealth University/Medical College of Virginia. Each project employed the same general format: an initial, intensive 3-week didactic and clinical session on campus followed by a 9-month period during which each learner worked with a preceptor at home, was visited by the NCP director, and attended one or two seminars. A 3-week summer session was devoted to curriculum planning. Finally, to demonstrate the efficacy of electives for increasing the flexibility of a nursing curriculum and maintaining its relevance to changing health care practices, two southern schools were chosen as sites to develop electives: Dillard University in New Orleans and Hampton Institute in Tidewater, Virginia. The clinical elective provides students experience in  industry, schools, geriatrics, rehabilitation, community health agencies, and hospitals. (SW)",

In addition, an outline of issues facing postsecondary education in California is included. According to the commission, the master plan for higher education provides for differential functions among the three public segments of higher education: the community colleges, the state university and college system, and the University of California. The commission recommends that statewide institutional policies for the 1980's emphasize greater differentiation of functions with the three sectors  (including more specialized campus missions) and greater cooperation among institutions and sectors. The commission recommends that the California Postsecondary Education Commission and the State Scholarship Commission study the relationship between current federal funding for higher education and the fee structure and financing of public higher education in California, with a view toward increasing California's share of federal education funds without placing an added burden upon lower and middle income students. The commission finds that the present concept of a state-local partnership for funding for community colleges is basically sound and recommends a mixed basis of funding for community colleges in which the state provides the major portion of funding as opposed to full state  assumption of financing. Proposition 13 and the following postsecondary education issues are outlined: the problems of community college finance, adult education, student charges, and equity dilemmas in funding among the segments of postsecondary education.

        "description":"A plan for reducing or consolidating institutions and programs of the University of Wisconsin (UW) is presented, based on a request by Wisconsin Governor Patrick J. Lucey in 1975. The Governor's basic fiscal and enrollment assumptions are identified, and the findings and recommendations of the UW system President John Weaver are presented. Part 1 of the report considers the implications of enrollment forecasts, educational opportunity, campus sizes and missions, program offerings and evolving societal needs, in relation to quality and cost. Part 2 addresses directly the request of the President to the Board of Regents for a statement of current planning assumptions, procedures, and directions. Finally, part 3 responds directly to the Governor's directive, in presenting criteria,  procedures, and legislative language by which the State could, if it deems such action to be in the public interest, take immediate steps to initiate reduction in the scope and size of the university system. Conclusions include the following: unless artificial limits are placed on enrollments, enrollments in the university system will increase for the next 5 years; reducing significantly the scope of the UW system over the next decade will reduce access to educational opportunity for some people; and cutting the number of institutions or programs without reducing the numbers of students, faculty, and staff will not yield significant savings. A summary table is presented that outlines decisions and actions that would follow from proceeding with planning directions currently established or  proposed versus reducing the scope of the UW system. Appended materials include data on campus finances and letters pertaining to the public policy regarding the UW system. (SW)",

UNED is helping to equalize geographical inequalities of access to higher education. Overall, UNED's academic programs have been aimed at those who want to obtain professional qualifications. In the first semester 1979, 75.4 percent of UNED's employed students came from the professional, administrative, and managerial classes. Data suggest that UNED is not providing increased educational opportunities for the economically deprived. Although the direct cost of studying at UNED is less than that of the other universities, the lack of grants available to UNED students effectively bars the poorer members of society from pursuing a degree course with  the university. The university initially concentrated on the development of a series of professionally oriented degree and diploma programs and also developed extension studies programs and a free studies program. More recently, UNED has begun to develop a secondary school (bachillerato) program that will entail distance education. Information is also provided on: the course structure, media and methods, course design, student support services, student evaluation, quality of teaching materials, student attrition, UNED's organizational and governance structure, costs, and school and higher education systems in Costa Rica. The country's physical setting, population and economy, communications, and people are described. (SW)",

        "description":"The hypothesis that conventional approaches to evaluating contaminants in performance appraisal overlook important individual ratee effects was examined. A rating form was developed that consisted of the following dimensions and behaviors: warmth; guided discourse or indirect teaching methods; control of subject matter; enthusiasm and reinforcing; organizing and managing; presenting and explaining; evaluating; and advising and counseling. Administration of the form to evaluate 23 instructors resulted in approximately 1,500 observations per semester. The reliability of the form and its factor stability were assessed, and possible contaminants were checked to assure that the evaluations were more likely to result from the instructor's performance than from student or course  factors. It was found that 8.6 percent of the instructor ratees had persistent and significant contaminants associated with their evaluations; a looser definition of \"persistent\" pushes the figure to 34.7 percent. It is suggested that the evaluations may not be assessing performance accurately because of ratee contaminants, including expected grade in the course, the time at which the course begins, the time and effort required of the student, and the student's major. These contaminants occurred in spite of the fact that the instrument was found to have face validity, factor stability, and internal consistency. It is proposed that adjustments could be made on an individual basis and only for those contaminants that are persistent for each instructor. However, what is needed is a practical  decision rule that would permit users of such evaluations to make necessary adjustments in the appraisals to correct for such persistent effects. Interactions among contaminants should also be addressed. (SW)",

After a review of the national statistics and projections of future enrollment trends, attention is directed to the campus level and the dimensions of current enrollment problems. Based on a 1981 national survey of college presidents and admissions directors, the following issues are considered: how campus presidents view their respective institution's ability to tolerate the expected difficulties ahead; the dimensions of the enrollment problem for individual campuses; and institutional finances in light of anticipated cuts in government support. Institutional response to enrollment problems include enrollment management  and information systems, marketing, and student recruitment practices. Research on student attrition has revealed the following negative financial and programmatic consequences for the institution: direct loss of revenue, recruitment and image costs, and undermining of the diversity of the curriculum. Policy areas that should be addressed by campuses facing enrollment problems include: planning strategies, including cost studies, enrollment forecasts, and program review; shared decision-making between the faculty and the administration; staffing and personnel policies; and the revitalization of student life and the linkage of faculty and student affairs personnel. The activities of eight liberal arts colleges that are reducing attrition rates by direct action and cooperative effort are  also reviewed. A bibliography is appended. (SW)",

After a review of implications of recent learning theories, it is concluded that theorists agree generally that: learning is enhanced when the student is active rather than passive; learning is improved by practice and feedback; learning is improved when directed toward some goal; learning has both an affective and a cognitive aspect; and the quantitative and qualitative differences in the learning process are great. Attention is also directed to the following issues related to improving instruction: models of teaching, characteristics of good teaching, teaching awards, faculty development programs, programs for teaching assistants, cooperation among institutions, interest of professional associations,  faculty growth contracts, evaluation of faculty by others, and the relationship between teaching and research. Another important concern is that the prospects for improved instruction are linked to faculty attitudes toward teaching, students, the institution, and change. Studies pertaining to methods of instruction are also reviewed. Methods emphasizing content include the lecture, the lesson method, audiovisual instruction, computer instruction, audio-tutorial instruction, the personalized system of instruction, and mastery learning. Methods focusing on students include tutorial instruction, independent study, learning contracts, experiential learning, and student-generated courses, while methods characterized by interaction include discussion, seminar, case study, role playing, games  and simulations, and encounter groups. Research on improving instruction is also reviewed, and a bibliography is appended. (SW)",

The survey also asked about such financial aspects as operating costs, indebtedness, and replacement value. Among the highlights are these: two-thirds provided residential facilities in fall 1980; private institutions housed a larger proportion of full-time students than public institutions; occupancy rates were high at each institution type, and universities exceeded slightly the facilities' design capacity; 1 percent of students in institutionally  controlled housing were in substandard quarters; the average monthly single student charge in fall 1980 was $108 at private institutions and $97 at public institutions, with charges for married students 60 and 54 percent higher, respectively; over 2,000 institutions with housing facilities spent $2.6 billion of current funds on such facilities in fiscal year 1981; and operations and maintenance expenditures amounted to $1.1 billion in fiscal year 1981, about two-fifths for utilities.

        "description":"Salary equity issues in higher education are examined with reference to sex discrimination in faculty salaries, the law and its application, judicial deference toward higher education, and the nature of salary equity evidence. The basis for most salary equity studies has been the simple observation that salaries of male professors are generally higher than those of female professors, even within the same academic rank. Information is presented on salaries for male and female professors for the 1981-82 academic year. Similar relationships exist for all academic ranks in both public and private institutions. Two pieces of legislation, the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, provide the primary basis for current salary equity studies and legal  proceedings. In any legal action, an aggrieved faculty member may choose to make the claim as an individual or as a representative member of an injured class, such as all women faculty. Even if a plaintiff demonstrates that one academic position requires about the same skills, effort, and responsibility as another and that a salary differential exists between the individuals who occupy the two positions, the plaintiff's case still fails legally if the salary differential is attributable to a seniority system, a bona fide merit system, differences in the quantity or quality of work, or factors other than sex. The school is likely to use faculty evaluation data to defend its claim that observed salary differentials are appropriate. Three major methods that have been employed in the courts  to examine salary equity are job evaluation, pairwise comparisons, and multiple regression. (SW)",

        "description":"In order to provide detailed descriptions of instructors' activities in courses taught by individualized instruction and to identify some of the factors responsible for variations in those activities, records were made of instructor behavior in two computer-managed Navy courses. Within each course, jobs differed considerably in kinds and patterns of activities and total demands on the instructor. Most of the specialized jobs in one course had nominal parallels in the other, but the activities observed in these parallel jobs were quite different. Most instructors spent the major part of their time in brief, relatively routine interactions; complex tutorial interactions were rare. Findings suggest that differences in course design affect demands on the instructor and that  systematic tradeoffs have not always been made between such demands and training effectiveness. It is recommended that a single set of student-instructor ratios not be used to compute instructor authorizations for all such courses and that instructor training courses avoid creating unrealistic expectations of actual job performance. Since instructor roles vary so widely, considerable caution should be exercised in selecting a common core curriculum for such courses. (Author/LMM)",

By collaboration with an investigative news team, the researchers learned in advance of the subject and air time of an \"NBC News Magazine\" segment investigating fraud and abuse in federal home health care programs. The study was aimed at discovering if this program influenced the public policy agenda by making such fraud and abuse in health care more important, causing a shift in priorities. Results indicate that media presentations do influence general judgments of problem importance among the public. The presentation influenced governmental policy makers but not interest group elites by  altering their perception of the issue's importance, their belief that policy action was necessary, and their perception of the public's view of issue importance. Although the program was found to have an impact on policy, it was not the actual airing of the program or resulting public pressure on legislative representatives which created the policy outcome, but rather the active collaboration between journalists and policy makers in the ongoing process of the media investigation.

A preliminary walk-through survey was conducted in November 1979, followed by an additional four-phase, in-depth investigation in 1980, which used (1) radiation measurements; (2) industrial hygiene sampling; (3) a survey of health complaints and psychological mood states; and (4) ergonomics and human factors measurements. The radiation surveys indicated exposure well below current occupational exposure standards. Air samples showed no  hazardous chemical exposures. A questionnaire survey indicated that a higher percentage of VDT operators reported more visual complaints at two of the three sites, more muscular complaints at one site, and more emotional complaints at all sites. Ergonomic evaluation indicated measured illumination levels at VDT workstations were generally acceptable, although problems of glare and physical dimensions of the workstations were sometimes noted. The report of this study provides detailed explanations of methodologies, tabulated results, general recommendations, and a 3-page reference list. Author/LMM)",

Questions of television's impact on viewer functioning are addressed for the general reader, for the purpose of elucidating research findings and their implications for public health and future research. The focus of this report is on public health generally, not just on children and adolescents. Issues discussed include cognitive and emotional aspects of television viewing, television and violence, television as it relates to socialization and viewer's conceptions of social reality, television's influences on physical and mental health, and television as an American institution. Literature reviews commissioned on specific topics from 24 researchers are  integrated and assessed. A list of these papers and their authors is provided in appendix B. This volume and its companion offer an update and elaboration of information presented in the 1972 Surgeon General's Advisory Committee on Television and Behavior which assessed the effects of televised violence on children and youth and called for research on the relationship of television to the psychological growth and development of children.

        "description":"An innovative educational medium--screenprinted visual aids on cloth--is one alternative to conventional media in Africa, where visual materials are important communication tools but conventional media and materials are often scarce. A production process for cloth visual aids was developed and evaluated in Ghana and Sudan through the implementation of several experimental projects. Unlike paper and electric/electronic visual media, cloth is familiar and can be locally produced with unskilled labor. Results indicate a preference for this type of cloth-based visual aid over conventional paper ones, and printing was found to be economically feasible if done on a mass-production basis. Since 1972, economic and political stability in Ghana have deteriorated, producing a more urgent  need for locally developed products. A feasibility study conducted in 1980 found cloth in short supply but need for visual materials large; however, for educational purposes, a supply of cloth could be provided. In Sudan, the development of textile visual aids is more advanced, with all materials needed locally available. The approach is significant in that, instead of transplanting a Western communications medium, the strategy takes advantage of local materials and resources. (LMM)",

During the first year of the project, sets of 26 lessons each were designed for first and second levels of English as a Second Language (ESL) classes and seventh and eighth grade social studies and life skills classes. Materials were written in BASIC programming language for use with a TRS-80 II computer and video screen. First-year evaluation results, based on data collected through site visits, interviews, and project office records, indicate that CASETS was successfully implemented as  proposed during the 1980-81 school year. The desired English language proficiency criterion was achieved, and surveys of parents, students, and teachers indicated a strong positive attitude toward the project and computer assisted instruction (CAI). Additional capabilities of the project were planned for implementation during the 1982-83 school year. The project includes a training component for educators and administrators and for CASETS project staff. A glossary of CAI-related terms is attached. (LMM)",

The first by Marcella Pitts and E. Joseph Schneider provides an overview of the educational technology movement and discusses current use of and interest in technology in schools. The paper distinguishes differences between educational technology and technological gadgetry, cautioning against indiscriminate use of technological hardware without instructional expertise. The second paper by Alan M. Lesgold focuses on ways basic instructional principles derived from education and psychology can be applied to computer-based instruction. Three  seminar themes are highlighted in the third paper by Richard E. Schutz: (1) the capability for CEDaR member institutions to advance educational technology and school improvement through programmatic research and development; (2) the possibility for CEDaR institutions to combine their expertise to explore instructional applications of technology; and (3) the problems of injudicious application of technology to educational problems. The final paper presents the views of a panel of experts, who comment on the services that research and development organizations can provide to schools and make specific recommendations about technology-related research issues. Each paper begins with a short summary, and references are listed for the first and third papers. (LMM)",

The framework also provides a performance measure for use in assessing alternative designs and cognitive effort. Properties of displays--features, dimensions, and configurations--that can be mentally represented and serve as a basis for response are also discussed, as well as the strategy used to determine which display property is actually being represented and a processing justification for its use. An experiment is then described in detail which used a speeded classification task to test  whether any of the display properties discussed were actually the encoding features and to assess the degree of interference in two univariate and two orthogonal conditions. It was found that, if the display format was not compatible with the information to be presented, classification errors increased, which in turn would increase the likelihood of miscommunication at higher levels of processing.

        "description":"Eight established methodologies were evaluated and compared in this preliminary study, which was conducted to resolve methodological questions and problems and develop an adequate approach for the collection of valid, generalizable data for an extensive study of family use of television. The study focused on four variables: which family members watch television, what else they do while watching, who talks to whom while watching, and the content of family verbal interactions while watching. Twelve families who volunteered to serve as subjects for a pilot study completed questionnaires and then participated in additional selected phases of the study. These data were used to make final refinements in the procedures and instruments for the methodological study that was initiated in  March 1980. Of the 260 families contacted by letter and/or telephone call, 53 completed questionnaires; 9 participated in telephone interviews; 8 completed diaries; 20 were interviewed in person; 4 were videotaped; 5 were audiotaped; 4 were observed by experimenters; and 4 were observed by family members. Comparisons of the data provided by and family reactions to the various approaches led to the tentative conclusion that the telephone interview combined with a questionnaire is the best methodological approach to developing a descriptive database on families' use of television. The questionnaire, interview form, observation form, telephone interview protocol, and extensive statistical results are appended. (LMM)",

Each model is evaluated in terms of its acceptance by personnel; validity of its objectives for the program; start-up costs; and resources required for implementation and long-term success. Examples are provided of community college allied health programs using these organizational structures, and the advantages and disadvantages of each model are  set forth. Administrative issues in planning for reorganization are noted, including what functions are to be centralized, where they can be put in operation, and who will manage these functions. College operations best accomplished through centralized and collegial or shared-power structures are identified, and the issue of the policy-making role of allied health professionals is explored. Finally, suggestions for implementing a reorganization are provided, stressing the importance of specifying objectives, centralizing appropriate functions, involving staff in decision making, effecting changes slowly, and seeking a variety of viewpoints.

        "description":"A project was undertaken by the Iowa Valley Community College District (IVCCD) to provide information and instruction via cable television to persons eligible for Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) programs. The project sought to identify and enroll at least 15 CETA-eligible persons in each of 3 programs; &quot;TV High School,&quot; designed to prepare viewers to take the General Educational Development high school equivalency exam; &quot;Voyage: Challenge and Change in Career/Life Planning,&quot; which emphasized the value of planning and personal responsibility; and &quot;Food Stuff: Nutrition for the Family,&quot; a program providing advice on budgeting and food selection and preparation. The project report provides information on the contributions of cable television to education; project  objectives; personnel; the three television programs; scheduling constraints; program promotion and participant recruitment; enrollments; and a student progress assessment, which used a telephone survey to determine participants' progress in changing employment status. Extensive appendices provide a detailed report on the &quot;Voyage&quot; course; newsletters providing information on diet, nutrition, and meal planning distributed free of charge to enrollees in the &quot;Food Stuff&quot; course; a list of agencies highlighted in 3- to 5-minute information segments on services eligible to CETA-eligible persons that were also used in the project; survey forms and results; and a schedule of television classes.

Lamar Johnson reviews the findings of the 1952 California Study of General Education and discusses their current applicability. Next, K. Patricia Cross reviews trends in general education from the 1950s to the 1980s. After Melvin Barlow explores the connections between general and vocational education, Suanne D. Roueche and John E. Roueche discuss the place of literacy development in general education and offer recommendations for the systematic development of community college curricula. Next, the characteristics and genesis of community general education are described by Ervin L. Harlacher, Maxwell C. King and Seymour C.  Fersh describe Brevard Community College's (Florida) international/intercultural education programs. After obstacles to general education in society and in the institution are identified by Terry O'Banion and Ruth G. Shaw, Judith S. Eaton identifies challenges and options facing community colleges wishing to promote general education. Advice on revising the general education program, based on experiences at Miami-Dade Community College (Florida), is offered by Jeffrey D. Lukenbill and Robert H. McCabe. Then, Leslie Koltai considers the decline of transfer education and recommends strategies for its revitalization. Finally, James C. Palmer cites ERIC documents and journal articles dealing with general education. (KL)",

The present study assesses the psychometric characteristics and utility of the AML, a teacher rating scale employed in a rural region. The 11-item teacher scale yields 4 scores: acting-out/aggressive, moody, learning, and total. A sample of 575 school children in 21 first- through third-grade classrooms across 3 southern Appalachian counties were rated by their teachers. Results indicate that, for this sample, the scale appears to have substantial reliability and validity features, as well as potential utility as a screening device for early detection of school maladaptation.

In a group of 96 children observed in preschool at age 4 1/2, 31 compliant and 22 extremely noncompliant children were identified and compared on a wide range of earlier and concurrent measures. In general, results highlight the importance of a warm, secure, supportive relationship between caregiver and child, within the context of a stimulating but organized learning environment at home, for fostering the child's compliance in preschool. Concurrent measures showed that compliant children also had better ego control, displaying fewer negative  emotions and more positive affect in preschool than did noncompliant children. Among noncompliant children considerable variability existed on these measures. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"Traditional perspectives on children's fears and anxiety neither provide satisfying answers to fundamental and important questions nor provide paths to effective clinical intervention. Recently, investigators assessing and treating phobic children by means of active, multi-layered, coping-oriented, temporally extended, and child-centered methods have tended to achieve better results than those who aim at quickly eliminating fear with minimal parent or caretaker collaborative involvement. Although little research has been conducted on very young children who are extremely fearful, the body of literature dealing with observational learning as a treatment for anxious and avoidant patterns is impressive. It appears that disinhibition, new learning, the establishment of positive  outcome expectancies, response facilitation, and heightened responsivity to environmental stimuli can result from children's simply observing other children acting successfully in phobic situations. Investigators have also begun to explore anxiety-related thoughts and images, as well as self-regulatory processes in the acquisition, maintenance, and modification of children's fears. Studies that use cognitive-behavioral treatment packages involving both fearful children and their parents represent important steps toward the expansion of clinical fear paradigms. While these approaches are promising, critical issues remain to be addressed, including the improvement of research designs testing effects of clinical interventions and consideration of risks and limitations of self-instructional  and related mediational interventions.

The focus of the report is on (1) the child and those features of the child's environment which affect his or her progress to adulthood and (2) those aspects of the family which pertain to its function as a childrearing environment. After the executive summary provided in section 1, the report specifies the problem, reviews the primary data  sets currently in existence, and presents several principles that should guide improvement efforts. Section 3 organizes the wide range of needed child and family indicators into a classification scheme permitting systematic assessment of how well existing data and indicator series meet the needs in each major subject area. To illustrate the kind of analysis required in every indicator area, section 4 presents five subcategories for more detailed examination. Section 5 presents recommendations, specifying actions necessary to support an effective indicator development strategy. (RH)",

Discussions are followed by multiple-choice skill-building exercises which describe realistic situations including toddlers, provide alternative ways of handling each situation, and give feedback on the  choices made. &quot;Preview&quot; and &quot;postview&quot; exercises are provided for self-evaluation.

Good record keeping is especially important in a center that provides &quot;drop-in&quot; or occasional care because income may fluctuate greatly as a result of the variable number of children using the center. This guidebook for effective record keeping, one in a series on the subject of military child care centers, is based on the experience and actual operating procedures of the program at Fort Lewis, Washington. It is hoped that the system for record keeping, as well as the financial planning and management techniques explained in this guide, will provide the center's director with answers to the following basic  questions: How can I plan a financially sound child care center? How should I budget when income from parent fees controls center expenditures? How should I establish fees and charges that will provide adequate income but not be more than parents can afford? How can I control major expenses so that the center is not wasting its limited funds? On a daily basis, what kinds of records should I keep in order to monitor income and expenditures? and, finally, How can I tell, before it is too late, that the center's expenses are exceeding its income?

A brief summary of empirical evidence bearing on both issues is presented. Next, research is reviewed which is devoted to the development of measurement devices for assessment of temperamental characteristics in infants, toddlers, preschool and elementary children, middle-school children, and adults. Finally, a selected review of current research examining the effects of temperamental  differences on such areas as the development of psychopathology, school adjustment, intelligence, and academic achievement are summarized and discussed.

Eleven fathers, recruited from announcements distributed by community organizations serving a Boston neighborhood, participated in the program. A &quot;non-equivalent&quot; control group, similarly recruited, was also utilized. The program consisted of eight weekly 3-hour sessions focusing on attending, responding to content, responding to feelings, self-awareness, genuineness, and acceptance. Program effects were assessed in three areas: (1) the fathers' communication skills, (2) the children's perceptions of their relationships with their fathers, and (3) family systemic effects such as parents' satisfaction with their families and the congruence of mothers' and fathers' family  concepts. Fathers, their wives, and one of their children were given pretests and posttests on the dependent measures. The program was found to result in an improvement in fathers' communication skills--specifically, a significant increase in their overall sensitivity, a significant reduction in their use of undesirable responses, a trend toward increased use of desirable responses, and a trend toward increased acceptance of their children's expression of feelings. Significantly more experimental than control group children perceived positive changes in their relationships with their fathers. An assessment of the family concepts of mothers and fathers indicated that fathers changed their views of the ideal family. (Author/RH)",

Three types of stability were considered: stability of individual scores, stability of group means, and test-retest correlations. Individual scores demonstrated considerable changes. No set of scores for any ABIC scale fell within one standard error of measurement in 68 percent of the cases.

One group was provided with social comparative information indicating the average number of problems solved by other children. A second group worked under conditions involving a goal of completing a given number of problems. A third group received both treatments, and a fourth group received neither treatment. Results yielded a significant main effect on perceived efficacy due to proximal goals. Children who received both  goals and comparative information demonstrated the highest level of division skill.

        "description":"The literature on children's acquisition of sex-typed knowledge, preference, and behavior is reviewed, and a matrix of sex-typing constructs and sex-typed content areas is offered. Two major themes are discussed. The first theme concerns the importance of activities, interests, and peer associations in the early acquisition of sex-typing constructs. It is argued that children learn sex-typed play activities, occupational stereotypes, family roles, and interests earlier than they learn about sex-typed personality traits and social behaviors. It is further suggested that while the latter have been emphasized as the core of sex typing, more attention should be paid to activities and interests and to sex segregation of peer groups. The second theme concerns the importance of  cognitions and concepts about sex typing in the process of learning about gender. It is argued that, contrary to a premise of cognitive developmental theory, identifying cognitions and concepts about sex typing is not in itself sufficient for understanding the process of sex typing or for generating interventions. The suggestion is made that many people have been too quick to assume that changes in cognitions produce changes in identity, preferences, and behavior. In conclusion, researchers are urged to take the multidimensionality of sex typing seriously and to include multiple measures of multiple constructs and/or content areas in their studies.

        "description":"A unique psychometric device, The &quot;Lock Box,&quot; has been developed to measure the ability of preschool children to structure a novel problematic situation. The primary purpose of the box is to identify those preschoolers with mental ages ranging from 2 1/2 to 6 years who have difficulty imposing an orderly plan on their explorations and whose movements are random, repetitive, and without apparent goal direction. The box can also be used to identify children with perceptual-motor dysfunctions. Differing from most traditional tests which focus on the product of learning, this device emphasizes the process of learning, is language-free, and utilizes three-dimensional, highly appealing, and lifelike materials. As its name suggests, the box is a large container. Each of 10 compartments  within the box contains a different toy and can be closed with a different lock. In administering the measure, the examiner codes the spontaneous moves of the child for 6 1/2 minutes. Five major scores are derived from the performance: total adaptive moves, total non-adaptive moves, number of latches unlocked, organization of moves, and aimless actions. (Rules for administering, coding, and scoring the measure and for constructing age-referenced profiles are indicated). (RH)",

        "description":"A framework for conceptualizing young children's theoretical and task-related strategies in everyday situations is presented in this Head Start final report. The first section of the report discusses the concept of strategies, reviews relevant literature, and presents a theoretical model of the organization of strategic behavior. The second section describes the Children's Strategies Assessment System (CSAS), a tool for assessing young children's competence in social interactions and in material tasks. The CSAS is largely based on Bronson's (1974, 1982) concept of &quot;executive skill&quot; and on her classroom observation measure, the Executive Skill Profile for Preschool and Primary School Children. The CSAS also extends the social and mastery strategies of Bronson's work, integrating  these within a unifying theoretical base and including strategies which have negative as well as positive effects. In the third section of the report, a brief account is given of the evolution of the Animal Stalls task (AST) in its first, second, and current versions. The AST is a block construction task, utilizing familiar materials and an unfamiliar problem, which can be adapted to different ages. In the fourth section, the analysis of pilot test data gathered from over 100 children is presented and discussed, and directions for future research are specified. Related materials, including a copy of the CSAS, are appended. (RH)",

The state of the art in development education through mass media techniques was discussed during the 2-day meeting. Major concerns of participants were focused in two areas: the need for sharper distinctions between fund-raising and education efforts and the need for increased coverage of development progress and problems by the news media. A third issue addressed the need for Agency for International Development (AID) and the  PVOs to develop a communications policy and set of objectives and procedures. Additionally, sessions dealt with public education, reporting about the Third World, World Food Day, collaborative efforts in development education, media approaches, AID education activities, and advisory committee business. The eight appendices include: a list of participants; a discussion of development education as an integral component of a PVO; a list of development education project grants; and the charter of the ACVFA.

A brief overview of the state of the art of the ca/n field and the SS/S population discusses child abuse systems and their problems, dynamics of child abuse in the Latino community, family dynamics/family stress, role of the court and protective services, alternative models/bilingual-bicultural resources, demographic profile of the Latino population regarding child abuse risk, and multiple high  risk factors faced by SS/S people (e.g., health, emotional, intellectual, and cultural hazards). Among 25 specific recommendations on how ca/n systems can become more responsive to SS/S people are: that a network of bilingual/bicultural referral services be established, advocated for, and sponsored by the state and county ca/n service network and that alternative responses be considered, e.g., bilingual/bicultural manpower resources, family oriented crisis intervention services, and parents as resources.

A 54-item, 6-part questionnaire consisting of 42 rating and 12 essay questions measured the reactions of 38 trainees (18 from social work and nursing, 20 from psychology and psychiatry) to their didactic and practicum experiences. Trainees rated each of the 39 seminars on a scale of 1 to 4 in terms of usefulness.  Seminar topics were grouped into three areas: clinical skills; mental health information; and social, cultural, and organizational issues. Rating scales were also used to measure reactions to participation in case conferences and field practicum experiences involving direct patient contact. Essay questions solicited suggestions for program modifications. Findings indicated that the seminars were considered useful by all trainees, although the social work and nursing students were somewhat more positive about the seminars, and that psychology interns and psychiatry residents ranked practicum experiences higher in terms of interchangability of professional skills.

A follow-up survey of the migrating portion of the sample takes a closer look at their expectations, perceived benefits, and costs of moving. Using occupation, earnings, and place of work as career attainment measures, the study shows that the young adults were successful in their movement into responsible positions. Among the findings, when compared to a 1970 study of young adults 25-35 within the U.S., were that: relatively high proportions of both men and women entered professional occupations;  substantial proportions of the men had blue collar jobs; and employed men's salaries were slightly lower and women's salaries slightly higher than the U.S. averages. Additionally, findings reveal that: rural areas provided jobs for roughly four-fifths of the men and two-thirds of the women; two-thirds of both sexes had some college training; respondents had not experienced desired amounts of satisfaction from their jobs at the higher need levels; and geographic mobility generally fulfilled migrants' expectations.

Communities were classified by three locational groupings and differentiated by size. The study was limited to 3,564 persons residing in places of under 50,000 people. Findings associated with the 23 community attributes were presented by 7 broad topical areas: public facilities and services, health, housing, social/environmental concerns, recreation and cultural  opportunities, economic development, and government-citizen relations. Although some modifications were apparent, the statistically significant relationships for the assessment were generally the same when personal characteristics were used as a control. Additionally, findings demonstrate continued use of a single residency classification for carrying out research on subjective assessments of quality of life attributes is inadequate. Size of place and ecological milieu should be considered simultaneously given that both account for a significant amount of the variation in residents' appraisals of adequacy of local attributes, even when important characteristics of residents are controlled.

A wide range of state and local efforts were examined, i.e., small business assistance programs, innovative developmental finance institutions, industrial parks built by local development corporations, state programs that provide technical assistance to local development, and many others. The projects presented offer a diverse and representative sample of locally initiated economic development efforts currently under way in smaller cities and rural areas.  Chapter 1 of the report presents the study's overall approach to economic development in smaller cities and rural areas. Chapter 2 analyzes the three local economic development strategies that were identified through the field work and discusses characteristics of local organizations that have initiated these strategies. Chapter 3 covers state support for local economic development.

        "description":"The study examines the issue of wife abuse in a rural area, assesses major service interventions suggested by the literature, and evaluates their practicality in rural areas. The area used for the study was the 10 rural and most southern counties in Southern Illinois, characterized by high unemployment and low per capita income. A questionnaire was administered via one-on-one interviews of 14 women (new residents of the only women's shelter in the area who identified themselves as abused and in need of help). Additionally, personal interviews were conducted with 21 service providers who might work with abused wives not served by the shelter. Results indicated that the abused women surveyed were generally similar to those in urban studies, except that rural husbands were in a  higher tax bracket and had more education and that rural wives were older (averaged 36+ years). Other characteristics included: 58% were Protestant; alcohol played a part in 64% of incidences; 93% of the abusers were abused as children; and 43% of children in the households were abused, too. Service providers surveyed indicated: more federal rural health clinic physicians than family physicians attempted referral; law officers and judges were lacking in knowledge concerning domestic violence; and few women openly sought help.

Although very small districts are largely ignored in the literature, the 19 very small districts represent 21% of New Mexico's school districts. Data were obtained from a questionnaire sent to the superintendents, from a meeting of representatives from 10 of the smallest districts, and from information from the public school finance division and the  state department of education. The four primary concerns of the school districts were: certification, multiple endorsement, and staff development; adequate instructional programs and student services; salary comparability; and housing and community resources. There are some things that can be done (some examples are given) within individual districts, among districts, and in conjunction with nearby postsecondary schools to alleviate many of the problems. The encouragement and leadership of state regulatory and funding agencies, the Legislature, and state professional organizations are also needed. (BRR)",

Reports included in this document were submitted from Australia, Canada, Dominican Republic, England and Wales, India, Ireland, Israel, New Zealand, and the United States. Points considered in the reports include the general interest in the topic in each country, research concerns (variables other than sex examined, theoretical frameworks of the research, activities resulting from the research such as programs to increase females' achievement/interest), discussions/developments on the topic, and situations unique to each country. Highlighting information received,  it appears that: (1) in most countries the topic is not a central subject of empirical research, although there are some indications that as interest arises, its importance is recognized and leads to research; (2) the United States, followed by England/Wales, is far ahead of other countries in research on mathematics and gender; and (3) that different research strategies are used to understand sex-related achievement differences as explained by sex role perceptions, personality traits, and differentiated interaction processes.

The effects of evaluative stress on high and low mathematically anxious subjects was examined, and preliminary effort was made to investigate possible relationships between anxiety and sex-typed versus androgynous sex-role identification. A total of 20 male and 20 female subjects were selected from a pool of 101 undergraduates pretested on the Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale (MARS) and the Bem Sex-Role Inventory (BEM). The data generated seemed to corroborate many previous research findings regarding mathematics anxiety and offer new implications with respect to its  distinctiveness. Among the results, it is noted that sex-role typing did not emerge as a significant contributing variable to the prevalence or distribution of anxiety. Results also suggested that mathematics anxiety differs from test anxiety in its being less affected by evaluative and/or reassuring instructions. Implications for treatment suggested by the analysis are presented. (MP)",

Half used Developing Mathematical Processes (DMP); the remaining used standard textbooks. Results showed DMP students performed significantly better than non-DMP pupils on the first two parts of the problem-solving instrument, with no significant differences on the third part. Among other results, no significant sex-related differences were found. Data for part one was collected during the fourth month  of the 1975-76 school year. Part two was conducted during the seventh month only with the DMP classes, in an attempt to determine direction of effects between teacher attitudes and student attitudes and performance. It is noted that initial teacher attitude seemed to have a greater effect on final student attitude than initial student attitude had on final teacher attitude. (MP)",

Results indicate that: (1) students are three to four times as likely to be especially attentive when rules are broken by the teacher as when they are being followed; (2) most of the time the scientific meanings being taught are expressed implicitly, not explicitly in the classroom dialogue; and (3) social beliefs about science and learning artificially limit classroom dialogue in ways which make it more difficult for most students to learn science.

The studies and summaries reviewed for this document include those which: (1) sought to identify a cluster of teaching strategies and behaviors which are positively related to student achievement and affective outcomes; (2) compared a specific instructional approach to one or more approaches; and (3) looked at the relative efficacy of different organization/scheduling arrangements for conducting mathematics and/or science instruction with intermediate level students. Forty-four documents were reviewed during this investigation. The bulk of this manuscript consists of individual item reports on these  reviewed documents. Four major hypotheses emerged from the examination: (1) instruction which features active, hands-on experiences has a positive effect on the mathematics and science achievement of intermediate level students and enhances the attitudes of these students toward the subject matter; and (2) the instructional approaches known as direct instruction and mastery learning are more effective than other approaches in promoting the mathematics and science achievement and retention of intermediate pupils, and also foster positive student attitudes; (3) individualized intermediate level mathematics and science instruction confers greater achievement and retention benefits than does instruction with no individualization; and (4) no one organization/grouping pattern is inherently  superior to others for instructing intermediate students in science and mathematics.

Two earlier surveys (1964 and 1970) had been conducted by ILAR at the request of NIH. Since these reports were published, many changes have taken place and much information in the first two surveys is no longer relevant. This survey was aimed at collecting and analyzing data on the current status of, unfilled needs in, and future requirements for research animals, animal resource personnel, facilities, and programs throughout the United States during FY 1978. Survey questionnaires were distributed to 2,637 known users of laboratory animals in the  United States, and 1,902 (72 percent) were returned. Separate sections of the report are devoted to the following topics: dimensions of survey population, animal use and sources, facility administration and personnel, facilities and equipment, costs of animal care, and appendix (the survey questionnaire). Each of these sections has two parts: current status, and comments and projections. In selected areas, comparisons are made between data derived from the FY 1968 and 1978 surveys. (Author/JN)",

        "description":"A study investigated the influence of sex on perceived credibility. It was predicted that males would have more credibility than females, and that males and females would respond differently to the question of having more credibility if they were of the opposite sex. A series of research questions concerning both the similarity of sex of the stimulus and the receiver and the influence of the sex of the interviewer on the subject were posed; and the variables of competence, trustworthiness, dynamism, and coorientation were examined. Subjects were 145 men and 160 women randomly selected from the local telephone directory of a midwestern university town. Each subject was interviewed by phone by a male or female interviewer. The results indicated that (1) men were perceived to have  more credibility than women; (2) men felt they would have less credibility if they were women, and women felt they would have more credibility if they were men; (3) subjects responding to female interviewers selected males as being more credible at a significantly higher level than they selected females; (4) men were perceived to be more competent than women, but women were perceived to be more trustworthy than men; (5) men were perceived to be higher in dynamism than women, but women were perceived to be higher in coorientation than men; and (6) both men and women perceived that they would have more credibility with persons of the same sex than with persons of the opposite sex.

        "description":"The most appropriate vehicle for examining the role of language in producing sex role stereotypes and sexism is Kenneth Burke's concept of the terministic screen, a definition of reality that directs the attention of the audience along a certain line of thought. Thus, once a linguistic term is accepted as reflecting reality, the term influences the selection and deflection of future observations. Burke's theory of dialectics provides a corollary to this discussion, treating ideas and action as paired or polar terms that can be viewed as being discontinuous, separated by different interpretations of a sitatuion. Transcendence allows discontinuous terms to be synthesized by a common term that dissolves the discontinuity into a new unity. The melding of both these concepts provides  the rhetorical underpinnings for a theory of how language can affect behavior and attitudes viewed from this perspective: sexist language causes sexism by acting as a discontinuous, terministic screen. The problems caused by sexist language can be transcended by a nonsexist language. Unfortunately, such a rhetorical analysis will remain only theoretical until there is a greater adoption of nonsexist terms as the accepted form of American English. (HOD)",

        "description":"Fiscal Impact Budgeting Systems (FIBS) are sophisticated computer based modeling procedures used in local government organizations, whose results, however, are often overlooked or ignored by decision makers. A study attempted to discover the reasons for this situation by focusing on four factors: potential usefulness, faith in computers, production process knowledge, and input data accuracy. Subjects, approximately 100 officials and members of citizens' boards, responded to 30 Likert-type scale items covering the four factors and the dependent variable: output acceptance or rejection. Results indicated that only faith in computers was nonsignificant while perceived accuracy of input data made the most important contribution to perceptions of quality of output. These results imply  that organizations should pay more attention to user involvement in implementation and knowledge adequacy. Decision makers must also become more aware of how the FIBS model works. (JL)",

While consistency theory predicts that low self-esteem persons will exhibit more eye contact when receiving negative feedback signals than when receiving positive feedback signals, need-fulfillment theory predicts just the reverse. Therefore, a study was conducted to test these opposing predictions. Eighty-nine subjects identified as having low self-esteem were divided into four experimental conditions in which they received combinations of positive and negative personal and performance feedback. Three data sets were generated  through observation of eye contact behavior, an attitude questionnaire, and the generation of a set of variables examining whether subjects differentiated between performance and personal feedback. Analysis of eye contact data produced no statistically significant effects, while analysis of questionnaires did indicate effects for feedback. No significant effect was found for differentiating between the two types of feedback. These results provide only weak support for the eye-contact hypotheses and bring into question the choice of dependent variables. (Questionnaires used in the study are appended.) (JL)",

Such a system follows a number of concepts, including favorable learning conditions, teachers qualified in learning-centered practices, clear learning objectives, and alternative learning strategies for students, but it is especially based on continuous, computer-generated diagnostic and prescriptive data for tracking individual pupil progress. Installing such a system means finding out what administrators, teachers, and learners need to know and do to ensure learner success, and finding out what must be done to maintain effectiveness. Among the political requirements for such a system is school board commitment to learner  success and to the learning-centered performance system. Technical requirements include teacher commitment to such a system and awareness of the difference between learner-and teacher-centered learning. In managing a mastery-learning-centered system, necessary data will be supplied to teachers (for diagnosis and prescription), principals (for support activities), central office administrators, and the superintendent and the board (for revisions and new objectives and resources).

One is the goal model, which defines effectiveness as the degree to which organizations meet or surpass their goals (either official or operational). The other is the system resource model, which measures effectiveness in terms of the organization's ability to secure advantageous bargaining positions and thereby acquire scarce and valued resources. Criticisms can be made of each model, but integration of the two models can increase their utility. However, four additional factors need to be considered, including the dimension of time, the organizational level under consideration, multiple constituencies (each with  different ideas about effectiveness), and multiple criteria of effectiveness. To specify dimensions of effectiveness in the integrated model, Talcott Parsons' four functions of social systems should be added, involving adaptation, goal attainment, integration, and latency, or value system maintenance. For each function, the model includes multiple indicators (or criteria) of effectiveness, and for each indicator, the model adds time, level, and constituency factors. (Author/RW)",

        "description":"Right-wing protests in four suburban Illinois school districts are analyzed in this paper. Two questions are asked: How do administrative organizations respond to protest from extremist groups? Under what conditions do administrators acquiesce to protestors' demands? Three major findings emerged. The first was that the more uncertainty administrators experience in dealing with protest groups, the more likely they are to recommend actions satisfying protestors' demands. Related to administrators' sense of uncertainty are the nature of the issue, administrators' understanding of protestor motivation, the length of successful experience with the materials being challenged, confidence in the teaching and administrative staff, and experience with similar right-wing conflicts.  Information gathering that linked protest to large organized protest groups only increased uncertainty because of the unpredictable nature of such groups. The second finding to emerge was that the more community meetings held about the issue, the less likely are administrators to recommend actions satisfying protestors' demands. More meetings offered opportunities for citizen defense of the challenged school policies. The final finding was that the more time and effort spent on the process of protest and response, the more likely are school officials to recommend actions satisfying protestors' demands.

Colorado's school finance program is essentially a resource equalization plan (also known as a &quot;guaranteed tax base&quot; or &quot;district power equalization&quot; plan). The major chanqes in the preceding 5 years involved improvements in property assessment practices and the setting of an authorized revenue base (ARB) for each district. Assessment of the equity of Colorado's current school finance structure is based on equality of expenditure per pupil (the amount of variation in such expenditure across school districts) and on fiscal neutrality (the extent of the relationship between a district's expenditure level and  its fiscal capacity). Data from Colorado's 181 districts show the state met neither equity standard in 1977 (nor did it in 1974). Per-pupil expenditures vary greatly and are related to districts' ARBs. Further, expenditure per student and district ARB vary with district wealth and income, so the state is not fiscally neutral. The authors suggest changing both the ARB, claiming it locks in unequal expenditures among districts, and the guaranteed tax base, which they say is too high and covers too many districts. (RW)",

        "description":"Using extensive data from before and after school finance reforms, the author analyzes the reforms' effects on school finance inequities in Michigan and Missouri, for all school districts and for suburban districts. In Michigan, data from 1970-71 show, the state met neither of two equity standards--equality in expenditure per pupil and fiscal neutrality--either for all districts or for suburban districts. After the 1973 finance reform, which instituted a guaranteed yield program, data from 1974-75 show fiscal neutrality was improved but expenditure-per-pupil inequalities were not. Effects on Michigan's suburban districts were the same as for all districts. Missouri also, 1975-76 data show, failed to meet either equity standard before its reform; inequities were greater among  suburban districts. In 1977 Missouri introduced a minimum foundation program with a guaranteed tax base (GTB). Simulation of the reform's impact indicates that it will improve fiscal neutrality but have no effect on expenditure inequalities, and that results will be the same for suburban as for all districts. Hence, reforms using GTB or guaranteed yield programs seem to meet the fiscal neutrality standard but not the expenditure-per-pupil standard, and to affect suburban districts the same as all districts.

Research suggests that blues and greens tend to foster relaxation while shades of red or orange tend to induce activity.

The second part addresses procedural rights--the school's obligation to follow certain procedures when pursuing disciplinary policies. Subsequent parts of the book include a guide for access to student records and to information about the school system that can be essential in discipline  advocacy; materials on remedies, disciplinary alternatives, and strategies for legal services advocates; a section on the rights of private school students; and a summary. The authors caution that while an attempt has been made to make the materials provided comprehensive, users must realize that the law is constantly developing and that the manual must be read in conjunction with the laws and regulations of the individual state and school system concerned, particularly since these may grant additional rights.

After explaining the value of volunteers to schools, teachers, and students, the booklet suggests and expands on 12 steps teachers can take to obtain full value from volunteers: (1) assess teacher and classroom needs, (2) talk with teachers who have worked with volunteers, (3) learn how to request volunteer help, (4) orient volunteers to classroom procedures, (5) take time to know the volunteer, (6) match the volunteer's skills with classroom needs, (7) establish good communications with volunteers, (8) share student progress with volunteers, (9) show continuing appreciation for volunteer help, (10) involve volunteers in evaluations of program  success, (11) encourage volunteers to seek training opportunities, and (12) set a good example. Appendices include a listing of ways volunteers can help at elementary and secondary levels, a sample volunteer request form, a checklist for teacher-volunteer conferences, methods for showing appreciation to volunteers, suggestions for self-evaluation by teachers and volunteers, definitions of key terms, and guidelines for a teamwork approach to a school volunteer program.

        "description":"Using data from the national research project &quot;A Study of Schooling,&quot; researchers sought to describe teachers' educational beliefs and to relate those beliefs to the teachers' classroom teaching practices. From 13 elementary schools in the national survey, 182 teachers were selected, based on their scores on two dimensions of belief: teacher discipline and control, and student participation. The two dimensions yielded four types of teachers, including (1) &quot;autocrats,&quot; with high discipline and low participation scores; (2) &quot;strategists,&quot; with high discipline and participation scores; (3) &quot;laissez-faire,&quot; with low discipline and participation scores; and (4) &quot;democrats,&quot; with low discipline but high participation scores. Questionnaires, interviews, and observations of 80 classrooms  where the sampled teachers taught were used to assess teaching practices. The variables examined included teachers'&quot;preactive&quot; behaviors (goals, intentions, and decisions) and &quot;interactive&quot; behaviors (instructional methods, grouping arrangements, time use, leadership, and expressive behavior). Discriminant analysis and chi-square analysis indicated that the four teacher types had different goals and methods. Among the results were that autocrats and strategists tended to emphasize basic skills and intellectual development, while democrats emphasized personal development, and that teacher beliefs on discipline were associated mostly with preactive behavior and beliefs on participation mostly with interactive behavior.

Chapter 1 considers defining student eligibility for special education, including the characteristics of handicapped children, ages for eligibility, estimates of the number of disabled children, and four strategies for clarifying eligibility boundaries. In chapter 2 the authors outline the range of special education services and discuss (1) state policies on reimbursement, assessment, class size, and school year length; (2) state definitions of related services; (3) legal opinions on state policies; (4) special  education effectiveness; and (5) five strategies for clarifying the range of services. Chapter 3, on special education costs, suggests weighing the costs of programs, policies, and factors affecting costs (such as population or salary changes) and getting adequate cost information. Revenue sources are considered in chapter 4, including state, local, federal, and private funds, policy considerations, and the structure of state aid. Chapter 5 examines six types of financial formulas used by states, reviews criteria for assessing formulas, and notes formulas' strengths and weaknesses. Eight appendices present further data and discuss definitions and legal issues. (RW)",

Section 3 reports on information collection and synthesis regarding the issues identified. The authors first drafted the guide's outline, next gathered information from state databases and policy reports, literature  surveys, and researchers, and then matched the information with the outline in five areas: eligibility, range of services, costs, and funding sources and formulas. In section 4 the authors assess the information base for each of the five areas and for three types of information sources (descriptive data, analytic research, and state documents). The concluding section offers suggestions for improving information on special education finance. Four appendices provide the telephone interview form, a list of experts interviewed, the draft guide outline, and a checklist of desired state information. (RW)",

Efforts made by the Research and Development Center for Teacher Education at the University of Texas at Austin to formalize research on the implementation of innovations led to the development of two measurement concepts. The first of these, used when assessing the degree to which innovations have been implemented, is called levels of use of the innovation; the second, establishing a perspective from which to define an implemented innovation's operational form, is called innovation configurations. This report discusses several alternative perspectives from  which implementation can be viewed, then details the characteristics of the innovation configurations approach. Several conceptual, methodological, and practical issues emerging from this way of defining the status of innovations are explored in the report's final section. (Author/PGD)",

The first stage in the evolution consisted of the collection of data concerning the degree of implementation of identified components of the new program in several randomly selected schools. In the second stage the program developers involved the building principals in the sampled schools in the implementation process, obtaining dramatic increases in implementation levels. The final stage  consisted of refining the processes developed in the first two stages to accommodate the needs and concerns expressed by principals, teachers, and administrators.

The introduction to the report explains the background situation and notes common themes  appearing in several of the papers. The papers themselves discuss legal, financial, and political issues affecting affirmative action policies and layoffs, the impact of layoffs on both school desegregation and minority representation on faculties, the roles of government agencies in preventing discrimination, alternatives to the layoff of minority teachers, and the provision of assistance to laid off staff members seeking new jobs. Conditions and responses to those conditions in the Massachusetts cities of Boston, Cambridge, Worcester, and Framingham are cited. (Author/PGD)",

An introduction reviews the Reagan administration's education program and budget. A summary of the impacts found by the journalists notes that the poor, minorities, and large urban school districts were hardest hit but that other elementary, secondary, and higher education programs were affected. It also mentions the responses of states and state lobbyists. A brief discussion outlines some of the implications of the federal programs for education.

These concepts include making sure everyone involved knows the schools' strengths, problems, and plans for solving problems; constantly pursuing excellence in education; making sure that people's experiences with their schools are positive; and working to improve staff morale. The authors also urge educators and public relations officers to become politically involved, to take the public's concerns about discipline seriously and work to address them, and to stop fighting among themselves and start building coalitions to support quality education. The last three points are  that every means available must be used to involve nonparents, that the business community must be involved in school improvement efforts, and that two-way communication must be established with all school audiences.

Each summary was written by the author of the original paper. David Kirp's article treats the changing nature of federal regulation and the proper relationship between federal and state governments in educational policy matters. Guy Benveniste discusses the effects of imposing regulatory controls at different stages in the implementation of programs. Charles Benson draws on the recent history of vocational education to illustrate the rise of federal regulation and the frustrations regulation has caused. Current arguments  concerning deregulation are reviewed by William Clune. Ann Swidler's summary considers the role of regulation in an individualistic society with a deep historical antipathy to centralization of authority. A supplement to the newsletter summarizes a doctoral dissertation by Mary Bankston on the subject of the organizational reporting demanded of school districts by the accountability requirements of state and federal programs.

The failure of U.S. society's formal and informal educational systems to instill clear moral, ethical, and social values in young people is documented first. The report then describes the character education concept as education in several virtues that are required to maintain a democratic and humane society, notably altruism, compassion, courage, courtesy, generosity, honesty, industriousness, integrity, loyalty, obedience, punctuality, respect for authority, responsibility,  self-discipline, self-respect, and tolerance. The role of boards of education in fostering and supporting character education efforts is described next, followed by recommendations for action by the CSBA.

Created to carry out this mandate, the School Finance Project established as one of its goals reporting to Congress on issues implicit in funding educational adequacy. Several educational authorities were asked to develop alternative definitions of educational adequacy that could be applied when assessing the adequacy of educational finance. The educational needs of regular school pupils, pupils with special needs, and preschool pupils were to be considered. The aspects of educational adequacy to be explored included the philosophical considerations implicit in definitions, the political feasibility of adopting  measures of adequacy, the technical problems associated with implementing a program of educational adequacy, and the prospects for achieving adequate educational financing in the coming decade. This document presents 15 of the resulting 16 reports (the 16th published separately), written from the points of view of several educational specialties: the economics of education, law and education, educational administration, education and politics, learning and measurement, the philosophy of education, anthropology and education, and the history of education.

The following sections review the psychological reasons for vandalism, which the authors say are not well understood, and enumerate the characteristics of schools, administrators, teachers, and student-school relations that accompany vandalism. Next, a \"primer\" on vandalism prevention first notes the inconsistent effectiveness of increased security measures and then recommends techniques for making schools less vulnerable and attractive to attack. Ways suggested to reduce vulnerability include occupying,  watching, and controlling access to the school and designing schools with vandalism in mind. Techniques for reducing attractiveness as a target include revising curriculums, changing administrative policy and organizational structure, and involving students, parents, and the community. The final section gives five suggestions for immediate responses to vandalism, including quick repair, formal recordkeeping, and the seeking of restitution. A brief bibliography is appended. (RW)",

After delineating the research questions and procedures guiding the study, and the definitional distinctions between the closely related concepts involved, the report examines relevant litigation. The cases reviewed affect state school finance schemes, the rights of students with special needs, and parental control over educational choices. State legislative and regulatory activity defining adequacy and establishing adequacy standards is described  next. The nature of school funding laws, eight states' statutory definitions of adequacy, and the application of program requirements, accountability mandates, and minimum competency standards are covered. The federal role in defining and establishing adequacy standards is addressed last, with special attention paid to regulations regarding handicapped students, bilingual, compensatory, and vocational education, and research, development, and dissemination activities. A final chapter summarizes the findings, discusses obstacles to defining adequacy conclusively, and comments on prospects for the 1980s.

Detailed data are reported for eight basic tasks, including employment of beginning professional personnel in special education assignments in 1980 (a 4% increase over 1979-80, but less than the 7% or 8% growth rate of the preceding 2 years); new employment of personnel with 1 or more years teaching experience; return rate of special education teachers (an increasing number each year); attrition rate of special education professional personnel (a decreasing attrition rate with a larger proportion of staff returning subsequent years); number of new  endorsements of certificate (an overall decrease in the number of total initial provisional certificate endorsements for all categories of special education); attrition rates of special education administrators (similar to those of special education teachers); and the need for special education teachers (continued growth in the number of new positions in categories of mentally impaired, speech impaired, social worker, emotionally impaired, school psychologist, hearing impaired, learning disabled, and occupational/physical therapy). Two main recommendations are offered: establishing a common coding system by Special Education Services and Teacher Preparation and Certification Services; and conducting a statewide study on the extent of absence among special education teachers, the  qualifications of substitutes, and an annual census of substitutes used in the state's special education classes. Detailed tables are appended. (CL)",

Findings included that changes in the children's IEP's have been in the direction of more rather than less restrictiveness; that there were parental reports of delays in testing; that the substantial majority of parents were not well informed or greatly involved in program planning; and that the level of family adaptation to the handicaps was associated with its severity. Conclusions largely  supported those of the first year. Among nine recommendations made were that parental involvement be emphasized and that regular educators and administrators be acquainted with the law through workshops and other inservice approaches.

The report begins with background information on Chapter 766 and highlights major evaluation findings, including that the law still is supported by a broad political spectrum in the state; that school staff expressed negative feelings about the paper work involved in implementing the law; that the law has been largely effective in making a range of educational services available to all handicapped students aged 3 to 21;  that secondary education has been greatly affected by the law but chronic problems remain; that relatively inexpensive efforts can be undertaken to solve many persistent financial problems; and that the state has dramatically increased reimbursement for education in poor urban settings since 1978-79. The second part of the report details findings and recommendations regarding eight issues (sample subtopics in parentheses): 1) finance (state aid, cost trends); 2) special education services (labels, related services); 3) the interface with regular education (inservice training); 4) state/local relations (monitoring, appeals); 5) secondary education (attitudes, service options); 6) individualized education plans (staff and parent use); 7) least restrictive environment (placement decisions,  student acceptance); and 8) parent/school relations (impact on parents, organized parent efforts).

Project REED workshops are discussed in the latter part of the guide. Warm-up activities are presented (including an activity focusing on notable women with disabilities. Workshop awareness tasks emphasize three topics: equitable early childhood classroom materials, inclusionary curricula, and inclusionary home environment.

Two of the children were most disruptive with the \"DIFFICULT 100\" condition, one child was most disruptive when demands were increased (DIFFICULT 100) and when attention was withdrawn (EASY 33), and another child was most disruptive during  the \"EASY 33\" condition. Results suggested that the disruptive behaviors served social-communicative functions. When Ss were trained to respond with verbally appropriate responses (such as \"Am I doing good work,\" to get attention), disruptive behavior was virtually eliminated. Implications of the findings were considered. Graphs of behavior under various conditions are offered. (SW)",

A distinction is made between descriptive and working models of communicative competence. Working models attempt to show how components of communicative competence are interrelated psychologically to form a set of independent factors and to determine whether aspects of language are psychologically distinct and can be learned separately. In reviewing the research on this question, several methodological and statistical issues must be addressed. Among these issues are interpretation of the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient, subjects' language background, patterns of language proficiency, and criterion versus norm  referenced language measures. Examples are provided of the ways in which these issues can influence the interpretation of patterns of test results. Research on the components of communicative competence are reviewed and the findings reinterpreted in light of the methodological issues. (Author/RW)",

In the first exercises, which deal with structural points, an incorrect answer is followed by a detailed explanation of the error. Students are also offered the opportunity to review all of the areas previously covered. Next, a practice/self-testing mode provides the student immediate feedback and reinforcement. Structural exercises also incorporate the elements of speed and pacing by allowing the student to  choose the number of seconds allotted to respond to each question. It is suggested that standard exercises designed for vocabulary development and reading comprehension are also well suited to CAI.

Two of the children were taped for short periods (7 hours and 9 hours), while the other two children were studied biweekly for 14 months, which resulted in 71 hours of transcribed child tapes as well as 3 hours of adult control data. All four unacquainted children showed strikingly similar language acquisition strategies. Word class categorizations and word order are discussed in detail, using examples of the children's speech. Although Chinese selectional restrictions have few surface indicators, Chinese children regularize and double mark the linguistic relations. Their innate capacity for grammatical marking by word  order and morphology is stronger than required by the language they are learning. In terms of word class categorizations, the children seem to illustrate classical Chinese grammar and philology by first assuming that all morphemes are full, free, unbound forms, equivalent to lexically full words. It is concluded that Mandarin is comparable to European languages in difficulty and rate of acquisition, as well as in the amount of experimentation and error required to master it. (SW)",

Rules of definition include clarity, avoidance of figurative language, avoidance of simple synonyms, and provision of the essential characteristics of the term being defined. English language proficiency has been given different operational definitions depending on the context in which it has been discussed. Guidelines for formulating clearer and more precise definitions of language proficiency are offered.

It is suggested that research since 1960 shows a positive relationship between bilingualism and cognitive development, at least for some types of bilingualism. The advantage or disadvantage of becoming bilingual seems to depend on the way a subject becomes bilingual and the degree of language proficiency achieved. The \"S-curve\" model deals with the effects of the environment in the development of a bilingual's cognitive abilities. The second model, a bilingual's cognitive structure model, explains how different types of bilingualism are developed and why some types of bilingualism are expected to result in  cognitive advantages. It is concluded that the advantage of being a coordinate bilingual (i.e., one exposed to two languages at a very early age who learns two distinct coding systems) is due to the bilingual's capacity to use language independent relations as well as relations between concepts unique to the two languages. There is no evidence that compound bilingualism (i.e., learning the second language through translation from the dominant language) will lead to cognitive advantages, while a major influence on the outcome seems to be the age of initial exposure to the second language. The social context in which the bilingual develops is also very important in determining the final outcome. (SW)",

In deciding whether to use a definite or indefinite article, the student is taught to ask three questions about the context and nature of the noun: (1) has it been mentioned before in the composition, (2) is there anything definite right after the noun, and (3) is there only one in existence ( as in \"the earth\"). The noun requires a definite article if any of these questions is answered in the affirmative. If all of the questions are answered in the negative, the learner must then consider whether the noun in question is a count noun and whether it is singular. A singular count noun requires no article. A test of the questioning system on native speakers of  English yielded disagreement on which article to use in some cases but demonstrated that context and prior knowledge make a difference in debatable areas. The system can help English as second language speakers to define their own context and to arrive at one of the correct uses of articles in each case. Sample exercises are appended. (RW)",

        "description":"Six practical components of listening comprehension and sources of listening materials are considered. Listening comprehension depends on: (1) the sonic realization or actual physical hearing of language, (2) the segmental/suprasegmental form (phoneme distinction), (3) the musical pitch and rhythm, (4) lexical phrasing, (5) the purpose of the message intended by the speaker, and (6) the actualization of the message in the listener. Sources of good listening material, listed in order of importance, are: the teacher; other speakers of the target language; recordings of radio broadcasts, music, speeches; films and television programs; and commercially-produced language laboratory tapes. The importance of frequently exposing students to the language as it is actually used by fluent  speakers is emphasized. The technique of adapting materials from the radio is illustrated by a weather report in German. Fifteen weather reports were recorded, since they are usually in a fixed format, with certain kinds of information in certain locations. Certain words and phrases were deleted from one report to the next, and three of the reports were not transcribed for the students, who were required to provide the basic information about the weather. It is suggested that the same technique can be used for other types of short abridged language material, especially music. Some limitations of commercially-produced tapes are noted. (SW)",

        "description":"Beginning core-French students who had contact with part-time French monitors and students who did not were compared in five Canadian provinces in 1979-1980 as part of an evaluation of the Second Language Monitor Program. Twenty-eight schools and 56 classes were studied in Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia, along with 5 schools and 10 classes in Manitoba and Ontario. Half of the sample had monitors for the grades 5 through 9 French classes, which were primarily first or second-year studies. Each student was interviewed for about 30 minutes in both French and English, and a standardized test of French listening comprehension was administered to determine speaking and listening competence, cultural knowledge, quantity and quality of experiences in French class,  and attitude toward learning French. Students who had monitor contact reported many more experiences in French class, and their experiences were judged of higher quality than those of control students. While monitors did not appear to provide experiences that increase competence in any conventional way, it is concluded that they add desirable and unique cultural elements. The English and French interview questionnaires and student background information questionnaire are appended, along with a checklist and instructions for interviewers and a classroom observation coding scheme.

Figures are provided of six models that propose relationships among visual input and processes, auditory input, phonological processes, and comprehension. These models illustrate the processes that may be operating in persons who achieve their initial literacy in a second language and in those who learn to read in a second language after becoming literate in their native language. There is controversy regarding whether comprehension is dependent on phonological processes or can occur directly from visual input in fluent readers. Six possible single routes and numerous multiple routes for comprehension of second language texts are identified. The nineteenth-century models are  equally complex, providing for recoding of auditory input into visual form as well as for reading aloud without comprehension. In conclusion, there is a need for models that summarize existing data, and for more complex models that generate hypotheses. (RW)",

This volume provides information on educational needs and services for the target population, while an earlier volume reports that estimated numbers of limited English proficient students between the ages of 5 and 14. A test of English skills was constructed to establish limited English proficiency and criteria were formulated to define minimum acceptable services for language minority students. Characteristics of instruction for limited English proficient students, the proportion of the target population receiving bilingual or other special language services,  the extent to which criteria were met by available services, and the unmet educational needs of language minority children are reported. Among the findings, it was concluded that (1) one third of all limited English proficient children are served by some form of special language instruction, (2) federal and state support is effectively targeted on those most in need, and (3) the types of bilingual education provided though government support do not focus on language maintenance.

The review concluded that there is little evidence supporting the need for bilingual instruction for language minority children. Given the widespread legal, fiscal, policy, and media implications of this conclusion, it is important that the evidence be analyzed. Each of the 28 studies cited to support the Baker DeKanter conclusion was analyzed in depth in regard to methodological soundness. Numerous instances of the following methodological errors were found: non-random assignment of subjects, high attrition of subjects, extremely small sample sizes, inappropriate measurement instruments or procedures, inappropriate pretest/posttest time frames,  inconsistent design, lack of control of critical learning variables, variations in qualifications of instructional personnel, and lack of recency of the studies cited. Given these problems, the conclusions of the Baker DeKanter review should be questioned. Detailed reviews of each of the 28 studies are appended. (RW)",

The studies involved Danish speaking subjects acquiring English as a second language at ages 7-10, 13, and 18. The evidence from these studies demonstrate a developmental sequence of linguistic stages with each of the structures acquired in sequential order. General syntactic principles are at work despite the different learning situations and learner skills. Gradual development, degrees of understanding, and the importance of contextual and interpersonal cues must be considered when evaluating variations in comprehension. The distinction between conceptual development and the mastery of the  syntactic rules studied is discussed. Performance strategies relying on syntactic/semantic cues varying according to experimental setup and developmental stage are noted. (RW)",

Attention is directed to the sociology of sexual harassment and to the following possible responses available to victims of harassment: acquiescing, declining but remaining silent, complaining through internal procedures, claiming unemployment compensation benefits after losing the job, pursuing state legal remedies, and filing a federal sex discrimination charge. Each possible response has negative consequences, and this places a victim in a double bind. Federal courts have addressed whether verbal and physical sexual advances are actionable under the central provision  of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. To understand the current position of the federal courts, some early and subsequent decisions are reviewed. The EEOC guidelines, which give a sweeping interpretation to the reach of Title VII in sexual harassment cases, are examined and sample policy statements prohibiting sexual harassment are presented. Attention is also directed to grievance procedures, sanctions, recordkeeping and reporting of sexual harassment, and students harassing students or employees. (SW)",

        "description":"Financial strategies, plans to increase return--and risk--up to the point (but not beyond) where the protection of core activities may begin to break down, are addressed. The stages for developing a financial strategy are: (1) formulate and examine academic program, research, and marketing strategies; (2) define core activities necessary to maintain the institution with its academic, research, and marketing strategies; (3) measure the levels of risk created by these internal, nonfinancial strategies and by external forces; (4) measure the levels of buffers like financial reserves available to protect core activities from risk; and (5) trade off the requirements to increase buffers against the need for additional nonfinancial resources necessary to accomplish core strategies. The  role of the financial manager is one of monitoring risk and resource levels and participating in the trade off between the need to build buffers and the need to build other resources. With the prospect of increasing financial stringency in U.S. institutions of higher education has come the necessity of acknowledging changing levels of risk. Financial management must be better integrated into strategic planning for institutions of higher education to be able to cope with the uncertainties of the 1980s. The risks that an institution faces are changing constantly, and financial strategies that were once appropriate may no longer be best for achieving goals while minimizing threat to core activities. Institutions must monitor financial and nonfinancial resources and three aspects of risk:  expectations, preparation, and tolerance. (SW)",

It provides a cultural, social, and recreational program designed to promote students' personal growth and leadership. The most common union programs are art exhibits, concerts, film series, games and tournaments, forums, lectures, and numerous special  programs and projects.

Data from a 1969 Faculty Survey of the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education provided a sample of 77 universities for the recruitment equity analysis and 73 universities for the reward equity analysis. The data were weighted to make them more representative of U.S. universities in 1969. After controlling for differences in qualifications and performance, it was found that almost all universities exhibited inequity toward female faculty in the recruitment, rank, and salary attainment processes; but, in most cases, female faculty were not disadvantaged in the tenure  process. On all equity dimensions, however, there were sizeable variations in the patterns exhibited. The extent of organizational equity in recruitment, rank, tenure, and salary were found to be largely unrelated to one another. It is suggested that organizational sex discrimination be treated as a multi-dimensional phenomenon, since no consistent relationships were found between the personnel recruitment and reward process regarding equity.

The following industries, which employ almost three-fourths of the scientists and engineers in private industry, were included in the survey: mining, construction, petroleum refining and extraction, chemicals, primary and fabricated metals, office machines, nonelectric and electric machinery and equipment, aircraft, transportation equipment (other than aircraft), electric/gas services, and engineering/architectural and other business services. Of the 255 firms contacted in the 1982 survey, 197 (77 percent) responded, representing the employment of about 8 percent of industrial scientists and engineers. Findings include the following: over  50 percent of the firms indicated that it was easier in August 1982 to hire new entrant scientists and engineers than it had been 10 months earlier; only electronic engineers with master's degrees were generally in short supply in 1982; the proportion of employers reporting shortages of petroleum engineers fell from about 65 percent in 1981 to 13 percent in 1982; and employers attribute the slackening market to the general state of the economy.

The course uses a variety of teaching modalities such as audiovisual presentation and self-instructional modules, and a format that permits updating of content. The course was presented at four sites in different states using several scheduling variations. Course components were systematically evaluated by students and faculty, and student examination performance was analyzed. There was consistent evidence of attainment of cognitive objectives. Acquisition and  retention of information was due partly to the use of self-instructional modules with review exercises and self-tests. The final field trial of the complete course provided partial support for positive attitude change regarding the efficacy of prevention. Presentation of the course as a one-semester offering, and/or assignment of course components to other courses, were considered by participants and faculty to be satisfactory formats. (SW)",

Respondents provided information concerning: the names of the courses they were teaching; previous teaching experience; their selection as course instructors; perceived reasons students chose the courses; the general background of students (age, educational background, occupation); teaching methods employed; student roles/activities; perceived teaching strengths and weaknesses; and the  effectiveness of the university in meeting their needs as noncredit teachers. It was found that the diverse backgrounds of adult learners provided the greatest challenge to the noncredit instructor. Recommendations include that: noncredit instructors should be provided information on the characteristics of adult learners; communication between teachers and administrators should be improved; and the university should better promote noncredit programs and recruit students.

The teaching of these processes involves the following course goals: teaching a specific subject, generally useful skills, and professional skills. Problem-solving applications are considered first. A subject may be taught through use of a guided design approach, which involves following a series of steps that lead to a solution. Teaching generally useful skills focuses on a set of strategies and heuristics rather than on a series of specific steps to be followed. Programs attempt to help students become better thinkers. Teaching professional skills can be illustrated by a  problem-based approach to medical education. Information, concepts, and skills learned by students are put into their memory in association with a problem. Creative learning and discovery experiences can be part of learning a subject. Usually, programs teaching creativity as a generally useful tool use heuristics (e.g., asking students to think like an inventor or encouraging them to reach a high level of abstract reasoning). Teaching specific skills for the development of creativity are found in both the sciences and the arts. (SW)",

The information was obtained from parent responses to questions about the financing of education for their children, along with student questionnaire responses. Fifty-one percent of the 1980 high school seniors who aspired to continue their education (college, vocational, or technical postsecondary training) applied for student financial aid by the fall of that year. The rates of application varied as a function of student plans, inclinations, and aspirations; family wealth; family size; parent knowledge of financial aid programs; and expected schooling costs. Several of these factors  appeared to have as significant a relationship with rates of application for aid as did family wealth. For example, the amount of parental knowledge about the Pell grant program was strongly related to differences in application rates. These differences were greater than those associated with family income or amount of savings for college. After controlling for family income, the factors showing the strongest relationship with application rates were parental knowledge, students' high school grades, and expected schooling costs. (SW)",

Students whose benefits are being gradually reduced would also be eligible to receive up to $2,000 a year in supplemental loan money, but would not receive more than the annual benefits they are entitled to as a social security beneficiary. S. 2655 is based completely on need, to be determined by the Department of Education, based on the current Guaranteed Student  Loan program need tests. Additionally, the aid will not be duplicative since the student would have to borrow the current maximum $2,500 loan amount before becoming eligible to borrow under the supplemental program.

A committee of 15 American professors in 1915 proposed a &quot;Declaration of Principles&quot; that endorsed academic freedom but reflected the view of the German professor Friedrich Paulsen who argued that: religion is a subjective experience that only a believer can understand and teach well; and, in order to perpetuate themselves, religiously supported institutions have a right to require that religion professors conform with official dogma. It is claimed that the first argument fails because of confusion between the subject (or observer) and the subject matter (or religious  experience). Subjects can formulate objective, or valid, conclusions about beliefs that are foreign to their own immediate experience. The argument from the right of self-perpetuation stands unless the institution attempts to control teaching and research in a selective manner. It is recommended that the American Association of University Professors retract their 1940 Statement on Academic Freedom clause that permits institutions to use their religious aims to limit academic freedom.

Usable data were gathered from 351 of 671 Higher Education Panel member institutions. Two weighting methodologies were employed. The conventional method assumed that nonrespondents were similar to respondents, whereas a minimum-value method assumed that nonrespondents had no financial activity in the humanities to report. The conventional approach generated dollar estimates about 85 percent higher than those produced by the alternative approach. Respondents reported by source the total amount of gifts, grants, and contracts from government and private sources that were restricted to the humanities, along with the the total amount of funds expended for the  humanities from all sources. During fiscal year 1980, restricted income for the humanities ranged between $130 and $246 million. Two-fifths of this support came for the federal government, and more than one-fifth came from individuals. Humanities expenditures from all sources ranged between $1.6 and $2.9 billion, with instruction accounting for 8 of every 10 dollars spent. Ten percent of humanities expenditures were financed by government or private sources. (SW)",

The societal and related economic and political reasons for the evolution of accreditation in its present form are addressed, since accreditation is related to prestige, political influences, consumer protection, and program and professional improvement. NCATE, a professional accrediting agency, is responsible for accrediting 550 of the total 1,367 state-approved teacher education programs. The 18 educational associations that support NCATE are listed. The key element of the teacher education accreditation process is NCATE's standards, which are outlined separately for undergraduate and graduate programs. The overall areas of  evaluation are as follows: governance, curricula, faculty, students, resources and facilities, evaluation, program review, and planning. The accreditation process involves both the measurement of the institutional program and evaluation of the measurements based on the NCATE standards. Attention is also directed to the views of critics and proponents regarding NCATE accreditation. Finally, the question of universal accreditation is considered, since existing accrediting agencies are voluntary. (SW)",

In addition, testimonies of representatives of The Common Fund and the United Negro College Fund explain the College Endowment Funding Plan and how it could help achieve the purposes of Title III of the Higher Education Act. This program would add $100 million to the endowment resources of the 41 member colleges of the United Negro College Fund. The problem of financial  institutions' continued participation in student loan programs and the issue of assuring that unmet financial need does not bar access to education are addressed by Martha Church, a higher education representative. Statistics for Hood College on the impact of President Reagan's proposed funding cuts for 1982 and 1983 are presented. Finally, financial data from Brandeis University are presented on operating income and expenditures for selected years and 1982-1983 proposed operating budget. (SW)",

        "description":"Current levels of federal and state support to increase access to higher education and the barriers now being faced are considered, based on a Higher Education Research Institute report. The postwar transition from elite to mass to universal higher education has been accompanied by major changes in government support. State governments have supported the growth and expansion of public postsecondary systems, while federal policy has focused on removing the financial and nonfinancial barriers to college access and degree attainment. It is suggested that major federal categorical programs designed to assist minority students and minority institutions have generally had positive impacts and benefits, including improved access. However, the issue of choice is not fully resolved.  Special programs for access and persistence do improve access and retention, but they fall short of their stated goal of improving academic performance, and institutional aid remains controversial. The challenges of the 1980s will be for state, federal, local, and institutional officials to cooperate in developing better programs that promote participation for minorities. Attention is also directed to Title III of the Higher Education Act of 1965 and the Reagan Administration's funding cuts for education. An extensive bibliography is included. (SW)",

Attention is directed to constraints under which chairs work that are beyond their control and the way that the resulting conflict, overload, and ambiguity impede effective performance. The academic model, which assumes that authority is based on function or expertise rather than formal position, may conflict with the administrative-managerial models. Institutional and disciplinary influences on departmental administration, and the effects of unionism are also considered, along with specific approaches to making the position of chair more attractive. Four major conclusions are as follows: (1) role  conflict may be reduced substantially by improving institutional management; (2) education, training, and administrative development is a central need of chairs and their key associates; (3) making the chair's role meaningful requires taking into account career orientations and disciplines, which may require changes in recruitment and selection policies; and (4) new resources may be required to make the role of the chair manageable.

The programming and production for this project, which was started in 1977, are entirely conceived, developed, and implemented by local school children ranging in age from 9 to 14 years. Two community surveys--one to ascertain the attitudes of parents to children and television, and the other to determine the viewing patterns and favorite television shows of school children--were commissioned, as well as a technical survey to examine the feasibility and cost effectiveness of physical interconnection of the systems throughout the county.  In addition, personal in-depth interviews were conducted with business persons, community leaders, elected officials, and educators to assess their awareness, interest, potential support, and the political climate in which the expanded children's channel would develop. Results of the study showed that the projected expansion would be both desirable and feasibile, and welcomed by Dane County communities. Appendices include a statement of the rationale for the program; reports on each of the surveys; a description of an international live satellite interconnect demonstration which linked children in interactive participatory television; descriptions of KIDS-4 which have appeared in several publications; and a packet of project administrative materials.

Dual process attention theory is reviewed, and the distinction between automatic and controlled processing is examined. The changing interactions between automatic and controlled processing in the development of skill are discussed, and it is proposed that consistent practice produces automatic productions which perform consistent transformations in a heterarchial system. The qualities of automatic productions are identified as being modular, showing high transfer, becoming resource free, not being under direct control, and being fast, accurate, and coordinated. Assumptions about controlled processing are also discussed,  including how such processes develop automatic processing, maintain strategy and time varying information, and perform problem-solving activities. Perceptual data, some motor data, and several motor performance examples are presented to show automatic controlled processing effects. The relationship to current theories of motor skill and new research paradigms suggested by the current approach are discussed. A 37-item list of references and 9 figures are included. (Author/LMM)",

These &quot;students,&quot; in turn, responded to teacher questions and asked questions on their own. The stability of teacher behavior within a simulation, differences among teachers in their use of positive affect as a consequence, and global changes in teacher patterns within the simulation were specifically addressed. Subjects were 40 teachers enrolled in the University of Virginia School of Education, who were divided into four subgroups representing factorial combinations of training area and  experience. During two 20-minute sessions, teachers individually conducted a spelling lesson by instructing, questioning, calling on students, or using other appropriate behavior. Results indicated individual teacher patterns were quite consistent. High-knowledge students received more positive affect, overall, as a consequence than their low-knowledge classmates, with the quiet high-knowledge students rewarded relatively most often. As a group, teachers demonstrated changes in behavior over time, indicating a move toward relatively greater emphasis upon instruction and teacher-determination of targeted students. Results of the study indicate that the simulation influenced teacher behavior in a logical and predictable manner. Five references and two tables are included. (LMM)",

Several studies have reported on the effects of television on children, including a study by the Australian Senate Standing Committee on Education and  the Arts in 1976. Television in Australia is about to undergo a transformation in which the technology of signal-to-screen delivery will change drastically, causing enormous changes to the message received. One definite change will be the establishment of a National Communications Satellite System. Major changes to the Australian Broadcasting Commission have also been announced, and the Australian government is investigating various aspects of telecommunications including cable and subscription television, postal service communications, and videotex. A bibliography is included. (LMM)",

        "description":"Suggestions for integrating computer technology and composition instruction are presented in four conference papers, summaries of four conference courseware demonstrations, a paper describing computer-based evaluation of textual responses, and a reactor's address. In an overview of the current state of computer-based composition instruction, Robert Shostak discusses the problems that writing teachers have traditionally faced and offers some promising solutions. Hugh Burns then describes a computer-based dialog designed to assist students in generating writing ideas during prewriting. Earl Woodruff discusses the role that computers can play in helping students compose text, and Ann Lathrop presents criteria for consideration when selecting courseware for purchase. The varied  courseware materials demonstrated at the conference are then described. The conference reactor, Alfred Bork, suggests principles that should guide the development of computer-based learning materials and stresses the need for a solid research foundation. In an appendix, the editor outlines problems that instructional developers may encounter in designing programs for teaching writing and discusses the need for interactive programs that can evaluate the form and content of textual responses.

The 16 sequential lessons, part of the Consumer in the Marketplace Series (CMS), demonstrate consumer economic theory in layman's terms and are structured to focus on the cognitive behaviors of knowledge, comprehension, applications, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation, based on Bruner's theory of instruction. The model merges the content of consumer economics and the methodology emphasized in computer education into a &quot;life-adjustment&quot; agenda. The resulting conceptual approach provides a mechanism for serving a varied audience of college students, teachers with consumer education  responsibilities, or interested adults without significantly expanding resources, while increasing the economics awareness levels of students and faculties in other disciplines. The CMS is divided into four segments focusing on the analysis of rational behavior in the marketplace and wise decision-making, increasing individual earning power, increasing consumer spending power, and the political and legal framework of society. Four references are listed. (LMM)",

        "description":"The efficacy of the CATES system for making training decisions and determining student proficiency in Naval in-flight training proposed in an earlier study (Rankin and McDaniel, 1980) is compared with the present system of instructor judgments for performance assessment. The current study used 29 newly-designated naval aviators undergoing Fleet Replacement Pilot Training in the SH-3 aircraft. From an inventory of 190 tasks, 18 tasks were selected to evaluate the model. Standard training materials and equipment were used, and performance was graded as students proceeded through the training syllabus. The task performance information required to reach a decision and the level of student proficiency upon completion of the training program were then analyzed. Results indicate the  CATES system requires less information to make a decision than the current human-judgment system and is reliably more accurate, suggesting greater consistency and accuracy of mathematical models to an actual training situation in a considerably more unstructured environment than previous research studies. This report also provides extensive details of the statistical decision model used by the CATES system, results of other evaluations using mathematical models versus human models in decision making, study definitions, research methods, results, and conclusions.

        "description":"Questionnaires designed to determine the extent of computer usage in secondary schools in Texas and the level of commitment to this usage by teachers, principals, and campuses were mailed to 1,950 principals. Results based on the 1,191 30-item forms returned indicate that computer usage generally increases with campus size. Principals of schools that were using computers felt more strongly about the need for computer literacy for all high school graduates than principals of schools where computers were not used, with agreement positively related to district size. A similar trend was found in principals' reporting of their own level of computer literacy. While 62 percent of all schools reported computer use, the number of computers per campus was relatively small. Current usage  emphasizes math and computer programming, however, other computer uses in instruction are increasing, with users reporting a strong tendency to purchase machine-ready software. Over 70 percent of all schools using computers for instruction had begun such use within the preceding 3 years. Cost is a primary inhibiting factor for computer use, and little campus-wide commitment currently exists for computer usage. The survey form used and 21 data tables are appended. (LMM)",

        "description":"This project attempted to replicate a 1981 study by Munro, Fehling, Blaise, and Towne, which found that instructional feedback for dynamic skill training is most effective when the student chooses when and if feedback is to be received. Using a simpler task, this study focused on an Air Intercept Controller Simulation program. The effectiveness of computer-generated voice output in instruction and simulation in dynamic skill training were also addressed in an experiment in computer-based instruction. Both the intrusiveness and delivery mode (text-voice) factors had statistically significant effects on student errors. Performance was superior in the groups which received feedback in a textual mode and had control over sequence and presence of feedback. The next highest performance  group received feedback in a computer voice mode and also had control over feedback. The third highest group received immediate textual-mode feedback to errors, while the poorest performance group received immediate computer voice feedback. Results suggest that instruction in dynamic skills should be non-intrusive, and that current inexpensive voice synthesis technology is inappropriate for dynamic skill training. Six data tables and six figures are included, and a list of crucial and non-crucial errors is appended. (Author/LMM)",

        "description":"Employee fringe benefits, characteristics of head librarians, and interlibrary loan activity among Illinois public libraries are described in this compilation of three reports. The first and largest report delineates results of a 1980/81 fringe benefit survey conducted by telephone interview. It is noted that the Chicago Public Library was specifically excluded from this study of Illinois public libraries. Information is presented on reimbursement for evening, weekend, and overtime work; paid holidays; paid vacations; paid sick leave; other types of leave of absence; support for continuing education and professional association activity; group insurance; retirement provisions; and other fringe benefits. An index of four major public library fringe benefits developed for the sake  of comparison, sample survey forms, and 12 tables of data are provided. The second report presents information on Illinois head public librarians by sex, extent of formal education, salary, size of library, and location of library within Illinois. Data extracted from 1979/80 and 1980/81 annual reports are displayed in four tables. A summary of interlibrary loan activity for Illinois public libraries from 1976/77 to 1980/81 is briefly presented in the third report, which includes data on loans received and transmitted. (ESR)",

User frequency, the composition of user patronage, preferred media formats for learning, and users' perceptions of audiovisual services offered are described. A brief history is provided of the Independent Learning Center (ILC), which houses the audiovisual collections at SUNY-Buffalo's E. H. Butler Library. Survey response rates for faculty (26 percent) and students (62 percent) are noted. Survey findings are presented, indicating that: (1) faculty use both the library and the ILC less frequently than students; (2) ILC collections are seen primarily as audiovisual &quot;reserve rooms&quot;; (3) many students and faculty  are underutilizing media items available on loan from ILC; (4) student and faculty users have extremely positive attitudes about the ILC facility and its services; and (5) faculty (67 percent) still prefer learning by reading while students are more evenly divided among reading (41 percent), listening (38 percent), and viewing (31 percent). Based on survey results, active promotion of ILC services is recommended. The survey questionnaire is appended, with associated frequencies of response for students and faculty given for each question. (Author/ESR)",

Response rates of 78 and 50 percent respectively were achieved. Questions dealt with types of information needed; sources of information used; utilization of personal resource collections; frequency of use of online searching, reference services, and libraries; and satisfaction with available  library collections. Only a portion of the research results are outlined in this publication. It is reported that eight sources of information were found to be commonly used by engineers: books, research journals, colleagues, personal resource collections, regular reading of the literature, technical reports, personal research records, and knowledge transmitted at conferences or meetings. It is also noted that engineering libraries were the primary source for all types of information needs but that the use of library reference staff was significantly lower than use of libraries.

Activities were undertaken to gain visibility for the project (e.g., creating an advisory board and introducing the project to students through letters and orientation sessions), while at the same time developing a treatment model to provide tutorial assistance and support services to black students, analyze transcripts to identify students who were having academic difficulties or who had withdrawn, and  determine student satisfaction with the college. Data collected at the end of the 1980-81 school year indicated that many students did not return to college because of lack of support and outreach efforts. Responses to a survey of non-returning students indicated that personal problems and \"stopouts\" were the main reasons for discontinuing studies. A separate survey of currently enrolled students revealed that programs stressing black awareness and workshops on study skills and test anxiety were among the support services desired by black students.

Scores on all three measures were available for 54 of the students enrolled in the four sections of the course. The study revealed significant correlations between: (1) high entering math scores and low math anxiety scores, and high anxiety and low entering math scores; (2) students' entering math scores and their scores on the midterm examination; and (3) students'  math anxiety level and their math test performance, even when controlling for the factor of initial skills level. The study report includes a review of the literature on math anxiety and student performance. The Math Test Anxiety Index is appended. (HB)",

        "description":"This report reviews actions taken by the Board of Governors and the Chancellor's Office of the California Community Colleges to implement the 1982-83 Budget Act's $30 million reduction in state apportionments for the community colleges. First, background material specifies the options provided by the legislature to effect the savings, including cutting funding for non-credit courses; avocational, recreational, and personal development courses; or certain types of adult and community education courses. Next, actions of the Board of Governors and the Chancellor's Office to implement the funding reduction are discussed, including the identification of avocational, recreational, and personal development courses that could be offered as self-supporting community service classes. Then,  the report outlines procedures used to calculate reductions based on district reports and estimated apportionment reductions on a district-by-district basis. After the criteria for courses to be deleted are presented, an analysis of the effect of the funding reduction on the community colleges' mission is provided. Finally, findings regarding the implementation of the budget reduction are outlined. Appendices include a report to the legislature on the deletion of selected credit and noncredit courses from the community college curriculum and tentative lists of courses to be deleted. (HB)",

        "description":"In late 1980, a study was conducted at Miami-Dade Community College (MDCC) to determine how well the college was meeting the needs of its academically superior students. Questionnaires were sent to four groups of students enrolled in fall 1979: Scholar's Grant students, who ranked in the top 10% of their graduating high school class; Phi Theta Kappa students, who had a grade point average (GPA) of 3.5 or more; a non-affiliated group of academically excellent students with a GPA of 3.0 or more; and a comparison group of students with GPA's between 2.0 and 2.5. The 150-item Student Reaction to College questionnaire was used to obtain student views on instruction, counseling and advising, administrative regulations, study habits, student goals and activities, living arrangements,  and college services and activities. Selected findings were based on responses from 283 (69.9%) of the Scholar's Grant recipients, 71 (79.7%) of the Phi Theta Kappa students, 444 (64%) of the non-affiliated students, and 173 (55.8%) of the comparison group. Findings included the following: (1) the academically excellent groups contained much higher proportions of female students than the comparison group; and (2) in contrast to the comparison group, the academically excellent groups more frequently felt that instructors had geared courses to student interest and ability, felt more favorably toward credit by examination and separate classes for the best and slower students, and placed more value on grades.

        "description":"Assessment programs, which have recently been implemented in colleges around the country, have indirectly affected the quality of education in ways that are both researchable and measurable. Admissions and placement testing affect educational quality by separating high and low achievers, and making it possible for high-level texts to be used and advanced discussions to take place with high achievers. However, neither testing method ensures instructional quality in the classroom. Exit examinations, on the other hand, have a more direct impact on quality, in that they require that the curriculum be geared to provide the knowledge to be tested at the exit point and that instructors teach at the level to be tested. While exit examinations should not be used as the basis for awarding  or denying degrees, they can and should be used to monitor the curriculum by sampling student achievement on exit exams and providing feedback to faculty. The effects of implementing assessment programs on educational quality can be measured in terms of institutional climate before and after their implemantation and in terms of changes in areas such as type of student attracted to the institution, and graduation and transfer rates. Because the literature suggests that the high institutional expectations result in high student performance, minumum skills testing, which represents low-level expectations, should be avoided in favor of achievement tests, representing higher expectations.

Focusing on first-time in college students entering MDCC in the fall and winter terms of 1978-79 through 1981-82, the study sought demographic information on the students in the two categories and investigated the relationship between delayed entry and basic skills attainment. Study findings indicated that: (1) during this period, at least 50% of the MDCC students had delayed entry and more than 33% of all new students had been out of high school for more than 3 years prior to entering MDCC; (2) a higher proportion of White  and Black non-Hispanic students had delayed entry than Hispanic students; (3) in 1981-82, 52.2% of the Hispanic students enrolled at MDCC were categorized as direct entry; and (4) direct-entry students scored higher on placement tests than delayed-entry students, with placement test scores decreasing as the delay increased.

Students achieving above the placement test score on all three CGP tests and those falling below this score were analyzed as separate groups, and quartile ranges were determined for each of the three tests based on national norms. Study findings, based on the records of all full-time, first-time-in-college students entering MDCC  in fall 1980, included: (1) by summer 1982, 19.4% of the Hispanic students, 18.8% of the White students, and 7.6% of the Black students had graduated; (2) Hispanic students also had higher reenrollment rates (68.6%) than Black or White students (52.0% and 5l.7%, respectively); (3) retention and graduation rates were significantly higher for students scoring above the placement test score on the CGP than for those scoring below it within each ethnic group; and (4) 40% of the White students, 60% of the Hispanic students, and 80% of the Black students scored in the lowest two quartiles on the reading and written English portions of the CGP.

First, the paper highlights major factors arguing for strong links between education and industry, including the decline of labor-intensive manufacturing, the rise of high technology industries, the demographic shift to the Sunbelt, and the need for large-scale retraining programs. Next, in examining the role of community colleges in industrial development, the paper outlines the advantages that colleges can offer to industry and provides examples of programs developed in the Carolinas, California, and New Jersey that combine the resources of education and industry.  Then, the relationship between education and industry in Florida is examined in terms of demographic and economic changes in the state and legislative and administrative efforts to bring educators in contact with business. After examining the attitudes of Florida colleges toward industry and outlining their efforts to attract new businesses to their service areas, the paper provides suggestions for linking the colleges more closely with future economic development. Recommendations regarding the role of higher education in economic development and an annotated bibliography are appended. (HB)",

The first sections identify ACcess advisees as students scoring below the 9th grade level on any of four measures, define the Center's role, and demonstrate that, rather than draining the college's budget, ACcess makes a profit. After explaining why ACcess courses receive college credit and use letter grades, the report emphasizes that remediation is suitable and necessary at the college level. The next sections present evaluative data indicating that: (1) ACcess is successful in preparing students for degree programs; (2) former  ACcess advisees have higher course completion rates than non-ACcess students; (3) the English as a Second Language program prepares foreign students to succeed in degree programs; (4) remedial reading courses are effective in improving reading speed, comprehension, and vocabulary; and (5) tutoring and study skills instruction positively influence student performance. After explaining that ACcess courses are not padded with students who do not belong and noting that the program does not succeed with every student, the report presents the requirements which qualify students to leave the program and explains the school's policy toward \"ultra-high-risk\" students.

The literature review begins with a discussion of academic documentation, that is, the record of formal training experiences such as classroom training, work experience designed for academic credit, and the documentation of competence. It then covers non-academic documentation of formal training experiences in apprenticeship systems, the military, and private business and industry. An overview is then presented of the training records that are kept for individuals participating in Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) programs. In addition,  sample CETA programs are described to illustrate various academic and non-academic methods of documenting training experience. A 77-item annotated bibliography is then presented which summarizes technical reports, textbooks, journal articles, congressional testimony, final reports, and conference presentations that relate to academic and non-academic accrediting and CETA system approaches. For each document, bibliographic information, a description of its content, and ratings assigned by a panel of educational experts are provided. (Author/HB)",

        "description":"In developing understanding of social roles, preschool children proceed from an initial awareness of single behavioral categories to the ability to comprehend, first, simple relationships between categories, and second, complex systems of categories. At each developmental level, children show characteristic modes of distortion when faced with situations requiring skills more advanced than they possess. At the level of understanding single behavioral categories, preschool children demonstrate the process of &quot;globbing,&quot; in which several categories are mixed. At the level of comprehending simple relationships between categories, preschool children's behavior is characterized by stereotyping based on social evaluations of categories. With respect to the level at which complex systems  of categories are understood, typical distortions involve rigid or literal adherence to particulars of a social rule or category. However, it is important not to misinterpret this developmental sequence. Children do not show the same level across all situations; the degree of structure or support provided by the immediate context influences the expression of children's awareness of social categories in the same general situation. In addition, the degree of disparity between developmental levels shown in spontaneous contexts seems to increase in the late preschool years. (RH)",

In the primary grades reading/language arts program, children read short stories, folktales, fables, and poetry. The goal of these activities is to increase each child's comprehension through emphasis on listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Home activities supplementing the reading/language arts curriculum give children additional opportunities to use these skills at home. The  program in mathematics is an organized sequence of math skills and concepts organized by categories of skills associated with addition, subtraction, time and temperature, geometric figures, and fractions. Instruction is geared to meet grade-level objectives; the content of home math activity sheets is based on these objectives.

This pattern of societal \"reinforcement\" severely penalizes women. Social learning in childhood, particularly in games, much like on-the-job training in adulthood, has important outcomes in allowing access to privileged occupational positions. To explore such theses, a study was made of informal interaction during recess in three diverse school settings in the Cincinnati metropolitan area. The major purpose of the study was to investigate, in third and sixth graders, differences in reported and observed rates of participation in highly complex playground games. Consistent with previous related research, findings  showed that boys participated in complex games more than did girls. Two years following the playground study, 287 of the original group of 400 children were located and a survey of the children's occupational interests was taken, using the Project Talent Interest Inventory. Subsequently, a series of interviews was conducted with eight ninth-grade girls from the initial study's older cohort. Tentative conclusions were reached concerning the association between girls' earlier participation in playground activities and their current academic progress and occupational plans.

In addition, implications of the research for training and education are indicated. Components of Flavell and Wellman's (1977) definition of metamemory are used to organize the discussion. Specifically, sections of the paper (1) report research on children's understanding of the demands of memory tasks, (2) discuss young children's understanding that characteristics in the person can influence memory performance, (3) describe children's increasing recognition that task variables influence the ease of storing and retrieving information, (4) briefly indicate limitations of children's use of planful behavior or strategies in  storage and retrieval, (5) take up the issue of the relative absence of research on the interaction of metamemoric components, (6) review research on children's memory monitoring abilities and their use of feedback to modify recall, (7) discuss research on the relationship between metamemory and memory performance, and (8) suggest outcomes of metamemoric training. It is concluded that research indicates many differences between the metamemoric understanding of young children and that of older children and adults. The suggestion is made that recognition of these differences by early childhood educators can influence the type of environmental experiences provided children and the memory task demands made of them.

Subjects were members of 29 families in which divorces had taken place and 30 families in which marriages were intact. Each family had two children. Individual family members' responses to the 56-item six-scale version of Schaefer's (1965) Child's Report of Parental Behavior were obtained from 59 first-born and 59 second-born siblings, 29 divorced mothers, and 30 married mother/father pairs. Three dimensions of childrearing behavior assessed by the measurement instrument (acceptance, psychological control, and lax discipline) were the dependent variables for the study. For each dimension of parental behavior, analyses were computed for  differences between divorced and married families and for differences between dyads within each type of family. Data from fathers in divorced families were not obtained. A major finding of this study was that children in both types of families reported both their parents as rating relatively high on the dimension of acceptance. For this group, then, there was no support for the stereotype that children whose parents are divorced feel rejected by their parents. Additional findings are discussed. (RH)",

        "description":"While children approach performance situations with different combinations of motives, parenting and teaching practices can influence the development of each child's achievement behavior. Because achievement motivation is learned, and its development begins early in life with a critical stage during early childhood, it is necessary that pertinent experiences during these years be identified and planned to maximize development of achievement motivation. Active involvement, coping with frustration, self-challenges, and self-evaluation are some of the behaviors parents and teachers should model to influence children's striving to achieve. It is also important to teach children how to be successful and how to set standards that can be reached. Participation in play and sport is one  effective way children can develop achievement tendencies. In order to help low achievers experience the joy of realizing their potential, teachers and coaches can manipulate the probability of success and the incentive structure of a task. Positive behavior must be rewarded, and teachers and parents should help children acquire the ability to set realistic goals, reinforce themselves for hard work, and evaluate their ability and effort. Children enjoy participating in activities if they believe they will be successful; their beliefs are based on past experiences and on others' reactions to these experiences. (RH)",

Child competency measures assessed socioemotional development and Spanish and English language production, comprehension, and concept development. Parent interviews assessed attitudes and knowledge about education, expectations and aspirations regarding the child's  educational achievement, and parental involvement in the child's education. Surveys of Head Start classroom staff focused on the staff's understanding of bicultural/bilingual children and their attitudes and sensitivity towards these children as well as their ability to appropriately modify instruction. Implementation forms, ethnographic notes, and focused observation of individual children were also used to gather data. Analyses of variance and covariance assessed differences in test performance of experimental and comparison children.

Actually, the most productive response companies can make to women's presence in the workplace is the full assimilation of women into all areas and at all levels of corporate operations. Achieving full assimilation will require time, however. Presently, barriers to constructive change exist. These include women's unfamiliarity with the corporate environment, their need for career guidance and role models, and the high turnover rate among their group. Other barriers are traditional male perceptions of sex roles, the male-oriented corporate culture, need for maternity leave and other leave associated with parenting, the virtual absence of quality child care, and the problem of  relocation. Companies can develop, and some in fact have implemented, methods for identifying employee and environmental problems actually or potentially impeding productivity. Methods now in use by corporations include a task force approach to identifying critical work and family issues, &quot;surfacing&quot; groups for identifying potential productivity problems within a specific employee population, and an environmental scanning process for monitoring new trends and developments in the world and within the corporation. Regardless of what other steps are taken, success in resolving productivity problems requires an effective communication policy and evaluation procedures. (RH)",

When teachers make use of these two ideas, children can begin to understand the necessity of considering their audience and the ways such consideration can be accomplished. Along with becoming aware of audience, children may come to appreciate contextual elements of language use such as time, place, and purposes of communication. Teachers can appraise a child's language use to see whether or not audience has been considered. When the audience is neglected, corrective exercises  can be provided. Children's use of language to distance themselves from the here and now also has a number of implications for teachers' thinking. Ways of incorporating spatial, temporal, and imaginative distancing into the curriculum include using fairy tales, fables, and myths, and encouraging all types of writing. Teachers should realize that they are models of language use and that, in order to help children understand the relationship between language and places and times at a distance, children need to hear teachers using language beyond the scope of the curriculum.

        "description":"In order to determine the effect of day care center sponsorship on children's development, the authors examined the ways in which programs, objects and materials, and teacher/child interactions affected the preoperational behavior of 4-year-old black children in publicly and privately supported day care centers. A total of 120 4-year-olds (30 from public day care, 30 from private day care, and 60 middle- and lower-class controls not attending day care) served as subjects. All groups received selected sections of the comprehensive Piagetian Preschool Battery pretest and posttest for determining cognitive growth. Results indicated that while significant differences existed between day care center children and control children with respect to preoperational behavior, no significant  differences were found between public and private day care center children. Based on these findings, five suggestions for providing a quality day care center for children under 5 years of age are outlined. (MP)",

        "description":"An exploratory study making use of ethnographic and grounded theory methods was carried out with two Hispanic and two Black American working-class families. Exploration focused on how cognitive processes taking place in the natural setting of the family can best be understood. In order to uncover the intellectual interactions that take place in the course of everyday activities, several areas of household activity were examined, including household management, entertainment, religious and special interest activities, and family record keeping. This report presents extracts of the field materials as a basis for considering levels of data in ethnographic texts and indicates how these data may increase understanding of the many layers of experience and communication within families.  The report suggests, first, that examination of family members' everyday routine analysis of social behavior and education--members'&quot;everyday social science&quot;--is a useful approach to understanding cognitive or intellectual processes. Second, the analysis indicates that the interactional view of educative styles and agendas can be augmented through closer examination of the characterizations which family members make of each other with respect to their educative styles and agendas, as well as through an examination of pedagogic styles and agendas. In conclusion, some reflections are offered about the conditions under which ethnographic and grounded theory methods are appropriate. (RH)",

        "description":"To assess whether or not a child's development is going well, preschool teachers might ask the following questions: Does the child fall asleep easily and wake rested? Does the child eat with appetite? On the average, over a period of 3 or 4 weeks, does the child have bowel and bladder control? Does the child exhibit a range of emotions? Does the child's play vary over a period of time? Does the child occasionally exhibit curiosity, adventure, and even mischief? Does the child usually accept adult authority? Can the child initiate, maintain, and enjoy a relationship with one or more children? Is the child capable of sustained involvement, absorption, and interest in something outside of himself or herself? Does the child express spontaneous affection for one or more adults? Is the  child capable of enjoying the potentially \"good things of life,\" such as going on picnics and exploring new places or materials? The first three questions are particularly sensitive indicators of the child's development. The remaining questions, representing preschool teachers' most important goals for their pupils, can be easily inquired about or observed directly. Observation of a child's functioning on these criteria over a period of 3 weeks provides data usually sufficient for assessment purposes. (RH)",

Projects invite children's participation at various developmental levels; strengthen their capacity and disposition for involvement in work requiring sustained effort; and are ideal for mixed age, ability, or linguistic groups. Teachers have a central role to play in stimulating and suggesting projects as well as in organizing the flow of work and assignment of tasks. Several dimensions, reflected by the following questions, should be considered in project planning: Is the central topic or feature vivid to children? Are opportunities provided for a small group to act out roles? Can new elements be added? Do children have sufficient interest and experience to enable them to \"get inside\" roles and  act them out with feeling? Is the project locally and culturally salient? Is the project reasonably feasible, given particulars of setting, space, and available materials? Finally, is the topic and associated learning really worthwhile? In addition to the ways project work makes developmental sense, such activities also make cultural sense, enabling children to come to grips with their culture by rebuilding it and acting out the many roles they see around them.

Testimony asserts that the effect of the block grant approach to funding lead screening has been severe, with reductions in operating budgets and numbers of children screened. Furthermore, witnesses conclude that the block grant approach has failed with respect to lead-screening programs. Recommendations for remedying the situation, focusing mainly on the restoration of lead-screening programs to categorical funding status, are offered. Pediatricians, public health personnel, and  academicians giving testimony describe the effects of lead poisoning on the nervous systems of children and on the chromosomes of adult workers and point out the need for continued program funding.

Thirty-six students were recruited to spend July, 1981, on the University of Colorado campus to participate in this specially designed experientially focused program. Student participation was in the following activities: reading and writing assignments pertaining to basic scientific information on matters relating to Indian concerns in energy resources; on-site activities at five laboratories where scientific research was in progress; interacting with scientists, both Indian and non-Indian; visiting applied science facilities; and participating in experiential activities focusing on botany, climatology, geology, and survival skills.

Such communities find it especialy difficult to deal with rapid growth or decline, or a switch from one to the other. Small communities now enjoy greater autonomy, but at the cost of reduced federal aid. Freed from federal mandates, each community has been thrown far more on its own resources to manage its own growth or decline. For each situation there are separate questions. For rapidly growing communities: How much local population growth is desirable? Are growth and its effects predictable? How much will growth cost, who should pay for it, and how? For declining communities: How can local facilities and services be scaled down in an orderly fashion? How are cutbacks  to be decided, and which services are to be reduced for whom? For all communities: Are there predictable changes in service demands as population changes, or as types of residents change? What type of economic growth is best? How should communities equip themselves to plan for, and adjust to, change? One useful role for a rural development strategy for the 1980's would be to assist state and local governments in finding answers to these questions. (Author/BRR)",

        "description":"Using new information from the 1980 census and data from a special study of Indian Student Certification Forms in 1982, this revised report was submitted in lieu of the initial 1982 Report to Congress on the Definition of Indian. The report presents estimates which respond to the following points in the statutory mandate: number of Indian children eligible and served under part A of the Indian Education Act; consequences of eliminating descendants in the second degree; and options for changes in the definition and their consequences. The report reaches two major conclusions concerning the relation of definitions to counts of Indian children: the term Indian has no singular meaning and efforts to stabilize Indian counts by means of added precision in the questions relied on for  identifying Indian children are likely to have just the opposite effect. The appendices provide an analysis of defects in the estimates contained in the 1981 Report on the Definition of Indian; a description of the special study of the Indian Certification (506) Forms; an evaluation of the 1980 census data on Indians; and 10 detailed State tables pertaining to Indian children enrollment.

Beginning with the trust relationship between tribes and the U.S. government, particularly as relates to natural resources, various ways in which reservation economies have developed are discussed. Tribal governments' new authority and renewed ambitions for self-rule are covered as is tribal efforts at determining who is an Indian. The BIA's role in defusing tribal tensions and untangling jurisdictions is described as well as its programs for improving tribal administrative abilities. In terms of improving life for the individual, tribes and the BIA are making efforts to protect life-ways, get children off to a good start, provide education for all ages, encourage tribally run schools, furnish  special social services, promote child welfare assistance programs on reservations, offer counseling and guidance for social problems, and recognize that the greatest resource of all is the Indian people. The 12 BIA area offices are featured (Phoenix, Sacramento, Muskogee, Albuquerque, Aberdeen, Navajo, Anadarko, Billings, Portland, Juneau, Minneapolis, and Eastern) with highlights of activities, successes, and problems for each area. Listings of the BIA FY 1980 budget, Commissioners of Indian Affairs from 1824-1980, and lands under BIA jurisdiction as of September 30, 1979, complete the document. (BRR)",

Recommendations center on possible revisions or amendments to the Act, based on the experience of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and 12 colleges which enrolled 4,254 students, for an FTE student count of 1,958 persons. Five appendices complete the document. Appendix I contains various forms necessary for a feasibility study  for tribally controlled community colleges. Appendix II provides pages from the November 21, 1979, &quot;Federal Register&quot; giving a summary on grants for tribally controlled community colleges and Navajo community colleges. Appendix III is a mission, philosophy, and goals statement demonstrating commonalities of the different tribes involved in the community college movement. Appendix IV graphically depicts organizational structure and accreditation status of tribally controlled community colleges. Appendix V is the latest training and technical assistance activity report made by the American Indian Higher Education Consortium contractors. (BRR)",

The case studies provide information on the environment and environmental problems and concerns of various countries, insights into that country's attitude toward the environment and education, and models of programs created for that country's situation. Many of them incorporate international cooperation or a global perspective. The opening section provides a philosophical overview of environmental education and strategies to promote environmental education internationally. Major sections which follow address multinational,  national, community, and single-institution programs. Multinational programs are those which involve institutions, organizations, or governments of more than one country. National programs are single programs intended for use throughout a nation. Community programs occur in one community or localized area of a country, and focus on that community's environment. Single-institution programs are undertaken at one school, university, or museum. Case studies are also categorized in a matrix found in the introduction to the document. Programs are arranged by world region, target audience, environmental/education emphasis, and sponsor in the matrix. (JN)",

It attempts to explore the upper content limits of the mathematics that such students can understand and appreciate. An innovative feature is that some of the more advanced parts are not to be teacher-taught in the classical mode; students read several books on their own, with the teacher then leading a discussion of what was read. The contents of the program are listed, with a detailed description in an appendix. The role of logic and intuition, enrichment and acceleration, teacher preparation, and evaluation are considered,  followed by some questions and answers about the Project. (MNS)",

At Site A, the program was implemented at the middle school level (grades 5-8), where most mathematics teachers were specialists; they accepted the problem-solving activities after some initial hesitation. At Site B, the program was implemented in grades 3-8, though most often in grades 4 and 5, usually by teachers who were not mathematics specialists. They varied in their belief that the activities would improve problem-solving ability, and, even though in year 2 they were allowed to develop lessons involving problem-solving strategies tied more closely to textbooks and tests, problem solving was never completely accepted by  all teachers. At Site A, 80 teachers were trained, eventually affecting over 300 classes, and the school board pledged continued support. At Site B, progress was slower. Two major effects were noted at both sites: (1) teachers viewed TOPS favorably and commented on its positive impact on students' mathematics and thinking skills; and (2) TOPS students had better test scores than non-TOPS students; differences were significant at Site A but not Site B.

Inquiry teaching within the context of the study addresses teacher behaviors facilitating student acquisition of concepts, processes, and skills through active involvement with general inquiry strategies. Specific outcome criteria which appeared in the research reviewed for the analysis and judged as falling within the confines of this definition include: knowledge of science processes, inquiry instructional strategy, indirect verbal behavior, accepting interpersonal behaviors, increased wait-time questioning behavior, higher  cognitive questioning behavior, and discovery instructional strategy. Sixty-eight studies, involving at least one of these outcomes associated with inquiry strategy, were selected for analysis. Relevant variables (114) were identified and coded according to: study form/design characteristics, teacher/teacher trainee characteristics, student characteristics, treatment characteristics, outcome characteristics, and effect size calculation characteristics. Because descriptive reporting of teacher and/or student characteristics which might affect outcome measures was sporadic and occurred with frequencies too low to support analysis, the analysis was divided into categories focusing on variables associated with: methodological aspects of studies, study treatments, and the variety of teacher  education outcomes sought.

The curriculum has seven parts, each one with a dictated sequence including well-defined objectives, suitable activities, and assigned materials, with little degree of freedom for the teacher. A primary concern for the study was to identify reasons for dissatisfaction which has accompanied new science curricula implementation. The sample included 42 junior high school teachers in 28 schools spread throughout the central area of Israel, and included urban, rural, and kibbutz schools. Discrepancies between original curriculum intentions and their translation to formal materials, and discrepancies between developed learning activities and their operation in the  classroom were examined, focusing on sub-variables related to the objectives, materials, activities, and strategies between ideal (philosophical directions) and formal (translation of ideal into tangible materials) levels. Results are reported for non-traditional sub-variables implemented completely, traditional variables implemented fully, and non-traditional sub-variables implemented in ways which were not in accordance with the aims of the curriculum developers. Although some objectives were implemented (including those related to subject matter and integrating laboratory work into regular class sessions), others (mainly those related to affective domain and higher order inquiry) were partially/totally lacking.

Entries cited in psychological abstracts, dissertation abstracts, Scientific American, Resources in Education (RIE), and Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE) were grouped under the following categories: definition, information transmission, advanced organization, attention holding ability, and media construction (the largest category). General trends within each category are discussed. Definitions of visual literacy are considered in the first category, defining a visually literate person as one able to perceive and understand a situation when using pictures of 35mm slides, complemented by either oral or written instruction. Modes of information intake and reproduction and visual/verbal organizers, as  they affect learning, are then discussed. The realism theory and related variables are reviewed in the media construction category. Continuum theorists hypothesize that visuals at the realistic end of the spectrum facilitate greater amounts of learning than visuals from other locations on the continuum, bounded at one end by simple abstract &quot;line drawings&quot; and at the other end by photographs of the actual object. This theory was found not to hold since a greater amount of learning was facilitated by simple line abstract drawings.

Unit 1 focuses on biological and psychological explanations of being female; the socialization process; Black, Native American, and immigrant women; schooling and its function as a gender-role modifier; and the effect of conflicting forces in one's life. Unit 2 discusses the patriarchal family; the family in American history; matriarchies, communes, and extended families; women alone and female friendships; women and work in America; and caring for women's bodies, souls, and minds. Topics in the final unit include the status of women, women as agents of social change, and women as artists. Athletics,  centering, assertiveness training, and consciousness raising are also discussed. Materials from literature and the social sciences form the focus for each unit, which contains an introduction, study questions, and an annotated list of required and suggested reading. The appendix includes guidelines for oral history interviews and research papers. A general bibliography includes a guide to audiovisual materials. (KC)",

The study focused on models for museums, theaters (profit and non-profit), symphony, ballet, opera, and dance. The report details four objectives of the project: to identify useful databases and studies on the economics of the visual and performing arts, construct a series of econometric models characteristic of the arts industry, acquire data and create analytical files, and estimate and analyze the models. Models for each of the arts forms are presented in detail as well as a model for all the art forms combined. Data were obtained from the Ford Foundation, Theatre Communications Group, Center for Policy Research, other foundation  reports, books, and periodicals. Variables included demand; cost; price; federal, regional, and foundation grants; private contributions; capacity extension factor; fund raising expenditures; and subscription sales. The estimation process, in which the acquired data were applied to the conceptual models, indicates that preliminary efforts at model estimation accurately describe a large part of the behavior of various organizations.

Information was collected in three ways. Questionnaires were sent to 50% of all recipients (858) in each year from 1967 through 1979. The response rate was over 75%. Two workshops, which focused primarily on questions of program operations and policy, were held with 15 recipients. Personal interviews, focusing on the timing of the grant, activities during the fellowship, impact on aesthetic content of their work, and resulting recognition, were conducted with 25 recipients. Ninety-two percent of respondents said the  most important impact of the fellowships was the change they experienced in confidence and commitment. The major benefit was increased time for work.

The Cognitive Style Questionnaire, administered to 120 freshmen, identified those students who obtain meaning from spoken words, numerals, or mathematical symbols; have the ability to place themselves in another's position; and are influenced by peers as those who would benefit from the simulation-gaming method. Students who obtain meaning from written words, numerals, or mathematical symbols, direct their own behavior, and make their own decisions were identified as learning best from the lecture-discussion approach. Students were then randomly assigned to courses using one of the two approaches. The experimental class  integrated simulation with the lecture method; the control class used the lecture method exclusively. Experimental classes used role playing, team membership, and a computer simulation to demonstrate microeconomic and macroeconomic concepts. Students responsive to simulation techniques in the experimental classes received higher grades than their counterparts in the control classes; conversely, students responsive to lecture-discussion methods recorded higher grades in the control classes than their counterparts in the experimental classes.

In the third phase, 697 of the 1148 women underwent a medical examination. The final phase consisted of follow-up psychiatric interviews with 160 subjects. Findings show that the response to middle age and to climacterium is shaped by  ethnic origin, there is no linear relationship between psychological well-being and the degree of modernity, and the cessation of fertility is welcomed by women in all cultures.

Frank Herbert's \"Dune\" formed the core of the course; additional works included Vonnegut's \"Player Piano\" and LeGuin's \"The Left Hand of Darkness.\" Students read both science fiction and theory weekly, wrote one-paragraph abstracts of everything they read, kept weekly journals, and wrote an original anthropological science fiction short story. A key function was for the class to take responsibility for the course,  with the instructor selecting readings, evaluating student work, insuring that everyone was permitted to speak, and seeing that all pertinent points were made. Students formed a committee which met outside of class to read and react to each other's journals.

The six problems involve student learning and motivation; the focus on classroom management and control; lack of a variety of teaching and evaluation methods; a focus on specific facts and broad conclusions rather than on critical thinking and values; disagreement on goals and objectives; and insufficient public support. Instructions for participating in the 12-step model form the major portion of the document and include planning to plan, deciding on a rationale, selecting goals and  objectives, modifying objectives, mapping the curriculum, and determining the scope of the program. Participants then engage in choosing content, identifying and selecting materials, tying program objectives to text objectives, planning for program evaluation, installing and maintaining the program, and modifying the program. Each step contains background information, an activity, and reproducible handouts. A list of resources, sources of instructional objectives, sample formats for scope-and-sequence statements, publishers of social studies materials, and a paper on evaluation as an instructional tool complete the guide.

A study sought to determine the employment patterns of former education students at Texas A & M University and to compare these employment patterns with their academic profiles. Research questions concerned: (1) academic ability of former education students who are teaching, measured in terms of their SAT scores and cumulative grade point ratios, compared to academic ability of former students who are not  teaching; and (2) employment options former teacher education students exercise. Six hundred sixty-eight education and agriculture graduates comprised the study's population. Findings revealed that approximately 70 percent of the 668 individuals in this sample are thought to be teaching. Those employed as teachers earned higher grades as undergraduates and had slightly higher SAT scores than their counterparts who were not teaching. (JD)",

A sample of 26 secondary school cooperating teachers agreed or disagreed with previous research findings which indicated that cooperating teachers believed the most pressing problems were concerned with knowing university expectations, field experience students' attendance, and field experience students' lack of teaching skills. The Ohio University sample indicated the most pressing problems as being the cooperating teachers' lack  of time to spend with field experience students, lack of audiovisual and teaching skills, and field experience students' low interest in getting to know other school personnel. Field experience students ranked as the greatest problems their inability to operate audiovisual equipment, and the university's lack of knowledge of what they had done or ought to do. Cooperating teachers indicated that field experience students were of assistance in paperwork, released cooperating teachers for small group and individualized work, provided some increased student motivation, and had a positive influence on the class. Potential problem areas were identified as field experience students' passive attitudes, difficulty in placing some field experience students, and limited university involvement. Field  experience students' evaluation of the experience indicated a high level of perceived attainment of the attitudes, skills, and understanding desired by the cooperating teachers. (JD)",

Descriptions are given of the gradual polarization of points of view on womens' athletics, and the growth of opposition in the federal government to affirmative action in cases involving civil rights.

Despite diversity and local autonomy present in its system, American higher education shows a substantial degree of coherence. Students and faculty move with reasonable ease from one institution to another. The autonomy of individual faculty members is countered by a complex network of influences: (1) prior educational and work experience and background characteristics; (2) textbooks and other instructional materials; (3) direct contact with other faculty members (e.g., curriculum committees,  departmental discussions, informal contact); (4) professional literature; (5) professional associations and learned societies; and (6) the accreditation process. The first section of this paper describes the nature of the faculty network and its constraining influence on faculty teaching, educational content, and standards. The second section discusses how the effects of faculty views and expectations on student learning, as constrained by the existing system of influences, are or might be assessed. Procedures are described that would extend knowledge of the educational accomplishments of the higher education system while allowing for its diversity. (JD)",

Two reasons are offered for this slippage; the first has to do with the ambiguous state of the community college faculty. These teachers are said to have difficulty defining their roles because they feel a powerlessness in dealing with the college administration and in having to lower their standards for instruction and grading in dealing with their students. The second major reason for slippage given is the past and present trend toward student consumerism. The current reality of teachers having to resort to advertising for classes and schools having to advertise for easy programs is seen as having a detrimental effect on the attitudes of students and  teachers. The vocational education emphasis that the community college has taken is traced, and arguments are offered for and against it. A program, established in two Florida community colleges, that has effectively raised academic standards is briefly described. (JM)",

        "description":"This paper, on the state of inservice teacher education, is divided into five parts. The paper's first part, which focuses on the context in which teaching occurs and on the role of the teacher, points out that, while the common denominator in the study of teaching is the teacher/learner relationship, social issues also affect teachers and teaching. In the paper's second section, a profile is drawn of the current state of inservice education, including the magnitude of the endeavor, knowledge base, program content, program delivery, and evaluation. The third part of the paper gives examples of five high quality inservice programs and describes identified characteristics of effective inservice: client involvement, recognition of district and school needs, focus on instruction of  children, skill-driven training, and in-class observation, feedback, and coaching. In the fourth part, three main high level issues confronting education today are examined: the politicalization of inservice education, lack of institutional commitment, and the problem of incorporating inservice into the responsibilities of elementary and secondary teachers. The final section of the paper presents a recommendation for the founding of an American Education Congress. A brief discussion outlines the potential strengths of such a Congress in bringing about consensual policy setting and monitoring of education, specifically teacher education. (JD)",

        "description":"An overview is presented of the scope and findings of the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) studies, which analyzed student achievement in 22 nations, one of which was the United States. Using these findings, this paper identifies national differences in the performance of pupils representing the United States and other nations which are part of a set of relatively more developed countries. Three principal considerations in the differences found--time spent on the subject, curriculum content, and student, teacher, and family expectations--are discussed, along with the principal findings: (1) Among more advanced countries and students, there were no marked deviations in the pattern of achievement test scores; (2) Time given to  instruction and opportunity to learn were two key characteristics associated with high test scores and achievement; (3) Curriculum content was consistently and significantly related to achievement scores in the less developed countries and to only a slightly smaller degree in the more developed countries; and (4) Inferences with respect to the place of expectations in student achievement were largely limited to personal expectations and motivation of the individual student.

A profile is offered of the competencies beginning teachers should command and of the qualities that should be contained in programs offered by schools of education. Principal elements of critical components in teacher education are discussed: (1) general education component, which provides a sound foundation in the liberal arts and sciences; (2) preprofessional studies, in which prospective teachers study subjects that provide a theoretical base and related skills in the social and  behavioral sciences; (3) academic specialization component, the in-depth study of the subject that the prospective teacher will teach; and (4) professional studies component, which transforms the educated individual into a professional teacher. It is pointed out that field and clinical laboratory experiences enable teacher candidates to master pedagogical knowledge and skills to a level which allows them to enter the classroom with the confidence of knowing how to cope with planned and unexpected events.

Special attention is given to how values, ideology, and various cultural patterns may serve to enhance motivation to achieve in the classroom. In considering what determines motivation and personal investment in educational pursuits, the following factors are discussed: (1) individual personality; (2) teacher expectations; (3) dimensions of academic tasks; (4) sociocultural expectancies; and (5) family background and aspirations. Recent research on motivation and achievement provides discussion on the increasing emphasis being placed on judgments that the individual makes in relationship to perceived situations. Four components that figure prominently in motivation are discussed: (1)  self-identity; (2) perceived autonomy and responsibility; (3) sense of direction; and (4) sense of competence.

It focuses on changes in the student from the beginning to the end of the educational program. The &quot;value-added&quot; approach would involve the testing of students entering a school or college for the first time to determine their entering levels of competence for purposes of counseling and course placement. These initial &quot;pretest&quot; scores would not only provide both students and teachers with information about the student's specific strengths and weaknesses, but they would also constitute a baseline against which to measure later student progress (&quot;value-added&quot;). Following the completion of appropriate  courses or programs of study, the same or similar tests would be readministered to measure student growth. This approach, unlike traditional measures such as the reputational view, the resources view, or the outcomes view, promotes equity because it diverts attention away from mere acquisition of resources and focuses instead on their effective utilization. Any school is capable of attaining a significant degree of &quot;excellence&quot; through this method. (JM)",

Three areas of change in students were consistently noted in the descriptions: children today know more, are freer, and grow up more rapidly. More autonomous, and armed with greater knowledge, children emerge from childhood more rapidly. Societal influences have had much impact on children, parents, teachers, and schooling. Television and other media have also consistently influenced children and schooling. Changes in the family structure, the relationship between parents and children, the increase in peer group influence, and in children's attitudes toward teachers and school are equally important. Educators today are faced with youngsters  who, by the time they reach high school, have acquired many material possessions, been entertained and partially educated by the media, achieved a sophisticated degree of sexual awareness, and attained self-reliance by virtue of changes in the quality of family support. These young people, having achieved many visible features of adult status, find it difficult to think of themselves as needing still more preparation for life. (JD)",

        "description":"Individual teacher behaviors, characteristics, and instructional methods make an important difference in what and how well students learn. Children enter school with a wide variety of differences in family background and aspirations, expectations, and previous learning. Research on learning in the home, nursery school, and kindergarten points out the differences between the learning environments of school and home settings, and differences between teachers' and parents' expectations and approaches to teaching. Once in the school environment, the student encounters a variety of instructional styles and classroom expectations in teachers which often pose problems as they move from class to class or grade to grade. In addition, a student's background may conflict with the general  school culture or that of a particular teacher. In this paper, which discusses current trends and research on this topic, questions are raised about instructional practices such as tracking, pull-out instruction, and ability grouping on the grounds that they often create difficult teaching/learning situations. The general effects of teacher expectations on student performance are discussed with suggestions for improvement. (JD)",

        "description":"This report is a comprehensive account of the accumulated research on the measurement of quality of effort and its significance in understanding the achievement of college students with regard to the College Student Experiences questionnaire (Pace, 1979). Results are based on the responses of 12,000 undergraduate students from 40 different colleges over a 3 year period. The questionnaire contained 14 quality of effort scales, on which students rated themselves on items concerned with the use of college facilities and the use of personal and social opportunities. The other parts of the questionnaire included items that enabled researchers to determine relationships between quality of effort and achievement and among many elements that might help to explain those relationships. A  major conclusion of the study granted the importance of all elements that influence &quot;who goes where&quot; to college. The study also found that, once the students got to college, what counted most was not who they were or where they were but what they did. &quot;Quality&quot; effort appears to be what counts in achieving in college.

        "description":"Consisting of four papers, this study examines university entrance examinations in France, Great Britain, and West Germany and compares them to similar tests in the United States on the basis of three subjects: world history, language study, and biology. The first paper, &quot;The Relationship of the Examinations to the Secondary School Age Group&quot; (Nicholas Farnham), discusses the following examinations: (1) the French Baccalaureate; (2) the German Arbitur; (3) the British GCE-A Level (the advanced level of the General Certificate Examination); (4) the International Baccalaureate (accepted by universities in all countries); and (5) the United States Advanced Placement Test (APT) and Achievement Tests. The second paper, &quot;World History&quot; (Robert A. McCaughey), discusses separately the  breadth of each examination and evaluates the capacity of each for self criticism (of its own country's history). The author finds no reason to believe that American students taking the APT are less equipped for serious study than are European students. The third paper, &quot;Language Study,&quot; by Richard I. Brod, looks at each country's tests for second language competency. The author finds the United States' College Entrance Examination Board test lacking because it does not approach the universality of the other countries' tests. The author finds the APT much more satisfactory. The fourth paper, &quot;Biology&quot; (William V. Mayer), after discussing each country's test in detail, finds the United States' Achievement Tests have breadth in the subject matter of the test questions but no depth. Although  the author feels the APT is better, in comparison, the United States biology examinations do not compare well. They are less demanding, more detail laden, require no writing, and do not concentrate on higher educational objectives. (JM)",

Debates over the desirability of a common or core curriculum for secondary schools as opposed to different programs are discussed. Demands for traditional academic disciplines and for vocational education and the way in which the changing needs of the labor market shape the school curriculum are examined. In the second section, tests and examinations as instruments of standard-setting are discussed. A distinction is made between those tests which monitor achievement but do not motivate or guide study, and those for which schools prepare students and which influence both the content and achievement levels of each  course. The nearly complete absence of European-style examinations in American schools is documented and its implications for educational standards considered. Comparison is made between the American approach to student assessment and that of France and England. Suggestions are made in the final section on ways of improving standards in the American schools. (JD)",

From these sectors come demands for accountability; community influence; and a heavy commitment of resources to maintaining good attendance, discipline, and public relations, which are the responsibility of the school administration. Secondary school curriculum consists of a broad range of diverse courses. This diversity is the result of perceived student needs and, in particular, the public schools' vulnerability to pressure from advocacy groups who, by their special demands, shape and increase curriculum offerings. Responsibility for curriculum falls to the teachers,  who must instruct and relate to students, and not burden the administration with disciplinary problems. Fragmented, diverse, open, and fluid curriculum responds to the needs and demands of students with widely divergent abilities, attitudes toward education, and career plans. The critical factor which differentiates a &quot;good&quot; school from one not so good is the orientation of the majority of the students in the school toward superior academic education. (JD)",

In reviewing studies done on teenage reading and television viewing habits, it becomes obvious that many teenagers today show little purposive striving toward goals of intellectual development, and they invest little mental effort in learning. General observations of schools today indicate that they are profoundly  diverse, porous, loosely-coupled systems and that the education system in general is panacea-ridden. These aspects of schools operate to complicate the problem and to thwart attempts at improvement. Recommendations for improvement include: (1) federal and state policies must be framed as adaptive strategies; (2) instructional strategies within a locale must be adaptive; (3) cognitive psychology needs to be researched more thoroughly; (4) cognitive instructional techniques must be taught to teachers; and (5) technology must be used in the classroom.

Gradual shifting of values and fluctuating attitudes are examined in the broad areas of authority, educational theory, the idea of merit, and moral perspectives. It is pointed out that public disastisfaction with the schools has been felt for well over a decade and that it has been responsive to the actual vicissitudes of American schooling, specifically the easing of both academic and disciplinary demands. It is also noted that the public's attitude toward schooling is not shared by a great many experts in education, who may agree that there has been a decline in quality, but see this as the price to be paid for universal education. In probing changes in the philosophy  of education, an effort is made to clarify the reasons for the loss of consensus as to the functions of the schools and the values they are meant to embody and teach.

The first, by Robert Sternberg and Richard Wagner, makes connections between cognitive processing of information and the metacognitive processing of one's own approach to a situation and the information contained therein. The second, by Deborah Stipek, implies that metacognitive processing depends upon intrinsic motivation and may be stunted by structured extrinsic reinforcement. The third, by Walter Doyle, holds that evaluation and control pressures in classrooms are detrimental to intelligence and motivation to learn. Each paper is synthesized and a set of recommendations is offered for the redefinition of the student role in learning. Four approaches are discussed: (1) build on the foundations of direct  instruction; (2) distinguish short-term and long-term values of learning; (3) develop student capacity for self-management of work; and (4) ground higher-order learning on ideals and exemplars. A discussion is presented of the work conditions required for teachers to implement the sort of curricular ideas suggested in the papers, focusing on management of teachers' agendas, resources, and incentives.

Evidence suggesting that external rewards and punishment can have negative long-term effects on achievement motivation is reviewed. A discussion is given of theoretical and empirical work demonstrating that it is not reinforcement per se that influences children's behavior, but beliefs about one's competencies, perceptions of the cause of achievement outcomes, and values regarding achievement-related rewards that determine behavior. For maintaining high motivation in children, the following strategies are recommended: (1) evaluating on a mastery rather than a  normative standard; (2) minimizing salient public evidence of individual childrens' performance; (3) considering errors as a normal aspect of mastering new skills; and (4) providing opportunities for all children to demonstrate competence in activities valued by the teacher. Encouraging students to trust their own evaluations and to set reasonable goals and providing greater autonomy in learning situations are suggested to help them develop independent, self-directed learning strategies.

(3) Students must have a high level of &quot;sociability&quot; to get along with their peers as well as with the faculty. (4) Colleges and professors assume a certain and sustaining degree of &quot;motivation&quot;; professors do not feel  it is their duty to interest the student. (5) Research indicates that those students with clearly defined goals and a sense of &quot;direction&quot; are more likely to persist and attain a college degree.

Approximately 100 fifth grade pupils were given a battery of four ability tests, learning materials dealing with the heart and the flow of blood, and immediate post-tests to assess acquisition of verbal and spatial aspects of the content. The Joreskog LISREL technique was used to analyze the main effects and interactions. It was found that acquisition of spatial content is superior in the audio-visual treatment, and that girls high in general ability perform better when listening than when reading. The results are  interpreted in relation to research on visualization suppression and sex differences in lateralization of processing. (Author/PN)",

Causal modeling techniques were used to examine the relationships among implementation of a formative evaluation system, structure of instructional programs, and achievement for 117 students in grades 1-7. The Accuracy of Implementation Rating Scale monitored implementation procedures and the Structure of Instruction Rating Scale measured the degree of instructional lesson structure students received. Reading achievement measures were collected three times over the 5-month period by 31 trained teachers. Measurement,  structure, and achievement were stable across time and measurement had a short-lived effect on achievement. Measuring student performance had an early effect on achievement, as did silent reading practice. Determining the effect of implementation of an evaluation system or structure of lessons and student achievement was not realized via the present analysis. The appendices contain the Accuracy of Implementation Rating Scale and the Structure of Instruction Rating Scale. (Author/PN)",

In the first study, 30 elementary-age children were tested four times on the same forms of the Woodcock Reading Mastery Tests and the Ginn 720 Reading Passage measures. Group stability coefficients, within-subject reliability coefficients, and group correlations between variables each were calculated on the basis of one or two testings and then on the basis of aggregations over four testings. On the standardized measure and on the oral passage reading correct rate score, aggregation had little impact; however, on the oral passage reading error rate score, aggregation substantially increased all reliability indices. In the second study, 78 children were tested 10 times  on alternate forms of two reading measures and one written expression measure. Group stability coefficients were calculated on the basis of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 testings. For the oral words-in-isolation reading correct score, aggregation had little effect, whereas aggregating over occasions and test forms dramatically improved the stability of the oral words-in-isolation reading error score and the written expression score. The reliability and criterion validity of short, simple measures demonstrated their suitability as measures of academic performance. (Author/PN)",

To investigate the test's construct validity, the literacy test performances between groups of adults at three education and income levels were compared with performace on an independent multiple-choice cloze test of communications skills in reading. The groups also completed demographic descriptions. A substantial correlation between the communications total score on the literacy test and the independent measure  of reading ability indicated strong support for the test's validity. The proportion passing the mathematics standard and communications standard increased markedly from the low- to high-level functional groups. Mean scores behaved similarly, indicating strong statistical support for validity. (CM)",

Already, the microcomputer has provided the key to the solution of some previously overwhelming methodological problems. It has enabled investigators to conduct exciting new lines of research while creating more general implications for future disciplined inquiry within the educational community. Educational researchers, aware of the importance of this new technology, are seeking guidance. There are primarily three areas of application for the researcher who is considering the use of a microcomputer: (1) use of the microcomputer to control experiments, (2) use of the microcomputer to collect data, and (3) use of the microcomputer to process data and results of  research. This monograph reviews state-of-the-art microcomputer applications and provides guidance for evaluating and comparing microcomputers, for pursuing research objectives with microcomputers, and for ferreting out further information concerning microcomputers.

These problems include identifying and obtaining appropriate studies, extracting estimates of effect size from the studies, coding or classifying studies, analyzing the data, and reporting the results of the data analysis. Earlier work by Glass, McGaw, and Smith describes methods for dealing with these problems: and has generated a great interest in the development of systematic statistical theory for meta-analysis. This monograph supplements the existing literature on meta-analysis by providing a unified treatment of rigorous statistical methods for meta-analysis. These methods provide a mechanism  for responding to criticisms of meta-analysis, such as that meta-analysis may lead to oversimplified conclusions or be influenced by design flaws in the original research studies. Contents include: indices of effect size, statistical analysis of effect size data, assumptions and the statistical model, estimations of effect size, an analogue to the analysis of variance for effect sizes, the effects of measurement error on effect size, statistical analysis when correlations or proportions are the index of effect magnitude, and statistical analysis for correlations as effect magnitude.

The main focus of the paper is on specific, relatively technical points that influence the validity of assessment. Since technical concerns are only one of the factors influencing the validity of placements, this paper is organized into two sections: the context of LD identification and technical issues in LD assessment. Specific propositions regarding the context of LD identification are advanced with supporting evidence: overidentification in the LD category; ambiguity in the definition of LD and local idiosyncratic criteria; students' needs for special help; parental demand and pressure from regular  education; teaching and system failures; and the consequences of overidentification. Technical topics related to steps in the assessment process are referral bias; normal variability and clinicians' vertigo; technical adequacy of tests; specialists' knowledge of test adequacy and measurement concepts; significant ability-achievement discrepancy; interpreting subtest scatter; using age norms to evaluate processing deficits; behavorial indicators, informal assessments, and clinical hypothesis testing; and exclusion and bias. Recommendations made include contextual changes that are likely to help clinicians be willing to make more rigorous diagnoses and improved training and retraining of specialists. (PN)",

There has been no effective way to bridge the gap between statistical relationships and theoretical propositions. The application of linear structural equation models helps to bridge this gap. Empirical propositions are not developed. Rather, the statistical relationships between imperfectly measured variables are used to estimate the true effects between theoretical propositions. In this sense theory and method are brought together. This approach to theory construction allows for surplus meaning in theoretical constructs and emphasizes systemic meaning for these concepts. The approach is especially valuable for subjective orientations such as symbolic interaction. It  is applied here to an example of family research. (Author/CM)",

Two different standards were used to gauge observed growth of groups in each category. The first required growth equal to or exceeding normal growth or, in other words, sustaining normal growth levels or exceeding them. All four category groups exceeded the standard of &quot;normal growth&quot; in both academic areas except for the 2 year interrupted group in mathematics. The second standard required growth equaling or exceeding the growth of the 3 year continuous  STP group. The three other groups failed this standard in both subjects with the exception of the 2 year continuous group in mathematics.

The gain score model used by the Federal Reserve Bank and the School District of Philadelphia in their &quot;What Works in Reading?&quot; study is successively refined using the LISREL structural equation program. First the Philadelphia data base is described and then difficulties of using gain score models are discussed. Regression estimates of the different models are described. Procedures dealing with identification, specification, and collinearity are examined. A sensitivity analysis of measurement and specification error shows the degree to which estimated parameters are affected by researchers' assumptions. The reanalysis shows improvements in the  understanding of achievement test data and the logic of how to analyze data bases with longitudinal dependent variables. (Author)",

        "description":"A sample of slightly over 1500 students was drawn from even-numbered grades in public schools of the U.S. Virgin Islands, and was given the 1973 edition of the Stanford Achievement Test (in grades 2,4,6, &amp; 8) and the Test of Academic Skills (grades 10 and 12) to assess student academic achievement in the basic skill areas of mathematics, reading, and English language. This report describes phase I of the data analysis, which involved the determination of levels of content validity and reliability of the scores obtained from these Virgin Islands students on these tests which were originally standardized on continental United States populations. The results indicate that the tests are content valid for use in Virgin Islands public schools at these grade levels and that the scores  obtained are at least as reliable as those obtained using continental U.S. students during the test standardization procedures.

        "description":"Content, instructional, and curricular validity, as related to certification tests, are examined. All three deal with content validity but the domain differs among the the three. Certification tests must have instructional validity, i.e., the test must be valid both with respect to the domain used to define the minimum competencies and the instructional content domain (what is taught in the schools). The test items must be representative of the objectives domain but not necessarily representative of the instructional content domain. Whether a test has content validity with respect to the domain specified by the curricular materials is important only insofar as it is a surrogate for instructional validity. Curricular validity should not be used as a criterion to establish the  instructional validity of a certification test. For tests of certification, a relatively large percentage of the items should represent topics that are covered by all students in the district and/or state (to assure that certification tests have instructional validity). A prototypic measurement of curricular and instructional validity for elementary school mathematics illustrates these points. (Author/PN)",

To analyze the relevancy and appropriateness of tests for educational decision making at the school district level, three studies examined the quality of teacher judgment in test development and implementation, the utility of test information to teachers, and what components of &quot;achievement-on-the-test&quot; are attributable to motivational, personality, and idiosyncratic factors. Fourth and eighth grade teachers and students in the Springfield (IL) School District were administered either teacher surveys evaluating student performance and motivation on mathematics test  items, or student measures of mathematics achievement-related motives. Ninth grade teachers assessed the utility of test information varied by ability, and ninth and eleventh grade teachers were interviewed regarding test information. Indications were that the role of test information is an incremental one, enhancing teacher estimates of performance; item scaling by teachers and latent trait theory are roughly similar; and, although correlations between various achievement related motives could not be determined, a substantial portion of performance variance is attributable to motivation.

Evaluation issues explored in this paper are: reliance on observer descriptions and participant ratings, effects on students and instructional staff of intensive  observations, effects on students of frequent requests for feedback and evaluative reactions, and the extent to which professionals can be expected to use materials as they have been developed.

Procedures for validating sequences of instructional units, or learning hierarchies, were found to fall into two general categories. One category included procedures based on coefficients of dependence, while the other category contained procedures based on more complete descriptions of the relationships between units of instruction, usually a mathematical model. Procedures based on coefficients were found to provide insufficient information for optimal sequencing of units. Procedures based on mathematical models were also found to be inadequate, but the model-based approach was found to have potential for dealing with the problem of sequencing.  Recommended future research emphasizes improving model-based procedures so that they provide more information useful for determining the optimal order of instructional units. (Author/PN)",

Results showed that, when the 20th percentile criterion was used, 40 percent of all kindergarteners failed the BLST. In order to minimize erroneous classifications, children with limited English proficiency were re-directed to their respective language arts programs. The speech therapists consulted with the classroom teacher on the remaining children to determine the necessity of initiating a formal request for  speech-language evaluation services. A multi-disciplinary assessment could also be conducted if it was suspected that the child's difficulties encompassed more than speech-language functioning. Additional assistance for children falling in the borderline range was provided by the language arts resource teachers.

Based on examinations of a Modified Caution Index, there were differences in the usual response patterns for both reading and mathematics. This result suggests that within districts there may be differences in the content coverage and emphasis placed on some of the subsets of items contained on a minimum competency test. Because differences were noted across districts and curricular programs, there is the suggestion that there may be problems with using one test. Other, more detailed non-test-based analyses should be conducted to further examine the  curricular validity and also the instructional validity of this test. The present analyses provide an initial insight into possible differences between test and curricular matches. (Author/PN)",

The properties of the model parameters, and initial results on the accuracy of a maximum likelihood procedure for estimating the model parameters are discussed. The model presented is a special case of the general model described by Rasch (1961), with close similarities to the models suggested by Bock and Aitkin (1981) and Samejima (1974). The concepts of item difficulty and discrimination were discussed in reference to this model as generalizations of the same concepts used in the unidimensional latent trait models. For this case, difficulty was shown to be defined by a function rather than a single value, and discrimination was shown to be related to the slope of the item characteristic surface at its intersection  with the .5-plane. Both the difficulty function and discrimination parameters are most easily interpreted when determined conditional on a particular dimension. The maximum likelihood estimation procedure that was developed for the model was given an initial trial on a set of simulation data that was generated to contain two distinct dimensions. The item parameters estimated from the simulated test data were shown to be very highly related to the true parameters. (Author/PN)",

        "description":"The predictive validity of the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) aptitude test has been investigated for foreign students at the University of Kansas. A total of 148 students whose first language was other than English were selected for this study. Verbal and quantitative scores on the GRE, field of study, sex, and year of initial enrollment were used as predictors. The grade point average (GPA) in the graduate school was considered as the criterion. The results revealed that foreign students scored significantly lower than American students on the GRE scores and the GPA. Poor correlation between the GRE scores and the criterion suggested that the GRE aptitude test is not the most appropriate way to predict academic performance of foreign students. During multiple regression,  field of study and verbal scores on the GRE were found to be significant predictors of the GPA. High within-group variability among foreign students suggested the study of subgroups formed on the basis of language, culture, or the geographic location. The use of separate norms for foreign students was also found desirable. (Author/PN)",

        "description":"In the answer-until-correct mode of multiple-choice testing, respondents are directed to continue choosing among the alternatives to each item until they find the correct response. There is no consensus as to how to convert the resulting pattern of responses into a measure because of two conflicting models of item response behavior. The first suggests that partial knowledge allows the subject to eliminate some distractors immediately, and then assumes essentially random guessing among the remainder. The second proposes that the first error made by the subject results from misinformation, but that guessing comes into play after that. The paper considers three latent trait measurement models from each of these perspectives. Each is an extension of the Rasch one-parameter logistic  model. The first, which is most relevant to the partial knowledge viewpoint, is based on a count of the error choices before the correct response is identified. The second calibrates the difficulty of each step in each item. The third calibrates the difficulty of each distractor. It is argued that the second model provides the best context for distinguishing between the misinformation and partial knowledge approaches. (Author/PN)",

District 68 provides services to learning disabled, behavior disordered, and low functioning children through a comprehensive program of special education which includes identification and evaluation, multidisciplinary staffing, intense parent involvement, and special education and related services in the least restrictive setting. Three data collection instruments were developed to assess the special education services. An Individualized Education Program (IEP) checklist (Appendix A) was developed to assess the quality of IEPs. A data collection record sheet (Appendix B) was written to collect information concerning the type  and amount of service, student goals and progress in achieving those goals, standardized test scores, and birth dates. An interview schedule (Appendix C) was developed to examine the perceptions of special education staff regarding the IEP process, particular instructional strategies, and the interaction between regular and special education teachers and students. Discussed are the methodology of the instruments, as well as the objective-by-objective results and practical implications. The results suggest that Skokie District 68 special education programs are operating effectively and are generally beneficial to handicapped students. (Author/PN)",

        "description":"The nature of controversial programs is discussed, including problems that such programs pose for evaluators and suggested solutions for the problems. Controversial programs are likely to generate news-media attention, internal conflicts (i.e., involving the program and evaluation staffs) and external conflicts (i.e., involving various advocacy groups and program critics). Ways of dealing with these issues are presented. Various experimental and quasi-experimental designs are suggested for evaluating certain types of high-controversy programs. Also discussed are measurement problems facing the evaluator: problems involving the measurement of both cognitive and affective objectives. Among the most salient differences between controversial and non-controversial programs are the  factors surrounding the evaluator's decision to evaluate the program. A presentation is made of the negative and positive factors that the evaluator might consider before deciding to evaluate a controversial program. It is concluded that no single set of problem-solving solutions will work for all controversial programs. More work is needed to explicate the evaluation problems inherent in such programs.

        "description":"In contrast to linear models of human judgment developed for predictive purposes which are characteristically insensitive to the exact values of the weights utilized in them, the Linear Multiple Regression Models used for policy capturing are assumed to reflect significant aspects of the subjects' judgmental policies. This latter kind of modelling is therefore justified only to the extent that its underlying assumption is found to be true. Its validity depends, however, on both that of the models' beta weights, and of R2 as a twin measure of the subjects' cognitive control/consistency and of one's success in capturing the judges' policy. Although the problematic nature of beta weights is well known, the present study shows that R2 is no less a problematic measure. It is shown  that the way in which self-insight is typically elicited may induce a demand-response effect; furthermore, traditional data analysis and comparison methods appear to be inconsistent. In the study, eight subjects were presented with 72 profiles of perspective undergraduate students and were asked to judge future academic performance, based on information regarding each student's sex, age, ethnic oigin, and socioeconomic and educational background. The results indicate that current policy capturing research and findings cannot be accepted at face value. (Author/GC)",

The program was operated by the Division of Special Education of the New York City public schools and served 527 students (6-21 years old) in 227 schools, including community schools, high schools, a school for the deaf, special education schools, and an approved work site. The report's introduction describes how the program helped students who were formerly educated in State-operated or State-supported schools to adapt to public school special education. Approximately 50 percent of these students were emotionally disturbed and 30 percent were mentally retarded. Chapter 2 documents the overall level  of program implementation by focusing on facilities, staff, and levels of services provided. Chapter 3 presents evaluation findings for the program's four subcomponents: regionalized services, citywide services, hearing handicapped services, and placement and referral services for the handicapped. These findings focus on activities, resource materials, budget problems, promising techniques, and attainment of objectives, and are based on analyses of pupil achievement data. As is indicated in the report's final chapter, the program is judged to have met or exceeded its objectives, but a number of suggestions are offered for improving resource allocation, use of supplies, staff utilization, and record keeping.

Using a diagnostic-prescriptive methodology, the program provided after-school and pull-out individualized remedial instruction in vocational and occupational education to approximately 3,000 children and adolescents residing in 172 facilities for the neglected or delinquent. Some students also received reading and math instruction. Evaluation focused on physical setting, materials, supplies, program goals, instructional activities, student records, planning, assessment, staff background, orientation, supervision, as well as problems in implementation  and administrative concerns. Also evaluated were pupil achievement objectives in reading and mathematics. Measures of the relationship between mastery of new skills and amount of instruction indicated that the program met or exceeded its proposed goals in all pupil achievement areas. It is recommended, however, that the program (1) focus on elements other than vocational skills for some retarded and the very young children; (2) establish instructional policy for transient pupils; (3) modify testing requirements; and (4) provide more inservice training.

        "description":"A meta analysis of 93 research reports on school desegregation and black achievement was conducted to determine (1) why the study results differed as to apparent desegregation effects; and (2) whether some desegregation plans produced greater achievement gains than others. An analysis indicated that inconsistencies in research findings were mainly due to two methodological flaws: the inability of most desegregation studies to focus on the earliest levels of schooling, where desegegation effects are most significant; and the absence of adequate control groups in most studies. Examination of reported desegregation effects showed that (1) desegregation produced greater gains for IQ scores than for achievement test scores; (2) achievement gains in successful desegregated schools were  greater in reading and language arts for elementary school pupils and in science and social studies for high school students; and (3) the most successful desegregation plans were those that resulted in schools with a majority and more than a token number of blacks. Implications for theory, public policy, and educational research were drawn from the analysis. (Author/MJL)",

Findings based on the 775 returned surveys were that the most frequent grade awarded to secondary vocational education was a &quot;C&quot;; &quot;B&quot; was the most frequent grade for postsecondary vocational education. Over 50 percent of the respondents indicated their company benefited from vocational education. Most manufacturers (85 percent) preferred hiring vocational graduates for a job requiring less than a four-year college degree. Manufacturers' willingness to engage in cooperative activities was generally high. Work experience was  most preferred as a form of collaboration; on-site use of company equipment was least preferred. Problems in collaboration included inadequate planning, inflexible scheduling, and poor quality training. Three-fourths of the respondents preferred both employability and job skills training at the high school level. To improve vocational education, manufacturers recommended teaching basic skills and initiating more postsecondary work experience. Suggestions for change included providing more postsecondary course offerings, increasing employer involvement in vocational education evaluation, and improving entry-skills training. Manufacturers disagreed with public funding for job placement programs and for vocational programs for nontraditional occupations. (The survey is appended.

The broader goals of economic development in the community and training for nontraditional occupations were in lesser need of emphasis.

Although prison educational programs exist, they are often ineffective because of poor program development, lack of administrative support, or small numbers of prisoners served. One innovation in prison education is the Free Venture program, which may succeed in revitalizing prison industries and in turning prisoner idleness into productivity. Elements of the Free Venture model include the following: (1) workers should be exposed to a realistic work environment; (2) prisoners should partially reimburse the state for custody and welfare costs as well as make restitution payments to victims; (3) prisoners should gradually be prepared  for release into the community; (4) there should be fixed responsibilities with financial incentives and penalties for job placement of prisoners upon release into the community; (5) prison industries should receive financial incentives for successfully reintegrating offenders into the community; and (6) prison industries shou1d be self-supporting profit-making business operations. Seven states have undertaken the Free Venture plan with varying records of success and disappointment. Where the program has succeeded, its benefits are seen as fundamental changes in the nature of the prison community. (Besides an examination of the issues concerning prison education and an examination of some models of improved correctional education, this monograph contains an annotated bibliography on  correctional education, keys to federal funding for education of adult offenders, and models of assessment instruments and school district legislation.)

Its role has become dysfunctional in societies such as those in Asia and the Pacific that are characterized by rapid change. In societies such as these, the need now is for education for development. This is why both the concept of life-long education as a principle on which the overall organization of an educational system is founded, and the concept of nonformal education as an indispensible part in all national schemes for education, are of vital significance in Asia and the Pacific. When developing nonformal educational programs for countries in Asia and the Pacific, planners must consider both the common features and  experiences that give countries of the region a common outlook on the nature and role of education in relation to future development and the uniqueness of each country's experiences and needs. Particularly needed by most countries of the region are training programs in the areas of employment skills, rural transformation, and health and nutrition. Other areas of concern include conservation of natural resources, public safety and justice, and literacy. (MN)",

This paper seeks to clarify connections among policy, planning, and evaluation, especially as associated with intergovernmental strategies for the development of adult education. In doing so, the author argues first that the advancement of adult education policy leads inevitably to \"system,\" i.e., integration into public (government-mandated) educational systems. Secondly, manpower development is examined as an adult education planning strategy and found limited; in this regard, the \"cultural\" approach to planning is reviewed. Evaluation is then analyzed not as a process or tool but as an expression of the values underlying  policy and planning. Accordingly, the focus of intergovernmental agency evaluations on cost statistics is criticized as an inadequate measure of the merit of adult educational programs. While intended as a review and critique of these intergovernmental strategies, this paper hopes to draw further attention to national issues in adult education and to foster consideration of the impact of international strategies on adult educational policy, planning, and evaluation.

        "description":"A study explored the feasibility of research on the impact of flexible work patterns on the educational and training opportunities available to women in low-status jobs. Intended to provide a basis for a more informed discussion of policy questions pertaining to flexible worktime, the study involved a review of related literature, a series of informal interviews, and the collection of preliminary data at selected worksites during 1981. These sources of data confirm the fact that concern over declining productivity, together with demographic shifts and workers' changing values, have made it more important than ever to develop more effective opportunities for education and training and to expand the use of flexible work patterns. During the study, an examination was made of recent  attempts at adjusting working hours for education and training such as the use of part time, combined part time and tuition aid, 40-hour flexible schedules, and informal flexibility. This examination revealed positive, albeit tentative, connections between flexible hours and employer-provided learning programs. However, it also suggests that this linkage will affect women in low-status jobs on a significant scale only if other conditions also prevail. Therefore, more comprehensive research on the impact of flexibility is needed. (MN)",

The study centered on three areas: (1) reviewing command policies affecting EEO and affirmative action programs at all levels; (2) ascertaining the current status of EEO representation within these occupational areas; and (3) identifying specific barriers to achieving EEO objectives for the classification and assessing their impact on program design options. Through the study, six major problem areas were identified. These areas  are conflict between command/activity missions and EEO goal attainment; decentralized locations of education specialists; lack of accountability for EEO goal achievement; competing government policies; competition with other employers; and inefficient use of civilian personnel offices. Based on the findings, a plan for encouraging managers and supervisors to hire, promote, and provide professional development to women and minority education specialists was developed. (Author/KC)",

Because of concerns raised about the program, the Government Accounting Office (GAO) assessed the program to determine how it was working. GAO visited 150 WIN offices in 40 states and gathered data on 2,229 WIN participants. Some of the findings of the assessment were as follows: (1) Of the adults receiving AFDC, 40 percent were required to register for WIN, but only about half actually participated because of funding constraints; (2) of those participating in WIN, about 36 percent entered employment, of whom 38 percent were employed and off AFDC 6  to 18 months later; (3) half of all WIN participants finding jobs attributed their employment to WIN assistance; (4) for those who entered employment, statistically significant relationships were found between certain personal characteristics such as marital status and educational level and employment and AFDC status at the time of GAO's followup interviews; however, no such relationships were found between geographic factors or participation in specific WIN training components and employment and AFDC status at the time of followup; and (5) the Department of Labor significantly overstated WIN accomplishments.

Four essays are included, each with a distinct theme and purpose. However, all the essays relate to the major issues in adult education, national policy, lobbying, and a human policy with respect to adult education. The first essay, by William M. Rivera, examines definitions of adult education and educational policy by distinguishing certain directions in the field and by underscoring that adult education is more than a field of study and practice; it is an arena of political controversy and complex policymaking. In the second essay, William Hilton reviews the political position and purposes  of the Education Commission for the States and sets up model guidelines of how to formulate policy. His essay introduces a major issue, i.e., should there be a comprehensive adult education policy at the federal level? Mariam Kazanjian's paper, third in the booklet, clarifies the federal and state interactive processes of policymaking, while the final paper by Warren L. Ziegler discusses a fully human policy of education, recognizing the drawbacks as well as benefits of providing education for adults as a public policy. His paper also questions the value of continuing to insist on distinctions between children/youth and adults with respect to educational policy and explores the implications of abandoning these distinctions.

Mounting evidence shows that unionized workers are more productive than nonunionized workers and that unionization increases productivity in an establishment. Technological advances have resulted in jobs that require more technical preparation than a high school diploma or undergraduate degree. Eighteen of 19 jobs need technical training, work experience, or training in a particular skill or group of skills. Organized labor has moved to deal with technological changes through contract provisions and technological change clauses in collective bargaining agreements. A clearly articulated national policy is necessary to help schools keep pace with workers' training needs. Industry needs to develop and expand  training programs, such as in-house training, on-the-job training, tuition aid programs, and apprenticeship. Organized labor and vocational education must cooperate to better train workers. Research concerns should include cooperation between vocational education and the apprenticeship system, promotion of sex equity by vocational education, and equal access to vocational education.

The charge that government ineptness generates a need for CBOs is supported by examination of the federal government's operation of the general revenue sharing program. A project set up by CBOs collected data on abuses concerning allocation and misuse of funds. CBOs also worked to press for monitoring activities for Comprehensive Employment and Training Act programs. Other examples of CBO achievements are: a CBO in Yakima Valley, Washington, which addressed energy and employment problems by manufacturing alcohol from sweet potatoes to sell to an oil company; the Woodlawn Organization (employment and training programs in Chicago); the Watts  Labor Community Action Committee (training and employment services for chronically unemployed individuals); and BUILD in Buffalo, New York, as well as the South Arsenol Need for Development organization in Hartford, Connecticut (alternative school programs). Examination of the experiences of CBOs and their successes can provide vocational educators with approaches for more effective vocational education programs that incorporate business acumen, people-orientation, command of the content of a program area, flexible operations, commitment to follow-through (job placement), and accountability to the neighborhood.

        "description":"The issues of harmonization and autonomy as they affect vocational education and manpower policy development and the implementation of program service delivery are analyzed. Some of the background issues that have affected the relationship of vocational education and manpower, in particular the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA), are examined as well as the economic and labor market considerations and demographic and technological considerations that form the context in which these two areas function. Next, the context in which these two policy areas function as institutions is examined. (This context relates to their characteristics as institutions and as governmental organizations.) Interorganizational collaboration and coordination of vocational education and  CETA are also addressed. Finally, the discussion focuses on formation of a vocational education policy. Considerations include a national versus nationwide policy, issues of policy harmonization for vocational education, and issues of policy analysis research and data needs. Six policy issues are then examined. (YLB)",

        "author":["Lloyd, Kent"],
        "description":"While preparing for reauthorization of the Vocational Education Act, the United States Department of Education is looking at the inadequacies of the present law: overemphasis on process and accountability resulting in its being administratively burdensome, inadequate provision for basic skill development, and no provision for improving and developing new training programs, particularly in areas of critical skills shortages--areas necessary to economic revitalization. The Vocational Education Act needs to be refocused in the direction of cooperation between schools and employers and provision of federal incentives without federal coercion. One of the greatest needs in promoting productivity is to improve the delivery of vocational education skills and vocational education students  to the employer. Management problems in the delivery system include unclear definitions of the vocational education mission at national and state levels and a need for delineation of roles and responsibilities for all partners in vocational education. The Department of Education considers the reauthorization an opportunity to target the program to high school youth; out-of-school, unemployed youth in depressed urban and rural areas; postsecondary and adult vocational students; and prisoners in penal institutions and also an opportunity to address national problems that hinder economic revitalization. (Questions and answers are appended.) (YLB)",

Studies selected for the review were conducted since 1970, concerned grades 9 through 14, had a sample population of 25 or more, were set in an educational agency or community service organization, and were empirical. These studies were identified through telephone contacts with career guidance experts, a computer search of the literature, letters to state departments of education, convention programs, journals, congressional hearings, and other sources. Review of the studies showed that they could be organized into five major categories according to career guidance  outcomes: (1) improved school involvement and performance (41 studies); (2) personal and interpersonal working skills (30 studies); (3) preparation for careers (14 studies); (4) career planning skills (34 studies); and (5) career awareness and exploration (44 studies). The majority of the studies reported positive outcomes as a result of various methods of career guidance intervention. As a result of the study, numerous recommendations were made regarding state and federal policy, practices, and research in the field of career guidance. (KC)",

        "author":["Franchak, Stephen J."],
        "description":"A study was conducted to identify the factors that secondary and postsecondary vocational education administrators use as the basis for their decisions to add, terminate, or modify their programs. Data were collected through a telephone survey of 115 secondary and postsecondary administrators and by face-to-face interviews with an additional 25 administrators, representing various states, rural and urban areas as well as types of schools. Analysis of the data gathered showed that the following factors influenced administrators' program decisions: (1) locally conducted surveys of industry; (2) advisory committees, especially in decisions to add or modify programs; (3) student enrollment figures and student interest; (4) job placement rates; (5) input from faculty and  administration (a major factor); and (6) published labor market data. One important implication of the study concerns labor market data. Although these published reports often influence policy requirements at the state and federal levels, local administrators' decisions were not usually data based; rather, data reports were used to verify decisions already made or to meet state or federal requirements. A second implication of the study concerns an activity that warrants further attention: faculty visits to local industries should be increased and budgets should allow for this activity. The study also showed the need to harmonize local decision making with legislated decision-making processes to increase the impact of vocational education. (KC)",

        "description":"This study extends previous research on labor market effects of vocational education by explicitly modeling the intervening factors in the relationship between secondary vocational education and labor market outcomes. The strategy is to propose and estimate a simplified, recursive model that can contribute to understanding why positive earnings effects have been so hard to find for men, why the effects vary between men and women, and why the effects differ according to the time unit of measurement. The data used are from the National Longitudinal Survey (NLS) of Labor Market Experiences, Youth Cohort, and the high school transcripts of a subsample of the NLS panel. The estimated model created shows that vocational education may have both direct and indirect effects on earnings,  income, and unemployment, and that the indirect effects operate through such intervening factors as job-search methods, unionization, industry, occupation, job tenure, labor market experience, and postsecondary education. The findings regarding indirect effects have several implications for vocational education policy. Although indirect effects are not dramatic, they are not trivial, showing that vocational education can probably make a significant, but limited, contribution to improving productivity and reducing income inequality. Also, some changes in programs may be necessary since the findings show that vocational education differs substantially between whites and minority graduates in its capacity to foster longer job tenure, more labor market experience, and greater labor market  stability. Several findings suggest that policymakers should not place a heavy emphasis on hourly earnings alone as an evaluative criterion for vocational education. Directions for future research also are suggested by the study. (KC)",

        "description":"This report describes the opinions of a number of groups on five roles attributed to vocational education (i.e., employability skills development, occupational skills development, work experience, job placement, and basic skills development). The findings were based on a secondary analysis of data from five completed National Center for Research in Vocational Education studies. The secondary analysis involved an examination of the opinions of students, school personnel, community representatives, and policymakers. Some of the findings included the following: (1) occupational skills development, work experience, and basic skills development are important for all students; (2) although employability skills development is important for all students, it is considered more important  at the secondary level; and (3) training-related placement is not seen as the most important role for either secondary or postsecondary vocational education. On the basis of the study findings, it is suggested that Congress should re-examine the importance given to training-related placement as a basis for assessing program success, re-examine the need to continue legislative set-asides, decide if state and local agencies should determine the allocation of federal vocational education funds, and examine the federal role in promoting basic skills development. The United States Department of Education should provide more adequate public opinion data and formulate national priorities for the use of federal funds for vocational education improvements; meanwhile, state boards should continue  research and cooperation with other agencies and levels of government to improve vocational education.

It concludes that record levels of unemployment, declining economic development and productivity growth, and sharp declines in the number of new labor market participants in the decades ahead, coupled with an aging labor force, are all forcing greater emphasis on vocational education's role in meeting the nation's economic development needs. The dominant effect of these conditions has been to move vocational education toward greater emphasis on  the development of highly specialized skills for specific occupations. At the same time, another group of knowledgeable people believe that secondary vocational education's emphasis should be on general education and preparation in broad occupational areas rather than in specific jobs, while postsecondary vocational education's focus should be on preparation for specific jobs, especially highly skilled jobs for emerging industries, for a wider spectrum of the population. These opposing viewpoints raise some policy implications for federal and state governments and lead to questions, which, the report indicates, should be researched in the coming decade. (KC)",

From a list of 252 outcome questions, the project staff, selected personnel from the National Center for Research in Vocational Education, and vocational educators identified 18 outcomes on the basis of their historic importance, contribution to individuals, contribution to the improvement of social relations, contribution to the production, development and management of material wealth, and likely importance in the future. Then, six experts in the fields of history, philosophy, psychology, sociology, economics, and futurism wrote papers that supported or rejected each of the 18 outcomes. On the  basis of evidence presented in the papers, the following outcomes are supported for vocational education: upgraded occupational competencies, acquisition of useful occupational skills, retrained workers, development of safe work habits, and satisfactoriness to employers. The following outcomes are not strongly supported: increased job satisfaction, increased potential for entrepreneurship, increased awareness of need for basic academic skills, and placement in jobs related to training. Finally, these outcomes are not supported at all by the papers: enhanced leadership capabilities, positive work attitudes, motivation for achievement, trained workers for labor market needs, improved quality of work, enhanced job advancement, increased productivity, reduced dropout rate, and increased  earnings. The study has implications for federal and state legislation concerning outcomes for vocational education programs. (KC)",

A special emphasis of the study was to determine if school supervision or monitoring has any apparent influence on the nature or outcomes of work experience. Data for the study were obtained from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market Experience, New Youth Cohort, and from high school transcripts. The study found that about two-thirds of all students held jobs while in high school, most of which they obtained on their own. Although most of these jobs were at low skill levels--such as in-service, labor, or clerical occupations--jobs that were school supervised as well as jobs held by students with concentrated  patterns of participation in vocational courses were usually at higher skill levels, especially for women. Through regression analysis, it was determined that work experience has either no effect or a slightly positive effect on grades. It was also found that there was some tendency for young people with part-time jobs in high school to have more school problems or delinquent behavior. Although work experience did not yield a consistent pattern of relationships with post-high school earnings, it did contribute to higher rates of employment for graduates. The study concluded that school supervision of work experience appears to achieve some equity for minorities and females as well as some training objectives. Recommendations were made to continue to emphasize work-study programs and for  schools to use work experience to enhance students' education. (KC)",

After analyzing abstracts of 3,994 research, exemplary and innovative, and curriculum development activities, researchers drew the following conclusions: (1) states seem to place a lower priority on research, exemplary and innovative, and curriculum development activities than on vocational guidance and counseling, personnel training, and sex equity; (2) public educational agencies and institutions play a dominant role in program improvement activities; (3) states show a heavy concern for assisting practicing teachers and a relatively small concern  for teacher education programs; (4) state funding for distributing materials have increased annually; and (5) the greatest program improvement effort has focused on improvement of instruction in local vocational education programs. Based on these findings, recommendations called for development of more descriptive abstracts for the database from which these findings were drawn, for more research concerning vocational education personnel training, for closer coordination of curriculum development activities across states, and for further research on the allocation of program improvement funds between preservice and inservice educational programs.

Data were gathered from the National Longitudinal Survey of Labor Market Experience, Youth Cohort, and the high school transcripts of a subsample of this panel. As identified in the data, job satisfaction consists of four relatively independent forms: (1) satisfaction with personal on-the-job development; (2) satisfaction with physical working conditions; (3) satisfaction with job rewards (including pay, job security, and chances for advancement); and (4) satisfaction with human interactions. Separate analyses were conducted with each of these four factors and the study's objectives. Some of the  results were that satisfaction with personal on-the-job development was found principally among those working in smaller firms and crafts or in farming and clerical occupations. Satisfaction with working conditions was primarily associated with specific occupations (sales and clerical) and with specific job characteristics (smaller firms and regular work hours.) Satisfaction with job rewards was explained most consistently by occupations, while satisfaction with the human interactions on the job was associated most with the individual's self-esteem and with working in small firms. No resolution was made of the overall question of the influence of vocational education on job satisfaction. Policy implications of the study center on needed support for improved assessment of the effects of  vocational education, improved career counseling, increased opportunities for work experience, and support for further research.

The second data base was a computerized ERIC search of 267 impact studies of educational innovations. The third data base was seminal theoretical works and research studies from innovation diffusion literature. After criteria were identified, reviewed, and revised, they were classified within one of five R&amp;D program improvement stages: development, dissemination,  implementation, utilization, and effects. Impact criteria were defined for each stage, and salient features of each criterion were illustrated by a case example from an impact study. Guidelines and caveats for using each criterion were recommended.

Membership in the CBMS now includes all 6 regional curriculum coordination centers, 3 national organizations, and 24 state educational agencies. During the initial year of operation, approximately 220 messages were exchanged each month by network members. Uses included transmittal of routine messages, requests for information or resources, responses to requests,  transmittal of product distribution information, announcement of new products, tracking of projects and products, announcements of meetings, and news about conference events. Cost for each of the monthly messages (assuming five minutes each for messages totaling 1,100 minutes per month) was approximately $2, or $440 per month. Telephone messages (at $5 each) would total $1,100, while letters (at $7 each) would total $1,540. Therefore, the CBMS network will provide substantial savings for users, even when the National Center for Research in Vocational Education stops funding it and users have to pay the estimated cost of $200 per year.

The 2,091 participants were 1981 graduates of vocational teacher education programs in 29 states. About 52 percent of these teacher graduates returned a mailed questionnaire about how prepared they felt themselves to be to perform 16 professional tasks for exceptional students. (Exceptional students were defined as physically and/or sensory impaired, mentally retarded, gifted and talented, limited English speaking, economically disadvantaged, racial/ethnic minority group members, those enrolled in programs nontraditional for their sex, and adults who are retraining.) It was  found that the graduates were not uniformly prepared for teaching exceptional students, especially students with limited English proficiency and adults. It was also found that many of the graduates were unprepared for program evaluation, and few had significant contact with exceptional persons. Finally, only about half of the students had been required to take courses relevant to teaching exceptional persons. Recommendations were made for changes in teacher preparation programs to remedy these deficits. It was also recommended that schools conduct periodic needs assessments of their programs to determine such deficits and to alter their programs.

The findings are intended to serve as a basis for suggestions of ways to enhance responsiveness in the 1980's and beyond. The six information sources analyzed included literature such as reports and journals, congressional testimony, state plans for vocational education for 1978, annual vocational education programs from 1974-75 through 1978-79, and publications issued by state employment services. The major findings of the study were the following: (1) a shortage of skilled industrial workers in the 1980's and beyond may exist; (2) information systems cannot yet predict labor shortages or  their locations; (3) local providers of vocational education have been responding to occupational skill shortages in their areas; and (4) state vocational education agencies have created many short-term customized training programs, but little long-range planning has occurred. As a result of these findings, it was suggested that Congress should consider providing a framework for vocational education and business/industry groups to create job training partnerships and funding information systems to forecast skill shortages at every level. It was also suggested that state boards and vocational education agencies should consider long-range planning for job training to encourage articulation between secondary and postsecondary vocational education and to include more varied data in planning.

It also assesses how well the outcomes of those applications replicated or verified selected empirical results reported by the model's developers. The model was applied to the high school transcripts of samples of students from three urban school districts. Two major conclusions were reached. The first conclusion is that while no debilitating problems were encountered during the applications of the model, a number of conceptual and operational concerns  were identified. These concerns include the following: (1) Local school districts often use unique course titles that do not correspond directly with those listed in the codebook of the model; (2) local districts define and offer more general courses than those cited in the codebook; (3) some courses do not fit into the model's definitions; (4) some definitions and rules of the model need clarification; and (5) certain vocational programs are &quot;discriminated&quot; against by the model. The second conclusion was that the model is replicable across data sets and should, therefore, be of use to vocational planners and researchers. (KC)",

        "description":"Although computerized instruction has been used in various educational areas for years, agricultural educators only recently started to consider its use in secondary vocational agricultural programs. Of the three roles possible for computerized instruction (CI)--tutor, tool, and tutee--only the tool role can be implemented profitably in agricultural education at present. CI can be used in its tool role because the software available for vocational agriculture is oriented toward use in agricultural industry. These programs are tools for record keeping or management decision making. The use of agricultural industrial software increases students' computer literacy and their ability to use similar programs upon employment. Computer tools reduce computational time needed for problem  solving, leaving students free to focus upon subject problems rather than concentrating on mathematics computations. Implementation of CI faces problems in the areas of hardware systems, teacher training and attitudes, and software quality. Solutions to the hardware problems will come from the computer industry, but teacher training programs must prepare teachers to use all forms of CI in their teaching and overcome prevalent negative attitudes. In addition, teachers must be involved in preparing software for classroom use because computer programers are not attuned to instructional processes. Solving these three problems will be the next step for successful integration of computerized instruction into secondary vocational agricultural programs. (KC)",

        "description":"An 18-month study examined the way adults learn in rural settings, particularly those adults over the age of 25 who have not completed a high school education or its equivalency. The study was organized into three major phases. The first phase consisted of a survey interview of 93 adults living in a rural county in Vermont. The second phase involved indepth case studies with a sub-sample of 14 subjects from the first phase. The third phase entailed a comprehensive analysis of the data and dissemination of the results. Data indicated that 98 percent of those surveyed reported at least one major learning effort. The majority of learning efforts were self-planned and involved the self and/or a mixture of resources in the learning process. Most learning projects were non-credit.  Among the most frequent obstacles to learning were time constraints, basic skills, and access to good information. Finally, those interviewed were most comfortable learning at home or in their communities. Recommendations called for developing more ways to determine what adult learners actually want as well as for reassessing the rights of self-directed learners and curriculum and delivery system issues for long-distance learners.

        "description":"A study was conducted to identify the separate influences of individual background characteristics and service environment on post-training attrition in the Army and Air Force. A second objective of the study was to determine whether the correlates of post-training attrition vary across services and military occupations. Data for the analysis of attrition behavior were obtained from the FY75 Cohort File created by the Defense Manpower Data Center. These data indicate that military occupation and duty location are significantly correlated with post-training attrition, after controlling for individual characteristics. Among individual characteristics, the research demonstrates that high school graduates have much lower post-training attrition rates than nongraduates and that  participation in a delayed entry program prior to entering the military tends to reduce substantially the likelihood of attrition. Married recruits are less likely to leave early than single recruits, but the presence of children enhances attrition. Recommendations were made calling for more stringent accession screens, for changing personnel practices to reduce the incentives to leave high-attrition work environments and locations, and for either altering the mix of military occupations held or enhancing the attractiveness of high-attrition occupations.

The study focused on the determinants of Hispanic occupational achievement; differences in the process of occupational achievement among different Hispanic ethnic subgroups; variations in the process of occupational achievement across geographic areas; and differences among the occupational achievement of Hispanics, Blacks, and non-Hispanic Whites. Data pertaining to earnings, steadiness of employment, and general job quality of Hispanic workers were compiled from various sources, including the 1970 Census of Population and the 1976 Survey of Income and Education. Once effects of schooling, experience, foreign birth, English language ability, location, and race are taken into consideration, data do  not show differences in the earning levels of men's occupations among major ethnic subgroups of the United States Hispanic population. If the factor of foreign birth has any effects on occupational earnings potential, they appear to be mediated through English language ability. Furthermore, the effect of schooling on occupational earnings is about the same for Hispanic and non-White Hispanic men. For both groups schooling and length of labor force experience have only modest effects on occupational salary potential. Recommendations called for helping Hispanic men improve their English proficiency to fluency or near fluency. (MN)",

During the study, data were collected from a sample of 531 tenth- and eleventh-grade students drawn from an initial pool of 3,100 youngsters attending high schools in Orange County, California. To gather these data, researchers used survey questionnaires, on-site interviews of the adolescents, and interviews with their parents. The research design included both cross-sectional and longitudinal components. Researchers concluded that adolescents who take part-time jobs while in school experience a number of benefits, including development of personal responsibility and acquisition of knowledge about business and consumer matters. However, some of the benefits of working  while in school have been overstated. Youngsters who work show no significant changes in their long-term educational or occupational plans. In addition, working entails costs. It can diminish involvement in school activities, is associated with increased absenteeism, and, in some cases, leads to a decline in school performance. Recommendations called for limiting student work to 15 to 20 hours per week, for encouraging youth to take jobs that provide opportunities for learning and contact with adults, and for closer collaboration among educators and employers.

It was determined that, during the past 20 years, the United States Government has established the legal procedures to combat inequities in educational opportunities and employment-related practices. While these procedures have effected some improvements, the problems of occupational segregation and its resultant lower earnings for women persist. Other issues affecting the full utilization of women in the work force include protective labor legislation, inequities in education, lack of adequate child care, lack of adequate alternative work patterns, the scope of unemployment, involuntary part-time employment, and limited unemployment assistance.  Despite outreach efforts to groups with special needs, such as migrant and seasonal farmworkers and minority women, members of these groups continue to lag behind their white counterparts in most socioeconomic areas. Analysis of the effectiveness of equal opportunity initiatives reveals that, for the future, equality for women in the workplace will depend on continued reduction of occupational segregation of women.

State policymakers will be facing three major problems in the coming years: a possible oversupply of health professionals; rapidly increasing costs of health care services; and continuing problems of getting personnel to geographic areas, subspecialties, and practice settings that need them. Six strategies are suggested to solve these problems; (1) create new health professions education programs only where there is clear and compelling evidence of need that  cannot be met otherwise; (2) implement coordinated strategies to address the specific problem of distribution; (3) make maximum use of existing programs through interinstitutional and interstate agreements; (4) cut back on class sizes and close some training programs; (5) raise tuition for students in those professions that are expected to be surplus; and (6) develop the capacity to analyze the financing and costing of health professions education. It is essential that each state know the current status of its own health professions training programs within its health care delivery system. Only after analysis of the state's trends and needs can rational action be taken to implement specific strategies. (KC)",

        "description":"A study examined the influence of cultural values on classroom behaviors of adult Vietnamese refugees. More specifically, the study was designed to determine the effect of culturally acquired attitudes and personality traits on the refugees' classroom behaviors, the relationship between these behaviors and the cognitive learning styles favored by Vietnamese students, and the implications of these preferences for selecting materials and instructional approaches to facilitate second-language learning. To collect these data, the researcher observed the classroom behaviors of 18 Vietnamese students in an advanced-level course offered under the Refugee Services Program, English for Speakers of Other Languages, of Montgomery County, Maryland. These observations revealed that the  students manifested little if any initiative or interaction with one another while in class. Options confused them, as did individual or small group activities. However, they did begin to show some competitive skills when broken into teams. Such behavior reflects the Oriental stress on passive humility as opposed to the American emphasis on socialization and independent action. To deal effectively with Indochinese students, teachers of English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) must understand these differences and not view reserved behavior as a manifestation of laziness or lack of intelligence.

        "description":"Employer-sponsored, job-related training as a means of satisfying labor demands has potentially profound implications for the operation of the nation's economic system. The alternatives of bidding for desired workers and downgrading job requirements tend to increase inflation and lessen productivity. Since the end of the 1960's, the ability of employers to attract and retain workers at a given point in the business cycle has declined substantially. This apparently sharp increase in labor market imbalance (a worsening match between the skills possessed by labor force members and the skills required in jobs) has not been met by an increase in the per employee amount of employer-sponsored (nominally paid for) job-related training. There is strong evidence that employers have turned  to wage bidding to attract needed employees. Employers' decisions concerning low investment in formal training have been guided by profit maximization. While this may be good private decision making, it may lead to undesirable social outcomes--inflation and lower productivity. (Twelve tables are found in the body of the paper and in an appendix.)

In the manufacturing sector, it was found that the extent of in-house, employer-sponsored, job-related training has a positive relationship with output per labor hour. The extent of this type of training received out-of-house did not appear to have this positive association. In the case of managerial and professional employees at two large manufacturing companies studied, attendance at a formal training program appeared to have a positive impact on rated performance. At one of the two companies, however, salary growth did not reflect the positive training-performance relationship. Study results had these implications for human resources management: (1) a company's  formal training programs should be chosen with care; (2) some direct evaluation of the contribution of these programs is possible; and (3) the interface between training and other personnel practices, in particular compensation policy, should be carefully considered.

A growing difficulty in filling skilled jobs at a given unemployment rate is reflected. Business community analysts attribute the growing imbalance to changes in technologies and geographic dispersion of jobs and to changes in education and training of the workers that are out of step with the economy's needs. The business community clearly recognizes the magnitude of imbalance. Employers' responses to this problem have caused significant increases in wage growth and significant declines in productivity growth. One response for the imbalance is the attempt to get skilled  workers from competitors. Bidding wars that raise wages and prices often result. Alternatively, firms accept a poorer fit between workers and jobs than has been customary, which serves to lower productivity. (YLB)",

These research and development efforts were studied through a mail survey returned from 321 respondents, telephone interviews with 100 respondents, and case studies of seven sites where these products had been used in an exemplary manner. Across the sites, 284 personal interviews were conducted. Overall, the study indicated that state and national research has had positive effects on vocational education programs for handicapped learners. The primary uses of the publications studied were in workshops or college classrooms, as professional references, in secondary classrooms, and for teacher inservices. Among the effects of these  research products on vocational education were the following: increased participation of handicapped students in vocational education, more relevant individualized education programs (IEP's), improved curricula for handicapped learners, and strengthened linkages between vocational and special education. In addition, the research products were reported to have helped handicapped learners by increasing their participation in work experiences while in school, by expanding their awareness of career possibilities, and by improving their self-esteem and employability skills.

Data were obtained from more than 121 programs and from 16 visited sites. The programs were identified by state personnel, technical panel members, consultants, practitioners in the field, a review of the litearture, and staff of the National Center for Research in Vocational Education. Educational need areas of the special students in these programs were identified as adequate assessment of interests and abilities, personal coping and communication skills, remedial basic education skills, special  prevocational training, and supplemental support services. The major strengths of the programs were found in the kinds of practitioner interventions that correspond to the critical needs areas. The major interventions were the use of the following: (1) diagnostic tools; (2) activities to aid students in coping with interpersonal and economic problems; (3) individualized, self-paced remedial education in basic skills; (4) activities to increase occupational awareness and increase opportunities for work experience; and (5) supportive services. The study can serve as a basis for the development of preservice and inservice training materials for vocational teachers, counselors, and administrators. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"Secondary analysis of self-reported data from 1,819 questionnaires completed by state vocational education staff in 47 states was used to examine the training and experience of current state vocational education staff in five federal policy priority areas: sex equity, disadvantaged persons, handicapped persons, limited English-speaking student populations, and economic development. Seven concepts were used to identity patterns of staff training and hiring practices in the data. Some of the results are as follows: (1) persons responsible for sex equity, disadvantaged persons, and handicapped persons reported a high level of training and experience and were employed mainly at the management level in state agencies; (2) 76 percent of sex equity personnel were hired in the last 4  years; (3) higher percentages of blacks and other minority groups on the state staffs had training and experience in the five priority areas; and (4) successful states had a higher level of effort in vocational education than less successful states, although states that were successful in economic development showed lower efforts in vocational education. The study concluded that the state staffs had high levels of training and experience sufficient to carry out federal policy initiatives, and it raised questions about the proper role of the federal government in directing how states should respond.

(While overtly concerned with sex equity, the materials are adaptable to other equity groups, since communication skills are a universal concern.) Unit 1 is designed to assess the communication patterns of traditional and nontraditional students alike, as well as show how irrational ideas influence messages. Unit 2 focuses on skill training in verbal communication,  while the third unit builds on unit 2 with skill training in nonverbal communication. The last unit addresses sexual harassment and the consequences of defensive messages in efforts to prevent or cope with this problem. Each unit contains objectives, a daily outline, and learning activities. Materials are designed to provide 8 hours of instruction.

Chapter 1 discusses black history with an emphasis on alcohol use by black Americans. Chapter 2 explores prevention approaches and offers nine alcohol prevention strategies suitable for black adolescents. Chapter 3 presents steps in starting prevention programs, e.g., community mobilization, cosponsorship,  networking, grantsmanship and outreach. Chapter 4 addresses evaluation, stressing ways to determine if programs are meeting objectives. Chapter 5 is a resource section listing national, state, and local private and public organizations by name and address as well as available resource materials appropriate for youth prevention programs. The three appendices provide program planning materials (grant proposal outline and grant charts, and needs assessment guidelines and forms); community workshop materials (letters, agenda, feedback forms, worksheets, and overhead projector outlines); and a glossary of terms and a list of references.

        "description":"Based on research which suggests that individuals transmit good news more than bad news and that people are motivated to project a positive image of themselves, 48 college students participated in a study to test the hypothesis that individuals would be more conscientious in giving information when future social interaction was anticipated. Message valence (good/bad) and anticipation of future interaction (yes/no) were varied in a communication paradigm in which student test takers (confederates) sought information on test performance from other students (subjects). The subjects completed questionnaires and their communication length (in seconds) and eye contacts were measured. Data analyses showed that good news subjects engaged in more eye contact and were more truthful than  bad news subjects. Questionnaire data revealed that anticipation subjects, both good and bad, believed they made a more favorable impression on the target person than did no-anticipation subjects. The findings suggest that the no-anticipation groups had little incentive to monitor their own behavior. Although self-monitoring is relatively stable within individuals, anticipation of future social interaction may produce transitory effects on self-monitoring. (MCF)",

        "description":"A developmental approach to counseling supervision proposes that counseling trainees develop in predictable ways over the course of their training,that supervision environments should change to match trainees' needs, and that a congruent supervision environment will better meet the learning needs of trainees. To explore the developmental approach to counseling supervision, a two-scale instrument representing the counselor complexity model of Cal Stoltenberg was developed representing supervisee characteristics (P-scale) and the supervision environment (E-scale). This Developmental Level Determination Scale was administered to 71 supervisors for 107 supervisees and supervisory environments at 9 university counseling centers. Each supervisor filled out a P-scale and an E-scale for  each supervisee at the two-thirds point of the semester. At the end of the semester data on satisfaction and learning were collected from both supervisors and supervisees. Results confirmed the model in which trainees progress in counselor complexity level over the course of training. Results also indicated that, in general, supervisors provided different levels of supervision over the course of training. The congruency hypothesis was not supported, since person-environment mismatch was not related to supervisor or supervisee satisfaction. The findings support the validity of the developmental approach to counselor supervision. (JAC)",

The report is divided into five chapters aimed at addressing areas of major concern to the nation and its elderly citizens. The first chapter, on the economy, discusses the importance of preparing our economy for an aging population, the changes which may be expected to result from this aging, the consequences of these changes, and the necessity to plan to meet the decade ahead. Chapter 2, income in old age, concentrates on the Social Security System, how  it works, its problems, and some of the options available for strengthening the system. Chapter 3, health care, discusses the medical delivery system, long-term care, and disease prevention. Chapter 4, social benefits and services, sets forth the policy thrust proposed for other benefits for the elderly. Chapter 5, research, discusses the research implications of the national policy. For each area, issues are defined, policy options are explored, and recommendations are made. (MCF)",

Although there is little data to support the two underlying assumptions of this causal relationship, i.e., a decrease in family involvement, and the efficacy of parent participation in enhancing student performance, there is potential in the intervention implications stemming from this hypothesized relationship. Most intervention efforts have focused on increasing parent participation, however, in the absence of any serious analysis of the content and purpose of that participation. Changing family conditions are repeatedly scapegoated in these discussions, yet the changing social conditions are a reality, and should generate a new level of discussion  about home-school relations and alternative mechanisms to accommodate them. The \"victim blaming\" implicit in deficient parent participation explanations threatens to divert attention from collaborative home-school efforts and fruitful change. (JAC)",

        "description":"By structuring the manner group members use to reach a decision, managers can affect the processes and outcomes of decision making. Business administration undergraduates (N=78) were randomly assigned to three groups and told to make group decisions based on the process their manager selected, i.e., they were either to seek concurrence, debate opposing views, or express their own views as they made their decisions. During discussion, managers acted as observers rating quality of the decision, acceptance of it, and interpersonal attitudes. Participants also rated the decisions and the group interrelationships. Analyses of results indicated that participants in the controversy condition were uncertain about both their knowledge and the decision, but explored the problem in depth.  Participants in the concurrence seeking condition felt confident about their understanding and the decision, though they did not explore the problem fully. They indicated they liked each other and felt their relationship was cooperative. Participants in the consensus condition were more confident about their understanding and decision but did not actually explore the problem as thoroughly as participants in the controversy condition. The findings suggest that controversy generates the greatest problem exploration. (Author/JAC)",

A cost analysis does not provide exact cost figures for any given unit of analysis, rather cost figures represent reasonable and best estimates derived from budget and expenditure information. It is estimated that 80-95 percent of a district's total budget can be isolated according to the selected unit of analysis. A cost analysis focuses on the input of schools as measured by dollars, without regard for school climate, quality of the teaching force, leadership of the  school, or outputs of the educational process. To illustrate cost analysis methodology, a cost analysis process is applied to a rural situation in a midwestern state where the school board operates two high schools, located in separate communities about 15 miles apart. A functional budget is developed in traditional categories as the basis for cost allocation. Tables and charts illustrate findings of the analysis and the ways such analysis can be presented for decision making. (BRR)",

        "description":"Because 66 of New Mexico's 89 public school districts experienced declines in 1981-82 enrollments and most were unable to decrease educational costs at the same rate as their decline in enrollment, the legislature requested a study on effects of declining enrollment and possible adjustments to the school distribution funding formula to cushion adverse outcomes. Current literature, interviews, and data compiled by the public school finance division over a 5-year period (1975-76 to 1980-81) provide comparisons and demonstrate trends. Statewide forecasts indicate that declines will begin abating within 3 to 4 years, but there will continue to be school districts experiencing major unpredicted decreases in population which cannot be easily addressed within the current formula for  distribution of state funds. Although the degree of negative impact from declining enrollments varies, reports of educational deterioration in some districts must be of paramount concern to planners and decision-makers. To adequately address declining enrollment problems, increased leadership and assistance from agencies and institutions throughout the state are needed. Among the recommendations are: greater flexibility in determination of standards for teacher certification, especially in the area of multiple certification, and expansion of course offerings in remote areas and incentives for nontraditional delivery systems.

Mental rehearsal is the process of using imagery to practice teaching behavior before actually teaching. If rural educators can be trained to mentally rehearse methods, activities, demonstrations, and teaching behavior, they can provide themselves with a means of instructional improvement through their own self-initiated, self-improvement program. Common purposes of mental rehearsal are relaxation, positive thinking, and psychological preparation of a task. Mental rehearsal can be used to focus on specific verbal cues (accepting emotion, praising, questioning, lecturing, or  criticizing) and nonverbal cues (energy level, touching, use of time, teacher travel, eye contact, posture, silence, facial features, or use of space) during classroom interaction and classroom teaching. Questions pertaining to mental rehearsal are discussed, such as what types of mental rehearsal are possible, when does mental rehearsal occur, how frequently should mental rehearsal occur, and where should mental rehearsal occur.

Each section is prefaced by an interview with a knowledgeable and experienced professional, e.g., Judith Myers, Mary Faeth Chenery, Stuart Mace, Nannette Enloe, Jan Adams, Gary Robb, and Armand B. Ball. Their comments give the reader an added dimension and distinctive insight into the six subject areas. Also, to help focus the material on the ACA curriculum, discussion questions and additional resources are included at the end of each section. (Author/NQA)",

Since an active Alternative Studies Program, designed for students with special learning problems or for working students, already existed on certain school campuses, school officials were receptive to providing school services at selected sites outside of the established school campuses and to providing regular credits to students attending at the alternative locations. Upon entering the project, subjects were informed that a fully accredited educational service was offered at a site near their home barrio and were encouraged to attend school during available hours  to earn credits toward high school graduation. Of the 13 Chicanos, 5 elected to return to school at the site within their home barrio and 4 did not take advantage of the alternative site because they were employed in work they found satisfying. Almost 40% of the Chicano gang members who had dropped out of school prior to entering the gang prevention program returned to school. The study demonstrated that alternative school sites can have a significant impact on the school attendance behavior of Chicano gang members. (NQA)",

Assertion training could be envisioned as an intervention strategy for Indians to create conditions for a new era in which their future is determined by Indian acts and Indian decisions in pursuit of entitlement to services rather than their need for services. Designed to aid educators, human development specialists, and mental health professionals in developing assertion training programs with American Indian people, the manual discusses assertive behavior; elements of Indian culture and  Indian thinking; a selected assertion training model composed of instruction, modeling, behavior rehearsal and feedback; application of assertion training to express Indian rights and responsibilities; aspects of communicating messages involving combined influences, perceptions, and interpretations of mutual role expectations of Indian and white and cultural differences. Other chapters discuss Indian non-verbal communications; assertion training with Indian adults; practical and ethical considerations for trainers; and assessment of Indian assertive behavior. Appendices provide references, a workshop agenda, and suggested exercises for assertion training. (Author/ERB)",

Although each geographic area has different needs, educators must be made aware of the cultural, social, and economic factors of the areas they serve. Preparation programs for teachers going into rural schools should be focused on producing a generalist in education, thus preparing teachers to cope with multi-grade-multi-subject teaching loads and with extracurricular activities. Leadership from state departments of education and from colleges of education is needed to upgrade rural and small school teacher preparation and certification programs. Preservice teacher programs alone do not suffice; inservice  programs are essential to the continued growth of rural educators and to the promotion of better relations between communities, schools, and colleges of education. This state-of-the-art review describes the need for better teacher preparation and certification for teachers going into rural or small schools, looks at current preservice and inservice programs and models, and suggests ways to upgrade the status of rural teacher preparation and certification.

For those who left during the school year, data were obtained from district records. For those who completed the year, data were obtained from the teachers via a survey questionnaire. Although 5 rural school districts reported no turnover, general profiles revealed an approximate 19% rural teacher turnover rate as compared to a less than 9% urban teacher turnover rate. Salary was the most frequent reason for leaving following the school year and maternity the most frequent reason for  leaving during the school year. The ratio of men to women resignations in rural districts approximated the men to women turnover ratios for the whole state. Positions most frequently vacated were in the elementary grades (1-3).

The objective of the survey was to update current needs assessment and arrive at an assessment reflecting educational needs of the school, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the community. Results of the survey created a Language and Culture Committee in the tribe, which appropriated funds for a community-based program in language instruction and the hiring of a teacher-coordinator and two language teachers. Essential points identified to conduct a  successful survey were: informing the community on what was happening; utilizing community people; not extending the purpose of the survey; meeting people at their convenience; and carefully selecting interviewers. Events leading to the development of the 67-question needs assessment survey and compiled data from the 530 responses received are fully describes. The complete survey is appended. (ERB)",

        "description":"Suggesting that the underrepresentation of ethnic minorities in technical and science-related careers and within academic programs leading to such careers has not resulted primarily from free exercise of choice on their part, but rather has resulted in some measure from barriers to minority group participation, the literature was surveyed to examine factors suspected of inhibiting minority participation in science/mathematics at the pre-college level. Factors examined included: (1) those related to testing procedures (general testing, achievement, other factors such as socio-economic status, performance patterns, and presence of bias); (2) those related to learner characteristics (cognitive style, locus of control, and attitude/motivation); (3) those related to classroom  experience (differential exposure of science/mathematics instruction, de facto classroom segregation, classroom psychological environment, teacher expectations, and instructional strategies); and (4) those related to counseling experiences. Programs to encourage minority participation in science/mathematics were also examined. Suggestions based on the literature review include early exposure to experiential science and concrete mathematical materials to develop conceptual understanding, providing instructional strategies accommodating a variety of cognitive styles, rectifying any imbalance in the quality of science/mathematics instruction encountered by minorities, providing career awareness programs and academic role models, and including Asian Americans and minority women in future  research studies.

Three brief texts were written for the investigations; they varied in degree of explanation of basic concepts of elementary probability. Subjects were undergraduate students at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. None of the subjects had had previous formal exposure to probability or statistics. All texts presented six basic formulas from elementary probability and an example of the application of each formula. All three documents contained definitions of special terms. The high-explanatory text emphasized the relation of probability to counting, used pictorial aids, and presented equations as natural developments ensuing from examples. The standard text lacked this conceptual development, but presented more concrete  examples than those found in the low-explanatory document. Subjects were given sufficient time to read their text, then given an unrelated 15-minute task to minimize immediate memory dependence. This was followed first by a performance test, then by an aptitude measure. Results suggested that very different patterns appear to be present in the high-explanatory subjects as compared to the other groups. In particular, subjects in the high-explanatory group tended not to retrieve formulas, but to recall examples. (MP)",

It was sponsored by the National Science Foundation and Loyola University, and it consisted of an academic portion and an intense 3-week, full-time summer session. The focus of this paper is a study done during the 1980 summer portion of the program. During this time, the teachers received training in both computer science and computer problem solving in mathematics. The purpose of the study was to assess the effectiveness of this instruction on cognitive and affective objectives associated with computer literacy. Thirty-three teachers were used as subjects. All teachers were female and were placed in two different  instructional tracks. Eleven completed track 1, and 22 completed track 2. Track 1 teachers were taught various topics in discrete mathematics, while those on track 2 were instructed in aspects of linear algebra and matrix theory. The investigation focused on 15 days of intensive summer instruction that involved microcomputers. Results indicated that the summer program had a positive effect on the computer literacy of teachers. (Author/MP)",

Although everyone presumably has some sort of knowledge about motion, it is by no means clear what form(s) this knowledge may take. The research described in this paper determined what sorts of knowledge are in fact acquired through experience with moving objects. Findings from experiments in which undergraduates solved simple problems concerning the behavior of moving objects are presented. Findings from these and other experiments demonstrate that people develop, on the basis of their everyday experience, remarkably well-articulated naive theories of motion. It is argued that the assumptions of the naive theories are quite consistent across individuals,  suggesting that theories developed by different individuals are best described as different forms of the same basic theory. Although the basic theory presented appears to be a reasonable outcome of experience with real-world motion, it is strikingly inconsistent with the fundamental principles of physics. In addition to considering the nature of knowledge acquired through experience with moving objects, the interaction of experience-based knowledge with knowledge acquired through classroom instruction in physics is discussed.

As children, they interpret many phenomena related to motion before encountering any formal science education. Since most adults have misconceptions, children's questions are not answered correctly, so the misconceptions persist. Thus, every science teacher must face the prospect that their students have serviceable misconceptions about the phenomena being studied. Yet the prototypical science course ignores all preconceptions and develops the science &quot;de novo.&quot; Likewise, psychology of learning is largely concerned with original learning, not relearning or unlearning. Both psychologists and science educators need to ask not what should be done when the learner is not a tabula rasa, but is burdened with half-truths  and conflicting concepts. Various misconceptions about motion held by students are discussed. A framework is presented for interpreting students' responses to problems involving motion, and implications for physics instruction and for cognitive psychology applications to science education are discussed.

The Teaching of Problem Solving (TOPS) project began in the 1980-81 school year under CEMREL's contract with the Basic Skills Improvement Office of the United States Department of Education. The approach used in the TOPS activities is to lead students through sequences of problem solving experiences presented in game-like and story situations. The material's design is based on the pedagogical theory fundamental to CEMREL's Comprehensive School Mathematics Program (CSMP), which emphasizes non-verbal languages to give pupils in grades K-6 access to mathematical ideas and methods necessary for posing interesting and challenging problems and  solving them. It is noted that further information on the pedagogical and philosophical roots of TOPS is available through CSMP literature. The major portion of the document is divided into five sections: (1) Problem Solving in the String Game; (2) Problem Solving with the Minicomputer; (3) Problem Solving with the Hand Calculator; (4) Problem Solving through Detective Stories; and (5) Problem Solving with Arrows. Each section has a separate table of contents listing activities and games. Each item includes prerequisites, objectives, and instructional strategies. (Author/MP)",

        "description":"To determine how children cope with some of the demands imposed on them by arithmetic word problems, 200 sixth-graders were asked to solve prolems modeled after those used by the National Assessment of Educational Progress. A quantitative demand was imposed on the children by adding extraneous information to the problems, and a verbal demand was imposed on them by increasing the syntactic complexity of the problems. Multiple regression analyses indicated that the children's computational ability and reading ability together accounted for 54% of the variance in solution accuracy: 8% and 14%, respectively, of this variance was unique, whereas 32% was common to the abilities. In addition, the analyses indicated that the presence of extraneous information in the problems reduced the  accuracy of the children's solutions. The use of complex syntax, on the other hand, had no significant effect on accuracy. The findings suggest that reading ability and computational ability both play important roles in children's successful solution of word problems. The findings also suggest that the presence of extraneous information in word problems can impose a formidable demand on children's limited processing capacities. (Author)",

The purpose of this Commssion is to define a national agenda for improving mathematics and science education in this country. The Commission will develop an action plan that will include a definition of the appropriate roles and responsibilities of federal, state, and local governments, professional and scientific societies, and the private sectors in addressing this problem. This report presents the Commission's assessment of the current condition of precollege education in mathematics, science, and technology and explores  some of the key problems and challenges facing educational institutions in meeting three goals (described in the introduction) to foster scientific and technological literacy. Specific contributory problems to declining achievement and student participation in science and mathematics in a time of increasing national needs are discussed. These include problems related to teachers, classrooms (inadequate teaching time, equipment, and facilities), curricula, and instructional approaches. Issues related to public perceptions and priorities are also addressed. (Author/JN)",

The first three units consist of several modules, each module containing a teacher-directed introductory activity followed by two or more laboratory blocks (consisting of several student activities). The introductory activity is a discrepant event or open-ended in nature to encourage students' questions and to motivate them to further inquiry in the activities included in the laboratory blocks. A transition section (or focus) is included between each laboratory block, tying in concepts explored  earlier to those concepts which follow. Materials needed and instructional strategies are noted for each activity. Topics covered include the nature of water, clean/dirty water, acids/bases, water cycle, Minnesota's glacial past, acids and rocks, stream tables, ecosystems, and acids and brine shrimp. Field trip activities are included in the Life Science Unit. The Extension Unit includes an acid rain game and various activities (including a simulation) related to use of the Boundary Water Canoe Area in northern Minnesota.

Projects were primarily academic year seminars of summer workshops and seminars. Although projects were subject matter oriented, the emphasis varied from those designed for teachers in need of subject-matter training in the traditional disciplines to those designed to present science subject matter in an interdisciplinary/multidisciplinary mode. Title, name and address of project  director, project summary (including goals and objectives), funding year, amount of funding, and discipline(s) are provided for each project. The major intent of this document is to serve as a resource for the planning of future projects based on the federally funded models described.

Two major lines of theories of the development of basic number concepts, called logical concept and quantification skill approaches, are identified. Major recurring issues in the development of early number concepts are also discussed. This is followed by examination of studies specifically related to addition and subtraction. It is noted that by kindergarten most children understand the rudiments of these operations, but a complete understanding develops over a protracted span of years. The direction of initial and ongoing research is discussed, and word problem studies and investigations on children's solutions of symbolic addition and subtraction  problems are viewed to be concerned with both problem difficulty and solution processes. The review suggests that a great deal is known both about children's knowledge of addition and subtraction and how they solve addition and subtraction problems. It also indicates that there is not yet a clear picture of how to apply such new information to design more effective instruction. (MP)",

        "description":"A great variety and amount of teaching materials and methods related to water quality and other Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) concerns have been developed. Program developers/trainers responsible for instructional programs will find in ERIC and the Instructional Resources Information System (IRIS) enough material to organize dozens of short courses and/or hundreds of instructional hours. The problem is not lack of material but rather selecting and/or developing material that is most useful in a specific situation, achieves certain objectives, honors the needs and concerns of adult learners, and permits instructors to use materials/methods which capitalize on their teaching strengths. Cited in this document are ideas, materials, and methods that may be useful to persons  involved in designing instructional programs for water quality or other EPA concerns.

        "description":"Solar photovoltaic cells have been called the ultimate energy technology, environmentally benign and without moving parts, solar cells directly convert sunlight into electricity. Photovoltaic energy conversion is fundamentally different from all other forms of electricity generation. Without turbines, generators or other mechanical equipment, it more closely resembles photosynthesis, the biochemical process that forms the energy basis of life on earth. A product of mid-twentieth century solid-state physics, photovoltaics has attracted a wide range of supporters: back-to-nature homesteaders, environmentalists, politicians, and businessmen. Increasingly, photovoltaics is a world of big business, with oil companies contributing a sizable share of the nearly half-billion dollars  invested worldwide in 1982. Although research and development still form much of the solar cell industry, practical use of the technology is growing rapidly. Photovoltaic technology, cost reduction, the photovoltaics industry, government programs and international competition, applications of photovoltaics technology, solar power stations, and the future of solar power are discussed in separate sections.

        "description":"The National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Association of American Universities are conducting an experiment in research grant administration designed to respond to the perceived needs of universities for more flexibility while assuring appropriate accountability for Federal research funds. The experiment delegates most grant administration authorities to universities and permits them to allocate costs among scientifically related NSF grants. The experiment is divided into two phases. Phase 1 (the Master Grant Phase) involved 245 grants awarded by NSF's Chemistry Division to the chemistry department of nine universities. Phase 2 (started in January 1981) modified and expanded the experiment to include almost all NSF grants to the nine Master Grant universities and three  additional universities. The U. S. General Accounting Office believes the experiment can increase the economy and efficiency of Federal grant administration and provide more flexibility in the use of funds but indicates that some operational problems need to be corrected. This document discusses (in separate chapters) the experiment's background, objectives/scope, and methodology; Master Grant Phase, indicated to have improved research grant administration; the Phase 2 expansion; a review indicating that the NSF experiment needs to be better managed and evaluated; and conclusions/recommendations.

Although the Federal Government has programs designed to address the asbestos situation, it has not determined in what specific circumstances asbestos is a hazard. Therefore, State and local school officials currently face a dilemma concerning what to do when they find asbestos in their schools. The first chapter of this document discusses the nature and uses of asbestos, health hazards, Federal action to address asbestos in schools, and a summary of Federal efforts to reduce asbestos in schools. The second chapter discusses Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) actions to address asbestos in schools, focusing on EPA's  technical assistance program (indicated to be a limited success), various State and local abatement responses, and EPA inspection and notification rules. The third chapter considers the limited impact of the Asbestos School Hazard Detection and Control Act of 1980, indicating that no loans/grants are available for asbestos detection and control, that asbestos hazard criteria are still lacking, and that state reports and records provide limited information. Appendices include characteristics of State programs to address asbestos in schools and state asbestos program summaries. (Author/JN)",

To encourage broad utilization, the programs were designed for the Apple II microcomputer and written in Applesoft Basic with a user-adaptable format. Each package focused on a key concept in biology, with specific educational objectives. User's guides documented programs, provided theoretical background, and offered suggestions for modification. Formative evaluation was conducted by project staff, other faculty, and graduate students. In most cases this evaluation was accomplished by pre- and post-testing, using computer administered multiple-choice examinations. For three modules, classes were split and students  using computer modules were compared to students using lecture or text-reading instructional formats. In essentially all cases, students filled out a subjective evaluation form dealing with aspects of student preference. Significant short-term learning was found for all modules. The final stage of evaluation was carried out by professional reviewers working under contract with CONDUIT. Although some dissemination of programs occurred during the project, the primary plan for dissemination involves release of the programs to CONDUIT for their review, modification, publication, and marketing.

Can microcomputer modules teach effectively, and do they enhance learning when used as a supplement to traditional teaching methods? Part 1 of this report addresses the former question and part 2 addresses the latter. The three microcomputer modules used were Population Growth, Predator Prey, and Mitosis/Meiosis. All three were produced by the author as part of a National Science Foundation (NSF) supported project. Each module was a self-contained teaching medium employing graphics, text, and sound designed expressly for the Apple II microcomputer. Each was interactive, allowing the student to enter answers to multiple-choice questions,  parameters for equations, and/or other input. No computer programming background was necessary for the student to execute or make minor modifications to the module programs. Results indicate that learning was achieved to a high degree of significance, but that CAI supplemented with traditional teaching methods did not significantly improve learning. It is indicated that although not a panacea, the microcomputer has proven that it has a solid niche in the educational world, and an ever increasing potential. (Author/JN)",

There are seven major chapters. Chapter 1, &quot;A Social History of the Guatemalan Indian,&quot; looks at the Indians under both Spanish rule and national rule after independence. A Guatemalan peasant community is described. The second chapter discusses agricultural beliefs and practices in the Maya highlands, examining ritual and technology, change, and risk taking. The issue of cooperation versus individualistic competition in Indian communities is the topic of chapter 3. Chapters 4, 5, and 6 deal with medical innovations. The role of the shaman is examined, a  case study of one town is presented, and disease prevention is discussed. The schooling process in cultural perspective is the focus of chapter 7. The appendices contain: a journal article discussing the fate of two innovators in a Maya village; maps showing current language boundaries of and ethnographic studies conducted in Guatemala; a directory of Guatemalan institutions, libraries, and individuals with social science research interests; a glossary; and a bibliography of resources dealing with the Maya highlands.

Rostow, representing the views of the Committee on the Present Danger, believes that America is losing the capability of mounting a lethal second strike because it has permitted the nuclear balance to tilt against us. Unless the balance is restored, the United States will be unable to reach equitable or safe agreements with the Soviets. Tarr, invited by the Institute of World Affairs, stresses the profound effect of the U.S. descent from nuclear superiority to balance. In his view this parity has weakened the deterrent value of nuclear weapons for  protection of our allies. The issue of SALT TWO has become less relevant compared to the juxtaposition of conventional arms and other areas of competition between the superpowers. Both speakers agreed that the Soviet Union does not want nuclear war. Rather, the USSR would prefer to have its adversary concede. (RM)",

The purpose of the project was to improve education in empirical and behavioral research methods. The center consists of computing facilities, a survey research facility, a simulation/gaming facility, and a resident specialist in quantitative methods. The laboratory is not tied to a specific curriculum but rather operates as a free-standing unit available to all social scientists and students. It contains a variety of software, a library, video recording equipment, calculators, audio centers, and projection equipment. The methods specialist teaches one interdisciplinary course per year and works with students and faculty on various projects.  Although student activity in the laboratory includes both independent and course-related work, the most tangible outcomes involve staffing and curricular innovations. Many courses have been modified to include computer instruction and use of the center. Currently, more than 80 percent of all social science majors have used the facilities. The project has been successful in providing students with quantitative instruction. (KC)",

The Family Impact Analysis and the concept of a Family Impact Statement (inspired but not modeled after the environmental impact statement) received an overwhelming mandate in 1980 from the White House Conferences on Families. Support was lost, however, during the second stage of the agenda building because of conceptual, methodological, political, and administrative difficulties. Currently only centers receiving relevant grants are engaged in analyzing the possibilities of a Family Impact Statement. The Family Protection Act (FPA), introduced in the 96th and 97th Congresses, contains 31  proposals. It is considered the major social movement of the New Right and establishes tax incentives for families and limits federal authority over child care, abortion, contraceptives, and juvenile delinquency. None of the House and Senate Committees to which the FPA was referred have held hearings, nor are any planned. The history of these two policies may be typical of the manner in which social movements will be treated in the 1980's. (KC)",

Throughout 1976, 21 adults were tested for recall of selected news stories; also, participants recorded daily three news stories that had come to their attention. Results indicated that participants totally ignored 67 percent of newspaper stories. Of the 33 percent that were noticed, less than half concerned government and politicians; other topics of interest were social problems, human interest, and economics. In general, the participants selected news stories that were interesting, simple to understand, and believable. After selection of the stories, participants employed five methods of processing or incorporating the new information into their belief systems: cause and effect  sequences (a story about rising crime rates is attributed to high unemployment); behavior judgments of persons and groups who are the focus of the stories; judgments about population subgroups such as business people, ethnic groups, and students; institutional judgments; expectations based on cultural norms (e.g., democracy is the best form of government); and personal interest stories which evoke empathy. Conclusions are that the types of schemes used for processing information are limited in world perspectives but are adequate for extracting some meaning from most domestic news stories. (KC)",

The media depict old people as rigid, meddlesome, sexless, conservative, unhealthy, and forgetful. Most pernicious of all old age stereotypes is that of second childhood. Popular culture portrays children and old people together as though they have personality characteristics in common. In advertisements, old people are given the personalities, dress, physical problems, playthings, and activities of children. Drug advertisements portray them as throwing tantrums, greeting cards depict them dressed in children's clothes, and one laxative advertisement praises an older woman's regularity by implying that she is a \"good girl.\"  Unfortunately, such identification with children lowers the social status of old people and robs the \"gray power\" movement of adults who might otherwise work for political change and social betterment. Clearly, efforts need to be made to change the media's demeaning portrayal of old age. (Author/KC)",

Approximately 12,000 White, Black, and Hispanic youth rated their attitudes toward statements that a woman's place is in the home, employment of wives leads to juvenile delinquency, employment of both parents is an economic necessity, men should share housework, and women are happier when they stay at home. Results indicated that most youth tend to have nontraditional views on the role of women, although Hispanic youth tend more than their Black and White counterparts to believe that a woman's place is in the home. Young men and women who expect to complete more education have less  traditional views. Of the three ethnic groups, only Black youth do not show congruence between attitudes toward women's roles and fertility expectations. Evidence also suggests that as they grow older, more youth view home and non-home roles as potentially conflicting. Females show greater consistency than males between fertility expectations and their view of women's role. (KC)",

        "description":"Significant regional differences in the proportion of white male and female children in the 19th century in different areas of the United States may be attributable to the economy. Boys were more numerous than girls in the South and along the frontier, while the ratio was more equal or in favor of girls in the eastern states. Data were obtained from county and state decennial census reports from 1820 to 1860 and were computer-generated into maps and tables which revealed differences in male-female ratios. Of the various theories explaining the causes of these sex differences, it appears that changes in the economic system and in the attitudes of the value of children produced these effects. In an economy of early agricultural modernization, boys were a greater asset to farm  families than girls, whereas in industrial urban areas there was little difference in the productive capability of the sexes. Because child labor was widespread during this era, parents could have been influenced to migrate to areas that would be advantageous to the sex of their children and to provide differential care (e.g., boys may have received better medical attention than girls) sufficient to influence childhood mortality patterns.

An evaluation of the workshops indicates  that over 90 percent thought that their goals were met by workshop activities, that workshops were very well organized, and that workshop facilitators were knowledgeable. A followup evaluation revealed that local activities of participating teachers have affected approximately 720 teachers and 44,000 students.

Because the industrial revolution and the movement westward limited the availability of men, the &quot;moral guardian&quot; role society prescribed for women was logically extended to teaching. The reason, however, for the inclusion of women in education was based on economy (women teachers were paid less than men) and the shortage of male teachers. Thus, public arguments for women's education were quite different from private considerations. The economic needs that dictated that women would be the principal members of the teaching profession were obscured by pronouncements of women's superior moral and nurturing powers. For the women who realized that lack of  education was a barrier to independence and respectability, their involvement in teaching was an important way to justify their own education. With literacy, women gained leverage and began to press for equal social, political, and economic opportunities. (KC)",

The survey was conducted over a three-semester period with students who had attended a seminar on reading instruction during which they responded in writing to the question, \"What do you recall about learning to read?\" Responses were analyzed for attitudes toward reading and were assigned to one of three attitudinal categories: positive, negative, or neutral recollections about reading. Neutral recollections formed the largest category in the survey; positive and  negative attitudes were almost evenly divided. Most of the positive recollections dealt with personal enjoyment of reading, while there were several negative recollections about oral reading in school. Study results suggest that, without course work which would stress the positive, appropriate, and practical use of oral reading in the classroom, prospective teachers may shy away from having students read orally. Responses also indicate that the pleasure that reading can offer ought to be reinforced along with methods and skills in all courses in reading instruction. (JD)",

        "description":"A survey questionnaire sent to 371 public school superintendents in Arkansas sought to identify schools offering a program of family life/sex education. An attempt was also made to determine if schools which offered such programs could be distinguished from those that did not, based on responses of school officials to a set of attitudinal statements. The questionnaire achieved a 37 percent response rate (137 usable responses), and there was some doubt about the identity of the respondents (not necessarily superintendents). A map presents a profile of Arkansas, identifying school districts with schools reporting no program in sex education, those reporting at least some type of program, and counties with no schools reporting any type of sex education program. Numbers on the map  indicate counties reporting the highest rate of teenage pregnancy. Some correlation was noted between lowered incidence of teenage pregnancy in some counties recently implementing sex education programs. Previous studies on the subject have indicated that one of the major barriers to initiation of family life/sex education programs is the presumed lack of public support. Findings have revealed, however, that a majority of parents and the general public do support such programs. It was noted in this study that, though Arkansas has an extremely high rate of adolescent pregnancy, less than one-third of the respondents indicated that any type of sex education was offered in their school system. Most of the respondents indicated personal support for sex education programs, with perceived lack  of community support a major barrier to implementing them. (JD)",

        "description":"A justification for the study of teachers' routines, as they affect the preparation of lesson plans, prefaces this paper on teachers' thought processes during lesson planning. In focusing on the importance of research into teachers' routines, it is pointed out that lesson preparation and classroom routines permit teachers to direct attention to special difficulties encountered by students. It is noted that routines also provide clues to teachers' information processing methods and to teachers' ways of solving problems. The nature of routine activities and the sequential steps followed by teachers in making lesson plans and classroom decisions are considered along with psychological studies in this area. A report is presented of a study of teachers' perceptions of their lesson  planning and routine planning activities. Questions addressed involved: (1) classroom issues or problems that teachers treat in the classroom and that do not require planning; (2) classroom issues or problems that are factually treated or at least mentioned during lesson planning; and (3) classroom issues or problems that are considered during lesson planning. In an analysis of the study's results, it is noted that experienced teachers differed from novice teachers in that their knowledge permitted them to predict classroom conditions and execute lesson plans in one step rather than in a series of sequential decisions.

Innovative teaching methods introduced by the SITIP project are described: (1) active teaching; (2) mastery learning; (3) student team learning; and (4) teaching variables. Also delineated are the activities of local education agencies (LEA's) and the roles of center office staff, school-based administrators, and teachers in four areas: (1) training; (2) planning; (3) local implementation; and (4) technical assistance provided by MSDE. A model of the SITIP design is illustrated, and activity areas (preparation, initial commitment, awareness  conferences, local plans drafted by LEA's, implementation, expansion, technical assistance, follow-up training, and assessment of progress and impact) are described. In a discussion of planning at both state and local levels, elements that had a direct relationship to successful implementation are identified. Descriptions are given of awareness conferences, summer institutes, and follow-ups conducted by MSDE. Included in the descriptions of these events are comments on attendance, needs and concerns of the participants, and relationships among training, planning, and implementation. Technical assistance efforts of MSDE are discussed, and evidence of their effectiveness is cited. An overview is given of the scope and impact of local implementation of the SITIP instructional processes.  Critical findings are presented, including planning-related decisions that might be addressed by local educators and issues that intermediate or state education agencies might address. (JD)",

Microteaching has been described as a \"scaled-down\" teaching situation, involving 3 to 10 teacher education students in a 5- to 20-minute lesson, which is often videotaped for future reference. Four main skill areas should be incorporated in a microteaching program: (1) questioning skills, including fluency in asking probing, higher order, and divergent questions; (2) skills aimed at increasing individual student participation; (3) creating student involvement through set induction, stimulous variation, and closure, all of which help to provide a meaningful organization to the lesson; and (4) lesson presentation skills and  methodologies. The trainee supervisor relationship is very important to the microteaching experience. Studies have shown the impact and importance of supervisors' expectations and feedback. Research has also noted the popularity of microteaching in teacher education programs, due to proven effectiveness in imparting teaching skills. (FG)",

In section 1, written by Joanne Rand Whitmore, a description is presented of the purpose and process of NCATE and the functions of NCATE standards. These standards, which serve as guidelines for the evaluation of preservice and graduate education programs, are grouped in six categories: (1) governance; (2) curriculum; (3) faculty; (4) students; (5) resources and facilities; and (6) evaluation and planning. The special education standard requires  NCATE-approved programs to prepare all education/human services professionals to recognize and provide for the special needs of all children in regular educational settings. An interpretation is presented of the relationship between the special education standard and the six categories of the NCATE standards. Section 2 presents suggested self-evaluation questions, which are intended to assist an institution preparing its program to meet the NCATE special education standard. The appendix contains a reprint of a statement adopted by AACTE on the preparation of professionals for educating the handicapped. (JD)",

        "description":"The major question addressed in a study of secondary school teachers was, to what degree do organizational incentives result in maintaining in the profession committed teachers whose primary satisfactions and reasons for persistence are related to students, curriculum, and classroom procedures? Interviews were conducted with 30 secondary school teachers, 20 former teachers, and 10 administrators from 8 school districts surrounding a large Midwestern city. Responses were examined with reference to three stages in the occupational lives of teachers: entry into the profession, maintenance issues related to day-to-day occupational factors, and continuance in the profession. The major conclusion from the analysis was that there are few extrinsic incentives (those that are within the  control of the organization) that can be differentially allocated to individuals to affect performance directly. Intrinsic motivation was found to be the most powerful link to teacher performance. School administrators, bargaining groups, professional societies, and community members who support the educational system need to focus their attention on internalized motivators which are central to a teacher's sense of worth and professional well-being.

In the first section, literature is reviewed that deals with demographic characteristics, teacher concerns, self-concept and self-esteem, empathy, interest in people, scholastic aptitude, cognitive levels of processing, and flexibility and creativity of student teachers, cooperating teachers, and university supervisors. In the second section, general constraints determining who may fill each of the roles in the triad are examined. This section focuses on preparatory experiences, training, and selection of student teachers, university supervisors,  and cooperating teachers. Literature on the roles and functions of cooperating teachers and university supervisors is examined along with research studies about the cooperating teacher's role in socializing the student teacher and influencing the development of teacher behaviors. In the closing section, contextual influences impinging upon and coloring the student teaching experience are reviewed. This section includes some consideration of the university or teacher training institution together with the public schools involved in student teaching. Literature about links of home and parents to the schools, as a general source of influence upon student teaching, are also examined.

        "description":"The Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM) offers an approach to the study of change by focusing on the needs of individuals and describing their growth over time. Seven Stages of Concern (SoC) have been identified that occur as a teacher adopts an innovation: (1) little concern about or involvement with the innovation; (2) interest in learning more about the innovation, with little personal concern; (3) personal uncertainty about the innovation's demands, concern about adequacy to meet demands, and considerations of potential conflicts with existing structures or commitments; (4) concerns related to processes and tasks of using the innovation and the best use of information and resources; (5) attention focused on impact of innovation on students and changes needed to improve  student outcomes; (6) concern focused upon coordination and cooperation with others regarding use of the innovation; and (7) exploration of more universal benefits of the innovation and development of possible alternatives. The concept of Levels of Use (LoU) deals with performance changes as the teacher becomes more familiar with an innovation and skillful in using it. Typical LoU teacher behaviors are: (1) nonuse; (2) information seeking; (3) preparation for use; (4) mechanical, poorly coordinated use; (5) routine use; (6) use integrated and coordinated with others; and (7) use established and effective alternatives sought. An example is given of the use of the CBAM in teacher education, and suggestions are made on the implications of research on change for teacher education.  (JD)",

        "description":"Papers and critiques are presented which were delivered at a conference designed to stimulate ideas and actions among foundations of education faculty members. Six foundations professors who had experience with Dean's Grant Projects were selected to deliver the papers, while seven foundations professors were chosen to present critiques. The introduction to this publication, by Maynard C. Reynolds, gives an overview of the effects of Public Law 94-142 (Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975) and of the Dean's Grants Program on educational theory courses. In the first paper, &quot;The Mandate for Equity in Education: Another Challenge for Foundational Teacher Preparation,&quot; Christopher J. Lucas urges philosophic inquiry into the ambiguities and challenges presented to  teachers by Public Law 94-142. Critiques of Lucas' themes are by Donna R. Barnes and Victor L. Worsfold. The second paper, &quot;All the Children of All the People: Public Law 94-142 and America's Proposition for Education,&quot; by David Julian Hodges, traces the development of equal education rights for handicapped people and cautions educators about the time needed to accomplish attitude change. Alanson A. Van Fleet responds with a different perspective. The third paper, by Angelo V. Boy, addresses client-centered counseling in &quot;Psychological Foundations of Education: The Teacher as Counselor.&quot; Robert L. Hohn presents additional arguments in his critique. A model for the diagnosis of learning characteristics is presented in the fourth paper, &quot;Human Development and Learning: An Individual  Differences Perspective,&quot; by Ronna F. Dillon. James H. McMillan assesses and comments on Dillon's views. &quot;Implications of Public Law 94-142 for Teacher Education in Measurement and Assessment&quot; is the topic of the fifth paper, by Nona Tollefson. The paper is reviewed by Thomas J. Kelly. In the sixth paper, Homer Page describes his course on &quot;Experiential Education with Special Populations.&quot; Jesse Liles evaluates Page's comments.

        "description":"The four papers in this volume address questions raised by the Dean's Grants Program. Among the themes addressed are the potential of deans to fulfill the role of change agent, techniques used in decision making and exercising authority, and faculty members' and deans' perceptions of the dean's role. Carole R. Sivage, in &quot;Advocates of Change: An Analysis of Deans' Roles as Directors of Dean's Grant Projects&quot; presents the results of interviews conducted at 10 institutions receiving Dean's Grants. In an analysis of the case studies, it is suggested that advocacy on the part of the dean should be examined descriptively and qualitatively. Appended to the study is a seven-part outline of the interview questions. In his paper, &quot;Using Structure, Action, and Power to Make Teacher  Preparation Responsive to Public Law 94-142,&quot; John M. Bryson discusses the nature of power in teacher education institutions. Political activities related to decision making are explained in terms of forums, arenas, and courts, and a model, designed to help with Dean's Grant Project administration, is introduced. John M. Bryson and Karin Fladmoe-Lindquist examined judgments of teacher educators during a simulated planning exercise in &quot;Changing Teacher Education: Addressing the Political Difficulties.&quot; The focus was on tactics used in planning and decision making related to specified contextual variables. The results of a survey of 104 deans and interviews with deans and faculty members are reported by Kathy A. Okun in &quot;Deans as Change Agents: Testing Assumptions of the Dean's Grant  Program.&quot; The conclusion of the study endorses the concept of deans as key change agents for curricular change.

        "description":"Two statewide surveys of Texas public school teachers who were members of the Texas State Teachers Association were conducted in l980 and in 1982. The 1980 survey, with 291 respondents, revealed that many teachers were considering leaving teaching. Of these, almost half cited low salaries as the chief reason. The survey also revealed that holding a job during the school year as well as working during the summer was common among the respondents, although most of the summer jobs were in a very low paying category. The results of the survey conducted in l982, with 319 respondents, indicated that a crisis in education still exists in Texas. Low salary remained the reason, given by more than one in three teachers, for seriously considering leaving the teaching profession. Nearly 30  percent of those surveyed were moonlighting to supplement their salaries. Teachers in Texas earned only 68 percent of what was needed to support a family of 4 in a middle-class but not affluent fashion. The rapid decline in real earning power that was observed in 1980 was checked over the past 2 years, due to larger than average salary increases. However, teaching salaries made no gain on the cost of living. Current findings offer no reason to revise the earlier prediction of a severe teacher shortage in Texas. It is planned that this study will be repeated every 2 years for the remainder of the decade. The 1982 survey questionnaire is appended to this report as well as a table comparing results of the l980 and l982 surveys. (JD)",

Research and service functions are as integral to the mission of the school of education as teaching, and should be scheduled with as much care and planning. In one school of education, a 5-year plan to integrate faculty research, service, and teaching assignments began with the design of a matrix for nonscheduled and scheduled workload, a reward system, and service and research assignment planning. The nonscheduled assignments, comprising 25 percent of the workload, typically consist of student advising, syllabus preparation, and committee work; scheduled assignments of teaching, research, and service make up 75 percent of the faculty  workload. Professional Service Units and peer-rated merit increases are awarded for service to the profession. A program has been devised to identify local school district needs and to provide professional assistance through faculty liaisons. Research assignments are planned 1 year in advance.

As part of a larger investigation of a community-based teacher center, a study was undertaken to identify: (1) special issues inherent in a research design that stresses collaboration between practitioners and researchers; (2) differences in data and analysis as a result of practitioner involvement; and (3) differences in the &quot;style&quot; of research carried out by practitioners and professional researchers. The research design, and the recruitment, selection, and training procedures were modified, when needed, to allow for practitioner involvement. Four practitioners were selected and were  involved in every stage of the research. Features of the practitioner research approach that were different from those of the professional researchers were: (1) acting rather than reflecting; (2) subjective involvement in the issue; (3) using everyday experience in questions and analysis; (4) using personal networks to gather data; and (5) building rapport. Practitioners brought resources and styles to research that could add important dimensions to data and analysis in some kinds of studies. Care needs to be taken that practitioners' methods do not lead the research into the nonobjective, nonrepresentational areas that some might fear. (FG)",

        "description":"Teacher career development deals with changes teachers experience throughout their careers, in: (1) job skills, knowledge, and behaviors; (2) attitudes and outlooks toward teaching; and (3) job events and advancement. A growing body of research indicates that teachers have different job skills, knowledge, behaviors, attitudes, and concerns at different points in their careers, and that these changes follow a regular developmental pattern. A study, useful for discussing and developing plans for professional growth, evaluates teachers' survival, adjustment, and mature stages. Administrators and supervisors should become familiar with the new research on teacher career development so that they can provide appropriate assistance for teachers, whether they are in the induction phase  or nearing retirement. Teacher educators should examine and revise content in teacher training programs to prepare students for their first year of teaching. Information about teacher career development also would enable preservice teachers to be aware of and anticipate professional changes which they might experience. Questions about the value and characteristics of teacher career development, as well as on the responsibility of teacher educators, remain to be answered. (FG)",

The Substance Abuse Committee, consisting of a residence-area coordinator, two RD's, and two RSA's, was formed. Resources for educating students were obtained and distributed, and a survey to ascertain student attitudes and behavior concerning drug use was developed. The first and second objectives were accomplished successfully. The third,  implementing drug education in the dormitories, was less successful. It was felt that the university's Department of Residence Services had difficulty in perceiving and understanding the nature of this task and its relation to their operations, and the notion of drug education was mistakenly confused with drug information. Further plans are being made for implementing a comprehensive drug education program. Appendixes include: (1) a resource list for substance abuse information; (2) a sample survey questionnaire eliciting information on student drug involvement; (3) survey findings from the questionnaire distributed at Kent State University; and (4) a sample drug education presentation.

Two ideas are discussed: (1) amount of mental effort investment (AIME), defined as the number of nonautomatic elaborations applied to a unit of material, and measured by self reports, is seen as capturing the essence of such constructs as depth of processing and mindful processing; and (2) the role played by perceptions, beliefs and preconceptions which pertain to the nature of a particular class of materials and the effort it demands. Evidence is provided from studies that examined the ways in which TV is perceived, in comparison to print, and how  these perceptions affect the actual ways of handling specific materials from each medium. The case is then generalized to other kinds of sources. (Author)",

Methodologies for data collection and analysis included quantitative measures of individual and group responses to change and qualitative dimensions concerning a sense of the context, interactions, and social meanings underlying the quantitative responses. These qualitative measures interpret and organize data to represent existing reality within a site and contribute to theory across sites. Qualitative methods can include coding of change action interventions, listing of effects, levels of use of an innovation,  and configuration and concerns data. Qualitative information can be focused by using intervention mapping of planned action, antecedent mapping of how change evolved, critical incident maps and time lines, and &quot;reality checks&quot; by cross-site discussions involving &quot;site expert&quot; researchers and district representatives. These techniques provide a means for interpretation, cross verification, and validation of phenomena present in the data. (CM)",

The test is based on the outcome of a research program dealing with various aspects of children's printing that involved over 400 normal, non-repeating, native English-speaking children from lower and middle socio-economic backgrounds. The task requires children to print a series of letters and numbers from pictures that are presented to them one at a time on cards held in a spiral binder. Each child's resulting reproductions are then scored for certain errors, known as form errors, which predict with the same accuracy as many more time-consuming screening instruments. This manual contains  information regarding (1) test materials, (2) administration procedures, (3) scoring procedures, (4) recommendations for using the test, (5) recommendations for early intervention, (6) summary, and (7) precautions.

The initial item pool was generated by the free-association written responses of high school students. Occupational titles were selected for inclusion in a pilot questionnaire if the students mentioned them more than twice. The scale was administered to vocationaal guidance clients. Items for the six Vocational Interest Survey scales were selected on the basis of cluster analysis of the 138-item pilot questionnaire, along with repeated item-total correlation analyses. The resulting six scales contained 105 items and provided internal consistency reliability ranging from 0.72 to 0.93. Principal  components analysis of the scales produced a two-dimensional structure of interests. Scores on the VIS were related to existing interest measures. The results confirmed &quot;positively&quot; each of the six scales' construct validity. When VIS scores were compared with those for personality and ability measures, the results confirmed &quot;negatively&quot; the construct validity of each of the VIS scales. The VIS will provide counselors with information at low cost and with a brief investment of time. These experimental scales are intended for use in guidance and research. (Author/DWH)",

Using research findings and common sense, arguments are presented for other skills as being more basic than the \"3R's.\" Evidence is presented that the skills taught in preparation for MCTs are disconnected, are not general and do not generalize. Arguments are made that preparing children for MCTs forces teachers to use a didactic mode of teaching even more than usual and that this mode flies in the face of all that is known from child psychology about good environments for  important learning. It is contended that because the skills do not generalize, minority groups who accept MCT programs are being lulled into a false sense of accomplishment and security and that the programs are thus racist in impact if not in intent in ways not contended by the plaintiffs in the case of Debra P.

        "description":"The Classification of Secondary School Courses (CSSC) is a coding activity to translate the diverse course titles which appear on transcripts and master schedules of students into common terms, permitting meaningful comparisons to be made about these students and allowing secondary school coursework to be considered as a coherent factor in statistical studies. The CSSC facilitates this task by aggregating under a unique main course title all similar course titles and assigning each main title a unique six-digit code. A test of intercoder reliability was designed, conducted and analyzed to test the usefulness of the CSSC as a coding tool and develop recommendations on coder training and the coding task. This report summarizes the following activities integral to the test: (1)  coder selection and training; (2) training methodology; and (3) coding task and analysis results. While there is a fair amount of variability in the coding, there are a number of straight-forward ways to reduce it and achieve nearly perfect codings. Some of these techniques involve training enhancements (e.g., expanding the cross-reference list) and some involve procedural approaches (e.g., using multiple coders). (Author/PN)",

However, NAEP data suggest that curriculum still emphasizes instruction in component skills apart and separate from the application of these skills. Many students evidence difficulty with tasks requiring higher-order skills. Gains evidenced by younger students in groups traditionally considered disadvantaged are being accompanied by declines in groups usually considered advantaged. In particular, the older and better students do not appear to be keeping up with  their counterparts in earlier assessments. In many instances, differences in performance may be decreasing, but overall performance is not improving.

The results of two experiments on the effects of prior knowledge upon comprehension of simple technical prose are presented. The procedure was to collect ratings of the amount of prior knowledge for individual passage sentences, and then determine whether those familiarity ratings predict reading (study) time and recall for the sentences. Results are patterned on the idea that increased study time is required for unfamiliar material due to the additional processing required to encode an unknown proposition and to elaborate less familiar propositions. The results are discussed in terms of possible theoretical mechanisms for the use of prior knowledge in  prose memory. (Author/PN)",

This study examined (1) the differences between examinees who requested these disclosure materials and those who did not, and (2) the differences between different examinee sub-populations in the likelihood of their requesting disclosure materials. For each of the March, May and June 1980 New York administrations, a data set was prepared that contained data for all requestors (4.77 percent of all test takers for the three administrations) and for a random sample of nonrequestors.  Analysis showed that requestors came from wealthier, more educated families; that requestors were more academically achieving than nonrequestors; and that requestors reported higher academic aspirations than nonrequestors. The likelihood of requesting disclosure differed both among different ethnic groups and across the two SAT administrations. Speculations that test disclosure materials might be disproportionately utilized by already advantaged groups and by those for whom the materials would have a direct utility (retesting, etc.) were largely confirmed by the findings.

The system is used to set up the strategies for precision remedial teaching. Testing practice will be improved, the communication between assessors and teachers will be more validly grounded, and, above all, the LPAD/IE principles are generic to pedagogy. The adoption of an LPAD/IE approach must be followed by a massive inservice and public information effort. Otherwise, the LPAD/IE system will be seen merely as an  alternative way of ranking by intellect for permanent placement in a category. (Author/PN)",

This suggests that the physical characteristics of an event may be deeply or elaborately encoded when they are meaningful in light of the task demands. Furthermore, memory about the acquisition event was superior when its physical characteristics matched those of the test probe (e.g., both were presented in a male voice) than when they mismatched. This facilitation was greater when the feature was meaningful than when it was non-meaningful. It was hypothesized that memory of an event could occur either by retrieving the episodic trace representing the particular event or by  constructing the event from an abstract, thematic code that integrates several, conceptually related events. It is suggested that elaborate encoding--relating an event to a structure of other events--facilitates memory because it permits the use of thematic knowledge at the time of retrieval. (Author/PN)",

In a general matrix representation of the problem, several new analytic results are proved concerning the parameters which affect bias in observed-score regression statistics. The bias in ordinary least squares estimators is expressed as a function of covariances among true scores, among the measurement errors, and sample size. The first two projects were employed to create an algorithm for assessing the potential bias due to the unreliability of measures. The algorithm was implemented as a FORTRAN program to improve the design of investigations of change and minimize potential errors  of inference. A review is presented of statistical methods which have been developed in several disciplines to estimate the parameters of true change by correcting the observed-score regression estimates for unreliability. A series of Monte Carlo experiments which evaluated the performance of the methods are discussed. The advantages and general superiority of estimators proposed by Fuller are examined. The relevance of a special linear functional relation (LFR) model and models devised for estimating the parameters of LFRs are compared. (Author/CM)",

As adapted for use in a public school setting, Goal Attainment Scaling proved to be a useful tool in not only determining program outcomes, but in also providing a standard for program decisions in a school environment characterized by flux and shifting frames of reference. How program goals were scaled, scored, and interpreted using the Goal Attainment Scaling procedure are discussed. It was concluded that the Margaret Sheehy  School Parent Outreach Program was successful in establishing a cost-effective home-based school program focusing on both academic and related needs of referred children.

        "description":"A 1978 study (Torgesen, Bowen and Ivey) of the structure and modality variables of the Visual-Aural Digit Span (VADS) test was replicated to determine: (1) if the effects generalized across age; (2) if differences between simultaneous and sequential visually presented items were due to mode of presentation or the amount of study time; (3) the effects of mode of output; and (4) the relationship between performance on the various tests and performance on standard achievement tests in mathematics and reading for second and fourth graders. The major consistent finding was that all groups performed significantly better on simultaneous digit span tests than on sequentially presented digit span tests. However, there was no significant difference in overall performance between second and  fourth graders. Unlike Torgesen et al., the consistent positive and significant correlations among performance on all conditions argued for a consistent memory for order across different conditions. Finally, the failure to find significant correlations between the memory for order measures and achievement scores fails to replicate earlier studies. Possible explanations for the failure to replicate revolves around differences in age of subjects and measures used. (Author/PN)",

In 1979, directors of special education districts, assistants to the directors, and directors of joint agreements were requested to send a copy of the teacher evaluation form most commonly used in their schools. In 1982, the same sample was again asked to send their teacher evaluation forms. Each form (n=132) was scored on seven standards: (1) discipline, (2) behavior management, (3) classroom management, (4) instructional, (5) relationships with parents, (6) professional development, and (7) communication between special education and local district. A mean was derived for each criterion statement for each standard. The seven selected standards did not  demonstrate a statistically significant difference between teacher evaluation forms of 1979 and 1982. Examination of a specific criterion within each standard did demonstrate growth in the stated criterion between 1979 and 1982. The increase in the number of rankings for a selected criterion did indicate compliance with state and federal mandates with special education. Decreases in specific criteria were resultant of administrative/managerial perceived needs, and not resultant of improved special education teacher effectiveness. (Author/PN)",

This paper examines the findings of a recent study on the uses of National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and suggests implications for increasing use of state and local assessment results. The NAEP study, conducted at Northwestern University, generated evidence that assessment results and methods were employed to make decisions, persuade others, and enhance understanding of issues. These uses occurred in the context of professional activities (the use of results to improve instruction); research (the use of results to understand achievement); and policy development (the use of results by different levels of governance). State and local agencies often exploited NAEP findings and methods to assess student achievement and  to identify and address weaknesses in curricular programs, but there was a wide variety of other uses as well. Implications are discussed for assessment planning, meeting heterogeneous user needs, inventing multiple dissemination strategies, providing technical assistance, developing inter-institutional relations, and systematic monitoring of use.

In choosing a specific cross-validation procedure, one should consider both costs (e.g., inefficient use of available data in estimating regression parameters) and benefits (e.g., accuracy in estimating population cross-validity). Empirical cross-validation methods involve significant costs, since they are typically laborious and wasteful of data, but under conditions represented in Monte Carlo studies, they are generally not more accurate than formula estimates. Consideration of costs and benefits suggests that empirical estimation methods are typically not worth the cost, except in a limited number of cases in which Monte Carlo sampling assumptions are not met in the derivation  sample. Designs which use multiple samples to estimate the cross-validity of a single regression equation are clearly preferable to single-sample designs; the latter are never expected to be more accurate than formula estimates and thus are never worth the cost. Multi-equation designs are more accurate than single equation designs, but they appear to estimate the wrong parameter, and thus are difficult to interpret. (Author)",

Two procedures for test development rely on domain specifications and item review for congruence with these specifications. The two procedures for test selection  are concerned with a test's relevance and its technical properties. Domain specifications connect learning outcomes to instructional content and the assessment of learning by providing rules for describing the domain, generating items, and setting their linguistic and cognitive complexity. The test selection procedures consider a test's instructional relevance to specified skills and objectives and its technical qualities.

The more comprehensive application of classical test theory in construct validation is distinguished from that in criterion-oriented validation. Critics of thematic apperceptive measurement of the achievement motive have often blurred this distinction and have consequently failed to appreciate the construct validity of this motive measure. Using explicit true score measurement models of theoretical constructs, evidence for the construct validity of the achievement motive in a representative sample of adult males in America (n=508) is described. Evidence is presented that the achievement motive construct is related in theoretically  expected ways to constructs of academic achievement and work satisfaction, despite the presence of substantial random measurement error in thematic apperceptive measures of the motive. Evidence for the discriminant validity of story content from story length in the thematic apperception test is also presented in this nomological network. (Author/PN)",

It is part of a larger program of national longitudinal surveys commenced in 1972 by the National Center for Education Statistics. The state of Washington participated directly in the study by expanding the number of schools selected (n=50) for the national study to create valid state samples. Washington elected to survey the schools using National Opinion Research Center (NORC) materials and procedures but with state personnel and resources. To assure the validity of comparisons with the national results, NORC provided the data processing of the completed instruments. Because Washington was the only state to select this approach, the Washington High School and  Beyond Study illustrates a unique example of a state's adaptation of a large-scale national survey activity. The report describes the background of the study, the focus on school-level data, the development of interviewing skills, the growing interest in the High School and Beyond data, the procedures used, concerns and problems encountered, and the benefits of interviewing as a follow-up technique.

Its purposes were to confirm (or disconfirm) the cultural differences hypothesis and to provide a systematic basis for reducing this potential source of test bias and invalidity. Subjects were 810 Anglo, Black, and Mexican-American students in grades 2, 4, and 6. The test used was the Raven Progressive Matrices. The relative level of culturally related bias was predicted for each item a priori, based on level of complexity. Results indicated that although group differences on the test are related to developmental level, they are  also related to test-taking skills. Test-taking skills are a major source of variation; they are learned and can be strengthened through exposure to specific requirements for the test. These results indicate that an important source of bias is as much in the overall testing procedure as in the test itself, and challenge the assumption that all children approach and solve a test-taking task in the same way.

The digest seeks to focus on matters of high priority in the conduct of current activities for instructional improvement. This article addresses the matter of how to use student test results for instructional purposes. It provides a simple and practical strategy for using test information sensibly. Interpreting test results, subtest labels, and test items are  discussed.

        "description":"In the spring of 1979, the National Institute of Education, in collaboration with the United States Office of Education, the UCLA Center for the Study of Evaluation (CSE), and members of a nation-wide network of research and development agencies, sponsored a national colloquy on the theme that testing could have an important impact in improving the effectiveness of instruction, but that much remained to be understood about testing needs and problems. Eight regional conferences were held. Each conference involved presentations from national and regional figures in the area of testing and instruction. The conferences also provided an initial training opportunity in test development and test selection to acquaint participants with some of the newer ideas in the field. Each  conference devoted its second day to important regional issues and needs. The recommendations of the regional conferences can be synthesized as follows: (1) current testing perspectives need to be refocused; (2) decisions about test development and selection should involve a much broader constituency than is presently the case; (3) the instructional application of testing needs to be refined; and (4) greater coordination is needed among federal, state, and local testing needs. Some implications growing from these recommendations are presented. (Author/BW)",

Research demonstrated a statistically significant and useful relationship between proficiency as respiratory therapists and SATB aptitudes of general learning ability, spatial aptitude, form perception, and motor coordination. The validation sample consisted of 496 employed workers (including 99 blacks) from 17 states and the District of Columbia. The SATB was found to be fair to Blacks, Hispanics, and non-minorities and to males and females,  using several definitions of fairness. Job performance data were collected during 1972-81 using supervisory ratings. The job analysis procedure, experimental General Aptitude Test Battery (GATB), validation sample description, and criterion-related validity for the study are explored. A sample Descriptive Rating Scale and respiratory analyst job description are included. Work performed includes record keeping, therapy procedures, equipment care, and other duties. (CM)",

Two areas of weakness were found: (1) the lack of depth of clinical correlates left the test user to extrapolate from assumed characteristics of criterion group members and/or scale item content; and (2) the documentation of cutting scores did little to suggest at what elevations a scale has clinical meaning. Therefore, criterion data was collected from parents in the form of a clinic application blank. The resulting actuarial study, completed in 1979, analyzed 431 PIC  protocols from children and adolescents during 1976 and 1977, comparing each of the 16 profile scales with 322 potential correlates. These analyses identified a reasonably robust number of cross-validated correlates and also delineated scale T-score ranges where these correlates were the most likely descriptive. Concerns which were also explored include: (1) the use of maternal reports to predict cognitive characteristics of their children, (2) the possibility that PIC scales represent maternal observations that can be distorted, and (3) the length of the administration booklet.

The number of erroneous line-judgments (conformity) made by subjects across five consent treatments and a no-consent control group were measured. Also, post-task measures assessed subjects' reactions to the experiment. Results revealed that informing subjects that they would not be at risk or would be at risk because they would be deceived increased the frequency of conforming line-judgments, while other consent statements did not influence conformity. Also, deception aroused subjects emotionally, but subjects did not indicate that they believed the deception placed  them at risk, nor did it adversely affect their impressions of the quality of the research. Implications of these results for future research on deception are considered. (Author/PN)",

The Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM) Project at the Texas Research and Development Center in particular has developed specific measures which can be applied directly: &quot;Levels of Use of the Innovation&quot; measure evaluates to what extent a program is actually being used, while &quot;Innovation Configuration&quot; describes what adaptations, if any, have been made in the program. The need to view any program within a time frame necessary for it to be considered fully installed has also been a valuable contribution from the change process research. The two CBAM measures can also be used to establish what this time period is. Taking  into account the three dimensions of time for implementation, levels of use, and description of use, evaluation designs can be far more specific about what they portend to evaluate and can attribute effects of this specifically described program with a greater degree of validity.

The case studies focus on local government and community attitudes toward the refugees; patterns of resettlement; and the nature and extent of health, housing, welfare, employment, and educational services that have been made available to them. It is suggested that there is a wide disparity among the states in their receptivity to the refugees, their management of the resettlement process, and their administration of public assistance. However, it is indicated that there is general resentment of the refugees among other low income groups competing for jobs and housing,  and that community attitudes toward the refugees are likely to become less hospitable as competition for reduced Federal funding sharpens. Observing that Indochinese refugee resettlement is widely seen as the Federal government's responsibility, the report emphasizes that Federal policies and funds alone cannot assure successful programs, and that the keys to success in refugee resettlement lie in community education, community-private sector cooperation in refugee employment, and other initiatives at the local level.

        "description":"This report on school desegregation consists of two parts. Part one is made up of two case studies designed to explore the manner in which Federal and State compensatory education policies affect educational equity at the local level in two Michigan districts that have been desegregated for several years. The degree of educational equity in the schools is identified by (1) the extent of resegregation; (2) the extent to which they provide a common educational experience for all students or differentiate objectives, curricula and materials for target students; and (3) achievement outcomes for target students in the various compensatory programs (Title I, Article 3 of the Michigan Public Act 94, Federal and State bilingual programs, and the Emergency School Aid Act). Part two of the  report is the result of three symposia held in 1980 at Michigan State University. For the first symposium, media experts were brought together to define desegregation policy issues which might be scientifically researched in order to provide pertinent information to professionals involved in school desegregation. The second symposium was held for educational policy makers at the local, State, and national levels, while the third was attended by legal professionals. In this section of the report, desegregation related issues that have concerned educators since the 1954 &quot;Brown&quot; decision are reviewed, and a new set of concerns as seen by participants from the various professions are raised.

        "description":"A study in 18 schools in the Alum Rock (California) Union Elementary School District investigated the educational effects of differential distribution of compensatory resources and services to educationally disadvantaged pupils. The study focused on the relative effects on reading skills of two methods for resource targeting: (1) concentration, or the targeting of additional resources and services only to those pupils who meet the entitlement criteria in a school; and (2) saturation, or the distribution of additional resources and services to any and all pupils in the school. In addition, the study investigated the contextual and instructional conditions that might account for differences in reading skills. Classroom observations were conducted to examine (1) types of teacher and  student activities; (2) time spent on instruction; (3) teacher-pupil interaction; (4) materials; (5) teachers' interpersonal styles; (6) instructional modes; and (7) group size. Data analysis indicated that concentrated services produced higher mean readinq scores than saturated services among fourth graders, although no significant differences were found among second graders; and that more time spent in noninstructional activities tended to lower reading scores. In general, however, the analysis did not identify the instructional components associated with the benefits of concentrated compensatory services. (Author/MJL)",

        "description":"Chaldean Americans in Detroit, Michigan, a growing community of Roman Catholic immigrants from Iraq, are the focus of this study. A description is given of the Detroit Chaldean community centers around three key institutions, namely the church, the family, and the ethnic occupation or community economic enterprise, and of how these institutions have been affected by the migration experience and by contact with the new culture. An analysis of the social setting of migration examines religious and economic determinants of migration to America, migration effects on the Detroit community, and Chaldeans' relationships with other social groups in Detroit. An exploration of Chaldeans' adaptation to their new setting considers assimilation and acculturation processes, changes in social  structure and values, creation of a balance between old country patterns and new practices, and the development of an ethnic identity and a sense of nationalism. Ethnic conflicts and accommodation processes that arise from efforts to achieve the balance between old and new are explored, and it is suggested that family and friendship ties will offset the divisive effects of conflict and American liberalism and keep the Chaldean community from disintegrating. Finally, an exploration of the future direction of American ethnicity points to the need for unity in a culturally diverse society. (Author/MJL)",

Results revealed that: (1) blacks tend to be more field dependent than whites, a difference that seems to be associated with blacks' lower performance levels on school tasks; (2) blacks tend to categorize their world using more finely discriminated classes than whites; (3) differences in stylistic preferences and performance on cognitive tasks seem to diminish if students were matched for life style, social situation, age, and grade; and (4) variations in cognitive patterns seem to be associated  with school performance and with students' social status. Overall, the data indicated rather complex relationships among preferred ways of knowledge acquisition, social and economic roles, and school performance. Many of the findings are inconclusive, however, because of varying results generated by the use of different instruments. (Author/MJL)",

        "description":"An emerging hypothesis about black progress since the civil rights movement in the United States postulates that economic polarization is occurring in the black community. This hypothesis, which incorporates conflicting earlier theories of declining versus persistent racial differences, suggests that talented and well-educated blacks are competing successfully with whites, while other blacks are falling further behind both whites and successful blacks, and that the gap between those at the top and those at the bottom of the economic structure is widening. To test the polarization hypothesis, socioeconomic data on blacks and whites were analyzed. The analysis produced mixed results. Data on occupational prestige distributions and proportions of labor force nonparticipants  suggested that polarization may be occurring. On the other hand, data on educational attainment distributions and earnings/employment returns to education indicated that the black community is becoming more homogeneous. Analysis of family income according to degree of concentration among income groups refuted the polarization hypothesis, while findings of a widening dollar gap between rich and poor supported the hypothesis. Finally, data on economic differentials by type of family clearly supported the hypothesis of polarization. (Author/MJL)",

        "description":"Selective organizational change in the school presents one promising approach for delinquency prevention among young people. The organizational change approach assumes that: (1) delinquency will be reduced when young people are able to show their competence and worth; (2) young people learn socially legitimate behavior mainly in the school; and (3) specific organizational arrangements create opportunities that influence positive behavior. An organizational change project for delinquency prevention might be based on a partnership between personnel of a public elementary or secondary school and outside groups (such as State government agencies or community groups). The project would consist of five implementation sequences. In the first stage, outside groups initiate plans and  enter into working agreements with selected schools, and participants in the partnership collaborate on a written plan. In the second stage, the team assesses the school to identify organizational features that influence what happens to students in school. In the third stage, the group uses data from the assessment to make decisions and select areas to be targeted for change. In the fourth phase, the cooperating groups identify specific team roles and then formulate and implement strategies for change. In the final stage, the team conducts an evaluation to determine the effects of change. (Author/MJL)",

        "description":"Cost-effectiveness analysis provides a useful tool for choosing between alternative desegregation plans or justifying one particular plan. Previous analyses of school desegregation effects on white enrollment, which focus only upon costs, have had limited use for policy. Traditional cost-benefit analysis poses problems because of the difficulty of attaching monetary values to policy alternatives and because the courts consider school desegregation a a goal in itself rather than just one of many alternatives leading to other goals. In cost-effectiveness analysis, the school desegregation goal may be identified as interracial exposure, and the analysis can proceed using (1) a measure of the extent of interracial exposure indicating the proportion of white students in the average  black child's school; and (2) information on school racial composition after projected reassignments and after white flight. Analysis of proposals for the San Diego (California) Independent School District using this method indicated that the American Civil Liberties Union plan would maximize interracial exposure more than either the school district plan or the condition of no further desegregation. By varying the white flight values in analysis, as was done for the Port Arthur (Texas) Independent School District, the effects of white flight on the value of desegregation plans can be estimated.

Chapter 2 shows how the different subgroups comprising the Hispanic American population (Mexicans, Cubans, Puerto Ricans, and Central and South Americans) vary in their characteristics and in problems encountered in the labor market. Chapter 3 reviews the literature on Hispanic Americans in order to explore the reasons for Hispanics' high unemployment rate and for their overrepresentation in low-paying jobs. It is suggested that, in general, the major  causes of Hispanics' labor market problems are: (1) lack of proficiency in English; (2) low levels of formal schooling; and (3) discrimination in the labor market. Finally, chapter 4 examines two federally sponsored activities designed to improve the economic position of Hispanic Americans, namely, bilingual education programs, and training programs to develop skills required for employment.

        "description":"Most of the recent research identifying organizational characteristics that seem to make schools unusually effective has been conducted at the elementary level and may not be applicable to secondary schools. Research currently underway suggests that the basic organizational structures of elementary and secondary schools dictate two different approaches to improving effectiveness. The secondary level is distinguished from the elementary level by structural looseness, departmentalization, and increased size. These factors undermine agreement on educational goals and block efforts of high school principals and administrators to influence classroom management. Secondary school principals are limited in their influence over programs and exercise symbolic leadership. Furthermore, it  must be recognized that schools serve students of a wide range of socioeconomic and intellectual levels, and that high schools, in particular, must prepare these students for the outside world. Therefore, in defining secondary school effectiveness, it is necessary to consider more than the criterion of \"basic skills.\" (Author/GC)",

Areas discussed in which high risk students may differ from other students include cognitive ability, task motivation and task performance, cultural aspiration and its relationship to educational attainment, locus of control, and self-esteem. The responsibility of schools in directing their programs toward problematic students is considered. Major elements that must be addressed or accounted for in an academic curriculum for high risk students are identified. Among these are: (1) a wide range of cognitive skills, (2) reasoning ability, (3)  communication skills, (4) nontraditional instructional methods, (5) competency-oriented disciplinary and interdisciplinary studies, (6) the revival of a \"general education\" curriculum, (7) self-actualization within the academic experience, (8) integration of the students' social environment into schooling, (9) transitional reentry programs, and (10) retraining programs for dropouts. Finally, a program model for the education of high risk students at the secondary and postsecondary levels is proposed. The model comprises curricular concerns and evaluation practices, school organization and administration, personnel and student concerns, and access to and articulation with the community and other learning institutions. An extensive list of references is provided. (GC)",

        "description":"In response to a request from the Department of Staff Development in Montgomery County, Maryland, an assessment was conducted of the county's Teacher Competency (TC) Program. The evaluation sought to determine the degree to which this inservice teacher training program addresses the factors identified in recent literature as promoting effective teaching: (1) teacher expectations, (2) classroom management skills and engaged time/academic learning time, (3) direct instruction, and (4) teacher decision making. Every course in the TC Program was found to address at least one of these factors. Further, it appeared that the Program's courses provide teachers with realistic experiences for applying concepts identified in the literature as being important, such as &quot;hands on&quot;  self-analysis, and practicum-type activities. A number of areas, however, were found to require improvement. Therefore, the following recommendations were offered: (1) teacher expectations of minority and linguistically different students should be more fully addressed in TC courses; (2) TC course reference lists should include more research studies on effective teaching practices; and (3) concepts relating to academic learning time should be incorporated into additional Program courses.

        "description":"The priority attached to inner-city student desegregation has often become diminished with the onset of mandatory faculty desegregation. Consequently, students tend to be substantially more segregated than teachers in urban schools. Faculties in predominantly minority schools typically have higher turnover and less experience than faculties in other schools. The effect of these circumstances on the academic achievement of elementary school students was examined in the Houston (Texas) Independent School District, the largest district in the nation initially affected by court-ordered desegregation. Achievement among black students was found to be negatively related to the extent to which their teachers were racially isolated.(Degree of racial isolation was measured by the  proportion of same race students assigned to respective teachers.) In addition, achievement was lower for black students assigned teachers who had been transferred involuntarily for faculty desegregation purposes. Achievement of black, Hispanic, and white students was positively associated with teaching experience and negatively related to faculty turnover. These findings suggest that poorly planned desegregation policies can have undesirable consequences. (Author/GC)",

It first discusses preliminary steps the consortium took, including exploration of ways to create better linkages and examination of obstacles to successful placement of the handicapped and their career-related needs. The next section describes the model that provides for classification of the students by the school and school-based actions in collaboration with parents to facilitate development of  vocational/special education programs for mildly handicapped youth. The 19 components of the model are discussed, and the role of the four sectors--schools, home, social service and rehabilitation agencies, and business and industry--that share responsibility for that component is also described. A final discussion focuses on some process issues, namely time constraints and participants' commitment to the project, and three issues related to development of the model: schools as initiators of the process, communication dynamics, and the organizational/individual nature of linkage endeavors. Appendixes include a glossary, lists of project participants and advisory committee members, and an abstract. (YLB)",

Only the goal of providing for early licensing was found to have been met. It was recommended that the State Board of Education support legislation to (1) repeal the state requirement for classroom and behind-the-wheel training in the public secondary school curriculum, (2) amend early licensing  provision, (3) amend the statutory provision concerning personnel certification requirements, (4) amend the statutes to authorize school districts to provide a comprehensive driver education program directly or indirectly through contract, and (5) amend the statutes to provide that the secretary of state shall have sole responsibility for licensing and supervision of commercial training driver schools.

The subjects were men who at the end of the decade were 26-34 and 55-69 and women who were 26-34 and 40-54 years of age. Information on unemployment was available for only 8 years and thus understated incidence and amount of unemployment over the decade. Large proportions of individuals with labor force exposure experienced some unemployment. Unemployment varied substantially among the subjects and was very unevenly distributed within each one. Unemployment meant lost earnings and led to long-term reductions in earning capacity. Multivariate analysis revealed that characteristics  bearing the strongest and most consistent relationship with the duration of unemployment are educational attainment, occupational and industrial affiliation, interfirm mobility, and length of service in the job held at the beginning of the decade. Many unemployment experiences appeared to result from being in the wrong place at the wrong time or from personality characteristics that generally go unmeasured.

The general hypothesis was that computing would have enhanced control of work life in relation to other individuals and in relation to the job for employees higher in the organizational hierarchy who perform more discretionary information processing tasks. The hypothesis also proposed that computing would have diminished control of work life for employees lower in the hierarchy with less discretion. Data were derived from self-administered questionnaires completed by 1,448 municipal government employees who indicated they use the computer or receive computer-based information and have some interaction with those providing computing services. Computing had  not yet caused dramatic effects on the work environment, but it had had notable effects on some aspects. Where computing had altered the employee's control in the work environment, the change tended to be job enhancing. Data in the analysis constituted a strong case against the general hypothesis.

        "description":"A study examined characteristics of female medical students who indicated an intention to specialize in surgery, traditionally a male-dominated field. Family backgrounds, career motivations, and career orientations from this group were compared with the same characteristics of female medical students selecting other fields of specialization. Data were collected in a national survey of third-year medical students in the spring of 1978. Questionnaires were returned by 1,238 persons from 112 different United States medical schools. The Association of American Medical Colleges provided anonymous background data from the respondents' admission records. Women selecting surgery were more likely never to marry, to have a physician father and homemaker mother, and to have higher family  income. Female surgery students decided on a medical career at younger ages, were more certain of their choices of specialization, and were more likely to be interested in a private practice. In regards to career orientation, female surgery students were more likely to state that the desire for financial rewards is important and that physicians need to sacrifice personal time for the sake of their work. They were less likely to report that the time demands of most medical practices are unreasonable. Shown through these characteristics, the women selecting surgery were significantly different from women entering other areas of specialization and were more similar to male medical students. (YLB)",

Data were analyzed from questionnaires from 4,191 nurses currently employed in hospitals or not employed at all. The sample was from a major metropolitan area in the Midwest. The most satisfying aspects of nursing work were shown to be working with other nurses and with patients. Nurses were least satisfied with personal child care availability and chances for advancement. Older nurses tended to be more satisfied with many aspects of work. Nurses with children under the age of 13 at home related more dissatisfaction with working conditions. Life-cycle variables were strongly related to nurse-employment status. One characteristic of work, hours and schedules, was related  negatively to employment status, perhaps pushing nurses out of hospital employment, while the nursing work itself tended to be the strongest positive correlate of hospital employment. The extent to which nurses had other competing role obligations (spouses and/or young children) affected work satisfaction and employment status. Data supported the notion that role conflict contributed more heavily than other factors to nurse attrition. (YLB)",

The report begins with a description of three major economic trends within the United States: the displacement of goods by services, factors related to the growth in productivity, and the increase in foreign competition. Future employment projections are then presented that provide evidence of changing labor-force skills. National assessment results for 17-year-old students with both high- and low-level skills in reading, writing, mathematics, and science follow. Implications of these conclusions are then discussed: the 10 percent  of students who are unable to perform basic skills represent hundreds of thousands of people and the percentage of students who achieve higher order skills is declining. The final two sections of the report explore problems confronting educators (changing definitions and diverse needs of students, educational responsibilities and relevance, curriculum and skills, institutional instructional technology, teacher shortages and training, accreditation issues, and joint education-industry responsibility and finance) and some actions currently proposed. Sample exercises from the National Assessment are appended. (YLB)",

Relying primarily upon prepared software packages, the first educator relies on his computer as a resource to aid in word processing and in home and professional management. The second educator, on the other hand, is primarily a hobbyist who finds his computer a constant source of intellectual stimulation. Both users of personal computers represent a significant potential market for credit and non-credit adult education offerings. Both educators have found their home computers a valuable professional resource in that it eliminates the need  for copious notes, outlines, and drafts when preparing professional reports; reduces typing and dictation time; provides constant intellectual stimulation; forces individuals to better organize their thoughts; and facilitates the rapid retrieval of information. The growing use of home computers has created the need for new software packages that are based on a humanist rather than a behavioralist philosophy as well as for additional adult-level courses or workshops on using home computers. The personal computer is also a valuable tool for use in adult education program administration. (MN)",

        "description":"Military professionalism began developing with the creation of professional officer corps in Prussia, France, and Britain during the 19th century. Prussia had a system that focused on practical military qualifications and promoted social discrimination. In contrast, the French system placed heavy emphasis on competition and had officials that recruited more widely. A noticeable difference from Prussian military education was that the education virtually ended when one was commissioned. Lacking the impetus for chanqe (the Revolution in France and Prussian military disasters in the Napoleonic wars), Britain retained its 18th century military system longer. Officer production was built around the concept that military leadership naturally developed from social status. Only in the  second half of the 19th century was the purchase system abolished. Discrimination in favor of the classes continued, since only the upper classes could afford to keep sons in schools when the entrance age to military academies was raised. Acceleration in the rate of technological and social change in the 20th century complicated the fundamental problems that 19th century military educators never completely solved. American academies have taken steps to improve the quality and to eliminate discrimination. They have maintained the principle of a common pre-commissioning education and have introduced specialization in the sciences and social and humanistic studies. (YLB)",

The report is organized into six chapters. Following an overview of the study in chapter 1, a synthesis of articles, books, and news stories in chapter 2 provides a historical perspective on out-of-state home care and changes in public attitude about out-of-state placement of children. Chapter 3 investigates the constitutionality of interstate placements and the legal authority of state laws for interstate placements. Chapter 4 describes the substantive and procedural elements of each of the three interstate compacts relating to the movement of children across state lines. In chapter 5, information on the case studies  drawn during the project is provided, including why the case-study states were selected, the organization of services in each agency studied, and a summary of key findings and recommendations. Out-of-state placement policies, practices, and issues are also summarized, and pros and cons of current policies are examined. The final chapter draws together all major findings of this research on the out-of-state placement of children. It also summarizes the contents of the third volume produced by the study, which consists of policy essays commissioned by national studies within the overall project. (KC)",

Included in this part are descriptions of (1) the court organization, (2) the pertinent statutory provisions in the state code, (3) the relevant cases tried in the state supreme court and the federal courts since 1950, and (4) the correctional placement options for juveniles convicted in adult courts. This information was obtained through a  search of the statutes and case law and through telephone interviews with court and correctional officials. The second part of the profile presents data collected from every county in the state on the frequency of referral of youths to adult courts through each of the mechanisms permitted by state law. In addition, demographic information, offense characteristics, and the judgments and sentences received by these youths are described for the most populous counties and for those counties referring five or more juveniles to adult courts in 1978.

        "description":"Men dominated the teaching positions in five of nine vocational program areas during 1979-80: industrial-arts (96.6 percent of full time positions), agriculture (93.5 percent), technical (92.8 percent), trade and industrial (91.4 percent), and distribution (69.5 percent) according to a survey of 282,292 full time instructional staff analyzed through the Vocational Education Data System (VEDS). Women staff comprised majorities in consumer and homemaking (96.1 percent), occupational home economics (88.8 percent), health (82.7 percent), and office occupations (64 percent). For three of the four types of institutions studied (secondary, postsecondary, vocational technical institutes, and other postsecondary programs) staffs were overwhelmingly male in traditionally male fields and  overwhelmingly female in fields traditionally considered to be for females. Only in higher education were these patterns broken, showing more balanced distribution. Estimates of data on racial/ethnic characteristics indicate that about 11 percent of the full time instructors in vocational education programs were minorities with 8.8 percent black, 1.5 percent Hispanic, 0.8 percent Asian or Pacific Islanders, and 0.3 percent American Indians/Alaskan Natives. Minority instructors were concentrated in occupational home economics, office occupations, industrial arts, and consumer and homemaking programs; few taught in technical and distributive education. Minority groups, however, varied according to program areas and types of institutions. (KC)",

        "description":"Blacks, Hispanics, and women are more likely to be unemployed or underemployed than white males, regardless of economic conditions. This conclusion was drawn from an analysis of data gathered from the March Current Population Survey for the years 1971 through 1980, the Dictionary of Occupational Titles, and state and local unemployment rates supplied by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The data were analyzed to determine whether factors other than discrimination could account for the disparities. These factors included economic expansions and contractions that might disproportionately affect some groups; regional and industrial variations in the economy; and individual factors, such as education, training, and age, that vary among groups. Disparities with employment rates of white  males in the same areas or industries, however, remained fairly constant. Individual factors, such as education, training, and age, were found to play a part in the unemployment and underemployment rates, but only as minority groups tended to be younger and less educated and, therefore, more often unemployed than white males. When white males and minority males had the same education and were in the same age group, however, the minority males still tended to be unemployed or underemployed more often. White females had less unemployment than white males, but were more likely to be employed in lower-paying jobs. The study indicates that a greater effort is needed to end the discrimination that contributes to these statistics and to provide more equal job opportunities for all.  (KC)",

The project recruited 40 senior citizens who were interested in teaching a course at their senior centers and gave them 8 weeks of training in teaching methods, the psychology of aging, and group leadership skills. The course was conducted as a demonstration of how to structure and teach lessons, as well as how to develop other skills needed to organize local programs. The participants were divided into two groups, distinguished by whether or not they had had instructional experience in the past. Those with prior experience tended to have been white collar or  professional workers, while those with no previous experience often came from clerical or service occupations. A survey was developed and administered to the participants before and after the course to determine their perceptions of the value of the work. All participants reacted favorably to the course. The prior-experience group reported most often that the course had given them specific teaching skills, while the nonprior-experience group commented that the course had increased their self-confidence in pedagogy. Followup data showed that 82 percent of the participants had succeeded in getting a position teaching a course within 5 months of the completion of the program. (KC)",

        "description":"An examination was made of what determined women's opportunities to participate in the United States labor force from 1940 to 1978. Using a model drawn from ecological and competition theory, the data examined suggest that the expansion of the economy, the relative proportion of women in the population, female tertiary education, and governmental involvement in the economy operate to increase women's opportunities in the labor force. Unionization and fertility operate to decrease women's opportunities. Empirical results from time-series analysis indicate that most of these factors are significant and have the predicted effects with the exception of the nonsignificant effects of fertility. Also, some labor force differences by female age groups are found. Directions for future  research should include the more direct specification of female and male competition in the labor force and the suitability of this model for cross-national analysis of female labor force participation.

Others believe that the government has not gone far enough. Evidence shows that discrimination against women and members of minority groups has declined, even though it is still common. Cases of reverse discrimination have occurred, but there is no evidence that it is widespread. Ambiguities in data and stories make concern about reverse discrimination understandable. Four basic types of reasons for the intensity of concern over equal employment opportunities and affirmative action exist, those related to: distributive justice, impact on employee income, governmental and business power and legitimacy, and  social perceptions of labor force processes. Many social scientists at universities also believe that affirmative action is having an impact and that reverse discrimination is common. Their personal experiences seem to contradict results of systematic studies of equal employment opportunities and affirmative action, and their social positions in universities are likely to affect their perceptions. Gaps in knowledge about equal employment opportunities and affirmative action have implications for research in social stratification, other areas of sociology, and public policy. (YLB)",

Among those programs and settings in which the processing technique has been used successfully are a community action for rodent control in Troy, New York; an inservice training program for field workers in a nonformal educational program in Indonesia; a project to coordinate nonformal educational activities among seven provinces in Indonesia; and a series of weekly meetings of faculty and graduate students at the Center for International Education in  Amherst, Massachusetts. Experience indicates that the sessions should be held on a regular basis. Furthermore, they should focus on a few simple questions. While the rules for processing sessions should be set by needs of the group, a few simple rules pertaining to the role of the group leader, limits on answer times, and the scope of discussions must be observed.

        "description":"A model program was implemented to provide support and advocacy services to handicapped adults for overcoming barriers in obtaining postsecondary vocational training and employment. The formative evaluation included a description of the project's phases and the activities undertaken to meet project objectives. Major activities were recruitment, assessment, and counseling; career support plan and support services; advocacy/support and referral to community services; occupational employability and skills training; and followup support. The summative evaluation utilized an ex post facto group design that compared project participants to handicapped and nonhandicapped persons. All subjects were postsecondary students enrolled in various daytime programs of vocational training at the  Nassau County Board of Cooperative Educational Services. Project participants and the nonhandicapped group performed with better skills and had lower dropout rates than the handicapped comparison group. Differences between the two handicapped groups were educationally significant on all criteria: instructor's skill ratings, attendance ratings, dropout rate, completion/continuation rate, and employment. The differences between project participants and the nonhandicapped group were not educationally significant on program or employment criteria. (Four successful case studies are also presented. Materials and instruments from the project are appended.) (YLB)",

To explore the relationship of the family power structure (e.g., wife-dominant, equalitarian, or husband-dominant) to physical violence, the reports of in-depth structured interviews with 137 battered women and 137 control women whose marriages were designated no violence, low violence, or high violence, based on the husband's level of violence, were analyzed. Analyses of responses indicated that high violence husbands made nearly all family decisions, had low external resources compared to less violent men, but were  relatively high in resources compared to their wives. High violence husbands, compared to other men, also used all of the social bases of power except reward and informational power. The data suggest the importance of physical violence as a means of controlling other family members. The findings also suggest the usefulness of examining violence in marriage as a form of influence and perspectives that may be addressed in future research on family violence. (PAS)",

Subjects (52 males and 86 females) completed a four-part questionnaire examining the psychological procedure labels, behavior therapy, counseling, and psychotherapy, to learn what meaning people give to certain words or concepts. Subjects viewed: (1) behavior therapy as more physically oriented than counseling or psychotherapy; (2) counseling as more humanistic, helpful, cooperative, good, and realistic, as  well as less medically oriented, than either behavior therapy and psychotherapy; and (3) psychotherapy as more tense, deep and complex than either behavior therapy or counseling. Participants also stated the counseling procedure they preferred for themselves or a family member. Participants strongly preferred the label, \"counseling.\" Findings suggest that practitioners may be wise to describe themselves as practicing counseling rather than psychotherapy as the former seems to have preferential connotations to the general public.

        "description":"Memory has been defined as traces left behind by past information processing. One approach to the study of everyday memory is to isolate reliable differences between individuals in the ways in which they process information when preparing for test events. The Inventory of Learning Processes, consisting of four scales, i.e., Deep Processing, Elaborative Processing, Fact Retention, and Methodical Study, assesses dimensions of learning behavior and conceptual activity characteristic of college students. Deep Processing assesses the extent to which a student critically evaluates, conceptually organizes, and compares and contrasts information being studied. Elaborative Processing is a strategy of applying information to one's own life and personalizing it. Both scales are assumed to  be measures of &quot;depth&quot; and &quot;breadth&quot; of processing that lay down more enduring memory traces. Studies have shown that students who score high on the Deep Processing scale are better at structuring information and have better reading comprehension and that students who score high on Elaborative Processing have greater mental imagery ability, tend to reorganize information in personal ways and thus are better at learning long lists, and are significantly better creative writers. The Deep Processing and Elaborative Processing scales together assess a dimension of &quot;thoughtfulness.&quot; Many students may be able to improve their academic performance by learning to process information deeply and elaboratively.

A sample of 70 clients participated in a study to examine the differences in the duration, satisfaction, and effectiveness resulting from combinations of white and nonwhite counselors and clients. Results indicated that white counselors provided fewer sessions and that nonwhite clients expressed lower levels of overall satisfaction with counseling regardless of counselor race. No differences in counseling effectiveness were observed. White clients seeing white counselors attributed their change more to counseling than to other outside factors. The results suggest that  racial factors may be associated with the duration, satisfaction, and attribution of perceived change in counseling, but not with perceived effectiveness. (Author/JAC)",

A national evaluation of these programs was promoted in the hope of better understanding the viability of diversion as an alternative to traditional practices. The impact of diversion services on youth in four programs was assessed, and there was evidence that the programs did reduce the penetration of youth through the justice system. Programs were less coercive, less controlling and more oriented to meeting clients' needs than justice agencies. Programs as implemented were a good match to original guidelines. However, diversion disposition was no more successful at avoiding stigma, improving social adjustment,  or reducing delinquent behavior than justice processing or release. (JAC)",

It was hypothesized that Hispanics, when compared with Anglos, would place higher positive values on women with children than on women with no children and that religious identification with the Catholic Church would result in higher positive attitudes toward women with children regardless of ethnicity. Anglo Catholic (N=31), Hispanic Catholic (N=26), Anglo Protestant (N=61), and Hispanic Protestant (N=4) female college students completed a semantic differential to measure their attitudes toward number of children in three different narratives about women. An acculturation scale determined the ethnic and religious identification of the  subjects. Analyses of results revealed no significant differences between attitudes towad number of children either as a function of Anglo or Hispanic culture, or Catholic or Protestant religion. These results indicated that within the total population sampled a tendency existed to want fewer children, and to place a higher value on women who have fewer children.

To investigate the relationship between attributions of personal control and other variables in marriage, e.g., measures of satisfaction, decision making, and task performance, and attributions of control over decisions and tasks, and to analyze the association between perceived control and power in marriage, married couples (N=37) completed a marital satisfaction scale and a measure of gender role attitude. Results showed gender differences in variables related to marital satisfaction. For both sexes perceived control over activities was the only variable correlated with marital satisfaction, and it was more highly correlated for women. Regression analyses showed that for  women, perceived control over decisions and frequency of activity performance predicted activity control; for men, perceptions of spouse's control and personal decision control were related to activity control. Women were more concerned about whether they could choose to do tasks and they do them more, but they didn't feel they got power from task performance. Findings suggest that control over activities is important to marital satisfaction and plays a more important role for women than for men, and that a major issue in marriage today is the division of labor.

Psychologists have only recently become involved in researching issues concerning the adoption, implementation, and routinization of innovative programs for such organizations. Much of their research efforts have been guided by a desire to provide a true test of the modified Research Development and Diffusion (RD &amp; D) model of producing organizational change. Much of this research, focusing on the Adoption Phase or the process of persuading organizations to adopt innovative ideas, has identified four major concerns: (1) the expense associated with program  implementation; (2) changes in role or role relationships required by implementation; (3) degree to which organization members believe implementation will proceed smoothly; and (4) amount of support for the innovation from various organizational actors. Results of various studies of the Implementaton Phase and the concept of routinization suggest that the modified RD &amp; D model is feasible as a means of bringing about large-scale organizational change. The findings suggest that future efforts must be longitudinally based, focusing on each phase of the change process. (PAS)",

They think frequently about their own actual or potential behaviors, and create behavioral scenarios (or scripts) in which they are the main character. To investigate the relationship between thinking about a behavior and one's expectancies or intentions to perform that behavior, subjects (N=93) in Experiment 1 were induced to imagine six different behavioral scenarios, and to sketch out the scenario in cartoon form. The instructors asked 30 subjects to imagine and sketch themselves as the main character, 33 subjects to imagine and sketch their best friend, and 30 subjects to imagine and sketch a person they knew and disliked. If intentions are based on the relative availability of appropriate behavioral scripts, then it was hypothesized  that intentions should change in the direction of imagined and drawn cartoon scripts, but only for subjects who drew themselves as the main character. Results suggest that thinking about a course of action--creating a self-referent behavioral scenario or script--can produce intention changes in the direction that is being imagined. Subjects, in essence, created salient behavioral scripts. In Experiment 2, subjects (N=21), repeated Experiment 1 to verify results, and then behavioral intentions were assessed 3 days after the cartoon task to see if initial changes persisted across time. Results of Experiment 2 replicated results of Experiment 1, and the magnitude of the induced changes appeared undiminished after a 3-day period. (PAS)",

In part, the distribution of females and males into social roles in society explains why women are oriented to expressive (social-emotional) goals and men are oriented to instrumental (task-oriented) goals. To account for the expressive and instrumental aspects of gender stereotypes in terms of sex differences in status, it was hypothesized that those who are higher in hierarchies of status and authority are perceived to be less expressive and more instrumental than those who have lower status  positions. It was also hypothesized that the differences people perceive between homemakers and employees parallel the stereotypic differences between men and women. Several experiments, similar in design, were carried out to test these hypotheses. In each experiment subjects read a description of a female or male stimulus person and rated her/him on 18 gender-stereotypic personality attributes. Results of all experiments provided strong support for the social structural analysis of gender stereotypes: the stereotype of male instrumentality and female expressiveness reflected the belief that women and men were differently distributed into homemaker and employee roles. Findings of this research suggest that those sex differences most salient in stereotypes about gender stem from the  differing roles women and men play in daily life. (PAS)",

Results revealed that: (1) students who were most successful in the Phoenix Program came from a regular school placement, rather than from special schools; (2) none of the students had received disciplinary action for drug-related incidents at the time of data collection; and (3) a general pattern of great improvement in behavior, attendance, and grades of students while in the program was followed by some slippage, but, in general, substantial improvement was noted, especially in grade point averages.

Subjects were asked to recall their interactions with incoming freshmen women at the beginning of their sophomore year. Results showed that the sophomore women failed to offer help to the freshmen women. Findings suggest that, separated by only 1 year at the  Academy, the major difference between these two groups was the hard-earned, yet marginal and constantly questioned peer acceptance the sophomore women had won from the dominant male group. Findings also suggest that the &quot;exception that proved the rule&quot; was the all-women athletic teams where freshmen cadets experienced a temporary reprieve from tokenism and competition with mates, and women reported helping other women. The results support the hypothesis that the failure of token women just one step ahead of the newcomer to act as mentors is the result of situational constraints inherent in the role of the double-deviant.

        "description":"Retirement has been the subject of increasing interest in the popular as well as professional literature, but the psychosocial consequences of the transition have received little systematic attention. To study variatons in adaptation to retirement, 80 female educators and educational specialists were interviewed. The majority were rated as predominantly satisfied with their lives, but a substantial minority reported periods of restlessness, boredom, and depression. The dynamics of positive self-concept appeared to best explain a successful adjustment to retirement. Adjustment was not associated with age at retirement, marital status, religious preference, ethnic origin, socioeconomic background, or living alone. Women who were dissatisfied with retirement initially felt negative  or ambivalent about retiring and anxious about filling the gap. The findings support the hypothesis that the woman's concept of herself over a lifetime constitutes the best single predictor of her adjustment to retirement. (JAC)",

To test the effectiveness of specifying three different treatments (a behavioral target program focused on increasing activity level, a cognitive target program focused on modifying and increasing positive self-statements, and a combined program including both targets) for different populations of depressed patients, 104 college women participated in 21 therapy  groups. In general, results suggested a better outcome for subgroups of subjects who had an acute onset of depression. There were no significant differences due to subject characteristics, a factor which emphasizes the generalizability of the program. Subjects high and low on positive activity frequency were equal in outcome within the cognitive target program. Within the behavioral target program, subjects who reported a high frequency of positive activities did better, and in the combined cognitive program subjects who reported a low frequency of positive activities did better. The findings suggest a need for further replication. (JAC)",

In a study of the environments within two automotive supply organizations similar in size and technology but different in formal managerial styles (participative management and modified Scalon Plan vs. traditional unionized organization), employees' attitudes and behaviors were compared. Overall, results indicated that the rank and file employees' perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors were more favorable in the organization with the more democratic formal managerial style than in the more traditional organization, but there was very little difference in the response of the supervisors between the two environments.

To determine if leadship style is related to sex role orientation, rather than to biological sex, to demonstrate that this notion generalizes to groups of different size and sex role composition, and to examine the stability of leadership patterns over time, college students (N=500) completed the Bem Sex Role Inventory. Masculine males (N=12), feminine females (N=12), androgynous males (N=12), and androgynous females (N=12) were selected to form 12 groups consisting of one person each from each sex role category. Each group met 1 hour per week  for 4 weeks to discuss legal cases. Discussions were videotaped and scored using Bales Interation Process Analysis. Results supported the contention that sex role orientation and group leadership behavior were the result of socialization rather than biology. Results also demonstrated that leadership styles were stable over time and attested to the utility of a synthesis of theoretical perspectives on androgyny and leadership as a way to provide a more balanced conception of leadership. These findings may benefit both women and men by helping them to recognize important skills each individual can contribute to group functioning. (PAS)",

To examine similarities and differences among four closely related approaches (brief, problem-focused therapy; structural family therapy; strategic family therapy; and systemic family therapy) and to determine if the therapy models are most closely related in theory, in practice, or considered variations on a common theme, representatives of four institutes where the models were developed completed a 60-item Family Therapy Questionnaire. Results indicated that despite common roots in cybernetics and systems theory, the four strategic systems therapies appeared to share less in concept than technique. The models shared a practical, strategic  orientation to change, but differed in their conceptions of how problems were maintained systemically. In addition, the four approaches were closely enough related to the considered variations of a common clinical, if not theoretical, paradigm. The findings suggest that the systems therapies are growing rapidly, with developments in technique outstripping those in theory and research. (PAS)",

        "description":"Researchers are now attempting to improve techniques for studying stable behavior patterns in family systems over long periods of time, e.g., the marital dyad across several levels of function and dysfunction covering time periods of months to years. One approach to improving this research design is based on the assumptions that longitudinal studies will be improved if the expected time course of the behavior patterns can be forecast in advance, and that computer simulation is one of the best technical approaches available for problems in long-range forecasting. System Dynamics, a computer simulation approach that is designed to deal with behavior patterns of complex systems over extended time periods (even when those patterns involve relatively severe nonlinearities), was used  to develop a model for dyadic interaction. The forecasting of behavior patterns in a marital dyad began from a mathematical model of the dyad, which contained two &quot;individuals,&quot; each represented by a mathematical model of personality function and a linking equation describing how each &quot;individual&quot; was influenced by behavior changes in the other &quot;individual.&quot; Data analyses of the simulation model supported the hypothesis that, assuming the validity of the Freudian model of individual personality function and the accuracy of its translation into a mathematical model, equations exist that link two &quot;individuals&quot; in such a way as to produce equilibrium for both &quot;individuals,&quot; even when neither &quot;individual&quot; model will tend to equilibrium, given the same starting conditions, without being linked  in a dyad. Further investigation of this approach is needed. (HLM)",

First, the teacher \"directs\" an interactive learning process by diagnosing student needs and modifying subsequent learning tasks throughout the analysis of student feedback. When diagnosis and feedback operate correctly, the teacher will identify a number of students who comprise an instructional group, and  will \"divide\" or assign them to work directly with the teacher on a specific instructional skill. Other groups of students will assemble as independently functioning task groups and will select and complete other activities, or \"diversify.\" As the teacher monitors the progress of the instructional learning group and the independent task groups, he or she pays close attention to the availability of a wide range of mastery activities--creative, appealing, and accessible to students as they move from instructional group to independent groups.

Subjects, 66 students enrolled in an introductory psychology course, were required to perform 6 successive retrievals from each of 18 conceptual categories. The six retrievals consisted of two successive blocks of three from either high, medium, or low dominance tasks. Increasing retrieval latencies and increasing number of errors indicated that the build-up of inhibition across position was more immediate for the low-dominance than for the high-dominance items. These results support the position that the number of prior retrievals from the same conceptual category is the primary determiner of the incrementing of retrieval inhibition. Effort-induced slowdown of  retrieval did not occur. These results suggest that two opposing processes occur in category access: a general initial facilitation and a cumulating inhibition. The cumulating inhibition is directly related to the number of prior retrievals, both explicit and implicit. (JL)",

Researchers joined two classes at the junior high and high school levels, and followed the students to their major content area classes--English, math, science, and social studies--for two terms. Conversations with the 60 pupils were tape recorded through 300 lessons. The results highlighted some important areas of confusion as well as some of the complex strategies used by pupils to cope with difficulties. The results indicated &quot;possible worlds&quot; confusion, related to schemata, in which pupils interpret a particular word according to their knowledge of it (i.e., alarm as fire alarm instead of fear). Text materials were frequently too difficult for those  pupils who did not really understand the content area, and pictures and diagrams were often of no help. The data also indicated that strategies used by students would change depending on the difficulty of the text or task, such as scanning a text for several answers to a question hoping that at least some of them will be correct, or looking for plausible key words without trying to understand the text at all. Low progress readers often misread unfamiliar words, but the major difficulty was that they read too slowly to keep up with classmates, and read much less frequently. These results call for further research in the areas of &quot;possible worlds&quot; interpretations that do not fit the text, instructional activities to increase reading &quot;mileage,&quot; and interviewing techniques to evoke and  enhance students' prior knowledge and understanding in content areas.

        "description":"The psychological process of segmenting sentences into meaningful units or &quot;chunks&quot; is believed to be an important aspect of text comprehension processes. The most characteristic type of parsing task elicits perceptions of text structure indirectly by asking individuals to make judgments about pause placement in sentences. In four studies of sentence parsing, individuals were asked to locate boundaries between groups of words on the basis of one of the following cues: words that form meaningful groups, locations where one would pause when reading out loud, and locations where it would be acceptable to pause. A major conclusion from these studies was that any one of these instructions was likely to be confusing to children. Children understood the parsing task best when the  instructions directed their attention to both the sound and the meaning of instrasentence units. Most studies of pausing phenomena as measures of structural units are based on the idea that pausing is at least acceptable at constituent boundaries. Although the units defined by children's pausal judgments seem to agree fairly well with adult intuitions of parsing structure, it is not clear that such units give a description of the optional &quot;chunks&quot; for processing by poor readers. Critical factors in the selection of an optimal unit appear to be whether information is new or old and the number of propositions expressed (which is correlated with the number of words). (HOD)",

        "description":"Two views of the sources of poor reading comprehension are currently distinguishable in the research literature: a decoding sufficiency view and a comprehension skills view. The decoding sufficiency view argues that decoding is the only skill that must be acquired for general language comprehension. The broader, comprehension skills hypothesis argues that a deficiency in any of several basic component skills could thwart reading comprehension mastery. R. M. Golinkoff's major review of studies comparing good and poor comprehenders posited three components of comprehension: decoding, lexical access, and text organization. Research on decoding has yielded some hypotheses relating decoding speed to comprehension, but problems of study design cast some doubt on these conclusions.  Research on lexical access ability indicates that poor comprehenders do not typically lack this ability; however, if cognitive overload during reading is more frequent among poor comprehenders, it is likely that lexical access functioning will deteriorate. Most clearly, text organization research has consistently shown that poor comprehenders are word-by-word readers while good comprehenders employ higher level strategies. (JL)",

        "description":"A study of 103 second, third, and fourth grade students investigated relationships among cognitive styles and reading comprehension. Each subject was individually tested using four different instruments to assess four cognitive styles: (1) field-independence/dependence (ability to locate a simple figure--concept--hidden in a complex field), (2) conceptual tempo (how one responds in situations of response uncertainty), (3) breadth of categorization (identifying maximum and minimum plausible answers to a variable), and (4) attentional style (attending to relevant stimuli while ignoring irrelevant stimuli). The dependent variable in the study was reading comprehension ability, as measured by a test developed by the Educational Testing Service. The results suggest that cognitive  styles, especially field-independence, are in fact related to reading comprehension and that students who are relatively field-dependent, impulsive in responding, and distracted by irrelevant stimuli are most likely to have difficulty with reading comprehension as a result of learning styles. Teachers might employ style measures to help identify these high risk students, and may also try to help students modify styles, or help them use strategies that compensate for style-related difficulties. For example, impulsive students might be rewarded for reading all directions and 11 possible answers before responding to questions, and students with constricted control might be given a quiet area in which to work.

A regression analysis was carried out to examine the effects of age, context, test type, school, and sex on the ability to understand logical connectives. Results showed that the difference in the students' ability to understand the connectives in each of the two contexts was significant, but there was no significant difference by age, sex, or test type. Furthermore, there was no correlation between students' ability to understand connectives and their ability to use connectives in their writing. (HOD)",

Subjects, 36 fourth, fifth, and six grade classes, were taught a set of 15 target words in each of the three instructional conditions for each of 3 weeks. Classes were assessed at the end of each week with three tests designed to measure word knowledge in a manner reflecting each teaching strategy. All classes were also tested on all 45 target words at the end of the fourth week of the study with a comprehensive test that required recognition of a direct general definition. Results indicated that both semantic feature analysis and semantic mapping were more effective than context for general vocabulary acquisition, with  semantic feature analysis groups performing at higher percentage levels on more target words than did either of the other groups on the comprehensive test. Context treatment groups significantly outperformed the other treatment groups on the test that reflected their treatment. These results indicated that the two strategies that rely on categorization of concepts as influenced by students' prior knowledge bases do positively affect vocabulary acquisition. The type of test format utilized to assess word knowledge also influences student performance. (Author/JL)",

Specifically the questions were designed to learn (1) what percentage of students felt the reading materials were of practical value to them, (2) what percentage found the materials of interest, (3) students' reading interests, and (4) students' perceptions of teacher choices of material for them. The results indicated that 71% felt that the materials helped them in other school subjects, but only  half felt the materials helped them outside of school. Forty percent liked the reading materials; 60% did not. Sports was the subject of greatest interest, followed by animals, mystery, comics and humorous stories, and science fiction. Only half felt that teachers would select books to match their reading interests. The results seemed to indicate a lack of communication between students and teachers in the reading material selection process, and suggested a need for teachers and students to discuss the value of all activities in reading class.

The series consisted of eight programs designed to teach skills for content area reading to seventh and eighth grade students. Each program presented skills and techniques that could be used to get meaning and retain information from reading textbooks and other expository materials. The study involved over 1,300 students who were given a pretest and posttest, and over 60 teachers who completed questionnaires or supplied supplementary information. A version of the Solomon Four Group Design was used because this design makes it possible to determine the effects of  testing. The tests were composed of three parts--a reading style inventory, a comprehension test of the TV series elements, and a reading comprehension test. Findings from the evaluation show that (1) students at grade 7 who had used the series reported using techniques that were conducive to effective reading more frequently than did the control group; (2) students at both grade levels learned statistically more about specific skills presented in the program than did the control group; and (3) taking into consideration the pretest scores, students in grade 7 who used the series scored significantly higher on the main idea reading scale. Teachers on the whole reported being satisfied with the series and gave the series and its manual a positive overall rating. (HOD)",

Results of experiment 1 revealed that rhyme priming obtained when the rhyming parts were separated by four but not by seven intervening  words, suggesting that the phonological code for the word was initially accessed and then rapidly destroyed. In experiment 2, where parsing demands required that the prime word be held in working memory, rhyme priming obtained even with seven intervening words. In experiment 3, the same materials used in experiment 1 were presented visually to 28 college students, and no rhyme priming effects obtained.

Concern with the human experience is put forth as the idea that unifies these essays. Smith is seen as calling for the openness of the scientist, so that the narrow conception of photography as object-centered representation championed by the tastemakers will not become its exclusive definition. It is suggested that Smith's articles about other photographers, which  contain no reference to his own work, nevertheless reveal his own theoretical underpinnings. Image making without the use of conventional equipment or subjects is presented as an important element of a broader conception of photography, and some examples of Smith's work in this vein are included in the paper.

Approximately 600 adults were contacted by telephone and questioned about their mass media use, political orientation, and demographic characteristics. Data were analyzed by means of the LISREL procedure, which posits &quot;true&quot; or &quot;latent&quot; variables that are unmeasureable except through their indicators. The findings revealed that the medium of primary reliance did make a difference in  the relationships between use of the media and surveillance gratifications.

The training program consists of an intensive 5-week summer workshop and a subsequent September-through-June followup that assists the new consultants as they schedule, plan, implement, and evaluate their staff development presentations. In 1977, a pilot study of the project's first year revealed a number of concerns, both among the participants and among the project coordinators. They questioned whether the summer session should be less participant centered and more syllabus directed. They wondered whether  more experienced teachers needed the same kind of program as did less-experienced teachers, and they questioned whether all participants became effective consultants by merely attending the summer workshop. These concerns formed the basis for further research conducted during the next 5 years. Results from these studies suggested that teachers did benefit from development programs that focused on their needs and desires; teachers with more experience had more positive attitudes toward staff development than did teachers with fewer years of experience; teachers with internal locus of control had more positive attitudes than did teachers with external locus of control; and instructional techniques, such as role-playing, had little or no effect on teacher perceptions of themselves as  consultants.

Most institutions use the portions of standardized tests that test ability to proofread and edit, but they do not use the optional essay sections that actually require students to write. To assure validity of a particular test requires item analysis by the department considering using it. An objective test of the student's mastery of standard, edited English does not test equally important abilities to choose a topic, evolve a thesis statement, and actually write a unified, coherent essay. Some teachers will not accept objective tests, insisting instead on writing samples. Other educators claim that essay tests lack reliability and  do not correlate with objective test scores and course grades. Work by the Educational Testing Service and College Entrance Examination Board researchers shows how these problems can be overcome. College English departments should conduct score gains studies to give credibility to claims of content validity. Since testing services often do not or cannot give enough information on item analysis, score gains, and correlation in informational booklets, and since individual departments differ from each other, every English department must correlate the composition grades and test scores of its students.

        "description":"Research on the composition process and writing instruction has reiterated that red-pencilling students' literary efforts achieves mostly negative effects. Researchers contend that if teachers ignore the mechanics used (or misused) by beginning writers, if they encourage and stimulate the production of both oral and written language, reward the expression of ideas, and value fluency and creativity, then through reading others' words and generating their own, children will gradually recognize and use spelling rules, punctuation, and proper syntax. Most children arrive in first grade well equipped with the language necessary for composition, but few control transcribing--spelling and mechanical--rules. Two samples of writing exemplify this: one a perfectly spelled and punctuated  two-word title, the other an extended, creative composition with several spelling and punctuation errors. The first indicates a fear of making errors, while the second indicates a willingness to take risks. Clearly, the second exemplifies an attitude that should be encouraged if the student is to become a proficient writer. Educators should be suspicious of first reactions to students' writing--reactions usually in response to error or \"correctness.\" Educators must promote turning classrooms into supportive, safe places in which to learn, to practice, to err, and to take risks, in order to meet the needs of beginning writers.

        "description":"The forebears of writing &quot;in&quot; and &quot;across&quot; the disciplines are such historical figures as Aristotle and Cicero. They believed that rhetoric contained within itself all other disciplines. Renaissance rhetoricians also insisted upon assigning a moral cross-disciplinary dimension to rhetoric while at the same time the intellectual reforms and principles of Peter Ramus were stripping invention and arrangement away from rhetoric, leaving it master only of florid and obfuscated style. Sir Francis Bacon preferred not to have the arts and sciences separated, but would have them nourish and inform one another. He drew upon Aristotle's term &quot;invention&quot; to show how the &quot;across the disciplines&quot; character of rhetoric can teach the arts and sciences how to speak to each other. Thus it is  appropriate to speak of both writing &quot;in&quot; the disciplines and writing &quot;across&quot; the disciplines, for it is neither the practical character of these courses nor their interdisciplinary nature that are their strengths, but only the two taken together, engendering inevitably the ethical, moral, and political questions and imperatives that should be at the core of any education. Three principles should guide current cross-disciplinary writing programs: (1) that writing promotes learning; (2) that writing is a complex developmental process; and (3) that a full universe of discourse must include a broad range of writing functions and audiences.

        "description":"Since 1974, when the Supreme Court concluded in &quot;Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.&quot; that public figures and private figures deserve different treatment under libel law (with private figures needing a lower standard of proof), most lower courts have had to sort out the two categories. From the results in &quot;Gertz&quot; and other cases, three questions have emerged that seem crucial in drawing the public/private line: (1) Is there controversy at all, and is it truly &quot;public&quot; and not just newsworthy? (2) Has the plaintiff voluntarily done something to inject himself or herself into the controversy? and (3) Did the plaintiff enter the controversy in an effort to influence the outcome? In 17 cases since &quot;Gertz,&quot; nearly two-thirds of the corporations have been adjudged private figures, and  two-thirds of these have won favorable decisions. Answering each of the three questions has been difficult for the courts, and the answers given are not entirely consistent. Unlike corporate plaintiffs, business people suing the media since &quot;Gertz&quot; were found to be public figures in 7 out of 13 cases. At the same time, those judged private figures were more successful. Answering the three questions for business people seems even more difficult and messy than for corporate plaintiffs. Still, when taken together, more than half of both business people and corporate plaintiffs have been found to be private figures, a result that may not bode well for the press. To protect themselves, journalists must carefully consider the courts' criteria, but at the same time, they should not allow fear of  libel to stifle their business reporting. (JL)",

To tap the natural energy of the majority of students, the curriculum must be adapted to create an ES classroom. Action-oriented ES English classrooms can be created in a variety of ways: field trips, the acting-out of scenes, or interviews--using the hands as well as the head. It is essential that physical movement be permitted in the classroom. Teachers should also move slowly from the student's experience to new concepts, starting with facts before moving to abstract ideas. Students should be encouraged  to read about real things, relevant to their lives, and to do real things as well. The arts are a natural way to simulate the students' senses, and like the other elements of this approach, can be used in a cross curricular way. Multimedia materials--films, computers, tape recorders--help make the intangible tangible to the student. Group interaction--peer tutoring, group projects, debates--provides the person-to-person contact the extravert needs.

Participating teachers were asked to complete a log of their activities in a target class to provide information on the frequency of writing instruction, topics taught during the class, assignments given, use of primary trait scoring in specific ways such as the formulation of assignments, and the nature of prewriting activities. Writing assignments, scoring guides, and handouts were also collected. In addition, each teacher was observed by project staff in the classroom at least once. Following the  observation, the teacher was interviewed about what had occurred in the class. During the interview, questions about activities reported on the log form were also clarified. Finally, on two occasions, teachers were asked to attend &quot;booster&quot; meetings to discuss their activities, share problems and solutions, and report specific assignments they had created. Their responses reported the following uses for primary trait scoring: clarifying the objectives of the lesson, providing a way to formulate assignments, providing a means to analyze and to respond to students' writing, helping students evaluate and respond to the writing of their peers, providing a means for assessing students' papers, and affecting students' reading ability.

Not all of the assignments presented were originated by the teachers: some were taken or adapted from a textbook; occasionally they came from another source. Tables are included showing the grade level intended for each assignment, classifying assignments by mode (expressive, explanatory, persuasive), and showing the mode of assignment by grade level. Where scoring guides are provided, the purpose is nearly always present in a statement of the primary trait. Several of the assignments offered specify a mix of modes by asking students both to describe or explain  something and to tell how they feel about it. All of the offered assignments involve considerable prewriting activity and the use of some verbal information about strategies to use in achieving the purpose of the writing, though few of the written assignments specify those strategies. A number of the scoring guides included in the paper emphasize organization and form as criteria; sometimes quantity of detail or argument or use of a particular type of language differentiates categories. Nearly all guides presented exhibit some abstract language which admits of subjective judgment on the part of the reader and testifies to the difficulty of formulating criteria in specific terms.

The students were randomly assigned to one of four conditions where they were presented individually with (1) a film story, (2) a silent version of the film, (3) a descriptive audio version of the film's content, or (4) the same story recorded by a storyteller. After viewing or listening, the students were asked to recount the story, to mime incidents from it, to draw inferences about the story content, and to express their opinions of the story. Findings indicated that in their recounting of the story, the students in all groups showed a good grasp of the content. However, media differences were found in the individual events they recalled, with children in the  descriptive audio group giving longer retellings and those in the film group retelling more of the central story content. In the mime task, children who saw the film showed greater sensitivity to the changes of pacing in the story by varying the pacing of their movements. In addition, film group students exercised more freedom in their verbal interpretations of the story, while the storyteller group students remembered and drew upon the provided information when responding to inference questions. The results demonstrated the capacity for a strictly visual medium to provide a comprehensible story to children in a format that also allows for diverse inferences and interpretations of its content.

To begin the unit, one might stimulate interest in the content and style of technical writing of the past by using Robert M. Hutchins' preface to &quot;Great Books of the Western World.&quot; Next, students should scan the table of contents of the &quot;Books,&quot; noting that of the 70 writers included in the 54 volumes, 20 are technical or scientific--among them, Euclid, Ptolemy, Galileo, Hippocrates, and Copernicus. A device for creating interest in current technical writing is the preface to W. Steve Anderson and Don Richard Cox's anthology, &quot;The Technical Reader: Readings in  Technical, Business, and Scientific Communication.&quot; After such introductions, students can begin the study of selected passages. In choosing selections, one might be guided by subject areas, rhetorical type, degree of difficulty, and human interest. In examining selections, one might consider audience, point of view, the concept of objectivity, sentence length, vocabulary, and rhetorical strategies. A number of activities can grow out of a study of past and present selections: students might do technical writing in which they emulate the best of the past and the present; write for differing audiences and with varying degrees of formality; do formatting exercises; and construct simple graphics. To help students gain historical perspective, one might give them undated passages of technical  writing and ask them to speculate on the dates. Finally, the unit can also be the stimulus for research papers. Examples of process, description, classification, partition, analogy, and audience are provided for past and present technical writing.

        "description":"In spite of apparent successes, it remains questionable whether communications reform groups have had significant impact on public policy toward broadcasting and its role in American society. Historically, the progressive movement and the rise of government regulatory apparatus underlie the communications reform movement. But the effectiveness of progressivism was undermined by the inherent contradictions of its own assumptions, and regulatory action has been constrained by the commitment to an essentially private, commercial, network-oriented industry. An examination of the licensing authority of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) reveals both increasing success for reformers in the 1960's and 1970's and strong countervailing trends that are dangerous to the reform  agenda. In a decade-long policy review process, major affected industries seem to be emerging relatively unscathed, with the reform movement losing the most ground on several major issues, including questions concerning cable television and the power of regulatory agencies to regulate. The reform movement needs to see itself more clearly to become effective and to prevent itself from being an instrument of the institutions it is attempting to change. (JL)",

        "description":"The dependency model of mass media effects predicts that dependency on media information increases as the level of societal structural conflict and change increase, resulting in greater mass media influence. However, this model appears to ignore the structural constraints that a nation's political system can have on media even before they deliver a message. Because the model may not fit Mexico's oligarchical power structure well, a study tested several dependency model hypotheses relating the perspectives of population elites in Mexico to the perspective of mass media. Two separate surveys in 1976 and 1979 provided data from which five different groups of subjects were defined: 100 mass media elites, 700 occupational elites, 411 upper SES (socioeconomic status) in 1976, 200 upper  SES in 1979, and 500 Mexico City general public. A common set of items assessing Mexico's shared economic interests with 10 different partners was used in each survey. Analysis of the data indicated that the strongest economic identification was with the Latin American oil exporting countries, particularly for upper SES and occupational elites. Further analysis aimed at revealing how the various groups structure their views suggested that perceptions of Mexico's ties may be characterized by a set of underlying assumptions; still differences in the structure of perceptions did exist. These results suggest that current dependency models need to be modified to reflect other recurring and habitual channels of communication. (Definitions of items used in the study are appended.)

The literature review identifies key variables that influence attitude change in social networks, including those of valuation, strength, apprehension, rate of contact, accumulated information, and the discrepancy between the initial attitudes of two communicators. Including these variables, the final mathematical model ultimately predicts that in most social systems there will be \"pools\" of disparate attitudes that are a result of group influence processes, out-group communication, and the relative rates of  communication in a human communication network. The paper concludes with a discussion of the importance of these findings for organizational communication, mass communication, diffusion, and small group research. An extensive bibliography is also provided. (HOD)",

        "description":"The primary tasks of the ethnographic researcher are to discover, describe, and comparatively analyze different speech communities' ways of speaking. Two general abstractions occurring in ethnographic analyses are normative and cultural. Communicative norms are formulated in analyzing and explaining the &quot;patterned use of speech.&quot; Analysis of cultural communication specifies the &quot;meaningful system of communicative behavior&quot; that is governed by an intersubjective understanding of what is coherent and meaningful. While communicative norms specify the appropriate performance of speech, cultural communication places the performance in a particular interpretive context. Both normative and cultural analyses offer distinct and complementary insights into communication phenomena. The  ethnography of communication as a perspective and method offers a productive way to describe and interpret human communication. An analysis of the film &quot;High School&quot; demonstrates the ethnographic approach to communication. A conversation in the film between a counselor, a student, and the student's mother illustrates a communicative norm (that teachers must be addressed with respect) and the cultural component (adolescent language). Other ethnographic research literature also illustrates these two abstractions. By focusing on communicative norms and ignoring the cultural codes in communication, researchers are missing sources in understanding the patterned use and meaning of human communication. (HTH)",

Twenty-four college communication department administrators responded to questions regarding the availability of such workshops, and 174 public school district superintendents responded to questions regarding the demand for and feasibility of such inservice workshops. The college administrators indicated that only three departments had offered workshops or seminars on communication skills for public school teachers, but that those three workshops had been well attended by both public school teachers and teacher education students. Fifty-six district superintendents reported that no teachers in their school district  had attended workshops on communication skills within the preceding 2 years. While most expressed a willingness to release teachers to attend workshops, they identified several problems with workshops, such as geographical distance, scheduling, and expense. An excellent model for such workshops is that offered by the department of speech at Pennsylvania State University. It is offered with convenient scheduling throughout the Commonwealth. Three courses cover (1) development of communicative behavior in children, (2) use of oral communication in the classroom, and (3) teacher use of interpersonal communication in the classroom. (HTH)",

The first 3 days of coverage of two terrorist events as reported by the &quot;New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Washington Post&quot; were chosen: the 1977 Hanafi Muslim takeover of three buildings in Washington, D.C., and the Black September killings at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Germany. The inital instrument included a limited number of categories/units, which then yielded a second series of categories, including the number of words devoted to (1) the terrorists' requests for publicity, (2) information about the hostages or victims, (3) loss of property or  injuries with such activites, (4) governmental helplessness during the incident, and (5) criticism of media coverage of terrorist activity. In the course of this first phase of the project, the researchers observed that the terrorists were not always assured that their cause would be explained in any detail, or that any sympathetic education of the audience would take place; that the nature of the coverage did not appear even handed or simply informative, but was instead neutral or negative; and that the coverage of a terrorist attack in which lives were lost did not over-sensationalize the situations being reported.

        "description":"A study examined the relationship between changes in a person's mode of responsiveness during an interpersonal communication course and his or her ability to predict the behavior of others. First an instrument to identify flexible-responsive individuals was developed. Over a period of 7 years, 163 subjects, undergraduates in a beginning interpersonal communication course, completed all phases of the project. Analysis of flexible-response scores at the beginning and end of the course indicated that the students did become significantly more flexible-responsive. Although each measure of predictive accuracy was significantly related to one or more of the independent variables, the magnitude of the relationship was low. Still, these results do provide empirical support for a  connection between communication behavior and ability to predict the behavior of others. Theoretical reasons for this connection include (1) the premise that communication is the primary method people use to come to know each other, (2) insights from communication theory that stress appropriate behaviors and interpersonal perception, and (3) the relationship between a person's general sensitivity to people and predictive skill. These results also support the notion that interpersonal communication courses can have measureable outcomes. Finally, the sex of the predictor does not make a difference, but the sex makeup of the dyad does appear to influence forecasting ability. (Tables of results are included.) (JL)",

Reid found the reduction of mental activities to material phenomena by Hobbes and others to be particularly odious and destructive of common sense. Turning to the analysis of human nature, he developed a radical distinction between mental and physical processes and posited the existence of a natural faculty, &quot;common&quot; or &quot;moral&quot; sense, that intuitively perceives truth and falsity. He enumerated sets of first principles governing necessary truths, contingent truths, and moral truths. His six general and five particular first principles of morals apply to three fundamental problems in the ethics of rhetoric: (1) identifying legitimate ends of  discourse, (2) legitimizing techniques of influence, and (3) educating the moral rhetor. Although it is unlikely that knowledge of one rhetorical system contributes to knowledge of another, Reid's philosophy has much of potential interest to us because there is a close parallel between the problems he confronted and some with which rhetorical theorists struggle today.

        "description":"A literature review was conducted to discover what programs, philosophies, and methodologies are recommended on the college level for teaching oral Standard English (SE) to speakers of Vernacular Black English (VBE) and to suggest areas of research needs in oral SE training. Most of the speech communication courses in this area are part of remedial programs, with students being required to take the courses because of low scores on standardized tests. Some educators, however, object to this procedure, claiming it stigmatizes the students involved. The philosophy that VBE is a legitimate linguistic system underlies almost all recommended methodological approaches. Several authors have argued that the teachers' belief in the linguistic validity of VBE is a condition of effective  language training. The importance of student motivation is also stressed. In keeping with the bidialectic approach, contrastive analysis is most often recommended, with drills, mimicry, repetition, and substitution being the standard techniques. Using behavioral objectives and student self-monitoring have also been suggested. Still, a lack of serious research on bidialecticism and the doubts of some linguists indicate that more study of this approach is needed. Surveys of programs and approaches currently being used are also called for. (JL)",

Essentially, the federal government can and should take a strong lead in helping change the public perception that theatre can and should pay its own way. It should take a lead through corrective federal legislation  to provide direct and indirect increased public support to professional theatre, and it should encourage appropriate legislative action by nonfederal centers of government. Also, the interrelationships among the not-for-profit and the for-profit theatres should be encouraged for the benefit of theatre as a whole, while the integrity of the motivation of each section should be recognized.

        "description":"A study examined the grading patterns in basic public speaking and communication courses. It was hypothesized that female students would receive higher grades in basic performance and nonperformance communication courses than would male students. The grades for one academic quarter in two nonperformance communication courses and one public speaking course were examined, for a total of 554 male and 466 female grades. The results indicated that females received higher grades than did males, regardless of the course in which they were enrolled. Women received an average grade between \"B\" and \"B-\" in the three courses while men received an average grade between \"B-\" and \"C+.\" The differences in grades yields a number of observations. The grades appear to be highest in the public  speaking performance course, most sections of which were taught by graduate teaching assistants rather than by fulltime faculty. While earlier studies suggested that women might be more competent communicators than men and thus receive higher grades, this explanation is weakened by these results, unless the explanation is broadened to suggest that women are also better at discriminating between testable and extraneous lecture information. However, the notion of compliance--that women receive higher grades because they are more willing to \"play by the rules\" of a particular course--is strengthened by the study. (HTH)",

Most textbooks focusing on the coaching of contest speaking address the use of evidence from a &quot;qualitative&quot; rather than an &quot;ethical&quot; perspective, although the forensic community has experssed a concern about this issue. The National Forensic Association and the American Forensic Association have established some guidelines on the ethical aspect of evidence usage. Unfortunately, the only section of the  National Forensic Association code to specifically address the use of evidence focuses on the issue of plagiarism, but with little amplification of the term or the many variations of willful distortion that may also be considered unethical for contest speaking. The code of the American Forensic Association focuses on three concerns--fabrication, distortion, and plagiarism--and outlines a penalty for contest violators. Thus it is the obligation of the forensic community as a whole both to establish ethical regulations for contest speakers and to hold contestants accountable for violations. (HTH)",

This paper examines some fundamental factors influencing student suspension in order to establish a basis for the development of policy alternatives. Detailed data, collected by the congressionally mandated &quot;Safe School Study&quot; from a nationwide subsample of 641 schools, were used in the analyses. The data sets obtained from these schools included results of a mail survey of the school principals, a self-administered questionnaire survey of all 23,895 of their teachers, and the onsite self-administered questionnaire survey of 31,373 students randomly selected from these schools. While students'  misbehavior and antisocial attitudes may indeed contribute to an increased likelihood of suspension, findings also show that suspension rates increase if: (1) teachers are seen by students as relatively uninterested in them, (2) teachers believe that students are incapable of solving problems, (3) disciplinary matters are handled largely by administrative rules, (4) the school is not able to provide consistent and fair governance, (5) there is a relatively high degree of academic bias among school personnel, and (6) there is a relatively high degree of racial bias present at the school.

This report draft reviews the literature concerning women managers: their personal characteristics, varied role combinations, role models, motivations, and supporting influences. The survey instrument design and the methodology for selecting the participants (a 64 percent response rate was received for 172 mailed questionnaires) are explained. The data are not analyzed beyond responses to 71 questions shown in numbers or percentages. Responses to a self-rating quiz on personality traits are illustrated by  graphs. In the final section a completed survey presents a profile of the average respondent. The report ends with a bibliography; information on the sponsor of the research, CEMREL, Inc., and the Training Program for Minorities and Women (TPMW); copies of the cover and reminder letters sent to survey participants; and a reprint of the survey instrument.

        "description":"The threatened loss of more than $4.5 billion in federal funds over the next 2 years leaves New York State with three options: to increase state taxes drastically, an action that could jeopardize the state's recent emergence from severe economic crisis; to curtail state services significantly; or to devise a creative new strategy including an expanded reliance on volunteers. This report by a state senate-appointed task force provides background information on the current economic conditions in the state and the potential effects of the federal cutbacks, and describes the possibilities inherent in volunteerism. The current status of volunteerism, the roles played by individuals and corporations in the voluntary sector, and the potential for expanding the use of volunteers are  detailed. A survey of local voluntary agencies to obtain suggestions and proposals for actions to encourage increased volunteerism is described, as is a survey of the volunteer offices established by other states' governments. Five proposals specifically recommended by the task force involve creating a state office of voluntary citizen participation, providing income tax deductions for volunteer service and mileage, extending deductions for charitable contributions, publicizing existing benefits for volunteers, and further promoting of volunteerism.

        "description":"Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act is similar to the Disadvantaged Schools Program of Australia in some ways and distinctively different in others. This comparison of the two programs by an Australian educator points out the similarities and differences in program purpose, regulation, funding targets, and local control. Both programs provide federal funds to schools operated and funded primarily at the state level, and both are aimed at improving schooling in poorer communities. The extent of financial inequality among American districts, however, prevents the American program from bringing low income districts up to the national average, whereas the Australian program allows schools with above average needs to receive funding above the generally equal level  already provided. The American program has more stringent regulations, is targeted at individual low-achieving students in low income districts, and establishes specific standards for achievement, particularly in basic skills areas. The Australian program is targeted at schools and permits local authorities to determine the most effective use of resources. The author suggests that the programs serve different social functions and that American conditions have so changed that a program like Australia's might now prove more appropriate. (PGD)",

        "description":"Three perspectives from which to study the implementation of educational innovation are explored in this document. Using the comparative policy perspective, the author compares and analyzes federal programs supporting educational change in the United States and Australia. Noting that Australia is more homogeneous, centrally organized, and oriented toward society seen collectively than is the United States, the author discusses how the increasing role of the federal government, the various forms of federal involvement, the relationships between different levels of government, the governmental policies on parochial and private education, and the &quot;doctrine of transferability&quot; affect educational change in both nations. From an organizational perspective, the author focuses on the  implementation of innovations in schools as organizations, citing the results of a survey of the innovative projects funded by the Australian Schools Commission in Western Australia that had been underway for at least 2 years by 1976. This research explored four categories of characteristics possibly affecting the implementation of innovations: those of the innovation itself, the implementation strategies employed, the organizational settings, and the personnel involved. Finally, the author discusses how personal involvement in a series of case studies helped develop an interactionist perspective on the less objective characteristics of educational change. (PGD)",

Although education is not a right granted by the Constitution, the Court has often recognized the importance of education, both to the individual and to the society. It seems that in terms of constitutional protections the Court has now accorded a sort of favored legal status to education although the exact nature of this status is unclear. The basic education necessary for functional literacy may be the extent of the protected interest. Although how this level of education is to be defined or measured is uncertain, what does seem clear is that the Constitution protects  the individual against inequitable and unfair state action. Whatever educational opportunities the state does choose to provide, neither a discrete class nor a single individual may be unfairly excluded from access to those opportunities. Although the Fourteenth Amendment does not extend to every person the guarantee of success, the concepts of due process and equal protection do shield each person from state-imposed failure.

        "description":"The potential benefits of microcomputer adoption in education occur because of the low cost, ease of use, and versatility of microcomputers. The microcomputer has simplified the development of both computer-assisted and computer-managed instruction. Teaching computing is easier because the microcomputer becomes the object of instruction as well as the medium of instruction. Finally, since the microcomputer is a general purpose computing machine, it can be used for many functions. The effect of microcomputer implementation can occur along a continuum of supplementing, complementing, and supplanting instruction. Interaction with a microcomputer can affect students by developing confidence, knowledge, and a life skill. Use of the microcomputer will result in saving teachers' time  and helping students advance from memorization to higher level skills. Issues and problems that may determine whether the potential of using microcomputers is ever realized include teacher adoption and the development of teacher skills, the availability of software, and the compatibility among hardware. A significant problem will be ensuring equity so that the disadvantaged have equal access to computer literacy. (Author/MLF)",

A synthesis of findings from this research indicates that differences among schools do have an effect on student achievement.

Thirteen variables are identified as contributing to the development of a school culture conducive to academic achievement. Drawing on recent literature, the authors suggest federal and state policies that would be likely to facilitate the development of effective schools. Key recommendations include policies that promote building-specific, whole-school improvement efforts and that rely on outcomes as the preferable means of  monitoring and evaluating school improvement efforts.

This document highlights many of the state-level activities by presenting the results of a 50-state survey conducted in May and June 1982. Two tables provide a brief overview, followed by short sections that describe the activities in each state. These diverse strategies share three general characteristics: (1) the school is the unit of educational improvement; (2) clear academic goals are focused on the basic skills, and the instructional program is directly related to those goals; and (3) student-level data are used for individual feedback to students and for modification of the instructional program. Frequently cited  strategies include improving the capabilities of teachers and administrators; dissemination/adoption assistance; incorporation of the effective teaching and effective schools research into the substance of a state's improvement efforts; and provision of technical assistance from state education departments, usually through regional or intermediate service units.

A summary of the findings shows that differences between urban and other schools are usually statistically insignificant when other school and student characteristics are controlled. Catholic schools have the best behaved student bodies, followed by other private schools and public schools. Schools with better behavior records have a stable faculty, assign more homework, discipline misbehaving students, and enforce more rules. The analysis chapters interpret the data by (1) presenting the perceptions of students and the evaluations of school administrators of the problems caused by student  misbehavior; (2) describing the association between misbehavior and student characteristics and exploring the complex relationships among misbehavior, course grades, hours spent on homework, and educational expectations; (3) showing the way in which levels of misbehavior vary with characteristics of schools; (4) comparing administrators' reports about rule enforcement with students' perceptions and analyzing the association between levels of discipline in the school and rates of misbehavior.

        "description":"The deregulation critique of the federal role in education asserts that education can be as productive with less federal intervention. This critique can be broken down into three groupings of separate criticisms. The first group denies the value or feasibility of federal goals. These criticisms insist either that federal goals are not worthwhile or not properly federal or that federal programs are unnecessary or ineffective. The second group of criticisms addresses the basic forms of federal intervention and implies the need for different means or policy instruments. Reduction not of aid but of the strings attached, through block grants, is one implication of such criticism, as is the suggestion that the federal role emphasize assistance in reaching goals rather than the  monitoring of legal compliance. Finally, the third group of criticisms seeks to reduce &quot;legalisms&quot; in the techniques of federal intervention. However, not all legalisms are wasteful and some are as unrestrictive as possible, so wholesale &quot;delegalization&quot; may reduce programs' effectiveness. To benefit from deregulation without reducing effectiveness, deregulation at the levels of goals, forms, and techniques must be selective, reordering some federal priorities, maintaining conditional grants, and specifying contexts for the reduction of legalisms.

        "description":"Beginning with the background to the 1980 passage of Massachusetts' Proposition 2 1/2, the authors analyze the first-year effects of the property tax limitation measure. Section 1 describes Massachusetts' previous high dependence on property taxes and outlines the provisions of Proposition 2 1/2. Section 2's analysis indicates that the state's property taxes are so high because local governments cannot use other taxes. Earlier attempts to lower taxes are also covered. Local governments' aggregate statewide revenue losses because of the measure are estimated in section 3, which also looks at the response of increased aid from state government. Section 4 analyzes the impact of Proposition 2 1/2 in terms of communities' population size and the amount of their revenue loss. It finds  the greatest revenue losses were in large communities and in communities with moderately high income, property, and tax levels, but that small towns benefited most from the state aid increase. Data in section 5 indicate that Proposition 2 1/2 affected school spending more than other local spending and increased somewhat the disparities across communities in education service levels. The final section summarizes the paper and suggests ways of ameliorating some of the measure's long-run effects. (Author/RW)",

        "description":"Data from the last several decades indicate that declining public confidence in education may be closely related to declining confidence in the authority and legitimacy of the state. Annual survey data from Gallup and others and data on declining public approval of school bond issues show the drop in public confidence in education in the 1960s and 1970s. At the same time public confidence in the state also declined, as evidenced by 1957-1977 annual survey data showing long term declines in &quot;trusting&quot; and long term increases in &quot;cynical&quot; attitudes toward government. Given the centrality of education in state activities, it is likely that declining public confidence in education reflects the wider decline in confidence in public authority. At the same time, declining confidence in  education may contribute to the declining confidence in the state. Since attitudes toward education are probably more related to this general decline in confidence than to purely educational factors, actions to improve education will probably change education's public standing very little. Further research is needed, however, on the modern state's legitimacy and on the state's use of its educational activities to compensate for legitimacy lost elsewhere. (Author/RW)",

An introductory section reviews the legislative, executive, and judicial branches' constitutional roles in education. Part 2 narrates legislative and judicial developments involving students with limited English proficiency (LEP) from 1964 to 1980, highlighting the roles of Congress, the Education Department (ED) and its predecessors, the courts, the Lau v. Nichols decision (1974), and the &quot;Lau remedies&quot; governing schools' services to LEP students from 1975 to  1980. Part 3 describes ED's proposed regulation, published in 1980, and its major features. Reactions to the proposed regulation are reported in part 4, including ED's analysis of regulatory impacts, the report of the President's regulation analysis group, Congress's veto threat, and the regulation's withdrawal. Part 5 discusses factors affecting the response to the regulation, including multicultural problems, teacher employment, teaching methods, states' rights, and media interpretations. Further factors, involving national political changes, problems in the regulation and ED, and civil rights issues, are reviewed in the final section. (RW)",

According to the author, educational paperwork has four purposes: as a substitute for onsite inspection, as a &quot;pseudo-contract&quot; to encourage compliance, as a due process and participation mechanism, and as a consciousness-raising device. Educational paperwork may be burdensome or excessive, he says, when, like much regulatory paperwork, it imposes standardization on highly varied problems, when demands for accountability are extended to inappropriate situations, or when documentation is used to attempt to forestall deception. Six paperwork mitigation procedures are suggested, including (1) central oversight and clearance of  data collection, within the agency seeking data; (2) redistribution of paperwork to specialized personnel; (3) reduction of excessive standards of accuracy or comprehensiveness; (4) filtering of &quot;junk&quot; memos, notices, and other paperwork; (5) better conceptualization of the usefulness of the data; and (6) substitution of more efficient means of carrying out paperwork's &quot;ritual&quot; functions (such as the wielding of power).

This paper explores the problems presented in educational reform class actions where plaintiffs disagree over the remedial objectives of the suit. Relying on reported decisions, interviews, and case histories, the paper first examines the conflicts that have surfaced within plaintiff classes, such as disputes over busing, mainstreaming, and deinstitutionalization. Discussion then focuses on the inadequacies of the existing procedural mechanisms for coping with such conflicts. Of particular concern are information and incentive structures that prevent courts, counsel,  and litigants from addressing or accommodating the full range of class interests. The paper concludes by distinguishing problems that may be susceptible to procedural reform from those that are endemic to any pluralist or majority decision-making process. (Author/MLF)",

The essay departs from two traditional approaches to educational law: the study of landmark cases, and textbooks that delimit legally approved practice. Instead the changing dialectic between statutory and court-decided law is analyzed, stressing how Americans used the legal system in different periods to accomplish different purposes. Then the essay explores how school promoters and educational professionals used legislation to establish and standardize schools, how interest groups employed law to assert normative dominance for their own values, and how people used the courts to challenge established practices or to resolve conflicts. Quantitative pilot studies are used to describe and  explain changing patterns of litigation. Finally, an appraisal is made of recent attempts to use legislation and court action to promote social justice for neglected groups. (Author/MLF)",

The paper attempts to clarify these related issues of fact and interpretation by first describing the relative levels and direction of change in the employment of Hispanic teachers; second, describing the specific contribution of bilingualism to increased employment of Hispanic teachers; and finally, interpreting these changes in light of the social reform and social control theses. The social reform thesis argues that existing political institutions are capable of enforcing structural social reform, whereas the social control perspective states that schools  cannot be expected to become significantly more equal than the larger society. The findings show that the employment of Hispanic teachers has not kept pace with the increase in Hispanic pupils and that the employment patterns increased the presence of Hispanic educators in Hispanic segregated schools and communities but not in Anglo segregated schools. Policy implications are that only a concerted planning effort directed at the state level and supported with significant increases in state and federal funding will reverse this trend. (Author/MLF)",

As a result, the environmental context within which a school district operates is exceedingly complex. This case study describes the complexity of the overall system of reporting that has evolved from a school district's participation in some of these programs. Environmental complexity is shown to produce increased organizational complexity within a school district as well as in its external organizational linkages. A distinct cleavage between fiscal and programmatic accounting results. While fiscal accounting at the school district is coordinated, reporting for programs is not. It is suggested that environmental complexity  inhibits efforts to integrate and coordinate educational programs at the school district level. (Author)",

Based on interviews with California officials involved in educational policy and governance, it argues that strategies for regulating education are limited by the commitment of officials and their publics to a language of individual benefits and individual rights as the central goods public policy should realize. The individualist imagery indirectly leads regulators to stress compliance with mandatory goods defined as rights, over encouragement of aggregate-level educational outcomes. The paper concludes by examining how some California educational administrators utilize ideals of individual initiative and local control to legitimate a broader state role in education. (Author)",

In the second section the authors review 26 studies on state grants' effects on educational spending by states and local governments  in general, by cities and municipal areas, and by school districts. The following section examines studies on federal aid, including six papers on pre-1966 data and seven on post-1966 data. Six studies are also reviewed on the effects of federal revenue-sharing and unrestricted lump-sum grants on state and local educational spending. Among the findings mentioned in the closing synthesis section are that the magnitude of intergovernmental grants' impact is uncertain and that the impact varies for different types of local governments.

Researchers tested three propositions about congressional action on territorial versus functional matters in education. The three propositions are that Congress (1) is more explicit on territorial than on functional issues, (2) decides territorial issues through consensus, and (3) is less likely to divide on partisan or ideological lines over territorial issues. Data were derived from analysis of 372 amendments in eight areas of educational legislation from 1960 to 1979. Review of the legislation finds that Congress drafts educational bills with greater precision when territorial interests are involved. This  confirms the first proposition. The clarity of political consequences in territorial issues may explain Congress' greater precision. Findings that amendments on territorial issues are less likely to pass, have roll-call votes, be decided by close votes, or, once passed, be changed later, confirm the second proposition. The third proposition is confirmed by findings that territorial issues engender fewer partisan votes and fewer North-South, ideological splits among Democrats. Among the researchers' conclusions is that new federalism policies may involve territorial as well as functional considerations. (Author/RW)",

This section describes the evolution of Commonwealth funding arrangements, outlines the structure of current Commonwealth aid programs and policies, and assesses the possible implications of the Australian experience in financing private education for the United States. Such implications  include the recommendation that an aid program should not benefit only private schools but should be part of a package benefiting public schools also.

It looks at the factors accounting for varying rates of private school attendance and estimates the responsiveness of such attendance to government support. It studies the variation in private school attendance rates at three levels: across states, across districts in California, and across census tracts within the San Francisco Bay Area. At each level, the authors analyze which economic, social, religious, and ethnic characteristics are significantly related to private school choice. Findings indicate that the concentration of Catholic families is positively associated with parochial school attendance. Family income is, in general, a significant factor in explaining nonparochial school  enrollments. Parochial school attendance rates are less responsive to income changes than are nonparochial rates. Estimates of combined parochial and nonparochial income elasticity range between .54 and .95. Thus public policies to increase average family income through major tax cuts, a fixed limit tuition tax credit, or educational vouchers would increase private nonparochial enrollments by an estimated 0.54 to 0.95 percent for every 1 percent increase in average family income. Finally, private school attendance rates, particularly parochial school rates, are positively associated with higher proportions of minority students in the public school. (Author/JM)",

The discussion includes a look at the positive effects of homogeneity in schools, maintaining that achievement is higher in private schools, where students and parents share common attitudes toward discipline and education. Also looked at are possible changes in enrollment patterns resulting from tuition tax credits. It is asserted that very few changes would result in rural or suburban areas where people are satisfied with their schools, but that strongest effects would be felt in cities. The possible supply and demand response of education and education consumers is examined. The author concludes that maintaining independence from externally imposed rules  would be crucial to preserve the present advantages of private schools. The paper concludes with an examination of divisiveness in American society and whether the concept of a \"common schooling\" can compete with the concept of \"free association.\" The author recognizes the value of a common schooling but believes that, in a country as diverse as ours, it may not be truly possible. He concludes that an opportunity for some to withdraw to a more homogeneous and effective environment can be provided without destroying our democracy or multiethnic society. (Author/JM)",

It begins with an examination of two social purposes of education: political socialization (or the acquisition of a common language, knowledge of one's government, knowledge of the role of the citizen, and tolerance for varying points of view) and reduction of stratification (or promotion of equality). Next, the possible changes resulting from greater public aid to private school are suggested, based on the current situation of public and private schools, and on the incentives within various proposals for increased public support. Finally, the impact of these possible changes on the goals of education in a democratic society are assessed, with regard to political  socialization, social stratification, and political and financial support for public schools.

The purpose is to explain the contradictory conclusions offered by two recent national studies on public and private schooling. The analysis examines differences between public and private school students in mathematics and reading achievement along racial and social class lines and for students in different programs of study. The results show that there are no public/private differences for wealthier whites, those who are the main clientele of the private schools, and for students in academic tracks. However, for minority and disadvantaged students and for students in the general track, there are small but statistically significant differences, some of which  are due to differential selection. Policy decisions should not be based on the assumption that private schools produce better achievement outcomes than public schools. (Author)",

        "description":"As interest in tuition tax credits has increased, one of the central issues has become the likely loss (or cost) that would result from adopting such a plan. In this paper the author first analyzes the likely independent effects of changes in the four major characteristics of tax credits (scope of eligibility, maximum amount, proportion of costs covered, and refundability) on federal revenue loss, assuming no change in either enrollments or tuitions. First, each characteristic would affect the amounts of credits that families would receive and thus would affect overall federal revenues. Second, by altering the price of education to students, tuition tax credits could affect the behavior of both families and schools. The last section of the paper examines how characteristics of  tuition tax credits, both independently and interacting with each other, would affect enrollment patterns and tuition costs and consequently federal revenues. A table summarizes how the characteristics of tax credits would affect who benefits, by how much, and what the result is in foregone tax revenues. (Author/MLF)",

Although historically the common schools were couched in the rhetoric of a common educational experience, democratic localism tended to undermine the commonality through a large number of antidemocratic practices. However, recent decades have witnessed successful attacks on many of these practices, leading to greater equity and homogeneity of the publc schools. This success in overturning some of the aspects of schools that undermine democracy and in creating greater uniformity in education has stimulated new searches for greater choice and influence in education. There are numerous public policy options that would increase parental and student choice within the common  educational experience required to meet the social goals of schooling in a democratic society. Finally, there are intrinsic obstacles to using such private choice mechanisms as tuition tax credits and educational vouchers for addressing simultaneously both the social purposes of schooling and private educational choice.

After an introduction, chapters 2 and 3 present findings about the sorting practices in seven California school districts. It was found that most schools do not have mechanisms for informing people about school sorting. Examples of materials schools use to inform parents of other matters mandated by school law are contained in chapter 3. Chapter 4 provides a theoretical basis for school disclosure by investigating information disclosure in general. Chapter 5 lists possible virtues of disclosure, including increased parent &quot;take-up&quot; of the choices open to them,  prevention of unfair practices, and greater public satisfaction with education. Chapter 6 investigates possible negative effects of school disclosure, including increased costs, increased work for personnel, professional demoralization, and parent confusion from information overload. Chapter 7 presents a policy analysis of school sorting disclosure. Chapter 8 examines the possibility of a due process right to school sorting disclosure. In chapter 9, a statutory analysis of school sorting and disclosure is undertaken. Conclusions and recommendations presented in chapter 10 include the recommendation that social experiments in school sorting disclosure be undertaken on the state level. (Author/JM)",

Concerning the first issue, the document discusses the background of P.L. 94-142 and its first 5 years, concluding that, although accomplishments are impressive, there are still difficulties in implementing the reform. It is suggested that the law has meant improvement in substandard districts but has sometimes had depressing effects in progressive districts. Several brief articles on education of the handicapped then follow, focusing on the issues confronting policy makers in the eighties, the fairness of &quot;fair hearings,&quot; the costs of equity, problems with and prospects for implementation of the mandated reform, and the  history of special education. Concerning the second issue, tuition tax credits, the document briefly discusses whether they will be a federal priority for the eighties. The author outlines how tuition tax credits work, recent legislative activity, issues and implications, their costs, and their effects on the costs of public schooling. He asks if tuition tax credits will benefit one income group more than another, will be equitable among ethnic groups, and will be legal and beneficial to the public. (Author/JM)",

The models, the assignment model and the transportation model, are termed evaluation models under a definition of evaluation that delineates its function as that of serving decision-making. The paper offers step-by-step procedures for the use of both models. The models are applicable to assignment problems where there is a variable to be optimized, such as teacher satisfaction. In the example used to demonstrate the assignment mode, students are assigned to teachers in a way that matches them up with the students they request as much as possible. The transportation model is like the assignment model but with  added constraints. The example of the transportation model given assigns teachers to sections and courses when a certain number of sections must be taught and a certain number of class periods are available. The author concludes that the advantages of these models are that they give a better solution than can be obtained by inspection and they take teachers' wishes into account regarding assignment. Computer use of the models is mentioned. (Author/JM)",

It is estimated that SEA evaluation activities in the U.S. today cost about $32 million and that the use of management consulting offers potential savings of about $2.9 million. The study compares management consulting, technical consulting, evaluation, and research activities and explains how each is different. Although management consulting and evaluation activities may overlap, one distinct difference is that management consulting is client centered regarding decision-making whereas evaluation activities emphasize a critical record of program activities or  outcomes. The study concludes with a number of recommendations for further research, including a refinement and confirmation of the figures presented here, and studies to show how actual savings might be achieved in practice.

        "description":"A review of 31 research documents found 26 of them relevant to the topic of student discipline and motivation. Variables studied in the 26 documents include time-on-task, achievement, disruptions, student attitudes and self-concept, absenteeism, disciplinary referral, detention, suspension, and expulsion. Among the review's findings are that effective classroom management involves a high degree of structure, clear and consistently enforced rules, and teacher monitoring and feedback; that behavioral and motivational improvement secured through material rewards is not as permanent as that achieved by social means; that student academic success will improve motivation and discipline; and that effective punishment should be commensurate with the offense and accompanied by support and  assistance. Eight recommendations are made, including inservice and preservice training of school personnel in effective practices, use of formal and informal social reinforcements, and instruction of students in appropriate behavior. Attached to the review are a table profiling 12 effective programs and their educational levels, major goals and features, evidence of effectiveness, and sources of further information; listings of the supportive, nonsupportive, and inconclusive research documents on five hypotheses; and 31 &quot;item reports&quot; giving data on each document reviewed and its relevance, quality, findings, and conclusions.

Assistance group members can include principal or teacher advisors, curriculum consultants, group process facilitators, dissemination or staff development specialists, parent trainers or organizers, and child advocates. The organizations studied were AFRAM Associates, Center for New Schools, Creative Teaching Workshop, Institute for the Development of Educational Activities (/I/D/E/A/), Rural Education Program, and United Bronx Parents. The manual's introduction describes the arrangement and use of the document, while the first section discusses general patterns that occur in all aspects of building effective assistance groups, such  as time management, firmness or flexibility in pursuing goals, and awareness of how human systems work. Each of the next seven sections covers an area of assistance group activity (that is, a \"puzzle\"), discussing from 6 to 22 critical tasks (or \"puzzle pieces\") in assistance activities and providing exercises for rating oneself on the tasks and for finding ways to improve task performance. The seven activities include forming the assistance group, leading and managing it, refining school improvement strategies, developing the advisor's role, building client relationships, providing assistance, and raising funds.

        "description":"Using the ERIC system, a library search of textbooks, publications from school administrator associations, and the recommendations of educators and researchers, the authors survey the literature from 1970 through 1981 on the principalship, especially on educational leadership and administrative practices. They identify two types of literature--that by academics and that by principals--and compare the themes and assumptions found in the two sets. Academics' textbooks and writings, they find, tend to be theoretical, analytic, rational, impersonal, judgmental about principals and schools, prescriptive, and laden with an emphasis on principals' responsibilities. Principals' writings, however, use concrete experiences and stories; see schools as nonrational, human, ambiguous, and  diverse institutions; and avoid prescribing solutions. Further, say the authors, academics assume that their textbooks will be read, will be useful, and will make their readers more effective, while principals assume that, since little works well, they will share what works and it may help others. From their review the authors derive three suggestions for improving literature on the principalship: encouraging principals to write more, building practitioner-academic coalitions, and circulating better texts more widely. An appendix traces changes in the principalship literature during the period 1970-1981. (RW)",

        "description":"Based on a review of the literature, the author summarizes and evaluates research on the role of principals in effective schools and suggests additional factors needing study. Her review identifies nine features of effective principals and schools, involving commitment to academic goals, academic expectations, school climates that facilitate learning, time utilization, and principals' instructional leadership, personality traits, interpersonal style, organizational potency, and goal monitoring and evaluation activities. Six assumptions in the literature are discussed by the author, including the assumptions that principals' observed behaviors are causally related to observed outcomes and that schools are tightly coupled systems. From this discussion she proposes a new model that  adds the variables of social context, principal characteristics, and inschool mediating processes to the existing variables of principals' behaviors and educational outcomes. She reviews further literature to suggest specific social contexts (such as federal, state, teacher union, district, and community pressures) and mediating processes (including schools' demographic, institutional, interpersonal, and labor relations characteristics) that should be accounted for in research on effective principals. Finally, the author discusses the usual criteria used for school effectiveness--test scores--and suggests adding other criteria, such as school attendance rates. Two appendices reorder the bibliography by topic and propose an agenda for future research on principal effectiveness.  (RW)",

The author first discusses the different images of the principal that guide research and the various research methods used. After reviewing early principalship studies of the 1950's and 1960's, he examines the variables studied and not studied in the areas of principal characteristics, such as demographic and personality traits; principals' problems, including time use and relations with people and groups; and principals' perspectives or point of view,  involving the problem- and management-oriented, face-to-face nature of the job. Ten neglected avenues for principalship research are identified, including school characteristics, private schools, managerial roles, external school environments, and job socialization. The paper's last sections suggest future research directions and discuss the literature's implications for principal training and selection.

He first summarizes findings from three approaches: the traits approach, emphasizing managerial motivation and skills; the power/influence approach, examining power accumulation and exercise; and the behavior approach, focusing on managerial activities and 22 behavior categories. Situational theories of leadership, according to the author, relate the three approaches to one another and to aspects of the leadership situation. Nine situational theories are reviewed, including Fiedler's contingency model, Hersey and Blanchard's maturity and task/relationship  behavior theory, House's path-goal and charismatic leadership theories, Yukl's multiple linkage model, Kerr and Jermier's substitutes-for-leadership theory, Osborn and Hunt's adaptive-reactive model, Stewart's role requirements and constraints ideas, and Vroom and Yetten's normative model of participation. The author discusses the implications of the trait, power, and behavior approaches, and of some of the situational theories (especially Kerr and Jermier's, Osborn and Hunt's, Stewart's, House's path-goal, and Yukl's), for principals themselves as well as for research on principals and principal training and selection.

The groups were compared with respect to referral rate, cognitive functioning, achievement level, social behavior, sex differences, and identification as learning disabled. The number of students referred through weekly measurement was similar to those referred by teachers. In addition, the results indicated that academic achievement is almost  the sole criterion used in teacher referral, although teacher-referred students appeared to be more likely to be rated as behavior problems.

However, few differences were found in students' opportunities to learn through active academic responding: less severely learning disabled students engaged in silent  reading for greater amounts of time than more severely learning disabled students, but they also spent more time in inappropriate student responses. Academic responding time was low for all students, averaging less than 45 minutes per day, and variability among students was large, even within one service delivery level.

        "description":"Surveys of 147 special education teachers and observations of 20 practicing teachers and 20 cooperating teachers were used to (1) determine which evaluation procedures are used most often by special education teachers in their evaluation of student progress, and (2) assess the adequacy of those procedures. Survey respondents indicated that they assess progress on individualized education program (IEP) objectives quarterly, that they rely on informal observation for assessing students' mastery of objectives, and that they are confident in their assessments of student performance. Observations of teachers during instruction corroborated these survey findings; teachers actually relied on and were confident in their informal observations of student performance on lesson objectives.  Nevertheless, the observed teachers were highly inaccurate in their assessments of student mastery of lesson objectives and in their estimates of performance on lesson objectives. Implications for monitoring student progress are discussed. (Author/DB)",

Fifty-four fifth grade boys and girls, from seven classrooms that were organized into two units, were observed over a 10-week period during both informal and formal school periods. The results indicated that both sex and setting contributed to the strength of the relationship between student behavior and both measures of social functioning. Peer approaches were related consistently to social status in one setting for both boys and girls, but only for girls in the other setting. While problem behaviors related to teacher ratings of girls in one setting, aggression was the predictor  of teacher ratings of boys in the same setting. The implications of the results for monitoring a student's social growth within classrooms are discussed. (Author)",

This research and development project is summarized by outlining the goal and rationale of the research, presenting the overall research plan, and providing a chronological description of the research and development process and results, and the current status of the research. The research has proceeded in three stages: (1) determination of what measures of student performance are appropriate in a formative evaluation system; (2) examination of the practicality and efficiency of the monitoring system for teachers; and (3) determination of the effects of formative  evaluation on student achievement. Results have indicated that generic measures useful in indexing proficiency in reading, spelling, and written expression are available and that teachers who have used the measures and the monitoring system are pleased with it and do not feel unduly burdened by the time commitment. Preliminary evidence concerned with the effect of the monitoring system on student academic progress is positive. (Author/DB)",

Results revealed the predictive power of various professionals and noted, among other findings, that assessment results provided by the educational diagnostician and the school psychologist do not provide predictive power in readng and mathematics. Among recommendations made were that  students should be assessed at least in those areas for which they have been referred; and that present level statements, short-term objectives, and annual goals must be related to one another in some coherent fashion within instructional areas.

The meta-analysis approach used for the project required locating all studies or a representative sample of all studies on a given topic, converting the results of each study to a common metric, coding the various characteristics of studies that might have affected the results,  and using relational and descriptive statistical techniques to summarize study outcomes and examine the covariation of study characteristics with outcomes. Overall results of the study suggested that drugs are a moderately effective treatment for hyperactivity; however, a significant number of variables were identified in the analysis which require further research, including age of children and IQ.

Section 2 reports the services delivered to HCEEP demonstration projects in the areas of needs assessment, agreements services, infant health care/education workshop services, and print products. Overall effectiveness of TADS technical assistance  projects is reported in terms of change in the status of the TA needs identified at the beginning of the year, impacts on the organization of the projects, impacts on programmatic aspects of the projects, and overall satisfaction with all the TA provided. Section 3 reports data collected on TA services to SIGs. Section 4 describes other TA services (such as the 1981-82 Demonstration Project Orientation Conference and the health care/education reltionship workshop) and cites client reactions to the services.

An introduction reviews the TADS technical assistance model which includes program planning, needs assessment, technical assistance agreements, delivery of services, and evaluation. Section 1 reports on recommended procedures for preparing for needs assessment (including the designation of a needs assessment facilitator and review of the project's organizational structure and decision making process). Section 2 considers procedures for conducting a comprehensive program review of the project's status as it relates to current  accomplishments, projected accomplishments, and tasks to be completed during the year. A third section describes procedures for selecting the needs or areas in which technical assistance is desired, refining the selected needs into technical assistance need statements, arranging the technical assistance needs in priority order from most to last important, and developing a plan to address each technical assistance need. A final section briefly offers suggestions for preparing the summary report, summarizing the process, and returning the appropriate materials to TADS. Attachments make up the remainder of the document and include procedures for handling needs assessment information, an HCEEP demonstration project profile needs assessment instrument, an HCEEP model development guide, and  example of a rated profile page, an HCEEP demonstration project profile summary page, an example of a memorandum of agreement, an example of a technical assistance agreement work sheet, an example of a technical assistance activities sequence, and a summary report form.

        "description":"During the past 10 years, the Technical Assistance Development System's (TADS) staff and advisory board members along with 500 other people have provided consultation services to model demonstration programs and state education agencies that help young handicapped children and their families. Consultants are usually located through a sponsor or broker. The consultant role involves that of advocate, technical expert, and process facilitator. Successful consultants usually posess specific knowledge and expertise, communication skills, systematic procedures, and interpersonal skills. Central to success for a broker are effective procedures, an orientation of responsiveness, nondirectiveness, knowledge, and skills; while important client characteristics are knowledge, involvement,  communication ability, realistic point of view, autonomy, and leadership. There are some practical considerations involved in matching prospective consultants to clients such as determining type of agency, previous experience, and compatibility of professional philosophy. Because of the nature of the work, the consultant with the TADS approach may be faced with problems in areas including identification of the client, confidentiality, and lack of feedback from the consultant/client interaction. The broker agency may face problems involving role conflicts, financial arrangements, selection of consultants, and accountability. The client can also have complaints regarding timeliness of consultation services, communication with consultants, and readiness for consultation. The TADS model for  consultation contains the steps of needs assessment, the technical assistance agreement, technical assistance delivery, evaluation of assistance, and program planning. Flaws in the consultation model are seen to be inefficiency, arrogance of the consultants, and iatrogenesis (i.e. that consultation may produce more problems than it solves). The client-centered and nondirective philosophy of the TADS approach has resulted in generally positive consultation relationships. (SW)",

        "description":"The authors review the relationship of technical assistance agencies with both the sponsor and clients, as well as the general reasons for technical assistance. Technical assistance efforts usually involve a three-party relationship--the funding agency, the client system, and technical assistance coordinator. Technical assistance systems in education are designed to foster growth and change in people--to help them acquire skills, knowledge, methods, or attitudes. Assumptions that should guide a technical assistance organization include that technical assistance is a process, not an event, and that technical assistance takes place within the context of a formal, ongoing relationship that is based on mutual trust and respect. There are 10 dimensions along which technical assistance  models reflect varying positions such as comprehensive services/limited services, user-identified needs/system-identified needs, content orientation/process orientation, advocacy/neutrality, and flexible technical assistance plans/fixed technical assistance plans. Conflicts within the three party relationship may arise between funding agency and technical assistance coordinator, between funding agency and client system, and between the assistance agency and the client system. Three unsatisfactory ways to resolve conflicts are the tyranny of confidentiality (in which the technical assistance group attempts to separate itself from the monitoring function), tyranny of expertise (when the assistance agency staff members perceive themselves as the ultimate experts in the field), and imposition  of the power hierarchy (in which the sponsoring agency resolves the problem by asserting its power). A more positive approach to resolving conflicts is through supportive collaboration which involves such characteristics as frequent communication and resource identification. (SW)",

The three strategies were: (1) on-site--conducted by a trained needs assessor at the program's site; (2) telephone--conducted by a trained needs assessor through a series of telephone conversations; and (3) self-administered--conducted by the program's staff using procedures and materials provided by TADS. The 64 programs participating were ramdomly assigned to one of the three strategies. Results indicated that all three strategies adequately identified technical assistance needs and were similar on  most variables. Perceptions of the participants occasionally favored on-site over telephone assessments. Comments from participants suggested that while the strategies were comparable for identifying technical assistance needs, there were some qualitative characteristics on which they differed. Appendixes include a report on the statistical analyses described in the text, along with tables; and a report of additional findings in the areas of project staff satisfaction, project staff perceptions of their needs, and targeted impacts of technical assistance.

Chapter 1, by P. Trohanis, focuses on a number of questions that people interested in using technical assistance in education should ask: what are the functions of a technical assistance (TA) system? how does TA work in education? what fields of inquiry have had an effect on the operation of present-day TA systems? how do I plan or refine a TA system? how has TADS structured its work with clients? and what has helped TADS achieve success? In chapter 2, T. Black et al. consider the concept of needs assessment  in terms of what has been learned at TADS. The discussion is organized around three major topics--definition of needs assessment, development of needs assessment processes, and an example of needs assessment procedures. The focus of a third chapter (by P. Trohanis et al.) addresses the process of arranging for consultants to assist clients in terms of the different kinds of consultation; the skills involved, and the problems in the process. In a final chapter, T. Suarez and P. Vandiviere describe the technology behind evaluation according to a general model which involves three focus points (purpose of the evaluation, audiences and their information needs, and nature of the program being evaluated) and five design components (including evaluation questions/criteria and data collection  procedures). Appendixes contain sample forms developed at TADS to evaluate TA services and a list of publications on TA developed under the auspices of TADS or its staff. (SW)",

Despite the greater parental role mandated by P.L. 94-142, the Education For All Handicapped Children Act, many parents of handicapped children still face frustration and noncooperatiion in their dealings with the public schools. Confrontations with the schools may result in feelings of isolation, resentment, and powerlessnss. Parents, however, have vital informatiion that school personnel can use in programing, such as knowledge about their child's unique communication methods, activity or food preferences, and behavior. Parents can assume advocacy roles if they are prepared and work together. Parent involvement initiated by the  schools can become more meaningful through practical strategies involving parent input in Individualized Education Programs, use of parent/professional advisory boards, a wider range of parent groups, use of parents as teachers, a framework in which parents help other parents, and the use of parents in program evaluation.

Nonbiased assessment procedures, vocational or educational curricula, and related services are seen as critical aspects in overcoming technological barriers, while attitude training for educators and nondisabled children is suggested to deal with attitudinal barriers. Jurisdictional barriers may be dealt with by such actions as legal and policy mandates and interagency agreements. Policies clearly defining roles and responsibilities of regular and special education personnel and materials on parents' and children's rights are among ways advocated for meeting administrative and political barriers. Architectural  barriers may be surmounted by cost-effective design modifications, while economic barriers may be addressed through the use of existing facilities and the efficient use of volunteers. Also suggested are ways to handle personnel barriers (including staff incentive and training alternatives); logistical barriers (such as using mobile assessment teams in rural areas); legal barriers (model legislation and policies on preschool education and graduation competency requiremens); motivational barriers (encouraging youth to stay in school through work study approaches); and idiosyncratic barriers.

Following a review of demographic data on the 112 DGPs, survey and questionnaire results are summarized in an examination of such aspects as DGP evolution, outreach or spin-off activities, curriculum change, facility attitude change, and student attitudes toward DGPs. Chapter 4, &quot;What Have We Learned from the Dean's Grant Projects?&quot; by J. Rand Whitmore, addresses four categories essential for DGP success: project leadership and organization, strategies to achieve faculty interest and participation, strategies to achieve denied curricular change, and project evaluation design. Chapter  5 presents a lengthy evaluation of the 19 central regional programs. &quot;The Dean's Role in the Dean's Grant Project: Director and Advocate&quot; by C. Sivage et al. cites case study research of 10 DGP sites. The extent to which 10 clusters of teaching capability were emphasized in DGP-Influenced Teacher Education programs is the focus of chapter 7, &quot;A Preliminary Study of the Clusters of Capabilities: An Approach to Curriculum Development in the Dean's Grant Projects,&quot; by M. Gazvoda. The final chapter examines the future of DGPs in terms of discontinuance of federal funding, emerging issues and problems, and future challenges in DGPs. Appended material includes examples of evaluative instruments used in local projects. (CL)",

Instructional variables investigated were classroom structure and student participation. Student aptitudes included were mainifest anxiety and perceived locus of control. The main effects of classroom structure and student participation were also considered. Outcome measures included students' rating of difficulty, teacher skill, teacher affect, and overall ratings. Learning performance was assessed with a completion-type examination of factual recall which was administered immediately after the rating of the instructional session. Among  findings were the following: high participation resulted in higher ratings of teacher skill and overall ratings; high structure yielded higher overall ratings and examination performance; Ss sufficiently external in their perceived locus of control orientation and in low participation conditions gave higher ratings of teacher skill for high versus low structure. Ss low in internality perceived low structure conditions as more difficult than high structure conditions. Ss low in anxiety potential rated the high participation, low structure condition more favorable in terms of teacher affect, teacher skill, and overall; as opposed to Ss in the low participation, low structure condition. Findings were generally consistent with previous findings with normally hearing subjects and with the  concept of trait-by-treatment task interactions.

Section 1 focuses on &quot;Parents Helping Parents,&quot; a program to make parents more effective advocates for their children and to encourage them to work closely with schools in planning appropriate educational programs for their children. The &quot;Parents Helping Parents&quot; project has five levels of activity: Level I--inform the general public regarding the needs and rights of handicapped children and PACER services; Level II--Workshops on special education laws for all parents of handicapped children; Level III--workshops on special education laws for specific groups, such as parents of preschool  handicapped children or members of a specific disability group; Level IV--workshop training of parent advocates and advocates for parents of handicapped children; and Level V--individual advocacy assistance to parents of handicapped children. Findings on evaluating the &quot;Parents Helping Parents&quot; program are cited for each of the five levels of activity. Noted among results are that 92% of 160 randomly selected parents felt the information presented at the workshops was useful to them, and that the disability areas of learning disabilities, physical handicaps, and mental retardation continued to elicit the greatest number of calls for individual advocacy assistance. The &quot;COUNT ME IN&quot; project trains volunteers to provide educational programs about handicapped individuals to preschool and  school age children. Goals are accomplished through three levels of activity--public information, volunteer training, and puppet show presentations. Among findings regarding &quot;COUNT ME IN&quot; project activities are that publicity efforts succeeded in attracting interest, that the effectiveness of the volunteer training was indicated by the evaluation participants, and that ratings of the puppet presentations by both children and adults were overwhelmingly positive.

Practical examples of how local variables within eight factors influence state special education fiscal policies are  described. The eight factors addressed are: population characteristics (population size, density, increasing/decreasing enrollment, eligibility criteria, interagency shifts, magnet effect); individual education needs (procedural protection, intensity of services, duration, multiple agency criteria); service delivery systems (program services, service providers, private insurers); governance structures (type of governance units, responsibility vs. authority, special education and the school budget); system costs (geographic location, price level variations, contract negotiations, resources); resources revenue-generating wealth, tax-levying authority, availability of community resources, private services, personnel resources); timing and predictability (dollar flow, fiscal stability,  contingency capability); and accountability (state education agency responsibilities, local education agency responsibilities).

Chapter 1 on the scope of the problem looks at student, personnel, and instrument variables affecting assessment of bilingual exceptional students. Among the factors discussed are variability within and between ethnic groups, teacher attitudes, and test translations. Practical suggestions for assessing bilingual exceptional students are provided in chapter 2. Three levels of assessment are described--the initial level (classroom screening), the intermediate level (diagnostic-prescriptive assessment), and advanced level (comprehensive individual assessment). A proposed model is reviewed which includes procedures for  informal language screening, formal language assessment, and comprehensive individual assessment of children with limited English proficiency. Also provided is information on use of informal tests (including checklists and rating scales, informal survey tests, observation, the Cloze Procedure for language assessment, and interviewing). A rating scale is outlined for assessing language proficiency in five domains--rhetoric, register/style, syntax, vocabulary, and pronunciation. The second chapter also contains sections on practical problem-solving techniques, task analysis, criterion-referenced tests, and additional assessment procedures. The final chapter addresses placement alternatives and programing for the bilingual exceptional student. Considered within this chapter are the  individualized education program, cooperative vs. competitive instructional arrangements, curriculum content, instruction in the student's native language, and preparation and teaching of a bilingual lesson. A sample profile form of oral language proficiency completes the document. (SW)",

An initial section on brain basics covers the history of brain research, methods of investigation, cerebral dominance, divisions of labor of the bifunctional brain, language and related functions, bilingualism, learning styles, traditional education and the single brain, and emotions and the brain. A second section considers the need to integrate both convergent left-hemisphere modes in learning experiences. Another section examines determinants of neurologically based learning styles including the impact of age, sex, and handedness on left or right brain learning style preference. The effects of relaxation and diet upon brain functioning is the  topic of the fourth section. The fifth section discusses findings relative to the study of learning disabilities, mental health, and creativity. Methods for educational assessment of learning styles are reviewed, such as the Structure of Intellect Learning Abilities Test and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised. Steps toward dealing with the whole child in the educational system should incorporate consideration of teachers' verbal and nonverbally expressed attitudes, relaxation strategies, general strategies which more fully involve the brain in learning, and curricular strategies which promote integrated processing of information. Following a summary and a list of implications for education are appendixes which contain 35 activities to stimulate integrated/right brain  processes and a brief report on the deprivation of estimates for national prevalence of right brain children.

Chapter 1 offers historical and philosophical, gifted education, and high school perspectives to stewardship (the dual responsibility to self and others to realize potential). Five models for educating the gifted are compared: the social/survival model (activities are mostly games), the curriculum model (which emphasizes mastering the basics), enrichment (which extends the curricular model with options within and outside the school), stewardship (which involves students as leaders in the community), and Micronet (which combines stewardship with  microcomputer technology). The MAP, particularly as it was developed at Lord Elgin High School (Ontario, Canada), is described in chapter 2. Five components of the program are discussed: orientation (which focuses on assessment and on a match of students with potential programs), networkshop (designed for skill acquisition in areas useful to becoming an effective mentor, steward, and networker), mentorship (in which students apply their newly acquired networking skills to working with mentors in the community), stewardship (during which the student engages in activities of service), and micronet (involving training the students to network their resources via microcomputer programing). A final chapter briefly addresses MAP outcomes including that students were better able to resolve  problems arising from differentiated learning situations and students were better able to meet their own learning expectations for areas of interest. Appended are a grade 9 enrichment program proposal and a description of the LESS (Learning Enrichment Service by Students) program at Lord Elgin High School. (SW)",

The rest of the time was spent in a computer laboratory working on assignments using terminals. Assignments included playing games, learning the BASIC language through computer assisted instruction, entering a program, running a program, and modifying a program. All students were successful in playing  computer games and completing the BASIC computer assisted instruction. Some students showed insight into understanding computer logic.

Goals were to develop materials that will: (1) give students information about the United States, (2) interest students in reading English, (3) help students improve their reading skills, and (4) expose students to a variety of literary forms. Fifty important and/or interesting areas of culture or life in the United States that were incorporated in the materials are identified. In addition to selections that explain cultural information directly, the selections used various literary forms, such as dialogues, directions, newspaper articles, poems, a letter, and a movie scenario. Additional literary froms that were used are identified. Types of realia included in the materials, such as recipes,  advertisements, and brochures, are also indicated. Besides having students read each passage at least three times in the class, the text was designed to have students do work related to the passage with exercises to gain more cultural meaning. It is suggested that visual aids help students better understand the main text, and that photographs, realia and maps made reading selections more real to students. Other learning activities include experience-based activities (e.g., making foods from English recipes), role playing, and writing exercises. Attention is directed to feedback on the materials from students and teachers, benefits of teaching culture, and previous studies on how well Japanese people understand American culture and how well they are taught about American culture in English  courses.

It is the result of a working session of experienced professionals that was convened by the Language and Orientation Resource Center (LORC), and it presumes some previous knowledge of the content as well as experience on the part of those who will use it. The manual consists of six sections: an introduction, definitions of technical assistance which the trainer may be asked to provide, a description of the keys to effective training, topics of concern to the trainer and to the ESL client, the planning and presentation of workshops, and a discussion of resources. It is noted that the third section is the core of the  manual because this section provides the trainer with the basis on which to develop any training session regardless of topic. In addition, this section presents the content that should be taught to other trainers. (Author/AMH)",

        "description":"Characteristics and reading performance of students who have a dominant language other than English are examined and compared with those of English-dominant students, based on the results 1979-1980 National Assessment of Educational Progress (reading and literature). Responses were obtained from 9-year-olds, 13-year-olds, and 17-year-olds. The exercises probed students' comprehension of simple words as well as such complex features of text as mood, tone, and character. It was found that students from homes in which a language other than English was often spoken (OL) generally performed below students for whom English was the dominant language (EL) In general, OL students attending advantaged-urban and private schools, those coming from homes with many reading resources, and  (except at age 9) those who have a parent with post-high school education performed near, at, or above national levels. OL students attending disadvantaged-urban schools, those coming from homes with few reading resources, and those whose parents had not completed high school performed considerably below their more advantaged peers. While OL 17-year-olds performed about a percentage point below the nation and 5 percentage points below white students for whom English was the dominant language, black OL 17-year-olds performed 26 points below the nation and 14 points below black EL students. In addition, Hispanic OL 17-year-olds performed 9 percentage points below the nation, just as Hispanic EL students do. Findings are also considered in relation to region of the country, type and size of  community, four achievement ranges, kindergarten attendance, television watching, time spent on homework, and reading, sex, and race/ethnicity.

        "description":"The acquisition of the metalinguistic abilities involved in ambiguity detection and resolution was studied with children. It is suggested that metalinguistic abilities may serve as potential test measures for facility in learning a second language. School children (ages 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13) were tested for their ability to detect ambiguous sentences and their ability to provide multiple interpretations for common ambiguity types in the areas of lexicon and syntax. An extensive review of the literature and a pilot study on the development of metalinguistic ability of children are presented. In the pilot study, each child was asked to give two meanings of ambiguous sentences. An equal number of sentences were lexically ambiguous, ambiguous at the surface level, and ambiguous at  the underlying level. Results with the 5 year olds show that they were not perceiving two meanings of the ambiguous sentences. A steady increase with age in the perception of two meanings was demonstrated. At each age level, the lexically ambiguous sentences were generally easier than the structually ambiguous ones. The 13 year olds perceived two meanings for almost all of the lexically ambiguous sentences and about half of the structurally ambiguous sentences. The current findings and those of previous research suggest that metalinguistic ability to detect ambiguity is not completely developed by the age of 13. It is suggested that a relationship may exist between the abilities to detect ambiguity and to acquire a second language. (SW)",

        "description":"The benefits for students of English as a second language of reading abstracts are considered, and the functions and types of abstracts are reviewed. In addition, the results of a survey of Ben Gurion University (Israel) lecturers regarding their reading habits and use of abstracts are briefly addressed. It is suggested that when abstracts are reproduced together with the article, they can be used in the classroom as advanced organizers. For the abstract that follows the structure of the article exactly, two types of activities may be undertaken: asking the student to find and outline the corresponding sections in the article, and forcing the student to read between the subtitles. An example of how to break down the structure of an abstract and relate it to the article is  presented: Abstracts can also be used in isolation as cohesive and coherent texts in their own right. For instance, since abstracts are short texts, several abstracts on related topics can be studied in much less time than it would take to read one entire article. In planning the curriculum, it is proposed that abstracts can be used on all levels. For the lower level class, short or indicative types of abstracts can be used. For the intermediate level, longer, informative types are useful, and for the advanced levels, the critical abstract is appropriate. Appended material includes sample abstracts, information on the organization of the abstract, classifications of introductory and concluding lines, a list of journals with abstracts, an example of an ideal abstract, and results of the  faculty attitude questionnaire.

A cost/benefit analysis was conducted of three English language training programs: the English Technical Language School (ETLS) operated by the Puerto Rico National Guard, the Defense Language Institute (DLI) English Language Center at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, and the Navy Verbal Skills Curriculum (VSC) implemented at the Recruit Training Command in Orlando, Florida. Program descriptions, test scores of recruits participating in each program, and cost data are presented. In addition, 14 alternative training tracks utilizing combinations of the three  programs are discussed. In considering the feasibility of these tracks, five non-cost factors must be considered: program length, capacity, location, flexibility, and Navy participation. The three programs were found to be similar in both effectiveness and cost. The ETLS program is best suited for recruits with a moderate level of English skills, while the DLI program can handle recruits with a wider variety of skill levels. The VSC program has a limited capacity but is under Navy control. Recommendations are made regarding testing and placement of Hispanic recruits in English training programs. (RW)",

A case study in reformulating Hebrew-as-a-second-language essay and a small study involving the reformulation of university level English-as-a-second-language and Hebrew-as-a-second language essays are reported. The case study demonstrates how a reformulation provides information not provided by a reconstruction, especially in regard to vocabulary appropriate for a written technical register, syntactic structures, and cohesive markers. The second study provides a comparison of the typical teacher correction  or reconstruction and reformulation. The reformulations gave more extensive feedback on improving the essays, especially in the area of cohesion. Student reactions were mostly positive in that reformulation provided them with a complete example of a more native-like way to express their own ideas. (Author/RW)",

Findings include the following: (1) writing system differences were reduced by emphasizing the printing system (whether by reading or writing print), particularly in the earliest  grades; (2) reading received the most attention, followed by writing, and speaking; (3) little evidence was found of either out-of-school participation in literacy acquisition or of topical emphasis on matters pertaining to home or community; (4) out-of-school influences on literacy acquisition, though small, occurred primarily for the ethnic language; (5) little awareness or concern was found for nonschool dialect, interlanguage contrasts, or interlanguage variation; (6) for instruction in French and Hebrew, teacher-made materials were more commonly employed than were basal readers, whereas the opposite was true for English instruction; (7) the Greek school stressed choral reading; (8) the French school used individual reading more than did the other schools; and (9) the Hebrew school  stressed analytic decoding in both languages more than synthetic zones.

In addition to using nonclassroom moments to expose students to language discovery, this approach involves changing instructional materials to get to the students' level of language and experiential development. It also involves taking advantage of each situation as a potential learning experience within the classroom. For example, a bird flying into an open window in the classroom was used to present continuous tenses to describe what the bird was doing at various times. Teachers can provide variety in the classroom learning experience by using different teaching methods, including audiolingual, silent way, suggestopedia, counseling learning, and total physical response  approaches. When students in the ESL classroom are having difficulty with some aspect of the language in the middle of a lesson, the teacher may teach the corrections on the spot. Specific ways to improve interest in ESL instruction and make it relevant to the students' environment may include using Mother Goose nursery rhymes to teach comprehension and culture or simple line drawings (droodles) to elicit oral responses from students. The need for teachers to know where language resources exist, and implications for teacher trainers, curriculum writers, and program directors are briefly addressed. (SW)",

Highlights are as follows: annual science and engineering (S/E) doctorate production increased over 2 percent to 17,600 between 1980 and 1981; S/E doctorates accounted for about 56 percent of all doctorates in 1981, approximately the level that has prevailed since 1973; decreases in doctorate production occurred in engineering and the physical sciences (both are down almost 30 percent  over the decade), while psychology and the life sciences generally increased; the annual number of both U.S. and foreign S/E doctorate recipients generally declined over the 1971-1981 period, but the 13 percent decrease for U.S. citizens was almost twice as great as that for non-U.S. citizens; minority group members received about one-tenth of the S/E doctorates awarded to U.S. citizens and permanent residents in 1981; the sex composition of the new S/E doctorate recipients changed over the last 10 years, with the proportion of women increasing from 10 percent in 1971 to 23 percent in 1981; the majority of doctorates undertake employment following graduation but the loci of job opportunities have been changing; the proportion of S/E doctorates entering employment in academia fell from 60  percent in 1971 to 43 percent in 1981, while employment in nonacademic institutions, excluding government, grew from 25 to 40 percent.

        "description":"Characteristics of colleges that are related to the achievement of undergraduates in teacher education were studied, based on study of 15 North Carolina institutions, 10 predominantly white and 5 predominantly black public universities. Student performance on the National Teacher Examinations and Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores were used as indications of achievement, which was correlated with the following college characteristics: library facilities, the age and size of the institution, curriculum, student body attributes, financial resources, and faculty characteristics. In addition, interviews were conducted in 1981 on four campuses with the chief academic officer, teacher education faculty, and students with high grade point averages. Aggregate data from the schools and  interview findings indicate that faculty characteristics were the most important influence on student achievement, followed by student body attributes, appropriations directed toward faculty improvement, and curriculum design. Degrees obtained by an institution's liberal arts faculty were the most strongly related to differing achievement rates. Faculty expectations of students were related to the reputations of institutions from which faculty members earned their degrees. Prior educational background of all students on a campus appeared to be the most important student body attribute for influencing college achievement rates of students with comparable precollege learning. In addition, the average SAT score of the entire student body and the proportion of a campus's student body drawn  from the top 40 percent of a high school class were highly correlated with differences in achievement.

A basic causal model for enrollment decisions (college choice and part- or full-time enrollment), and five elaborations on the model using data provided by VUAC are presented. These elaborations focus separately on the students' place of residence, performance on the Higher School Certificate examination, preference level of the final offer of courses made to the applicants, the type of institution making the offer, and type of course (discipline) offered. A final model incorporating the last  three variables is then constructed. Detailed analysis of the individual, joint, and interactive effects of parental social status and ethnic background and the mediating and direct effects of the social-psychological factors using the survey data follow. The final chapter focuses on deferring and declining the final course offers, and summarizes the variables' effects on the students' enrollment decisions. Brief case studies are introduced for illustration. (MSE)",

        "description":"The research evidence for selecting students in higher education with and without regard to race and sex is examined to assist admissions officers in light of the 1978 Bakke decision, which seems to give schools the option to use race in admissions decisions. Three clusters of studies supporting the consideration of race-sex subgroups in admissions decisions are considered: (1) those showing no relationship, or perhaps a negative relationship between the traditional predictors and college grades for minority students; (2) those indicating the need for separate equations or cutoffs for each subgroup if traditional predictors are employed; and (3) those involving the utility of noncognitive or nontraditional variables in predicting minority student success. Proponents of using a  single prediction equation or cutoff score suggest that this approach is most fair to all concerned. Proponents of using separate equations or cutoffs for each subgroup when traditional predictors are employed note that black males tend to be the least predictable race-sex subgroup and any general equation would discriminate most against them. One reason for considering noncognitive or nontraditional variables in predicting minority student success is to ensure having comparable information for minority and majority group college applicants. Some research has indicated that the typical minority applicant is not as sure what is being solicited and is less likely to know how to supply the information the college wants. It is concluded that strong consideration should be given to race-sex  subgroups in admissions procedures. (SW)",

One part of the attrition study used the American College Testing (ACT) program's withdrawing/nonreturning student survey, while a second approach was based on the computerized People Oriented Information System for Education, which maintains the student database files. The compositions of the three freshmen classes were cross-tabulated by sex and ethnic category. The male/female composition of the classes reversed for 1978 and l979 as compared to 1977, but the ethnic makeup was basically unchanged. Approximately 37 percent of the fall quarter first-time college freshmen did not return the following fall, and about 50 percent remained after 2  years. On the ACT survey, nonreturning students indicated major and minor reasons for leaving college, and almost 32 percent of the respondents cited one of the following three reasons as the single most important: desired major not offered, marital status changed education plans, or wanted to move to a new location. Based on the comparison of the student databases, no significant differences in attrition were found between males and females or between blacks and whites for the 1977 class. For the 1978 class, male attrition was statistically higher than the female rate (41.9 percent and 32.3 percent, respectively). The total student attrition rate between fall 1977 and 1978 did not change significantly, but the fall 1979 attrition rate was significantly lower for black students than for  white. (SW)",

The objective was to ascertain if the difference in cultural settings between the two colleges (small town vs. metropolitan area) influenced choice of employment, assessment of students, professional activities in addition to teaching, and desire to stay with present position. Based on questionnaire responses of 23 white FSU teachers (15 male and 8 female), it was found that the respondents were more likely to be married (57 percent), between 40-44 years old, doctorate degree holders (78 percent), employed full-time, and teaching within their area of  specialization, and to have had 11.5 years of teaching experience, 8.1 years of which were at the undergraduate level. Prior to employment at FSU, the white teachers had attended school with black pupils/students (91.3 percent, elementary through graduate school), but were not likely to have been taught by black faculty (43 percent). The need for employment was the main reason for seeking employment at FSU, and most of the teachers were sufficiently rewarded by the position to consider teaching at historically/predominantly black colleges for the remainder of their careers (86 percent). Similarities were found in the reasons the white FSU and Morehouse faculty sought employment, their assessment of the caliber of students being taught, their publishing record, and level of job  satisfaction. Lists of colleges attended by the respondents and their academic specialties are appended. (SW)",

Questionnaire responses from 137 students indicated the degree of student satisfaction with academic and social services provided by the college. Data are presented on student enrollments by class during 1970-1980, and on student attrition rates from freshmen to senior year. Questionnaire responses included the following: (1) library and work/study supervision--well-satisfying; (2) teaching methods, advising, and course scheduling--satisfying (good); (3) course materials, classroom environment, dormitory living conditions, and financial aid information--partially satisfying; and (4) recreational activities, college regulations, sports equipment, and food  services--partially satisfying or dissatisfying. A condensed version of students' suggested changes, comments on services, and educational experiences is appended. Reasons for student attrition (fall 1979-1981) are indicated, along with data on student age groups and sources of student funds. Since about 18 percent of the recorded explanations on student attrition were attributable to poor performance and academic suspension, it is recommended that student educational support programs be provided. It is suggested that Barber-Scotia enrollments could be increased by: introducing additional occupational and technical programs; sending a college recruiter to the public schools to provide information on programs and job opportunities; and improving food, health, and recreational services.

        "description":"Retention rates of professors, associate professors, and assistant professors in the Florida State University System (SUS) for 1977-1978 and 1978-1979 are analyzed. Separate retention rates for each rank by tenure status and age group are presented. The nontenured assistant professors have the lowest retention rates (about 85 percent for both time periods). Data are presented on the total number of new positions to be filled by both the SUS faculty within the system and faculty who could be hired from outside. It is only at the assistant professor level where it becomes possible to hire a sizeable number of new faculty from outside the SUS. Using the age categories established by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), it is suggested that the the Florida SUS  faculty is a &quot;mature&quot; faculty. As the older and more expensive SUS faculty retire, they will be replaced by less expensive younger faculty. The data suggest that there will be adequate annual retirements to keep a steady tenure ratio, adequate number of positions available for hiring young faculty, and no increased compensation costs due to an aging faculty. Although the turnover rate is sufficient for the entire SUS, it may not approximate the faculty turnover rate at each of the nine universities. It is suggested that an early retirement policy might have some merit if it were designed to achieve specific goals at the various institutions. It is proposed that a projected modest growth in new positions over the next 5 years will reduce the system's chance of increasing minority  representation at the tenured professor and associate professor level in a short period of time, unless minority faculty are hired at the tenured full and associate levels.

A random sample of 147 ethnic minority students (54 Asian, 54 Black, and 39 Hispanic undergraduates) responded to a 59-item questionnaire with a return rate of 77 percent. The data suggest that more similarities exist between Asians and Hispanics than with Black students. Over half of the Asian sample grew up in suburban settings, while a majority of Blacks grew up in cities. Many of the Asians and Hispanics came from families where fathers either held professional/managerial positions or owned their own businesses; fewer Black fathers held these positions. It was more common for both the Asian and Hispanic students  than for the Blacks to have an immediate family member who had attended college. The majority of the Hispanic and Asian samples had dated persons of another race while in college and high school, attended social or athletic events more frequently in mixed groups or with friends of another race, and tended to feel positive about the college environment and its services. Hispanics displayed the greatest amount of interracial interaction and exhibited the most positive perception of the school. Blacks were more likely to date or attend social or athletic events with other Blacks, and less likely to do things in mixed groups. Blacks had less favorable perceptions and attitudes toward the college and its environment, and also appeared to be more race-conscious and concerned with racial issues  than Asians or Hispanics.

The first summarizes the findings of site visits to 56 two- and four-year institutions to examine four aspects of the teacher training programs: curriculum, management, student characteristics and progress, and the institutional setting. Indicators of an institution's ability to produce sufficient well-qualified bilingual education teachers and to institutionalize and maintain the programs in the absence of Federal support are also discussed. The second summary presents the findings of a survey of graduates from bilingual teacher education programs and a study of the supply of and demand for bilingual education teachers  nationwide. The graduate survey obtained data on the professional status of 809 teacher education graduates and 168 teacher trainer program graduates from one to three years after training. The objective was to determine the extent to which the programs were alleviating the shortage of qualified teachers. (MSE)",

An initial 1982 evaluation of the dental school revealed numerous deficiencies in financial and operational management. Among other things, the 1982 report concluded the the dental school, the third smallest in the United States, is a high-cost institution that expends 58 percent more than the national average to educate its students and receives more state appropriated funds per Doctor of Dental Science equivalent than any other U.S. dental school. Of 54 recommendations that were reevaluated by the legislative committee, 47 had been addressed and acted upon by the school. Ten recommendations were not addressed because the institutions of higher learning  contended that academic and curricular matters were not subject to legislative review. A brief overview is provided on actions taken by the dental school to improve in the following areas: organizational structure, institutional and educational structure, accounting procedures and related controls, selected areas of operation, and cost reduction and revenue increase measures. For 26 of the findings contained in the 1982 review, a chart outlines the recommendations to the dental school, and the actions taken by the school. (SW)",

Additional areas of analysis were: expenditures per student, tuition, institutional costs, revenue sources, clinic facility utilization, learning resources facility utilization, dental school applicants, accounting  procedures and related controls, budgeting, travel, free care, and an intramural private practice plan. Findings include: the dental school expends 58 percent more than the national average to educate its students; the school is ranked low nationwide in sponsored research revenue, tuition income, and clinic income; the school admits only in-state residents as dental students; and the value of the schools' supply inventory is materially understated due to inadequate inventory and accounting procedures.

The theory is based on the concept of stages, which are structurally whole, internally consistent systems of thought that organize the individual's understanding of, feelings toward, and actions on the world. Stage theory presents the image of an expanding self that is forced to reach for a new formulation of reality more adequate to the situation at hand. The structural-developmental theory presents a working model of \"the whole person\" as the totality of all his/her capacities (cognitive, moral, social, ego). It is possible for experiential education to promote development by deliberately supplying the prerequisite conditions for movement from stage to stage.  Structural-developmental theory has implications for: (1) how experiences for individual students are structured; (2) how educators interact with students; and (3) how educators interact with the community placement staff. Using these three aspects of experiential education, elements of good practice are covered, based on the theory. Three group exercises and checklists are included to stimulate thinking differently about experiential activities, how field experiences are planned and structured, and objectives of the experience.

The focus was attitudes and practices of 1,621 departments and central offices on U.S. campuses concerning internships in the following majors: English, American studies, history, art history, philosophy, classics, and modern foreign languages. Information about non-sponsors and sponsors of humanities internships was obtained, using two questionnaires, which are appended. The investigation also covered: prerequisites for students, internship placement, extra fees, paid internships, learning plans or contracts, hours students work, student evaluation and the fulfilling of academic requirements, evaluating student internship performance, grades, credit awarded, locating &quot;high-quality&quot;  internships, and reasons for success in internship programs. Case studies cover ad hoc and department coordinated internships including: art history (Sweet Briar), modern foreign languages (Purdue), English (Wayne State), history (Boston University), philosophy (Bowling Green State); joint arrangements by department and office including Office of the Dean (Brown), Career Cevelopment Center/Internship Program (Macalester); institutionalized programs, e.g., humanities internship program (Scripps); and internship programs based outside the school, e.g., The Washington Center and the Philadelphia Urban Semester (Great Lakes College Association).

        "description":"Dental school enrollments and the supply and demand of dentists in the United States and the south are examined. The growth in the supply of dentists in the South is related to an improved economy in this region and a rapid population increase. In addition to producing a large number of dental school graduates, the South is attracting graduates of schools outside the South. A reduced demand for dental services is linked to improved oral hygiene, the wide use of flourides, and the fact that dental care is often deferred because dental expenses usually are paid by the consumer. Between 1980 and 1984, first-year dental school enrollments declined 16.3 percent in the United States and 20.3 percent in the South. The number of applicants has decreased from 14,807 in 1975-1976 to 6,200  for 1985-1986. In 1976, dental schools accepted only 40 percent of applicants, while 77 percent were accepted in 1984. Reasons for declining application rates include: rapid increases in dental school costs; high debt among dental school graduates; and reduced earning potential in dentistry. Since dental school enrollments are likely to continue to decline, options that might be helpful to states with public dental schools are identified. Data on 1980-1984 first-year and total dental school enrollments in 14 southern states and the United States are included, along with data on cost-per-student. (SW)",

Evidence suggests that an estimated 40 to 50 percent of entering freshmen will be referred to remedial education, and colleges may be granting degrees to students who lack basic academic skills. The recommendations to improve undergraduate education are directed to three areas: beginning college-level work; student achievement and outcomes; and faculty and curriculum. States are advised to improve the readiness of students to begin college work by such measures as: requiring that higher education establish statewide standards for placement in credit courses; requiring that  threshold placement standards and assessment procedures be consistent statewide; and ensuring that students not qualified to begin degree-credit study have geographical access to programs that will prepare them to qualify. It is also recommended that standards of academic progress be adopted and that colleges should specify skills/knowledge students need for the bachelor's degree. Proposed ways to strengthen the curriculum and the faculty reward system, which would involve faculty and presidential leadership, are also offered. (SW)",

Each school offers at least one type of part-time program, but while the University of Houston has only the part-time, on-campus model, each of the other three schools has satellite model programs also. Both UT and UTA utilize other colleges as their off-campus instructional sites, and OLLU utilizes training facilities. The number of students admitted each year ranges from a low of about 15 students (OLLU) to a high of about 30 students at UT's off-site program. All three schools have the  same admissions criteria for both programs. However, both OLLU and UTA require a period of residence on the main campus that ranges from 15 weeks at OLLU to 32 weeks for UTA students. The UT program is completely off-site, with no Austin residence requirements. Information was also obtained on: the academic rank of faculty involved in off-site, part-time master's of social work programs; academic advising for students; course sequencing by semester; field placements; and grading systems.

Student characteristics include personal attributes, needs, abilities, interests, and values, while institutional characteristics include physical, academic, social, and psychological attributes that affect the campus environment. To increase levels of fit between campus and student, enrollment managers need to define the campus environment and gather data as  the basis for making changes when student-institution mismatches occur. An intervention model is described that allows the college to set goals based on intended outcomes for students, design programs and activities to help fulfill the goals, and measure how well the goals are being met.

Major findings show that: the distribution of student assistance has undergone considerable shifts in the past 10 years, due in large part to the rapid growth of the proprietary sector; the elimination of Social Security and Veterans Administration support for students has had a substantial impact on the mix between loans and grants; and the maximum and average financial aid awards in the various programs have not kept pace with inflation.

General factors that limit an institution's flexibility in managing scarce resources and adapting to environmental uncertainty include: excessive external budgetary controls, limited time to respond to change, limited capacity to reallocate resources, and  internal opposition. The following 13 staffing practices are examined: flexibility in tenure and staffing, control of academic positions by attrition, contract systems, nontenure-track appointments, part-time appointments, tenure quotas, extended probation and suspension of &quot;up-or-out&quot; rules, stricter tenure standards, review of tenured faculty, early retirement incentives, retrenchment, closure of academic programs, and retraining and reallocating faculty.

In higher education, assessment is used to refer to at least six separate but overlapping activities: (1) multiple measures to track students' intellectual and personal growth over an extended period of time; (2) state-mandated requirements for evaluating students and/or academic programs; (3) a focus on the &quot;value added,&quot; whereby students undergo pre- and post-testing and the gains in general education and skills are measured; (4) general standardized testing; (5) making decisions about funding by rewarding institutions for performance on established criteria; and (6) measuring changes in student attitudes and values. Attention is directed to three purposes of student testing: admission/placement  testing, achievement testing, and testing for graduation. Policy issues include: specifying educational quality, achievement and student access, the cost of quality, legal issues surrounding the use of tests for promotion/graduation decisions, and the use of performance criteria in the budget process. It is proposed that concern with the outcomes of college and student achievement is likely to become an increasingly prominent policy issue. (SW)",

It is important for faculty to develop goals for student achievement and to determine whether a test fits a given college program or course. Standardized, objective tests have been used extensively for selection purposes, and external tests are useful for assessing basic skills and deficits for purposes of placement or remediation. A few external tests assess outcomes of general education. When using outcomes assessment to improve instruction, faculty should be involved directly in evaluating student performance. National tests are also used to assess knowledge and skill  in major fields of study. Assessment procedures on campus include course examinations, tests to assess major field proficiency, using examiners other than the student's primary instructor, and senior comprehensives. For various fields of study, externally-validated instruments are identified for the assessment of student performance in associate and baccalaureate degree programs. New ideas in the field of assessment are listed, and the concept of the assessment center is mentioned. The innovative approach of Alverno College (Wisconsin) is described.

Background information covers the use of assessment in business and government, as well as in education and psychology. It is proposed that assessment include: multidimensional sampling of students' abilities in action; observation and judgment of those samples on the basis of explicit criteria; and structured feedback, administered sequentially in relation to a learner's development. Each of these elements in turn must contribute to the growth of the students' ability to self-assess. Issues relevant to beginning, intermediate, and advanced learners are identified, and research on criteria, feedback, and self-assessment is reviewed. To  help faculty design individual classroom assessments, consideration is given to: determining a specific ability or expected outcome, identifying component abilities, selecting or designing a stimulus and context, attending to developmental levels, developing criteria, providing for self-assessment, and judging performance and giving feedback. Included are guidelines for judging whether criteria are effective and an example of extending assessment beyond the classroom to a wider curriculum context. (SW)",

After summarizing some special characteristics of large research universities, two problems are addressed: the lack of purposiveness in undergraduate education, and the widespread failure to achieve the learning outcomes professed for undergraduate education. The potential of assessment to introduce more coherence and purposiveness into undergraduate education in large research universities is discussed. Limits of assessment in solving the problem are also considered, with attention to other aspects of the problem: funding for undergraduate education, and integration of undergraduate education with the other functions of research universities. Principles to guide the design of  assessment activities include: (1) assessment of learning outcomes should be part of a framework that is accepted by faculty and includes deliberation about what students should learn, inquiry into what they do learn, and action to adjust educational practices; (2) the assessment framework should be accepted by students and employers; (3) assessment should emphasize continuities with learning in elementary/secondary education; (4) formal assessment should be employed; and (5) the use of intensively evaluated pilot programs should be increased.

Presently, assessment in professional education relies almost exclusively on written or oral testing of a predetermined set of cognitive and analytical skills. This is followed by assessment of the ability to apply these skills to predetermined and well-defined problems and cases. Professional education and assessment need to focus more on the process of defining problems and making instrumental judgments, using a variety of real and simulated clinical experiences. Professionals need to be able to make choices among a number of possibilities, each of which optimizes one or more competing values. Professional  competence requires dealing with complexity, tolerance for ambiguity, coping with discontinuity and disequilibrium, and risk-taking. Self-assessment is emerging as an integral part of professional competence, and, therefore, must become part of professional education. The effective use of the following methods in assessment are addressed: the case study method; simulation, role playing, and group discussion; and small group interactions. Specific reference is made to the education of engineers, managers, and medical personnel. (SW)",

Two questions considered deal with (1) the unit of analysis and (2) what to count. The unit of analysis can be the individual student, programs or curricula, or the institution as a whole. Cost calculations vary (direct, indirect, full, average, marginal, opportunity costs); it is most important to determine the level of regular investment the institution must make in addition to ongoing activities. It is assumed that an institution will adopt an explicit program for assessing instructional effectiveness, in which various efforts are coordinated and supported by a visible,  staffed office. Some typical direct costs (instrument costs, administration costs, analysis costs, coordination costs) associated with establishing such a comprehensive program are derived. Constructed cost estimates are provided for four typical institutional types (small private liberal arts college, public major research university, regional comprehensive university, and community college). Each constructed cost estimate is anchored by actual data from institutional experience. Commonly used commercial instruments available for assessing student cognitive growth, reactions to college, and experiences after graduation are described in an appendix. (LB)",

Topics discussed include: (1) goals for computer use in education; (2) the software design  process and the source of quality productions; (3) student orientation to software; (4) student interaction with hardware and software; (5) ways to facilitate student understanding; (6) promising directions to pursue; and (7) the Advanced Instructional Technology Program at SRI International. Included are diagrams which illustrate the concepts of software types and learning skills, educational software development, design considerations for educational software, and the interaction of computer science and cognitive engineering.

Included are two models of human long-term memory--networks and hierarchies--and reasons are given for the higher efficiency of hierarchical theories, including the k-d tree. A description of the k-d tree includes its structure, computation rates, and balancing (branching); its applications to human cognition, including a comparison with Piaget's notions of equilibrium and cognitive stages of development; application to memory and forgetting theories; covergent and divergent thinking processes;  logic paths and decision-making; and the function of sleep. A concluding discussion compares human and computer processing of information, and raises questions related to the hierarchical structure of brain activity. It suggests that the k-d model from information science may have a strong relevance to the study of human cognition, particularly regarding the study of memory and sleep, while at the same time allowing for vast differences between a computer and the human mind.

Twenty-two participants used IBM-PC equipment to complete two skill modules. Each module included a series of simulated lessons followed by a debriefing session during which individualized counseling on skill attainment was given. In the first module, trainees were encouraged to inform pupils whether their content-based answers to spelling questions were correct or not. In the second module, trainees were encouraged to adjust the pace of their questioning on the basis of whether they were introducing or reviewing  content-related material. The instructional strategies could be determined by the teacher-trainee, and the interactions between the teacher and pupil (computer simulated) was in the form of spoken dialog. Instruction for the participants was based on a skill mastery approach to learning. The teacher-trainee response to classroom simulation was positive; 100% of participants reported enjoying the post-session debriefing and performance appraisal by a counselor. Future plans include continuation and expansion of simulation methods with opportunities given for participants to experience inappropriate classroom behavior in order to gain practice in effective management techniques.

        "description":"Designed to present a rationale for evaluating the implementation of computer assisted instruction (CAI) in higher education, this paper describes a multi-paradigmatic approach to the evaluation of CAI pilot implementation efforts and its application in various math and English courses at the New York Institute of Technology (NYIT). Students in two math courses--Developmental Math and College Algebra--and four different English courses--Communication Skills, Composition, Business Writing, and Technical Writing--spent significant portions of class time working in a microcomputer laboratory utilizing Apple/Franklin and Commodore 64 computers. Evaluations of instructional effectiveness focused on a process analysis, but a quantitative evaluation was also conducted. Included are  discussions of: (1) CAI and student role changes; (2) CAI and faculty role changes; (3) faculty professional development; (4) points unique to the math experience; (5) points unique to the English experience; (6) student attitudes toward computers and math CAI; (7) students' perceptions of word processing in the learning of writing; and (8) unanticipated negative consequences. Findings indicate that: CAI students demonstrated a good conceptual grasp of subject matter; their difficulties were identified quickly; they often worked in pairs, which provided mutual support; and faculty were able to interact individually with students, observe the learning process closely, and intervene directly and immediately.

Part I of this document describes the policy making process generally, and offers some specific ways that various groups approach policy developing. Part II presents some characteristics of computer use in schools and reviews policies that have been established by other districts. Part III describes a model for analyzing current computer use in schools, and discusses how this model can help a school board in understanding de facto  policy in their districts. The summary and recommendations list a number of characteristics of school computer use including utilization of computers without any stated policy; unequal distribution of computer resources due to economic differences; and initiation of computer acquisition by individuals, which complicates policy making. The conclusion calls for the adoption of a standard analytical tool--the distributional matrix--so that districts can compare their patterns of computer use.

The basis for the study is the realization that libraries, through automation, a changed philosophy about their role, and finance models, can possibly offer some solutions to the problems confronting them by extending and exploiting their information storage and retrieval and generalized information handling talents. The study comprises three sections: (1) a literature review designed to address the scope and range of current activities at other academic libraries; (2) a survey of representative libraries designed to elicit  their descriptions and comments on fee based services; and (3) a summary of conclusions, inferences, and remaining questions appropriate to the topic.

Many resources, especially in large academic libraries, are technically open to the public but arranged in a way that prevents shelf browsing according to the definition given. A historical perspective shows how librarians have reacted to ever growing space pressures and includes discussions of electronic publishing and microforms as a space solution, selection criteria for storage, housing and arranging the relegated materials, and degrees of speed of public access. To support the statement that stored resources should be shelved compactly in sized rather than in classed, or shelf-browsable  order, three points are developed: (1) an increasing proportion of academic library resources are already shelved in nonshelf-browsable order; (2) for more than a century academic library resources have been arranged according to a sliding scale of speed of public access; and (3) shelf browsing is an excellent retrieval device for a casual search but very unreliable for research purposes. Categories of materials that should remain in classed, shelf-browsable order are then listed. (Author/THC)",

AFP's goals in the area of bibliographic control included: inspecting all volumes identified in OSUL's general collections as potentially falling within project scope and integrating them with already identified items in OSUL's Division of Special Collections; systematically reviewing a broad range of bibliographic tools to enrich an already established card file of fiction of the period and to identify titles not held by OSUL;  and locating and purchasing titles not held. During the grant period, AFP cataloged on the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) database all titles acquired with project funds (4,500 books) and recataloged approximately 1,500 titles already owned by OSUL. Following a summary report, this document comprises the following sections: Introduction; Background of the American Fiction Project; The William Charvat American Fiction Collection; Rationale for a Bibliographic Data Base of American Fiction, 1901-1925; General Organization and Administration; Applications and Accomplishments--Bibliography; Applications and Accomplishments--Cataloging; Research Potential; and Future Work.

        "description":"This report describes a new automated process that pioneers full-scale operational use of subject switching by the NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) Scientific and Technical Information (STI) Facility. The subject switching process routinely translates machine-readable subject terms from one controlled vocabulary into the equivalent terms of another controlled vocabulary using a system called the NASA Lexical Dictionary (NLD). This report also describes the NLD, discusses how to build a lexical dictionary system, details the resources needed, and explains how to maintain the system after it is built. A description of the NASA STI Facility's experiences with their first input vocabulary, that of the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC), is included.  Following a preface and executive summary, this report is divided into seven sections: (1) introduction (purpose, significance, definition of the NASA Lexical Dictionary, scope of NLD, preliminary results, presentation, and project personnel); (2) system description; (3) history; (4) procedures for building a lexical dictionary; (5) data file maintenance; (6) results and conclusions; and (7) summary.

The study focused on students' primary goal for enrolling, whether that goal was achieved, reasons for withdrawal, current occupations, and plans for returning to JTCC. In addition to the 150 full-time students who dropped out between winter and spring 1985, 263 non-returning part-time students were also surveyed. Study findings, based on a 42% response rate, included the following: (1) proportionately, males tended to drop out at a higher rate than females; (2) a much greater proportion of black full-time students dropped out compared to their representation in the population; (3) Electronics,  Data Processing, Management, Business Administration, Human Services, and pending curriculum were the areas with the largest percentage of full-time dropouts; (4) full-time students tended to give \"pursuit of a degree, certificate, or diploma\" as their educational goal, while part-time students cited \"taking one or more job-related courses\"; (5) 70% of the respondents were working at the time of the survey; and (6) 77% of the former students planned to return to JTCC. Recommendations were developed based on study findings for reducing student attrition. Former student comments and the questionnaire are included. (Author/AYC)",

        "description":"This colloquium report presents four views on the future of student services in the two-year college. First, \"Student Development Philosophy: A Perspective on the Past and Future,\" by Terry O'Banion, discusses the origins of the student development profession, the emerging \"student development model,\" and the projected impact of the quality reformation, educational technology, finances, and the community college mission. Next, \"Student Development and College Services: A Consumer Perspective,\" by Ernest R. Leach, reviews the \"in loco parentis,\" student services, student development, and consumer models of student development and personnel services. In \"Student Developers--Partners in Student Success,\" Lee Noel and Randi Levitz define the roles of the student services professional  as the educational interpreter and the essential learning agent, contending that the key to attracting and retaining students is a focus on identifying and developing competencies for the information age. \"A President's Perspective on Effective Leadership in Student Services,\" by Paul A. Elsner, asserts that integration of student and instructional services will be a necessary ingredient to successful educational programs, suggesting that a human resources management philosophy holds promise for student development professionals. The concluding presentation, \"1984 Traverse City Statement: Toward the Future Vitality of Student Development Services,\" by John S. Keyser, reaffirms the philosophy and purpose of student development services in the two-year college, defines the major issues  facing the profession, and puts forth an agenda for local and national action.

        "description":"Recent research studies have focused on various ways of addressing the question of how much students learn in community colleges, focusing on factors such as transfer rates, job placement rates, and alumni satisfaction. Few studies, however, have attempted to directly confront the question of student learning, and few measures and tests are adequate to assess what knowledge is being gained by student cohorts. A study conducted by the Center for the Study of Community Colleges (CSCC) attempted to demonstrate that a measure of what community college students know can be obtained. The Center developed the General Academic Assessment (GAA) instrument to measure student knowledge in general education and the liberal arts. The GAA was administered to 8,026 students in 23 two-year  colleges, and additional information was obtained on students' age, aspirations, reasons for attending college, number of courses taken in disciplinary areas, total units completed, and self-assessment of knowledge. Study findings included the following: (1) student knowledge was related both to age and number of courses completed in a particular area; (2) age relationships showed up primarily in English usage, social sciences, and humanities, with older students having higher scores; (3) age-related differences did not occur in mathematics or science; (4) a direct relationship existed between the number of units completed and GAA scores; (5) highest scores were made by students attending college for personal interest; and (6) students' self-assessment of their knowledge showed high  correlations with their GAA scores. The study confirmed the usefulness of the GAA. (LAL)",

Academic preparation, a comprehension of language, and offical permission, as well as permission from the subject group, are then highlighted as important prerequisites in conducting field studies. The module also discusses moral and ethical questions  involved in conducting fieldwork, such as the researchers' responsibility for presenting a realistic account of current conditions among a population along with the more specific findings of the research. The next section focuses on the common tools and techniques of the anthropologist, including census taking and area mapping, interviews, kinship records, psychological tests, and video and audio recordings.

        "description":"Designed for use as supplementary instructional material in a cultural anthropology course, this learning module examines concerns that should be addressed when using ethnographic films to explore cross-cultural perspectives. Beginning with a brief discussion of the purpose of ethnographic films, the filmmaker's perspective is discussed, stressing the need for viewer analysis of how a culture has been portrayed. The module further asserts that since most ethnographic films provide incomplete information about sex and age roles, student viewers should be aware of the imbalanced presentation of those roles in many films. The cultural state (i.e., the overall status and position of a cultural group within the larger society) and the ethnographic present (i.e., the culture's  contemporary situation) are discussed as important aspects to be included in ethnographic films. Finally, the filmmaker's obligation to provide the viewer with information about special circumstances affecting the film's validity, and the educational usefulness of ethnographic films, are discussed.

This workshop leaders' guide offers suggestions for helping parents become more involved with their children's learning. Chapter 1 gives specific suggestions for planning, conducting, and evaluating workshops for parents. Chapters 2 through 10 give examples of workshop activities that focus on the following topics: children's attitudes toward learning, play, language, reading, writing, math, science, television, and problem solving. Each of these chapters is divided into sections concerning what parent workshops  achieve; often-raised questions; workshop displays; choosing workshop activities; and introducing and generating ideas for activities. Because each group of parents has different interests, concerns, and outlooks, each workshop leader will use the workbook differently to select activities suited to his or her particular group of parents, to modify activities, or to create new activities particularly suited to local parent concerns.

A promising line of research attributes the emergence of &quot;internal remembering strategies&quot; to formal schooling environments. Data gathered from 173 children in kindergarten through the third grade indicated that types of environmental differences perceived by the children were consistent with some of the causal dimensions proposed by schooling theorists. However, increasing evidence of strategic study and retrieval behavior in preschool children point up the limitations of schooling hypotheses. It is difficult to know how frequently and in what ways adults direct instructional activities to everyday memorization tasks with preschoolers, or  how systematic and persistent adults are in attempting to gradually transfer remembering responsibilities and strategy usage to their children. Research suggests that while mothers often refer to and demonstrate the use of adult-like strategies for remembering, they seldom persist in requiring the child to use the strategy to self-regulate recall. Nevertheless, even 2- and 3-year-olds are taught and expected to remember to perform simple recurring and prescheduled activities on a daily basis. Such experiences undoubtedly afford young children at least a rudimentary means-goal understanding of the recall function and may account for some of the strategy knowledge and use found in primary school students.

Part 1 of the study consisted of an analysis of the types of reversible actions two kindergarten children engaged in and the actions they wanted to engage in but could not because of the nature of the software program they used. Part 2 of the study consisted of an analysis of a number of software programs designed to be of educational value for children between the ages of 5 and 8 years in which the basic activity is the construction or creation of pictures on the monitor screen. Programs analyzed were Grandmas' House, Kids at Work, Kidwriter, Pic.Builder, Rainbow Painter, Stickers, Story  Maker, and StoryMaker. Analysis focused on the transformational activity related to the development of mental reversibility: negation; modifying of objects and their positions, movements, and arrangements; and the placing of objects into relationships through combining, separating and rearranging parts and wholes. After a brief review of the Piagetian concept of reversibility, results are discussed. Concluding remarks focus on characteristics of optimal &quot;constructive&quot; educational software. (RH)",

        "description":"Data obtained under naturalistic conditions do not support the notion of a close fit between the growth of geometric concepts during the concrete operational period and &quot;realism&quot; in art. Realism here refers to the ability to portray the objective proportions of a figure, to coordinate spatial relations and distances, and to represent a scene in perspective. Participants were 161 children of predominantly middle-class background, ranging in age from 3 to 13 years. From six alternatives, four drawing themes were specified by the examiner, and their order of presentation was randomized: A Family, A Birthday Party, Children Playing, A Garden with Trees, Flowers, and a Pond. The tasks were administered on an individual basis or in small groups of 2 to 3 children. The Revised  Compositional Scale (Golomb, 1983, 1984) was used to assess the spatial characteristics of the drawings and to identify compositional grouping principles. Where Piaget predicts a radical transformation in representational competence (perspective drawings), findings indicate some consolidation of skills and attention to specific aspects of figural differentiation, but spatial differentiation per se do not show the predicted transformation. Compositional strategies were found to be very much a function of the nature of the task and remained fairly simple for all ages and/or all tasks. The relationship Piaget proposed between drawing competence and spatial-geometrical constructs should be reassessed. (RH)",

The purpose of this study was to examine 4- to 7-year-olds' understanding of single turtle commands as transformations that connect turtle states and to characterize the nature of their misunderstanding. Children were introduced to a highly simplified turtle graphics environment that included four possible turtle orientations and four legal commands. Children were then shown events consisting of an initial turtle state, a command transformation, and the resulting turtle state. They were asked to indicate the key/command involved in each event. Most children systematically misunderstood the  commands. Younger ones associated each of the four commands with displacement in a particular direction and rotation to a particular orientation. Overall, most children performed much as Piaget's theory predicts. When the turtle rotated, they tended to focus on features of the final turtle state, ignoring both initial state and transformation information. When the turtle changed location, children seemed to attend to the transformation itself. Younger ones, however, tended to define the displacement from their own or the display screen's frame of reference rather than from the turtle's frame of reference. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"In a series of elicited production experiments, eight 3-year-olds and eight 4-year-olds were asked to explain three types of phenomenon: physical, psychological, and logical. Three main findings emerged from an analysis of the children's uses of the causal connectives, 'because' and 'so.' First, the children made very few errors in producing the causal connectives. Only 6 percent of the children's uses involved inversions of the cause-effect relationship. Second, the children's ability to use the causal connectives appropriately did not vary according to the type of phenomenon being explained. Third, the explanations were appropriate to the type of phenomenon being explained. For example, the children usually explained physical phenomena in terms of physical causality. Thus,  contrary to Piaget's claims (1929), the children did not tend to psychologize. Results are contrary to those of Piaget (1926, 1928, 1929, 1930) and also to those of several comprehension experiments (e.g., Corrigan, 1975; Kuhn and Phelps, 1976; Emerson, 1979). On the other hand, the present results are consistent with the results of Hood's (1977) production study. Possible reasons for the discrepancy in results are discussed with particular reference to the relationship between comprehension and production of language. (Author/RH)",

Evidence suggests that the way an organization is managed has considerable impact on the mental health of the people who work in it.

The manager's principal role is to maintain the status quo in an organization. Phases of school development make different demands on leaders. In pioneer and expansion stages, everyone's energies, talents, and resources are focused on the goal, the creation of the Montessori school. In the consolidation phase, curriculum richness becomes apparent in the classrooms and playspaces, and even the office area often boasts  of a copying machine. But have the teachers, who are not being provided subsistence level salaries, shared in this richness? At the present time insufficient numbers of potential teachers are entering training.

A script is defined as a model that specifies the roles and props appropriate to an event and identifies a sequence of acts for achieving the goal defined by the event. Two aspects of script knowledge were investigated: (1) the development of the ability to maintain the appropriate temporal order of events within a script and (2) the development of the ability to represent social roles within a script. The white, middle-class sample consisted of boys and girls from four age groups: 18, 22, 26, and 30 months of age. A total of nine action sequences was modelled for each child--three using a single doll as a passive recipient of action (bathing, eating, and  going to bed), three composed of nonmeaningful combinations of script sequences, and three using one doll as an independent agent and one as a passive recipient of action. All sequences were four acts in length. Several measures summarizing subjects' imitation task performance were scored. Results demonstrated that children as young as 18 months of age incorporate information about the temporal order of actions in their script knowledge of events. Few children demonstrated an understanding of differentiated role structures. Age differences were found, but these appeared to be more quantitative than qualitative in nature. (RH)",

The areas in the television advertising research which are addressed are: (1) the extent of television advertising directed to children; (2) the content of children's commercials and techniques used by advertisers to enhance the content; (3) the effects of television commercials on children's actual behavior; (4) the experimental manipulation of children's food preferences via television advertising; and (5) parent-child  conflict which is associated with television advertising. Attention is then turned to an examination of research on the experimental manipulation of delay of gratification and resistance to temptation. The effects of obervational learning on self-control are also considered.

        "description":"This review of research, part of the Illinois State Board of Education's Early Childhood Education Policy Study, focuses on issues related to potential state funding for full-day kindergarten and changes in the age at which children enter kindergarten. Specifically addressed are the following issues: (1) a review of the legislative background on initial school entry, (2) research on age as a factor related to successful school entry, (3) the effect of raising the school entry age, and (4) the application of delayed school entry age to Illinois children. Since chronological age is the most administratively convenient criterion used to determine eligibility for school entry, the first section on legislative background provides a table showing the variability of cut-off dates for  kindergarten entry for forty states. The second section dealing with research on age as a criterion for initial school entry argues for an acknowledgement that a child's developmental age may be different from his/her chronological age. Included in this section are discussions on delaying the child's entrance into school and on enrolling the child in school at a particular age. An extensive review of the research on entry age focuses on factors related to the prediction of initial academic success of children entering kindergarten or first grade. These factors include chronological age, sex differences, socioeconomic status, intelligence, preschool experiences, social adjustment, and birth order of children. The third section debates the issues of whether raising the age for initial  school entry helps to eliminate school failure by giving younger children a chance to mature. The final section identifies resultant problems stemming from delayed school age entry for Illinois children. The paper concludes that research literature does not support the raising of school entry age. (DST)",

This report, part of a comprehensive policy study of early childhood education, presents a review of the research on the effect of class size on student outcomes, including achievement and adjustment to school. Topics covered include the following: (1) child development theory, (2) class size research, (3) a review of practices in South Carolina, Florida, and Indiana (4) a review of current Illinois statutes and practices, and (5) a summary of the findings in terms of policy implications for the Illinois State Board of Education. A review of the mandates for class size in the School  Code of Illinois (1983) is given and tables provide comparisons between grades and types of programs. Data on kindergarten/primary class sizes of three selected states, South Carolina, Florida, and Indiana, is highlighted because of the different methods used in these states to achieve lower student/teacher ratios. A table in the appendix summarizes the recommended class sizes for kindergarten through third grade for all fifty states. In conclusion, this review shows that there is general agreement that at the primary grades smaller classses facilitate learning and that class size must be sufficiently small - at least below 20 - for significant benefits.

        "description":"Increasing numbers of parents, educators, and legislators have questioned whether half-day kindergarten schedules are adequate to prepare children for the first grade, particularly since full-day kindergartens are being offered in some public and nonpublic schools. This report, one of several background papers for a comprehensive policy study of early childhood education, identifies and defines the different types of kindergarten schedules being used in Illinois school districts and reviews research which identifies the effects that different types of schedules have on student outcomes, especially those related to achievement or readiness measures. Specifically addressed in the report is a comparison between half-day, alternate day, and full-day kindergarten programs. In  addition, the findings are summarized and discussed in terms of policy implications in Illinois. The report excludes issues of cost or facility. Half-day kindergartens predominate in Illinois; however, an examination of scheduling during recent years reveals an increase in participation in alternate day and full-day schedules. The 1984-85 data from the State Board of Education records show that 2,431 public schools operate a kindergarten program. Of these, approximately 87 are half-day, 5 are alternate day, and 8 are full-day programs. The summary reviews the advantages and disadvantages of each program with strong support being given to full-day schedules. Reasons for adoption of a full-day schedule are: to meet the needs of disadvantaged students or those not academically ready who can  benefit from extra preparation for first grade, to provide an enrichment program for advanced or gifted children, and to reduce transportation costs.

Following a description of the methodology used to obtain statistics as well as a brief explanation of the changing child care needs in our society, an extensive review of the statistics is delineated. Tables provide 1980 Illinois Census data in these areas: (l) estimated number of children under 12 years of age and percent of each group enrolled in school, (2) estimated amount of adult supervision required by children under the age of 12, (3)  cumulative estimates of numbers of families with children in selected age groups, and (4) presence of parents in labor force in families with children under 12 years of age. Based on the available data, projections are made for the number of children currently receiving custodial day care services and those receiving inadequate day care services as well as for child care arrangements for preschool age children. In addition, census data summaries provide the following conclusions: (l) increasing numbers of single-parent families and families in which both parents work have resulted in a need for child care services that are provided by adults other than the parents; (2) in 1980, over one and a half million Illinois children under 12 years required child care services; (3) in 1983, an  estimated quarter million families required child care services for children of preschool ages; and (4) the provision of quality child care and the environment in which this care is provided is of concern to parents and educators because of its influence on the children's future educational and social attainments.

        "description":"While most programs for prospective teenage parents address the obvious and immediate needs of the parents - prenatal care, nutrition, delivery, and financial assistance - the purpose of this paper, one of several reports forming a comprehensive policy study of early childhood education, is to identify the problems associated with teenage childbearing, review the research on teenage pregnancy, discuss intervention programs, and recommend additional intervention programs. It has been assumed that children of teenage mothers have more physical, emotional, and intellectual handicaps than do children born to older mothers. Until recently, few studies have analyzed the evidence related to this claim. Some current findings attempt to assess the impact of adolescent motherhood on  infants and young children. This review presents data regarding the demographics of teenage pregnancy. Specifically addressed are the problems associated with teenage childbearing: infant death risk, premature and low-birth-weight babies, Aid to Families With Dependent Children and other welfare assistance, and the education of the teenage parent. A review of the research related to the problems associated with teenage childbearing forms the second part of the paper, focusing on (1) economic and social consequences, (2) physical health consequences, and (3) emotional, developmental, and cognitive consequences. Also reported are the results of some intervention programs for teenage parents and their children. Recommendations are made for intervention programs in Illinois. Extensive 1982  data on Illinois teenage mothers are provided in tables throughout the paper. Two appendices provide listings and findings of research studies dealing with the outcomes of teenage pregnancies and the children of adolescent parents. (DST)",

        "author":["Helmich, Edith"],
        "description":"This report, one of several background papers for a comprehensive policy study of early childhood education, examines the effects of preschool experience on Illinois children from low income families. The 1980 U. S. Census for Illinois identified 81,959 preschool-age children (3 to 5 years old) from poverty-level families; 54 of these young children were not enrolled in a preschool program. A review of the literature in this paper focuses on factors which enable children to experience early success in school and which continue to have an effect on the quality of education a child receives in his later school years. Substantive descriptions of seven studies of preschool programs designed to serve children from low-income families are included. Highlighted are the outcomes of the  early 1965 Project Head Start, the Follow Through program study in 1982, the 1978 study for the Educational Testing Service of Head Start programs, Cornell University's Consortium for Longitudinal Studies report in 1978, the still ongoing Illinois model program for the Early Prevention of School Failure Project, the 1982 Philadelphia School District study, and the Perry Preschool Project of 1984. A summary of these studies reporting preschool effects on various age groups of low income children shows that, during the preschool years, children demonstrate improved intellectual capacity, i.e., higher I.Q. scores. These initial gains, while not sustained beyond the second grade, appear to inhibit special education placement and give the children a short-term advantage in academic success  during the first years of schooling. Throughout the elementary school years, the preschool participants demonstrate improved scholastic achievement and reduced frequency of special education placement. Finally, during the high school years and beyond, preschool participants have a lower rate of delinquency and/or criminal charges, a higher rate of high school graduation, and a higher rate of employment a year after graduation.

The single major issue discussed is our society's inclination to introduce children earlier and faster to academic expectations. A brief historical background is provided on early philosophical and pedagogical influences on the development of kindergarten curriculum in the U.S. Five current approaches to the kindergarten curriculum are identified and compared; namely, traditional kindergarten, the Montessori method, behavior analysis, direct instruction, and  Piagetian programs. Four reasons for the shift in emphasis from a developmental curriculum to an academic curriculum are discussed. These reasons are as follows: (1) a greater emphasis on kindergarten attendance as the beginning point in school, (2) increased societal pressure to provide academic instruction at an early age, (3) increased use of standardized achievement and screening tests which tend to emphasize outcomes of formal instruction, and (4) lack of appropriate early childhood education training for kindergarten teachers. Next, the controversies related to the shift in emphasis are delineated. Finally, research on the kindergarten curriculum is described pointing to a conclusion that, while studies show that children can learn a great deal at very early ages, it can also be  shown that some learning will not occur if children are not developmentally ready. Also included in the paper is a table comparing the two curricular orientations from the standpoint of five criteria: teacher, pupils, activities, materials, and expectations. (DST)",

The review of studies and rating scales focuses on the following areas: the variability of children's behavioral reactions to starting school; specific areas of behavior indicative of how well children adjust: personal emotional adjustment, social adjustment, and attitudes and behavior in response to the intellectual demands of the school (cognitive/verbal, and general cognitive); comparisons of children with nursery school experience and children without  nursery school experience; identification of children's problems of adjustment; and the effect on children's adjustment of school policies on when and how children enter school. Data suggest that (1) knowing the types of behavior to expect as well as the problems of adjustment constitutes a first step in developing home and school strategies to help reduce stress and provide a smooth transition, and (2) school policies should be examined and evaluated in terms of the effects they have on children's adjustment. The following strategies are recommended for handling problems of adjustment: (1) development of handbooks/guidebooks for parents and teachers; (2) more formal instructional programs for teachers; and (3) development of a statewide educational policy.

Emphasis is given to the role of cognition in the theory of emotion. The nature of cognition is discussed in terms of (1) the &quot;primacy&quot; of emotion versus cognition; (2) knowledge by acquaintance versus knowledge by description; (3) cerebral lateralization and cognition; and (4) the interaction of syncretic and analytic cognition. The discussion explores the role of language in controlling behavior. Subsequent discussion differentiates self-as-acquaintance and self-as-description; interprets Rogers' self theory and Kelly's theory of personal constructs; and explores the implications of the foregoing for  attribution theory. Distinctions are made between purposive and reactive attribution and self cognitions, body cognitions, and environmental cognitions.

Reported are conclusions from a series of three studies carried out in 15 Israeli kindergartens. Data for the first two studies were collected in non-participant observations, audio-recordings, and semi-structured interviews with teachers. Analyses showed how, within the broader confines of teachers' planned schedules, children exercised discretion over the sounds they made, their movements, and uses of time and space. The ways in which children collectively exercise discretion defined the age-group as a social category and as a group with self-propelled interests different from those of the socializing adults. The third study included interviews  with kindergarten teachers and children to elicit accounts of their experiences. Teachers' accounts reflected their educational intentions. Children's accounts showed them to be (1) cognizant of the teachers' schedules; (2) interested in and able to talk about the activities that they themselves initiated; and (3) aware of being part of a group that has a place in the kindergarten environment. It is suggested that the discrepancies between the accounts of chldren and adults are best explained as a latent consequence of how performances are structured in kindergartens. (Author/RH)",

RERSC was funded by the University and the College of Education, staffed by a half-time director and a fourth-time secretary, and governed by an 18-member board representing the university and member public schools. Seven area schools were selected to join RERSC on the basis of proximity to  campus, dimension of ruralness, existing relationships with school officials, access to grade K-12 schools with supervising principals, and future access to small schools with teaching principals. A 4-year school effectiveness study of 100 area rural schools was planned. Eighteen research/service project proposals totaling $5,003 were accepted and funded. During the 1984-85 school year, 63 student teachers were placed in rural schools for pre-service teacher education field experiences. One-day workshops on ethnographic techniques in educational research and field-based research design were sponsored. (NEC)",

An ex post facto approach was used in the validation of the assessment procedure which included subject testing, parent interviews, and teacher checklists. Five experts reviewed the assessment data. The investigation did not produce any recommendations on evaluation measures that appeared to be more viable than others in discriminating differences in the language disordered and non-language disordered bilingual child. The findings demonstrated the  complexity of attempting to develop and validate a procedure and the obvious need to establish some validity in the diagnosis of language disorders in Spanish/English bilingual children.

The 100 rural counties with the highest poverty rates were located in south and southwestern United States and shared certain characteristics when compared with the 100 rural counties having the lowest poverty rate. These characteristics were: more likely to lose population, more rural persons, small total population, lower population density, higher proportion of nonwhites, more families headed by women, larger families, greater work-disabled population, higher poverty rates for  elderly, lower levels of formal education, lower per capita personal income, lower average family median income, lower employment rates, predominance of low wage jobs, larger share of self-employment, and greater share of earnings from farming and government employment. Although farms were larger in high poverty rate counties, market value of farm sales compared with poverty rates suggested skewed distribution of wealth and income. Knowing these characteristics can help public officials develop successful antipoverty programs. Supporting graphs and tabular information drawn from federal source data are included.

Previous Alaskan distance education programs had been criticized as &quot;second class&quot; compared to traditional on-campus programs. To assure quality control equivalent to the campus program, the project emphasized human contact and uniform evaluation criteria. Telecommunications systems--videocassette, audiocassette, teleconferencing--as well as site visits by faculty, student presentations, and weekly student meetings facilitated human interaction. Student assignments were graded by the same criteria as on-campus student work. Seven of 10 courses required for  certification in special education were offered and students also attended on-campus summer school. Approximately 12 students enrolled at each of 3 remote sites. Seven students completed the certification program, 12 subsequently completed the program on campus, and 12 applied their credits to other programs. The distance education program required more faculty time and effort than the on-campus program, students needed more individual and group support, and technological problems and lack of student skills in using the technology had unexpected potential to disrupt training.

Servicing districts that average fewer than 2 people per square mile, 21 elementary schools have only 1 teacher. Sixteen high schools have enrollments of less than 100. Curricula in remote schools is limited, depending on resourcefulness of teachers, administrators, and community members to fill gaps from lack of art, music, counseling, physical education, library, or vocational specialists. Alternative strategies for remote schools include multigrade arrangements, itinerant services, assistance from multi-school principals, employment of paraprofessionals, and rotating  diagnostic-prescriptive services. Use of computers and video tapes is increasing but remote areas lack access to televison/satellite transmission. Mildly/moderately handicapped children are mainstreamed while severely handicapped are unserved or institutionalized. Teachers must be &quot;competent generalists,&quot; with skills in individualizing instruction for all students. Teachers either spend a lifelong career or only 1 or 2 years in remote schools. Despite teacher benefits including housing subsidies and isolation salary bonuses, districts cannot always fill positions. Teacher training, retraining, and inservice needs are extensive and are beginning to be addressed by the Nevada Rural School Alliance, formed in 1983. (NEC)",

        "description":"In addition to presenting a brief picture of the public school administrator on an Indian reservation, this digest identifies some issues and problems, suggests ways for administrators to deal with those problems, and provides possible resources which can be of assistance. After citing public school enrollment at 176,000 Indian students attending 800 public schools on or near reservations, special challenges faced by the administrator are described. Some challenges include the additional responsibilities of working on or near reservations, isolation of some communities, staffing problems due to isolation, community interaction and communication, integration of language and cultural education into the regular curriculum, understanding the impact of federal policy, and  understanding tribal policy. Educational standards, funding, public relations, staffing, and student attendance are identified as major issues. Recomendations emphasize analyzing these issues from educational, economic, political, and cultural perspectives. Special resources available are cited including the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Department of Education, national organizations, journals, the ERIC Clearinghouse on Rural Education and Small Schools, and the Bilingual Clearinghouse.

The need for long-term solutions is discussed. Five action-oriented steps to attract Hispanic high school graduates into the teaching profession include identifying talented Hispanic high school students, developing their interest in teaching, locating and engaging &quot;master&quot; teachers, arranging significant student-teacher contact, and providing incentives for students to participate in special programs. Adaptations of recommendations by Franz, Aldridge, and Clark are also listed. Short-term solutions are listed, e.g., providing readily available opportunities for  recertification, offering improved working conditions, offering teachers financial assistance during additional years of college preparation, providing summer jobs in industry, recruiting part-time instructors from other segments of society, and borrowing skilled professionals from industry. Options for financing programs for youths in teacher education programs and for Hispanic teachers currently employed or underemployed are presented. (PM)",

        "description":"The issue of providing public education for undocumented students (children of foreign-born persons who reside and/or work in the United States without proper permission from immigration authorities) is receiving current attention for two major reasons: (1) fear that the financial burden on local taxpayers will increase in areas with increasing concentrations of undocumented students; and (2) Supreme Court declaration that Section 21.031 of Title I of the Texas Education Code, which denies reimbursement of funds to local school districts for educating undocumented children, is unconstitutional. While Texas estimates $85 million a year is spent to educate undocumented students and Los Angeles estimates annual expenditures of $415 million, the question of the actual cost of  educating undocumented students continues because most states lack actual enrollment figures. The cost of developing and implementing programs for undocumented children depends upon district characteristics (numbers of students, taxable property per pupil, teacher linguistic characteristics, presence of programs for limited-English-speaking students, pupil-teacher ratios, historical enrollment patterns, status of physical facilities, and proximity to migration streams used by undocumented persons) and student characteristics (numbers, age dispersion, geographic dispersion, English fluency, prior educational experiences, length of presence in this country, and socioeconomic status).

Other federal, state, local, and private sector agencies that have traditionally served the poor, disadvantaged, and other special-need populations could also serve migrant students. Potential sources include the amended Chapter I and Chapter II of TItle I ESEA; Title VII ESEA bilingual funds; 27 federal agencies listed in the Federal Catalog of Domestic Programs as having funding priorities for migrants; states' Title I set-aside monies; state agencies for  employment, training, health and human services, and agriculture; and local service agencies funded by economic development block grant monies or United Way dollars. Tapping private sector resources requires appropriate long range, coordinated planning and sustained effort including the following six steps; identifying alternative funding sources using tools like the Foundation Directory; researching sources to identify common interests; determining how to approach the source; cultivating new sources; acknowledging sources for past services on similar populations; and thanking sources for donated time and effort.

Outdoor education can enrich, vitalize, and complement all content areas of school curriculum by means of first-hand observation and direct experience out-of-doors. School grounds, regardless of locale, can afford learning opportunities. This publication discusses the need for and focus of outdoor education, outlines six school ground activities adaptable to any elementary grade level, and provides specific language arts, social studies, science, health, mathematics, art, and  music projects for each outdoor activity. The outdoor activities include: marking shadows at different time intervals; collecting insects and other animals; observing the flagpole; observing a partly cloudy sky; and observing birds near feeders or shrubs. Interdisciplinary activities suggested from a visit to the school parking lot include composing words from license plate letters, determining distances to capital cities of states represented by cars in the parking lot, suggesting parking lot safety rules, computing parking lot size, designing a car using basic shapes and colors, and composing a song or rhythmic reading.

Good staff development programs should incorporate a broad definition of staff development, ensure that relevant personnel at all levels  are trained, develop partnerships to secure additional resources, and use low cost or free staff development tools. Effective rural staff development practices are use of system-wide models, use of specific technological appproaches to meet special needs, and focus on individual teacher needs.

Principals were asked to indicate which of 105 courses listed on the questionnaire were in their school's curriculum and to rate the need for courses not offered. Responses were received from 319 principals in 46 states for a return rate of 67.2 percent. Findings suggest that the core curriculum in most small high schools would allow for the 4 years of English, 3 years each of mathematics and science, and one-half year of computer literacy recommended by the National Commission on Excellence in Education. The recommended 3 years of social studies might be difficult to obtain,  and the 2 years of foreign language recommended for college bound students would definitely be difficult to obtain in small high schools. Principals indicated a need for courses in word processing, data processing, computer programming, remedial reading, speech, computer literacy, computer mathematics, first aid and safety, geography, creative writing, and consumer economics. Of special interest, foreign language, advanced placement, and agriculture courses were not ranked among the most needed courses. (JHZ)",

National statistics now indicate that out of 10 Hispanic students in the 8th grade, about 5 will receive a high school diploma but only 1 will have completed an academic program in school which prepared the student for college admission and the pursuit of a professional career. Students, parents, guidance counselors, teachers, and principals should be acutely aware that the decision to take or not to take elementary algebra in junior high is a crucial, hard-to-reverse decision that adds up to a predisposing pattern. Stereotypic thinking leading to the assumption that Hispanic children  probably will want to embark on vocational or general curricula must be changed. Programs such as Options for Excellence, conducted in San Antonio, Texas, by the College Board from 1981-1984, have been successful in identifying able high school students whose abilities and talents were not being fully recognized, instilling a sense of optimism and self confidence, and raising the educational sights and expectations of students, parents, and schools.

        "description":"The issue of accidental environmental contamination of homes and businesses has been of increasing concern. Actual costs to state and federal governments for relocation of persons and restoration of habitats have run into the tens of millions of dollars. In addition to these real costs, there have been more illusive costs to public health. These costs are found both in increased levels of negative physiological and psychological effects. The two sources thus far identified as causes of these effects are toxic agents and stress. Since, up to this point, research has focused upon toxic agents, this paper addresses issues related to the effects of stress. Adult residents (N=396) living adjacent to the only Class I sanitary landfill in southern California participated in a survey  which asked for demographic information (including educational levels), health-related information (such as frequency of colds and sleep problems), and questions about stress-related issues (demoralization, current upset, perceived threat to physical health, attitude toward quality of life, and trust in authorities). Although significant correlations were noted (such as between educational level and demoralization), overall results suggest that while a toxic waste receiving landfill generates some degree of stress, it is insufficient to produce recognizable levels of behavioral effects.

The Wait Timer, an unobtrusive indicator of wait time, is an automatic device that activates a light when a person speaks. The duration of the light at the end of a question, response, or other pause can be regulated to control wait time length. The effects of using the Wait Time was noted to be enhanced by a supportive intervention process that employed analyses of tape recordings of classroom discussions. Through studies, it has been determined that effective use of wait time can result in spontaneous improvements in both cognitive and affective variables in the classroom. These changes are greater if wait time  information is supplemented by supportive intervention from persons who have studied tape recordings of interactions from the teachers' classrooms. It appears that monitoring wait times using an electronic device accompanied by skilled analyses of tape recordings and supportive intervention do provide an avenue for the improvement of teaching skills.

Major areas considered were: (1) the concerns that UCLA/SEAS Industrial Associates (IA) have relative to the content and development of the UCLA/SEAS curriculum; (2) SEAS faculty concerns regarding impact of increased IA contributions on the content and development of the SEAS curriculum; and (3) evidence that faculty cite as negative curricular effects of  increased corporate giving through the IA program. Among the findings (obtained from analyses of interviews and such documents as contract reports and minutes of various meetings) are those indicating that although both groups expect curricular change, SEAS faculty do not expect to implement change at the pace expected by the IA representatives, that IA organizations must more clearly define the nature and purpose of their relationship with SEAS, and that the IA liaison is appointed more often by role in the IA organization than by school affiliation.

The factors were compared in six families: General, Numerical, Reasoning, Spatial, Verbal, and Mathematical. Eleven data sets were reanalyzed, with principal factor analysis followed by graphical rotation to oblique, simple structure. Higher-order analyses followed the same procedure; the entire structure was then orthogonalized and the results compared to each other and to the original results. A partial hierarchical structure of mathematical abilities appeared. Overall, reasoning abilities were closely associated with mathematics achievement, while numerical and spatial abilities were associated with only certain aspects of mathematics achievement and verbal  abilities were only minimally associated. Evidence was found for a kind of mathematical factor. Among the findings of the reanalyses was that fluid- and crystallized-intelligence abilities were closely associated with mathematics achievement. The variance for each factor was ascertained; collectively, the factors in the reanalyses accounted for about 50% of the variance, most of which represented the relationship of mathematical abilities to general cognitive abilities. Appended is the pool of selected studies and a chart of families of factors. (MNS)",

Data from three ten-item instruments (included in appendices) were analyzed for 517 subjects in grades 9, 11, first-year calculus, and fourth-year engineering; and professional engineers in Vancouver, British Columbia. Covariates were computing experience and past  algebraic achievement. Most subjects (93.6%) demonstrated competence in the regular notation algebra tasks. Both subjects using propositional referents and those using surface cues in syntactic decision making were generally successful (91.0%) at the five simple nonce algebra items, but complex nonce algebra items were more difficult (66.3% was the mean percentage correct). Close nonce notation was significantly more difficult than spaced nonce notation. Variation among respondents was substantial, and individual differences are extensively discussed, as are implications for research. (MNS)",

Each group received two 30-minute periods of instruction on writing and solving number sentences and writing number sentences to represent word problems. The Noncanonical group was introduced to all six basic open sentence types, while the Canonical group was introduced only to the one for addition and the one for subtraction in which the unknown is to the right of the equals sign. Children were then given  two 12-item tests, on one of which they were instructed to write a number sentence for the problem and to solve the problem; on the second test, they only had to write a number sentence for the problem. Results suggest that most first graders are limited to direct symbolic representations of word problems.

It is based on previous work by Hunt and Lansman (1983), who developed a model of problem solving that could reproduce the data obtained with several attention and performance paradigms, extending production-system notation to time-constrained problem solving. Four college students were required to do mental arithmetic rapidly, keeping track of the running total of a visually presented series of numbers using base three (to keep the task from being fully automated). From time to time, they had to deal with an interruption and then return to the arithmetic task. The students generally, but not always, managed to remember the things they needed to remember, and  often became aware of an error after making it, indicating there was a good deal of self-monitoring of behavior. The problem solver's internal control of information seems to be an essential part of real-time problem solving. These processes were reflected in the simulation model, which is described in detail.

        "description":"This report explains an evaluative study of the conceptual and affective development of students associated with the Floating Lab Program, an experiential field project sponsored by the University of New Hampshire and the Maine Sea Grant Program. The field program involved an opportunity for students to have hands-on experiences aboard a 65-foot vessel outfitted with various kinds of oceanographic sampling equipment. Students and teachers operate equipment, collect samples, and record data. An assessment of this experience was made with 20 eighth grade students. Modified clinical interviews that incorporated concept mapping and concept propositional analysis were administered pre- and post-trip. Results indicated that students interviewed exhibited an increase in marine science  concepts and values toward coastal zone resources. The report includes a number of knowledge and value claims and recommendations for teachers, program developers and researchers. (ML)",

A cooperative study program based on the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization's (Unesco) program, Man and the Biosphere, was undertaken by faculty and undergraduates of SFS and personnel from the Virgin Islands National Park Service. This report reviews the methods, materials and results of the research project at Great Lameshur Bay on St. John's Island. Base-maps of marine habitats along the reef were constructed from aerial photographs. The maps were used in ground-truthing to determine the species and substrate composition for each area specified in the aerial  photographs. Qualitative and quantitative data were obtained from five transects along the reef. Findings on species distribution are summarized in tables and the five dominant species are identified in depth profile graphs. It is indicated that the methodology used is suitable and appropriate for any team of easily trained technicians in other marine environments and that it is also inexpensive and requires a relatively small amount of time for training and implementation of the project.

The experimental group, also with about 25 students, contained students in Term I who were primarily self-identified as &quot;math-anxious&quot; and received counseling throughout the term in addition to the standard lectures. No significant difference was found between scores on the final examination, a standard college-wide test. The two groups performed about equally throughout the term. However, some success for counseling was indicated by the fact that even though  experimental students had a lower grade point average, more control group students actually failed the course.

Policies for programs and practices are outlined in the third chapter. A conceptual framework for a human ecological perspective in biology education is included. The framework provides (in table format) a list of topics with related concepts and teaching examples. The fourth and fifth chapters are both the major portion and the most practical  components of the monograph. An exclusive review of curriculum materials is provided in the fourth chapter.

        "description":"This information bulletin reviews the research literature on blacks and mathematics. The amount of research that focuses specifically on race differences in mathematics in an attempt to explain and lessen those differences is small. Research of the past ten years indicates that black students, when compared to white students, take fewer mathematics courses and achieve at a significantly lower level, although the differences are growing smaller. Some factors which may explain why these differences exist are presented, with the focus on race, gender, and social class. A model relating these factors is presented and described. The review of the literature concerns societal influences, teacher attitudes, school mathematics curricula, student attitudes and student achievement-related  behaviors, classroom processes, and student achievement. Following the concluding summary, in which directions for future research are also noted, an extensive list of references is included. (MNS)",

An item analysis was performed for a random sample of 6,439 students (approximately 10%).

Sinclair is an example of deep or new critics of education who deal with more than surface blemishes and relate school criticism to deeper social issues like justice. In 1922 Sinclair conducted personal interviews with educators throughout the United States. He called public attention to root problems in schooling, academic freedom, and corporate society through a rough journalistic style and muckraking. For example, Sinclair's book &quot;The Goose-step&quot; is filled with straightforward comments on specific colleges where he identified linkages to industrialists and cozy relations between big business and academia. Sinclair identified specific industrialists and  capitalists as behind-the-scene manipulators of higher education. This basic criticism of capitalist greed and manipulation as detrimental to education is also a theme common to current deep critics of education. Current critics can learn much from Sinclair. They should conduct another cross-country personal study today and report their findings using Sinclair's clear and straightforward identification of evils. (RM)",

In colonial America women shared the economic responsibilities of family livelihood with their husbands and were engaged primarily in the production of food and clothing. Early 19th century America saw a redefinition of the social and economic spheres of men and women. For white Americans, a sentimentalizing of the home led to a decrease in women's economic activity while black women continued to play a major role in agricultural production. The necessity of competing with foreign manufacturers led to the demand for cheap factory labor, which in turn led to the employment of women in the latter half of the 19th century. This factory work typically provided a limited range of jobs under  poor working conditions. Like manufacturing, commerce and the entertainment industry also gave employment to women in the late 1800's, while the beginning of the era of science at the end of the 1800's led to female employment in data processing. Throughout the 1800's, several occupations were considered properly female, including health care and teaching. (LP)",

Gilligan's research indicates that the formation of self based on connection with others and an orientation to care (connected self) is associated primarily with women. The RSI survey consists of 27 items arranged in four scales: (1) the Connected Self scale; (2) the Self Care from Need scale; (3) the Primacy of Other Care (POC) scale; and (4) the Self and Other Care Chosen Freely scale. The RSI survey was completed by 526 adult women, ages 21 to 85, most with a high school education or less. The Inventory was found to reliably measure Gilligan's model. Ninety percent of the respondents reported that the  Connected Self scale was self-descriptive, and 60 percent indicated their care orientation was described by the POC scale. Consistent with Gilligan's model, the POC scale was self-descriptive of the older (42-85) rather than the younger (21-41) women. Homemakers (48 percent) were less likely than other respondents to be described by the Self Care from Need scale and the Self and Other Care Chosen Freely scale. (Author/RM)",

To encourage creative thinking, teachers must provide students with divergent problems, i.e., problems that are expansive, allow for a variety of responses, and have no fixed answers. Teachers must cultivate a classroom environment that encourages creativity. The understanding must be developed among students that there are times when free thinking is appropriate. The creative climate fosters an openness and respect for unusual questions and ideas, an understanding that all ideas have value, and an opportunity to learn and perform without constant threat of evaluation. Almost any museum object--from an ordinary  light bulb to an African tribal mask--can be used in divergent activities. Slides and/or reproductions may serve as substitutes for the actual object. Divergent activities using museum objects can help students develop many kinds of thinking, including thinking that is fluent, flexible, original, and elaborative. (RM)",

Nobel was a 19th century Swedish industrialist who was fluent in six languages. He invented dynamite. At his death in 1896, his estate amounted to $9,200,000. His will stipulated that the income from his estate should be divided annually into five equal parts and distributed as prizes to those who during the preceding year had conferred the greatest benefit on mankind. The fields embraced by the prizes reflect Nobel's personal interests: physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, and peace. The Nobel Foundation was organized as legatee and administrator of the Nobel fund capital, while the various bodies named in the will agreed to award the prizes. The Bank of  Sweden, at its tercentenary in 1968, instituted a Prize in Economic Sciences, pledging an annual amount to the Nobel Foundation equal to one of the regular Nobel Prizes. Candidates for the Nobel Prizes must be proposed by qualified individuals or groups. Special committees examine the proposals and announce the winners in mid-October of each year.

Students did show some improvement in logical reasoning from grade to grade. No significant sex differences were found in overall reasoning ability. Nor were correlations found between reasoning ability and academic achievement. However, clear differences were found between educational strata within the school, e.g., science was found to encourage a critical spirit. The Jamaican students scored much lower than  a group of U.S. students taking the same test. Reasons for the noticeable differences in level of performance may be due to a number of factors, including lack of resources in Jamaican schools and the inadequate knowledge and skills of many teachers, especially at the elementary level. Some important facts that teachers need to be taught about logical reasoning are suggested. (RM)",

        "description":"Trends in pre-college philosophy teaching are discussed. Today philosophy, especially at the elementary level, is becoming fashionable. Research has shown that even minimal training in philosophy improves students' reading and mathematical abilities as well as general skills such as reasoning and creativity. A study examining the formal training and attitudes of teachers of pre-college philosophy showed that many were already engaged in teaching pre-college philosophy in their own sense of what counts as philosophy. Teachers with significant preparation in academic philosophy recognized that philosophy is a distinct academic discipline requiring formal training. Certified teachers with little philosophy preparation did not recognize it as being significantly different from  history or social studies. Studies have shown that there is a variability in student outcomes associated with teacher preparation. If pre-college philosophy is to succeed, teachers need formalized training, and all educators must be taught to recognize what counts as philosophy. (RM)",

The report discusses how the program defines talent; how gifted students are identified for program participation; the role that creative thinking plays in child development; the integrative model of education used; educational strategies used to develop creative thinking from the four perspectives of perception, affect, cognition, and behavior; course content; and program evaluation. The program offers skill based courses in visual perception, exploration of sound and movement, communication, and learning and thinking  skills. Also offered are a series of optional workshops in different art disciplines, including drama, dance, music, and film. In some experimental sessions professional artists and teachers worked with the students. Concepts and ideas initiated by students are explored through sensory stimulation, creative problem solving, and reflection. Both teachers and students rated the program very highly. (RM)",

Skills are not simply habits which, once learned, become automatic. True skill involves care, vigilance, and criticism. A skilled performance, for example, is one which can be adjusted to changing circumstances. Learning skills is in fact an important part of creativity. (LP)",

Curriculum development in Israel is moving from a centralized approach to greater involvement of teachers in the process. This study was undertaken to raise the sensitivity of curriculum developers and teachers to factors in the curriculum materials that may shape the nature of that interaction. The instrument uses four major categories for analysis: (1) information about developers' considerations and deliberations regarding curricular decisions; (2) expected involvement of teachers as partners in the curriculum enterprise; (3)  teachers' professional credibility in the developers' eyes; and (4) teachers' assigned role in instruction. The analysis revealed an image of Israeli teachers as consumers of centrally developed curricula, who are expected to exercise limited autonomy in curriculum implementation, mainly in choice making. The main responsibility assigned to teachers in these projects is to organize instruction so as to achieve curriculum objectives. (RM)",

Equity cannot be achieved until equality is expected and until the contributions of all women are understood and accepted as a simple matter of fact. The unit contains six lessons based on biographies of women, past and present. They were chosen to represent the many ways women work as members and leaders of their communities. The women are Abigail Adams, Sarah Winnemucca, March Fong Eu, Shirley Chisholm, and Carmen Delgado Votaw, representing major ethnic groups, and Helen Keller, representing disabled Americans. Lessons also help students explore the concept of leadership. Each unit begins with  a biography that the teacher is to read to students. Discussion questions, suggestions for class activities, and a student worksheet follow each biography. Students participate in class discussions, write short stories, conduct research, listen to guest speakers, and create advertisements. A bibliography of additional resources on each woman concludes the unit. (RM)",

The program focuses on development of teaching skills for successful classroom experiences. Major components of the program are basic studies, research knowledge, and professional education. Performance competencies of interns in the MAT program were assessed through their supervisors' responses to the Teacher Assessment Instruments. Students in  the MAT program scored significantly higher in two of the three areas tested, namely, teaching plans and materials and classroom procedures. The students' scores in the third area, interpersonal skills, were high before they entered the MAT program, and scores in this area did not significantly increase after internship.

The experiences of particular seventh-grade science teacher are described, with focus on the teacher's expectations of students, or herself and of problems, her use of humor as a coping mechanism, her expectations of feedback and evaluation, and her fear of developing an attitude of cynicism. Issues raised from the teacher's experience concerned preparing teachers for the  realities of teaching, providing a nondidactic learning experience for teachers, and training teachers to use evaluation techniques and opportunities, including self-evaluation.

In a summary of the ideas set forth in these papers, a new agenda for education is proposed. Among the recommendations made are: accrediting Master Teachers  to foster quality teaching, restoring educational choice to parents through tuition tax credits, establishing English as the sole teaching language, and allowing parents to deduct tuition from their taxes. All contributors recommend the elimination of centralization of educational direction at the federal level where, it is maintained, it falls into the hands of special interest groups and loses its ability to adapt to the diverse schooling needs of local communities throughout the United States.

There are many different opinions regarding what preservice teachers should reasonably be expected to know and minimum conditions they should establish for classroom management. However, two outcomes of teacher preparation appear essential. First, the teacher education curriculum should include the teaching of disciplining methods, with focus on keeping students on-task. Second, prospective teachers should be taught to help students learn a repertoire of positive problem solving strategies geared to the appropriate grade level. To be able to achieve these outcomes, prospective teachers must know how to reach three specific objectives: (1) foster student involvement; (2)  focus student attention on learning; and (3) serve as positive role models. Although teachers should work toward dealing with behavioral problems to foster growth toward self-discipline, teachers must also realize that misbehavior is a part of classroom life. (CB)",

In-depth case studies were made of six universities and six school districts. Data were collected by interviews (n=180) with deans, professors, placement officers, education students, administrators, principals, and teachers in the school systems. The study highlighted the fact that the present teacher labor market remedies such as career ladders and incentive pay plans do not address the significant variables of: (1) teacher recruiting methods by school systems and universities; (2) mobility patterns of teachers; (3) characteristics of teachers sought by school  systems; (4) expectations, life styles, and attrition of teachers; (5) working conditions in the schools; and (6) teacher role-modeling for public school students. It is pointed out that school systems vary widely in the needs of their students and what they expect of teachers. Differences between rural and urban school systems are noted, and policy recommendations are made for recruiting and holding teachers suitable to the needs and expectations of school systems. (JD)",

In this field experiment on classroom management, experimental group teachers (n=18) and control group teachers (n=20) in four content areas received a manual and attended two workshops at the beginning of the school year. Extensive classroom observation of both groups provided a basis for assessing implementation of recommended management practices. The effects of the use of the recommended practices on student cooperation and task engagement were also assessed. Additional research questions investigated relationships between management behaviors and student behavior criteria and assessed impact of several context variables on management  outcomes. Based on observations in the first two months of school, significant treatment effects were obtained in most of the nine areas of management addressed in the training materials and workshops. Treatment group teachers used the recommended management practices significantly more and established classes with more appropriate, task-oriented student behavior. Results provided evidence of the effectiveness of most of the recommended management practices, and suggest that research-based teacher education on classroom management could help many teachers establish better learning environments in junior high and middle school classes.

States are implementing large-scale statewide programs, funding pilot projects, or funding the local development of performance-based incentive programs. A survey in August 1984 showed several different approaches states used to develop these programs. While the states' responses varied, the questions to be resolved are similar: Will statewide or locally developed plans be adopted? Who will be included--teachers and/or administrators? How will teachers be evaluated? What about funding? Will teachers receive incentives in the first year of the program, or will the pay incentives and,  therefore, major state funding be phased in after two or three years? This publication includes an updated version of the 50-state survey and provides an analysis of the emerging trends in developing and refining plans, implementing programs, and some early observations about intended and unintended outcomes of performance-based incentive programs. A state-by-state summary of 1985 state actions on career ladders is given. (JD)",

Each step is claimed to affect the next, and the demonstration addresses the truth of each of these claims. This booklet is intended to help the teacher examine the effects of training efforts in ways that lead to convincing demonstration of their effects. Outlines are presented on the following topics: (1) questions and answers about demonstrating  effects; (2) evidence that demonstrates effects; (3) planning the demonstration of effects; (4) judging the evidence; (5) a model for demonstrating training effects; (6) measurement issues in demonstrating effects; and (7) sources and resources on demonstrating effects.

This paper describes procedures used to select successful teachers within classroom groups having students with equivalent cognitive entry skills. It then compares the classroom situations and teaching strategies of the two successful teachers with the other teachers. The analysis indicated that gain in mathematics achievement in these two classes could not be attributed to differences in students' home background, class size, number of mathematics lessons per week, or teacher workload. However, the profiled teachers used different teaching strategies than their  colleagues. One used an extremely organized approach to teaching wherein material was taught until mastered, thereby reducing the need to review work frequently. The other used an approach emphasizing the presentation of material followed by extensive practice in applying the material to new situations. Although both teachers placed emphasis on new material rather than on review, there were differences between their teaching practices. These differences reflected the success of both teachers in diagnosing the particular abilities of their students and adopting appropriate teaching strategies. (JD)",

        "description":"Several studies have shown an improvement in the performance of motor skills following imagined performance of the skill, or &quot;mental practice.&quot; One unresolved issue has centered on whether the effect being observed is in fact a practice effect. As one alternative, the effect may be a simple instance of planning when to use a skill, or deciding in advance what strategy to select. Alternatively, the possibility has been noted that mental practice may have its effects by influencing motivational factors, and not by exercising some component of the skill. A report is given of an experiment in which the procedures used by G. Nigro in 1983 to study imagined practice were replicated. The Nigro study reported that attempts to manipulate motivation make no difference in the effectiveness  of imagined practice on dart throwing, whereas the content of the practice does. The results of that study appeared to eliminate motivation accounts and simultaneously to begin a specification of the relevant content of mental practice. A description is given of the experiment, designed both to replicate and extend Nigro's findings, and to examine the role of self-reported imagery ability using Nigro's procedure, a procedure that is apparently free of the confounding effects of motivation.

        "description":"The authors in this volume propose expanding the topic of motivation in the preservice teacher education program by including contemporary research. Margaret W. Cohen reviews a body of research and theory concerned with the effects of extrinsic reinforcers on intrinsic motivation. She notes that contemporary research in the area of intrinsic motivation has consistently demonstrated that extrinsic reinforcers may undermine rather than facilitate performance on and interest in activities that are intrinsically motivating. Carole Ames addresses the implications of attribution theory for the teacher preparation curriculum. She believes it is important for teacher educators to help preservice teachers understand the positive and negative effects of types of classroom structure and  evaluation on attribution. Dale H. Schunk suggests that social comparison is an inherent factor in every classroom and can have positive or negative motivation effects. M. Kay Alderman suggests that the preservice component in motivation should provide the preservice teacher with a repertoire of motivation-linked strategies, such as goal-setting, in order to facilitate learning and to educate students with high-achievement patterns of thought and action. Drawing from research on teacher effectiveness and decision making, Mary Rohrkemper argues that if preservice teachers are to be adequately prepared, they need concrete skills that will enable them to observe motivation, diagnose the need for motivational strategies, and assess the effectiveness of strategy implementation. Bibliographies  accompany each of the articles. (JD)",

Case studies illustrate these problems. Numerous ways to report achievement data have been found: (1) means and medians; (2) number of students scoring above and below certain percentiles; (3) analysis of items correct (related to specific skills) by individuals , classes, schools, and district; and (4) results for  subgroups of sex, ethnicity, classroom, school, grade, special education students, and limited English speakers. Scores may be compared to the national norm, the state, other similar districts, surrounding suburban districts, or the same district in previous years. Data of interest to the public include National Merit Scholarship winners, honor roll members, high school graduates meeting minimum competency requirements, and students who will attend college.

Two formal tests were administered: the norm-referenced California Achievement Tests (CAT), and the criterion-referenced Alabama Basic Competency Test (ABCT). Informal measures included the Houghton-Mifflin Informal Reading Inventory (HMIRI), the Classroom Reading Inventory (CRI), a cloze procedure, and teacher judgment (as indicated by the basal reader assignment for each student). Results indicated that correlations among all of the measures were moderate to high. The formal tests, particularly the CAT, tended to produce lower scores than the informal measures. In spite of high correlations, the CAT and ABCT results revealed very different distributions of  student ability. With the ABCT, more students showed average and above average performance. Examination of teachers' judgments regarding reading book placement, as compared to test results, indicated that teachers underestimated students' reading ability and placements did not reflect test results. HMIRI results also suggested that a number of students could have been assigned to a higher-level reading book. It was suggested that informal measures be used for book placement and that multiple measures of reading achievement be used in decision making. (GDC)",

The consistency of mastery classifications in criterion referenced reading tests was examined. Pretest and posttest data were available for 945 first and second grade students and for 1796 fourth to sixth grade students who were given the PRI Reading Systems Instructional Objectives Inventory. Three traditional item analysis procedures were used: the Cox-Vargas index; the point biserial correlation applied to combined pretest-posttest data; and the phi coefficient. Two approaches derived from item response theory were also used: item information at the cut-off score as estimated by the one parameter and the three parameter models. The results  indicated that the two item response models produced classification consistencies, indicated by coefficient kappa, that were superior to the three traditional procedures. Furthermore, the three parameter model appeared to be superior to the one parameter model. (GDC)",

Each algorithm is classified according to the time frame of analysis, the level of data aggregation, the continuity of the population, and the reference norms used. Six of these algorithms are applied to data collected from a suburban elementary school 30 miles from Boston on tests of reading comprehension, mathematics, and readiness.

The first step is to identify the specific school locations of the teaching graduates. Then the survey forms and cover letters are mailed to the principals. One followup letter and another copy of the questionnaire are sent to those 15 to 29 percent who have not responded after four weeks. Telephone calls are also made, but such calls have not exceeded three in any of the three years discussed. Five different introductory cover  letters are used, as well as personal individualized letters when indicated. Return envelopes are provided, and the letters are prepared on high quality letterhead stationery. These procedures are satisfactory in producing a high response rate.

In the first experiment, fourteen multiple choice items were selected from the Stanford Achievement Test. No reading passages were provided, but the items were clustered according to their association with a particular passage. The learning disabled students answered correctly only slightly more than predicted by chance. Scores of the non-learning disabled group were significantly higher. In order to address the suggestion that the poorer performance of learning disabled students was caused by their lesser ability to read the test questions, a second experiment was  conducted. A different sample of students included learning disabled and average third grade students. The examiner read each of the 14 test items aloud, and all students were given sufficient time to answer all items. The average students again had higher scores than the learning disabled group. The results suggested that learning disabled students may be less likely than their non-learning disabled peers to apply test-taking strategies to reading comprehension questions. (GDC)",

This study sought to identify factors contributing to this increase, to assess the extent and characteristics of the change, and to examine the motivations and expectations of the students concerned. Patterns of school retention were considered in relation to the influences of the economic environment, the social-psychological environment, and the school environment on individual decisions to remain in school. Data were analyzed on three levels: school systems, schools, and students. Chapter 2 outlines the study's design and methodology. Chapter 3 describes the patterns and trends in government school systems retention, their relationship to  non-government schools and to opportunities in equivalent programs through Technical and Further Education. Chapter 4 examines differences between schools in retention rates and the types of recent program developments occuring in schools. Chapter 5 and 6 report on students' reasons for staying in or leaving school and their intentions for further study. Chapter 7 reviews the findings on factors influencing retentivity in Australian government secondary schools. Appendices contain detailed information on the retentivity measures, two student questionnaires, and the school curriculum and organization questionnaire. (BS)",

The following data were obtainted on 45,067 undergraduates enrolled in 31 different institutions in a state college system: SAT Verbal (SAT-V) and SAT Mathematics (SAT-M) scores; high school average (HSA); cumulative credit hours carried and cumulative credit hours earned; and cumulative grade point average. Regression equations of GPA with SAT scores, HSA, and indicators of college experience were calculated by institution for all students and for black females, black males, white females, and white males. The regression coeffecients for SAT-V, SAT-M, HSA, the constant term, the standard error of estimate, and the adjusted R squared  were graphically presented. Findings provided some support for the supposition that GPA's are less predictable for black males - largely due to the lower weights of HSA and SAT-V in predicting GPA for black males as compared with weights for white females, and for the other groups to a lesser extent. There was no clear pattern effect for type of institution attended. While both gender and minority status differences in SAT score validity were apparent, the difference in SAT-V weights between white females and males was greater than the difference between white and black males.

Evaluation utilization is discussed in terms of what is used, who uses evaluation, when evaluation is used, how evaluation is used, where evaluation is used, and why evaluation is used. It is suggested that the personal factor - the interests and commitments of key people involved in the evaluation - is the most important explanatory variable in evaluation utilization. Ten basic utilization-focused evaluation premises are presented, and it is suggested that the primary direction for further utilization research is to test these premises in an integrated, holistic way in real evaluations. The recent external evaluation of the Caribbean Agricultural Extention Project is described to  illustrate a comprehensive test of utilization focused evaluation in a real world project. Five issues that continue to create confusion in the field and that emerge from discussions of the stakeholder assumption and research on the personal factor are discussed. It is concluded that evaluators should act on what is already known about utilization and evaluate those actions rather that do further isolated research on utilization. Preliminary observations on the problems of misutilization are also presented. (BS)",

The following are the evaluation's major findings, based on interviews, questionnaires, case studies, test data, and archival data: (1) changes are more likely in areas such as clear school mission and monitoring student progress, and less likely in areas addressing particular teaching techniques and other classroom practices; (2) a single school can set into motion districtwide policies and procedures for districtwide school effectiveness efforts; (3) the program's assessment and action planning procedures establish clear and valuable boundaries for the direction of  school effectiveness efforts; (4) when more effective staff communication becomes a goal rather than the means to a goal, the emphasis of the school improvement efforts is compromised; (5) volunteerism is a central theme in the program, but some of the most needy schools do not volunteer; (6) the proportion of low-income students scoring below the 30th percentile decreased from 36 to 24 percent in math, from 41 to 32 percent in reading; the discrepancy between the proportion of low-income students achieving minimum proficiency and the proportion of all others achieving it narrowed from 19 to 10 percentage points in math, from 25 to 17 in reading; and (7) schools with the greatest achievement gains were the schools showing most progress in the school effectiveness program.

        "description":"The six papers which comprise this report analyze the labor market experience of youth as reflected in the 1982 results of a longitudinal study of a nationally representative sample of 32.9 million young people who were ages 14-21 as of January 1, 1979. Chapter 1, &quot;The Nature and Consequences of High School Employment,&quot; by Ronald D'Amico and Paula Baker, reports that by the tenth grade about one third of students were employed for at least one week, with white males showing the highest percentage, and that the effects of employment on schooling appear to be positive. Chapter 2, &quot;A Longitudinal Study of Reservation Wages, Duration of Job Search, and Subsequent Wages,&quot; by Choongsoo Kim, expands on previous studies concerned with whether the length of the job search period leads to  subsequent wage gains. Chapter 3, &quot;The Effectiveness of Job Search and Job Finding Methods of Young Americans,&quot; by John Wielgosz and Susan Carpenter, examines whether particular job search methods exert a significant influence on the duration of job search and level of job satisfaction. Chapter 4, &quot;Race, Employment, and Educational Attainment,&quot; by Joan E. Crowley, argues that young people's desire for education is strong, and that their expectations are closely predictive of actual attainment. Chapter 5, &quot;Long-Term Outcomes of Government-Subsidized Employment and Training Programs,&quot; also by Crowley, reports that such programs had little effect on subsequent employment either in terms of pay or of job satisfaction. Finally, Chapter 6, &quot;The High School Dropout in an Overeducated Society,&quot;  by William R. Morgan, discusses the finding that, by 1982, 4.8 million youth (14 percent of the 17-24 age youth cohort) had left high school and had no diploma or GED certification. (KH)",

        "description":"This paper considers the relationship between bilingualism and intelligence in Puerto Rican children from a population perspective. A population perspective refers to the idea that many of the variables considered by psychologists to be independent are, in fact, distributed non-randomly in the population, and that this distribution needs to be considered as an essential aspect of the phenomenon in question. Almost 400 elementary school students in a bilingual program in New Haven, Connecticut, who were homogeneous in terms of socioeconomic status (low) and ethnicity (Puerto Rican) were tested using measures of English and Spanish ability, metalinguistic skills, and nonverbal intelligence. Results, in general, supported the position of a positive relationship between bilingualism  and cognitive ability. Along with the student testing, a large-scale survey of all parents of Puerto Rican elementary school students was carried out in an attempt to gain understanding of what characteristics described the subpopulation from which the cognitive study sample was drawn, in relation to the broader Puerto Rican community. It is argued that the relationships found between demographic characteristics and language use, within both the subgroup and the larger group, highlight the importance of understanding the social environment in which bilingualism develops if questions are to be asked about its effects, and that what happens to an individual child will be a function of an interplay of influences that cut across various levels of analysis.

        "description":"The links between sixth-grade reading achievement, race, and the socioeconomic status of schools and neighborhoods in the Kansas City School District (KCSD) from the 1950s to the present were examined. The data show that black students tended, as early as 1956, to be in poverty schools with low achievement and that this pattern has persisted. In 1957, predominantly black schools were in lower status neighborhoods than white schools, with 54% of adults in black school neighborhoods and 31% in white school neighborhoods having low status jobs. The low socioeconomic status of predominantly black schools was still in evidence in 1980, when 80% of students at schools which were 95% or more black in 1957 were eligible for subsidized lunch. Reading achievement in these schools was and  remains concomitantly low. Average sixth grade reading scores at predominantly black schools were 5.64 in 1957 (the national average was 6.8), 5.45 in 1960, 5.03 in 1970, and 5.54 in 1980. In contrast, average scores at predominantly white schools were above the national average in 1957 and 1960 (7.43 and 7.28 respectively). During the 1960s and 1970s the KCSD changed from a largely white middle class school district to a predominantly black working class one. And by 1981 the percentage of KCSD schools that were low achieving poverty schools had jumped from the 19% of 1960 to 80%, thus underlining the strong links between race, social status, and achievement.

One study measured students' perceptions, the other assessed staff perceptions. Based upon the findings of this research, it became clear that in order to get a good picture of the school climate, data from both students and staff were needed. Staff and students had convergent opinions in many areas. The school's academic program was viewed positively by both groups. Students were positive about guidance and counseling, the curriculum, and the instruction. The staff were positive about related areas: frequent monitoring of student progress, and opportunity to learn and time-on-task. They viewed the department head, especially  in the role of instructional leader, in a positive light. The staff did not feel safe in the school (and students did not participate in activities which would cause them to remain at school after hours). Both students and staff were generally satisfied with the school, but had negative perceptions concerning Boulevard's administration. The staff viewed the principal as accessible but as a poor instructional leader. Students felt that the administration was not accessible, and they were not involved in the decision making process. And finally, while staff tended to have low expectations of student performance, students felt they were learning almost all they could and learning a lot in most or all classes.

        "description":"In 1983, 602 first year New York City teachers participated in a questionnaire study of their backgrounds, motivations, personal attitudes and experiences, and the support structures they felt they needed to survive in their profession. Results indicate that regardless of gender, race, or religion, participants were proud to teach, well educated, concerned about children, fully engaged in their new profession, and relatively unstressed (although teachers of kindergarten through Grade 3, women, and Caucasians were slightly more stressed than other groups). Overall, first year teachers appear to be hard-working individuals who are motivated more by idealistic than pragmatic reasons for entering teaching. They also seem to be more concerned with their students' experiences than with  their own experiences as new teachers, and this is an indication of the transition from self-preoccupation to pupil-centeredness that is necessary for effective teaching. However, the fact that there were so few differences among the 602 teachers of diverse backgrounds and experiences, from every grade level and city borough, suggests that the first teaching year may have a normalizing effect. The new teachers gave strong support for retired teachers to serve as mentors for first-year teachers in 1984, and a study of this intervention is underway. (KH)",

In addition to focusing on how government affirmative action policies impact on racial minorities and women, the study investigated individual attitudes on the extent of racial discrimination at the workplace and in society. The survey produced four major findings: (1) there are significant differences in the attitudes on affirmative action held by Blacks and Whites; (2) the attitudes held by \"advantaged\" (high income and/or middle or upper class) Blacks differ from those of less advantaged Blacks; (3) White women and Blacks differ significantly in their attitudes on the perceived major beneficiaries of affirmative  action. White women are more supportive of affirmative action programs than are White males, but these differences are small when compared to interracial differences; and (4) on abstract questions, well-educated Whites hold more liberal attitudes on affirmative action than less-educated Whites. However, there are no significant differences between well and poorly educated Whites when they are asked to support applied policies advancing affirmative action. These findings suggest that affirmative action has been more successful in promoting debate than in increasing employment opportunities for a growing number of structurally unemployed Blacks. (KH)",

        "author":["Silva, Helga"],
        "description":"This report describes the impact on the Dade County, Florida, public school system of the 125 Cuban (and some Haitian) refugees arriving in the Mariel exodus. In September 1980 the school system had to absorb 13,000 new refugee students. Preparing for the students included hiring many bilingual teachers, reopening schools that had closed, establishing special entrant schools and programs, and obtaining funding. In the first year overcrowding was a drastic problem, with as many as 60 students in some classes. Many of the students were not well prepared, with median scores of 33% in basic reading skills and 24% in mathematics tests in Spanish. A further problem was the Marxist education the children had received in Cuba, which meant that there were extreme differences in the  educational material they had covered and the methodology they were accustomed to. In general, it is reported, the schools were successful in accomodating these students, although some students &quot;fell through the cracks&quot; and others--mostly older unaccompanied minors--were never enrolled in the schools. The report concludes with a description of ongoing concerns, including the lack of an adequate Federal government response to the crisis and related experiences with Nicaraguan refugees. Included are a bibliography, appendices outlining costs of the refugee program, recommended instruction materials for students with limited English proficiency, a listing of programs for limited English proficient students, and a comparison of elementary school programs for students classified independent in  English versus those limited in English.

        "description":"This evaluation report summarizes results of the Bilingual Language Arts Program (BLAST), Walton High School, Bronx, New York, 1983-1984. BLAST was designed as a transitional program emphasizing student integration into society. The program provided instruction in English as a second language and native language arts, as well as bilingual instruction in social studies, science, mathematics, typing, and career orientation. Quantitative analysis of student achievement data indicates that: (1) most program students manifested improved oral/aural English language skills on the New York City Fluency Scale; (2) the yearly average passing rate for students in E.S.L. classes was 72%; (3) students demonstrated overall passing rates of 95% (fall) and 98% (spring) on both the city-wide and  Regents examinations in Spanish; (4) overall passing rates in mathematics, science, and social studies courses were quite similar for both program and mainstream students; (5) overall passing rates in elective career courses were high; and (6) the attendance rate of program students was statistically significantly higher than the attendance rate of the school as a whole. Recommendations for improving the program include developing health careers and computer literacy components, a bilingual program counselor, guidance office follow-up of students in mainstream classes, recruitment of a certified bilingual mathematics teacher, and workshops for project and school staff to further educate them in bilingual curricula.

        "author":["Smith, Jeanne"],
        "description":"The purpose of this project was to strengthen a volunteer literacy council's ability to offer an innovative curriculum and program monitoring system that meets the total literacy needs of O-4 level students, thus increasing student and tutor motivation and retention. The project designed volunteer staff training seminars to meet these objectives. Curriculum innovations were designed and implemented. A program monitoring system for testing and evaluation was put into operation. Tutors and students were offered three inservice seminars over a 12-month period. Each seminar was repeated in four different areas of Philadelphia for a total of 12 sessions. The first eight sessions were for tutors. The last four sessions consisted of separate meetings held simultaneously for tutors and  students. Responses were positive when a follow-up survey on the last seminar was conducted. The retention rate for the 1983 program was 62 percent, 2 percent higher than the 1982 rate. More important, however, is the fact that the number of students more than doubled (from 399 in 1982 to 850 in 1983), with a 29 percent increase in retention in 1983 as compared with 1982. The project directors concluded that the inservice seminars increased the agency's capacity to expand and maintain a high retention rate because the seminars provided the support and motivation essential for serving more tutors and students. The appendix presents &quot;How to Conduct 'Goal Setting and Study Skills' Inservice for Basic Literacy Students,&quot; by Rose Brandt. (KC)",

Whereas 78 percent of the 11th graders would have liked help with career planning in 1973, only 71 percent desired such help in 1983. Sixty-six percent of the 11th graders responding in 1983 reported receiving \"some\" or \"a lot of\" help with career planning as opposed to only 50 percent 10 years earlier. Although significantly more of the 1983 respondents realized that persons do not tend to remain in one job for their entire working lives, more than half of the 8th and 11th  graders polled in 1983 were under the misconception that the earlier individuals choose a career the better. The percentage of students aspiring to careers in the personal, social, and health occupations decreased from 31 percent in 1973 to 13 percent for 8th graders and from 27 percent to 14 percent for 11th graders. Although students are apparently receiving more help with career planning, fewer students were \"fairly sure\" of their first career choice in 1983 than in 1973.

A logicodialetical model called the CLER model was used in the conceptualization of the project. The CLER model assumes that the probability of a change event depends on the following: optimization of configurational relationships (C) and linkages (L) among the social configurations in the change event, the environments (E) to which the various social configurations in the change event are responding, and the resources (R) available to the social configurations. The project  was intended to develop a training technology that would incorporate the principles of competency-based instruction, establish learning resource centers to undergird the new training technology, and institutionalize linkages between the training system to be proposed and the private sector. Training will be offered in the consultancy mode, and the training model will consist of five stages: demand, diagnosis, definition, design, and delivery. The project, which is still in the preliminary planning stage, is slated to have a built-in evaluation system that will use both formalized and naturalistic methods of evaluation. (MN)",

In a 1982 survey, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) reported that more than 21 million people over the age of 17 attended adult education activities during 1981, an increase of 3 million in 3 years. The NCES conception of adult education is a relatively narrow one, which results in conservative figures. Persons most likely to participate in adult education are middle-class, white, and high school or college graduates. Women are more likely than men to participate. Much of the adult education activity is job-related, and most participants are in their 20s and 30s. More than 37 million different courses were offered in 1981, but only about 3 percent of the courses were aimed at remedying  adult illiteracy. Types of adult education are courses carried out by a variety of schools and recreation departments, continuing education courses offered by professional organizations, &quot;second chance&quot; programs for persons who were inadequately educated in childhood, and employer-sponsored education and training. Adult education activities will continue to expand in the years to come. To meet the challenges of adult education, adult educators will have to be trained to understand adulthood and meet the needs of adult students. (KC)",

        "description":"One of the new dimensions of vocational and career counseling is the recognition of the continuity in careers. Despite periods of unemployment and despite a radical change of occupations, the person having these experiences of change is still the same person. Although a career involves the life pursuits of a person, there are several differing conceptions of what characterizes a career. Models that are frequently used are the rocket model, the rolling mill model, the stability model, the rainbow model, and the life-stage model. The concepts of developmental tasks and of the life stages into which they can generally be grouped, as exemplified by the life-stage model, led to the development of the concept of \"career maturity.\" Career maturity has been defined as readiness to cope  with the developmental tasks appropriate to one's life stage. The model of adult maturity or adaptability has evolved from recent work. A new model of career assessment is clearly needed, one that is more comprehensive and more developmental than the classical matching model. One such model--the developmental assessment model--resembles the classical model, but has differences, including ascertaining the relative importance of the work role and other major roles in the life scheme of the client. This new model may lead to a new \"quiet revolution\" in counseling. (KC)",

        "description":"Information-processing students solving problems in the 1960s and 1970s accepted the tradition of early experimental psychology in concentrating primarily on the study of &quot;knowledge-lean&quot; tasks in which competence can usually be acquired over short periods of learning and experience. In recent years, experts have examined knowledge-rich tasks that require hundreds and thousands of hours of learning and experience in an area of study. Investigations of problem solving in knowledge-rich domains show strong interactions between structures of knowledge and cognitive processes. Data and theory in developmental psychology, studies of expert/novice problem solving, and process analyses of high and low scorers on intelligence and aptitude test tasks show that a major component of  expertise is seen to be the possession of accessible and usable knowledge. Five generalizations can be made about the nature of expertise: first, there seems to be a continuous development of competence, as experience in a field accumulates; second, expertise seems to be very specific; third, experts develop the ability to perceive large, meaningful patterns; fourth, the knowledge of experts is highly procedural; and fifth, these components of expertise enable fact-access pattern recognition and representational capability that facilitate problem perception, greatly reducing the role of memory search and general processing. Increased understanding of the nature of expertise challenges educators to inquire how it is learned. It seems evident that expertise is acquired when people  continually try to confront new situations in terms of what they know. Thus, when teaching beginners, teachers must build from initial knowledge structures. Acquiring expertise is the successive development of procedurally oriented knowledge structures that facilitate the processes of expertise. (KC)",

        "description":"Two recent studies proved the usefulness of predictors of academic performance and conceptual models that were developed primarily from research on traditional college students for the study of retention among nontraditional adult students in conventional postsecondary programs. Some modifications and extensions were suggested. The first study investigated the accuracy with which conventional demographic and achievement measures would differentiate between persisters and nonpersisters among adult students at Youngstown State University. A stepwise discriminant analysis identified four variables that explained 25 percent of the variance in the study population: financial aid, grade point average, matriculation status, and age. Using these four variables in the discriminant  function to classify persisters and nonpersisters resulted in the correct classification of 81 percent of the study population--88 percent of the nonpersisters and 57 percent of the persisters. The second study explored the appropriateness of the conceptual model developed by Tinto from research on dropout among traditional college students for understanding dropout among a nontraditional student group (older, mostly minority women on welfare) enrolled in a postsecondary nondegree vocational training program. Findings indicated program completion was related not to personal background characteristics but to academic aptitude and the significance of students' integration to both academic and non-academic sectors.

        "description":"A study assessed the impacts of an entire career guidance program in a school. Research on the effects of guidance and counseling using high school students gave an overall picture of research on guidance interventions as providing conflicting conclusions and as being confounded by complex interactions between student and program characteristics as well as by type of treatment. Evaluating the impact of career guidance was made difficult due to diffuse goals, objectives, and methods and alternative interpretations of guidance functions. The study assessed effects of school career guidance programs on five outcomes: locus of control, self-esteem, perceived ability to complete college, educational expectation, and occupational expectation. Data were part of the High School and  Beyond survey database. Five broad categories of variables were used: outcomes, career guidance program characteristics, lagged outcome measures, socioeconomic background and ascribed status characteristics, and geographic regions. The statistical analyses consisted of cross-lagged regressions in which time-two measures of outcomes are dependent variables and the regressors are comprised of lagged endogenous variables and exogenous variables. These data indicated that attending a school with an active career guidance program did not have much effect of any of the outcomes studied. A five-page list of references concludes the paper.

        "description":"For several years the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has been actively involved in educational and training affairs. Small businesses must overcome some inertia to become again interested in educational reform and training. The conflict that will occur between them and community-based groups that have been filling the void will only help the educational and training systems. Business organizations are interested in educational and training reforms and programs for a number of reasons: the dropout problem leading to skills shortages, demographic changes, and retraining midcareer and older workers. The business community sees proprietary schools as having the ability to respond quickly, to place students, and to retrain and upgrade. Proprietary schools must look at themselves, articulate  strengths and weaknesses, and engage in public relations. The idea of developing a national youth policy is regaining interest and momentum. While the public educational delivery system has already failed or turned off dropouts, the flexibility and effectiveness of proprietary schools has been proven. Challenges to proprietary schools are as follows: training illiterate Americans, contracting with industry to do training for them, cooperating with public and private non-profit schools, keeping up with technological advances, and associating with accrediting organizations.

Rather than prescribing the specific career development activities schools should use, CPSS provides a means for schools to focus their career development program on the unique needs of their own students and within the bounds of their own resources. A project was undertaken to disseminate information about CPSS across the country and to assist interested schools in adopting it. During the course of the project materials for use in adoption decisions, training instruction, and program management and evaluation were developed. Adoption agreements were  negotiated with State facilitator grantees and educational service providers, and technical assistance and staff training were provided to potential adopters. The quality and effectiveness of the CPSS adoptions were monitored and evaluated, and a system to identify and train certified trainers was implemented. (Attachments to this report include the executive summary of a National evaluation study of CPSS, a CPSS decision guide, informational and promotional material on CPSS, a CPSS awareness workshop and training plan, sample adoption agreement and reporting forms, awareness materials and awareness session questionnaires, a CPSS certified training agreement, and an aggregate data section.)

The following three conclusions emerged from the interviews: ABE students who return to school after bad experiences as children or adolescents are keenly aware of their previous educational failures; even for those who can handle the academic challenges of ABE, problems often arise in coping with the dual roles of adult and student; and adult students often have extenuating health or family pressures that necessitate special accommodation efforts on the part of instructors. Data from these  interviews and from other studies suggest that it is not personal inadequacies but rather school-related problems that are responsible for most withdrawals from ABE programs; these data underscore the need for treating adult students as individuals and providing adult learners with learning choices so that they may (1) remove themselves from frustrating or boring situations, (2) adjust when other responsibilities demand priority, and (3) exercise the same self-direction in learning that they both enjoy and are expected to use in other areas of their lives.

        "description":"To determine the current state of the art of the teaching of vocational ethics in the state of Illinois, a survey of Illinois educators was conducted in the spring of 1985. A sample of 650 teachers were asked if and to what extent vocational ethics were currently being taught in their state. About 50 percent of the teachers, kindergarten through postsecondary, responded. Of these respondents, 78 percent regarded vocational ethics as an appropriate area of instruction, and 92 percent agreed that understanding vocational ethics would help students obtain and keep a job after graduation. However, only 21 percent reported that vocational ethics are currently being taught in their schools. Many Illinois educators believe that vocational ethics should be introduced to students early in  the school career. Of the areas selected by the respondents as currently including the teaching of vocational ethics, career education was selected most often. While most reported that a course on vocational ethics was not available at their schools, indirect teaching through teacher-student interaction was reported by many. Nearly all the educators indicated that they currently include vocational ethics at least occasionally in their curriculum. While there was strong agreement on the importance of the topic, there was little agreement on the teaching of vocational ethics as a specific course. As a group, Illinois educators favored teaching vocational ethics indirectly over teaching a specific course. About two-thirds of this report consists of copies of the computerized data files of  the study survey. (KC)",

        "description":"This study evaluates pre- and inservice training of business educators in Connecticut. Data from a questionnaire returned by 820 of 912 business teachers in Connecticut indicated that over 60 percent of them received their undergraduate training in the state. The teachers indicated that general professional education courses were not worthwhile, business methods and curriculum courses were sometimes helpful, and courses in business content and skills were the most beneficial. They felt that their preservice training was most lacking in training in the use of modern technology and equipment, testing and grading, classroom management, and techniques for dealing with students of varied abilities and other characteristics. A review of the literature indicated that the information  gathered from the teachers in the study is consistent with the findings of other research and also reflects many of the concerns that employers have concerning the type of training provided to teachers of secondary-level business students. Ten recommendations for improving the pre- and inservice education of business teachers were set forth. (Appendixes to this report include the teacher questionnaire and response frequencies, results of the non-multiple-choice questionnaire items, Connecticut certification requirements for business and office education teachers, and National Association for Business Teacher Education standards.

MAP's mission was to provide career transition and outplacement job search assistance to RIF-affected employees. It provided these services: job search, personnel support, training, and professional individual and group counseling. Based on the definition of the MAP mission goals and objectives, the MAP evaluation design consisted of these components: assessment of program implementation, program delivery, and program impact and cost/benefit comparisons. The methodology consisted of review of MAP records and materials, administration of surveys, and MAP staff interviews. Collected data and information strongly suggested that MAP achieved  the goals and objectives related to its mission. Program activity was implemented generally as planned with significant employee participation. Program services were effectively delivered and had positive impacts on the career transition and outplacement job search process for RIF-affected employees. A possible pattern of benefits exceeding costs for the MAP implementation was suggested. An overriding theme of recommendations was a need for the ongoing provision of career planning and job placement assistance. (YLB)",

The High School for Health Careers began classes on August 27, 1984, with 204 ninth-grade students enrolled from 12 school districts in Bexar County, Texas. The competency-based curriculum for the school was based on recommendations of the curriculum subcommittee and the mandates of Texas law. After development, each topic was reviewed by subcommittee members and by consultants. Materials and equipment lists were developed to support the  curriculum.

        "description":"Fully addressing most problems clients bring to therapy usually requires more than one session. Some student therapists seem to be more capable than others of engaging clients and promoting more visits when warranted. To discover whether graduate admissions information can predict a psychologist-trainee's ability to readily engage clients, data were collected over a 6-year period from 43 clinical psychology practicum students. The data included: (1) an engagement quotient (EQ) which is the percentage of clients returning to the trainee for more than one session; (2) age; (3) Graduate Record Examination Verbal score (GREV); (4) Graduate Record Examination Quantitative score (GREQ); (5) Miller Analogies Test score (MAT); (6) grades from two clinical diagnosis courses; and (7) a new  variable created by subtracting the GREQ score from the GREV score (GREV-GREQ). The results showed that all variables correlated significantly with EQ. Age had the most predictive value followed by GREV scores, GREV-GREQ, and MAT scores. These findings suggest that higher engaging trainees, relative to lower engagers, have better verbal and diagnostic skills and also tend to be older. It appears, from these results, that high engagers can be identified at admission to graduate school and from certain course grades. (DPO)",

Previous studies on the impact of divorce on children have generally focused on pre-schoolers and elementary-age children. Since more long-term marriages are ending in divorce, attention should also be given to adolescent and adult children of divorce. Subjects (N=26) who were 11 years old or older at the time of their parents' divorce responded to an instrument assessing their feelings at the time of the divorce and their feelings at the time they completed the questionnaire. Parents completed similar questionnaires for children (N=9) who were younger than 11 at the time of divorce. Parents' responses for the younger group of children indicated that the younger children were, in general, less troubled  than the older ones at the time of the separation or divorce. The older children, in contrast, tended to show a wide range of responses and were more sensitive to their feelings at the time of separation as well as in the present. They reported feeling angrier and more depressed than the younger children at the time of divorce and also reported feeling unhappier than the younger children both at the time of divorce and at present. The older children, who were generally more variable in their self-ratings than the parents were in rating the younger children, also showed a larger mean score for total change than did the younger children.

        "description":"As more women enter the work force, a new family phenomenon is emerging - the shared parenting household. To examine the dynamics of this new family type, 40 couples in shared parenting families were interviewed. In these families, both parents shared the responsibilities of primary caregiver while also working at full-time white collar or professional jobs or being enrolled in academic programs. Preliminary findings revealed that both women and men in shared parenting families felt a disidentification with their own same-sex parent. Mothers reported entering shared parenthood to avoid feared losses of their own identity; fathers reported entering it with expected gains. Mothers described their relationships with their children as &quot;nurturing&quot; while fathers described the  father-child relationship as &quot;intimate&quot;. Mothers often expressed feelings of jealousy and rejection because of the bond between father and child. Although the child may feel caught in the middle, the shared parenting family can generate for the child an understanding that men, like women, are feeling people who can express their emotions. At the same time, the child is provided with role models of women who are multidimensional in their lives and experiences. Hopefully, the child in a shared parenting family will be able to integrate the father's intimacy and the mother's nurturing so that these qualities are woven into one person, male or female, who can someday offer both qualities to his or her own child (NRB)",

        "description":"A differentiation between two types of self-blame, behavioral and characterological, has been suggested. Behavioral self-blame is control-related and pertains to attributions made to one's behavior, while characterological self-blame is esteem-related and involves attributions made to one's character. To assess the efficacy of separating the attributions of victims of domestic violence into these two categories, and to determine the existence of any relationships between self-blame and help-seeking behavior, 30 women residents of a battered women's shelter were interviewed. The relationships among sex-role beliefs, self-blame, and reasons for staying in an abusive relationship were also examined. The results, when compared to the results of a study examining the effects of the  two types of self-blame among victims of sexual harassment (Jensen and Gutek, 1982), revealed that a larger proportion of the domestic violence victims agreed with the behavioral and the characterological self-blame items than did the sexual harassment victims. The sex-role beliefs scale was negatively correlated with the characterological self-blame item suggesting that women with feminist sex-role beliefs would engage in less characterological self-blame. The two measures of behavioral self-blame were correlated, while the correlations between the characterological self-blame item and the behavioral items were not significant. These findings provide support for the differentiation between behavioral and characterological self-blame among victims of domestic violence, a differentiation  which is useful because of the different therapeutic implications of each type of self-blame.

        "description":"Although divorcing parents have a variety of child custody arrangements from which to choose, opinions are mixed as to which children benefit from which arrangements. To compare the adjustment of boys in joint and maternal physical custody and to investigate factors related to their adjustment, 20 joint custody families with a boy aged 6-11 and a matched group of 20 maternal custody families in which the boy had regular visitations with the father were interviewed. Individual interviews with the boy, both parents when possible, and a written report from a subset of teachers were obtained. Parents reported boys in joint custody to have significantly fewer behavioral difficulties, teachers indicated that joint custody children were better adjusted in the classroom, and informal  clinical impressions suggested that joint custody boys had higher self-esteem and less anxiety than maternal custody boys. While the adjustment of maternal custody boys was highly correlated with the length of time elapsed since separation, there was no correlation between time elapsed and the adjustment of joint custody children. This finding suggests that divorce may be less of a crisis for boys in joint custody. Data from follow-up questionnaires sent to all parents 2 years after the original study suggest that fathers who chose joint custody had higher self-esteem and were more respected by their ex-wives during their marriages.

        "description":"The potential for feelings of hopelessness and depression in the aged is well documented. Although studies have examined the role of perceived control in ameliorating depression in the institutionalized elderly, no research has actually measured the perceived causal attributions among depressed, hopeless and/or institutionalized elderly populations. To explore the different types of attributional styles used by depressed/nondepressed elderly women (N=50), the old and the reformulated models of learned helplessness were tested. Pretest scales included the Zung Depression Scale, the Gallagher Well-Being Scale, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the Rosow and Breslau Health Scale, the Information subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, and the subject's education level.  Subjects were presented with a Thematic Apperception Test card depicting a success/failure situation and were asked to determine the degree to which task difficulty, luck, effort, and ability contributed to the respective outcomes. Data analysis revealed significant interactions on the luck and ability variables, which upheld the reformulated model predictions that depressed subjects would attribute success to an external agent and failure to an internal agent and nondepressed subjects would attribute failure to an external agent and success to an internal agent. The principle implication is that depression may be reversed by replacing maladaptive cognitions with more vital ones, suggesting that treatment for depression in the elderly should continue to be cognitive therapy.

        "description":"Although studies have suggested that moods may affect motivation, the nature of these effects remains obscure. To clarify the relationship between mood and motivation, manipulated mood and self-reports of mood were related to paper-and-pencil ratings of motivational orientation. College students (N=70) in Happiness Induction and Sadness Induction mood manipulating groups followed instructions for mood induction, reported their feelings on the Mood Adjective Checklist (MACL), and rated the attractiveness of 56 different general long-term life goals on the Goals Questionnaire. A manipulation check revealed that the mood induction had not significantly affected self-reports of any MACL mood factors. There were significant differences between the two groups on 11 of the goals rated,  and significant differences on four additional scales for females only. Significant correlations with sad mood were found for 12 goal-scales with the entire group and for 15 goal-scales with female subjects alone. A cluster analysis of data resulted in the identification of five goal clusters (Jet Set, Self Improvement, Security, Other Orientation, Morality). Goals in the Jet Set cluster, which combined motives for wealth, glamour, and a very high social status, were involved in 31 of the 55 significant effects. All Jet Set goals were involved in at least one significant effect. The strongest trend in these results seems to be that sad mood is related, both experimentally and correlationally, to Jet Set goals. (NRB)",

A study was undertaken to determine whether there was a difference between Type A and Type B persons in general lifestyle pace preference. College students (N=140) completed a number of stress measurements, the Jenkins Activity Survey (JAS) Form D, and a brief survey assessing preferred pace style and current style. Students were categorized as Type A or Type B by their JAS scores. Pace incongruence was determined by subtracting the preferred pace score from the current pace score. The results indicated that, compared to Type B students, Type A students preferred a  faster paced environment and reported a faster paced current environment. Students who were pace-incongruent reported significantly greater stress on all stress measures. Approximately twice as many Type A students as Type B students were pace-incongruent, and Type A students reported more stress related to their current pace. When pace-congruent Type A students were compared with pace-congruent Type B students, Type A students still reported significantly more stress with the exception of pace-control stress, where congruent Type A's were significantly less stressed. These results support the person-environment fit stress hypothesis, and confirm the Type A preference for faster paced environments and the Type A propensity to be in lifestyles which are pace-incongruent.

Although the traditional family is no longer the norm, many social perspectives and policies reflect the belief that it is and do not meet the needs of dual-employed families. Dual-employed couples experience problems of work and role overload, identity and normative stressors stemming from traditional sex-role stereotypes, and difficulties in coordinating daily schedules. Societal changes which would increase the quantity and quality of all kinds of services (educational, domestic, child care, etc.) would strengthen dual-employed family living. Institutional changes which would increase the flexibility of the  occupational structure would also aid significantly in reducing stress in dual-employed families. Flexible scheduling, increased availability of part-time employment, on-site day care, and parental leaves are some of the occupational changes which would enable individuals to combine work and family roles with less strain. Social changes which would benefit dual-employed families involve a re-evaluation of the traditional career path model, nondiscriminatory employment opportunities, comparable worth legislation, and a change in marriage tax laws.

It is intended for use by staff in small colleges (under 1,000 students) where women's centers and on-campus child care are rare and where the needs of re-entry students have not been adequately addressed. The information presented is based on the experience of the Project for Re-Entry Students implemented at Midland Lutheran College in Fremont, Nebraska. Citing the strategies used at Midland as examples, this guide outlines a method by which small colleges can design programs for re-entry students suited to their individual needs. The numbers and needs of re-entry women students are presented along with suggestions for meeting those needs. Ways of  obtaining information about a college's re-entry student population and its specific needs are discussed, and ways to use this local information are considered. Specific suggestions for action are provided in the areas of recruitment and orientation, student services, faculty services, and administrative services. The handbook concludes with a brief discussion of program evaluation; a list of references; and appendices which contain a student survey form, a summary of the needs assessment survey, and a brochure for re-entry students.

Females score slightly higher on verbal tasks and males score slightly higher on mathematical tasks. According to the cognitive approach to stereotypes, people should perceive these differences to be quite large. To determine whether subjects would estimate large differences between females and males in verbal and mathematical performance, 101 college students estimated the average scores for females and males in their freshman class on the verbal and mathematical portions of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). Subjects also completed the Bem Sex-Role Inventory (BSRI). The results indicated that both female and male subjects judged that females would do significantly better on  the verbal portion and that males would do significantly better on the mathematical portion of the SAT. Further analyses demonstrated that female and male subjects did not differ in the extent of their stereotyping. Sex-typed individuals (feminine females and masculine males), as identified by scores on the BSRI, showed no greater tendency to stereotype than did other individuals. (Author/NRB)",

Home-career conflict exists when a dual-career wife values both homemaking and career and views some aspects of these two roles as incompatible. Home-career conflict results when a dual-career husband values his own career and that of his wife, but is uncomfortable with his wife's successes at work. Dual-career couples who hold traditional sex-role values are more likely to experience role conflict at a level that interferes with their effectiveness, while couples with less traditional values may experience some conflict and role overload. Smith's (1981) finding that egalitarian family decision-making was more characteristic of wives employed at professional levels, combined with Klein's  (1984) finding that fewer dual-career wives were employed at levels commensurate with their training, suggest that women have a long way to go to achieve equity. The fact that role conflict exists, and may impact the level of career involvement for wives, and the level of family involvement for husbands, supports the need for approaches to reducing role conflict which incorporate values clarification for both men and women. Rational strategies to reduce overload and increase role efficiency are also useful. An egalitarian decision-making style between dual-career spouses can result in less conflict over home and career roles and more effective behaviors in both roles. (NRB)",

Most approaches to training people to think focus on an intermediary or mediating process. To explore the effectiveness of a group support training method in modifying cognitive style, the performance of female college student participants (N=29) was compared to that of controls (honors students, N=13, remedial writing students, N=5, and no training students, N=11) before and after the training course. The experimental group was divided into high and low ability groups and met once a week for 14 weeks of loosely structured exercises designed to explore the use of symbolism, promote abstract thinking and the generation of alternative viewpoints, broaden the  application of thought, and promote metacognitive awareness. Experimentals and controls completed pre- and post-tests of the Watson-Glasser test of critical thinking, the Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT), a water-bottle test correlating with the GEFT, and an essay evaluated for level of thinking and writing skill. At the conclusion of the semester, the control group showed a mean difference of 0.0 relative to their initial performance on the Watson-Glasser compared to the +1.68 mean difference for the experimentals. There was no evidence of improved academic performance for the experimental group as a result of the training in thinking. The findings suggest that the intervening training of the experimental group raised their level of critical thinking more than the intervening training  (writing seminar, honors seminar, no systematic training) of the controls.

The executive summary presents details of the actions taken by Congress to pass legislation (H.R. 7551) to help control unwarranted violence against the aged and by the states to pass elder abuse-related laws and procedures to gain compliance with the anticipated new law. The procedures taken by the subcommittee to gain information in the area of elder abuse are outlined, e.g., collecting, reviewing, and tabulating letters and case histories received by the subcommittee over a 4-year period; reviewing all Congressional hearings and reports on elder abuse; and conducting survey and telephone interviews of state human services  departments. Section I of the report presents case histories submitted by the states describing physical, financial, psychological, and sexual abuse and violations of rights and self-neglect. SEction II discusses theories of the causes of elder abuse and section III presents the results of the survey of state human services departments (budget and resources, abuses, state regulatory actions). Section IV summarizes the federal response to elder abuse, i.e., Congressional action, the involvement of the Justice and Health and Human Services Departments, and federal funding. Section V contains policy recommendations for the Congress and for the states and section VI provides a brief summary of the report. The appendices contain the questionnaire to the states, a directory of offices  responsible for adult protective services, and a summary of Health and Human Services elder abuse programs.

        "description":"Caring for a family member with dementia is a major source of stress for the caregiver. To assess the impact of caring for an impaired family member and to evaluate the effectiveness of intervention programs, 34 caregivers of relatives with dementia completed an amended form of the Philadelphia Geriatric Center's Caregiver Survey and two psychosocial measures assessing depression and social mastery. The Caregiver Survey assessed family history, the impaired person's problems, caregiving, social support, caregiver characteristics, and caregiver goals. Results of the survey indicated that the key factor affecting level of caregiver depression was the level of cognitive impairment in the care receiver. Depressed caregivers were characterized as being socially isolated and  unassertive while nondepressed caregivers were more likely to be employed, to have paid help, and to participate in support groups. Although high social mastery caregivers were more likely to report being able to assess the care receiver's needs, handle caregiving problems, and participate in other activities, they were also more likely to be caring for a distant relative rather than a parent or spouse. These results suggest that caring for an impaired close relative clearly increases one's feelings of stress and burden and decreases one's feelings of mastery. These findings further suggest that intervention strategies should involve aggressive case management, counseling, and supportive therapy. (BL)",

        "description":"In recent years there has been a rapid increase in the number of American families in which both spouses work. The literature regarding preschoolers suggests that one cannot say that being from a dual-earner family will necessarily harm a child. Key issues center not on whether both parents work, but on the quality of substitute care and how well the family copes with the stresses of a dual-earner lifestyle. The research on school-age children has examined the issues of time spent with the children, sex-role modeling, academic achievement, intelligence quotients, career aspirations, adequacy of substitute care, psychosocial adjustment and perceived rejection. Generally, the literature shows that the mother's working does not have to adversely affect the child. There are many  mediating factors that are crucial in determining whether the dual-earner lifestyle results in harm or benefits, i.e., the child's age, sex, and relationship to parents; family socioeconomic status; nature of mother's work; family's coping resources; and the role of the father. Counselors can help dual-earner families in their adjustment through diagnostic, guidance and counseling, consultation and program development, and referral interventions. In addition, counselors must continue to study the dual-earner family phenomenon in order to help families cope with the stresses and take advantage of the opportunities for growth and change. A nine-page reference list is appended. (NRB)",

        "description":"Three sources of professional uncertainty have been described: uncertainty about the practitioner's mastery of knowledge; uncertainty due to gaps in the knowledge base itself; and uncertainty about the source of the uncertainty, i.e., the practitioner does not know whether his uncertainty is due to gaps in the knowledge base or to personal inadequacy. Clinical psychologists (N=35) in private practice were interviewed to determine their views on the degree to which uncertainty is an essential aspect of psychotherapy. Subjects responded to an open-ended structured interview designed to allow expression of their orienting assumptions about the nature and responsible practice of psychotherapy, and to assess their ways of coping with uncertainty. The interviews were taped and  transcribed and then rated by independent blind raters using a 100-item Q-sort. Cluster analysis of the ratings yielded six orienting approaches to uncertainty resolution clustered around: (1) reliance upon theory; (2) self-doubt; (3) personal gratification; (4) research-mindedness; (5) patient characteristics; and (6) consultation-intuition. These six strategies were present to some degree in all respondents. These results suggest that trainees in clinical psychology might benefit from active fostering of a consultative attitude toward peers and an investigative attitude toward clinical work, and from the teaching and practice of alternative research methodologies that complement clinical work.

        "description":"Although multidisciplinary teams (MT) are often available to all students in a school district, questions concerning the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of MTs remain largely unanswered. To examine MT functioning in New York, a survey was conducted with 108 separate MTs representing 43 public school districts. Respondents completed the Multidisciplinary Team Questionnaire (MTQ), a 19-item survey covering background information about the school district, its use and organization of MTs, and the respondent's assessment of the MT's success and other characteristics. The results revealed that 20 percent of the responding districts' MTs did not serve all grades and students, with service most lacking to junior high or middle school and high school students. Many of the MTs were  responsible for large numbers of students making full service to all students a difficult task. Individual student assessments, individual student prescription, and teacher consultation were the most frequently cited functions of the team, although MT functioning at the elementary grade level differed from MT functioning at the high school level. Results are presented in two forms: a delineation of the cumulative responses to the 19 MTQ questions, and a discussion of multiple statistical contrasts which address primary ratings, effects, and correlates of MT success. The 19 MTQ questions are included in the text. (NRB)",

A Developmental Research and Utilization Model is employed to systematically guide planning, implementation, evaluation, advocacy, and institutionalization. Curriculum development is discussed in terms of addressing age-related student needs and community readiness for comprehensive sex education programming. The comprehensive approach is proposed to augment basic instruction in reproduction (anatomy and physiology), pregnancy/contraception, and sexually transmitted diseases. Comprehensive sex education is described as an expansion of information-giving to include active student exploration of present  and future choices which forge a positive, healthy, and satisfying sexuality over the life span. Considerable attention is paid to several important topics: program excellence, staff competence and integrity, administrative responsibilities, and community relations. The review concludes with lists of typical values underlying comprehensive sex education and recommendations for local program development. A reference list is given, and tables are provided which list tasks and concerns in developmental sexuality by age level from infancy through late adolescence, and which illustrate student readiness and community acceptance of selected topics in comprehensive sex education. Appendices contain the Developmental Research and Utilization Model and a list of sources of information about sex  education. (Author/NRB)",

Following an introduction, basic demographic trends are examined in the areas of numbers, proportions, and age composition of the elderly; balance of the sexes; societal age-dependency patterns; and population distribution. In a section on morbidity and mortality, trends in mortality and life expectancy are discussed,  personal factors in longevity are considered, and information on morbidity and functional limitations is presented. In a third section, socioeconomic characteristics and factors in mortality are examined, including the social factors of marital status, living arrangements, familial dependency and multigenerational families, and the size of family and longevity. Other socioeconomic factors considered include economic development and per capita gross national product or income, socioeconomic differentials, economic activity and dependency, physical factors, and health personnel.

The effects of such prescription on the interactions among instructional method and a number of individual difference variables were also investigated. Subjects were 140 high school students randomly assigned to read a text passage displayed on microcomputers in one of four conditions: (1) required review of main text if response to adjunct questions was incorrect; (2) required review of an alternate, easier text if the response to adjunct questions was incorrect; (3) optional review; and (4) reading without adjunct questions. In each of the conditions students also had access to a number of other macroprocessing options. Pretests and posttests were also  administered, including the Nelson-Denny reading test, a worry-emotionality scale, a test anxiety scale, and a scale assessing prior knowledge of the topic in the reading passages. The results indicated that the required review groups outperformed the others on text relevant to the adjunct questions, and also differed significantly from the other groups in the number of reviews. Significant interactions among treatment, prior achievement, and anxiety measures were also obtained. Students' self-report of reading strategies were found to be unrelated to options use.

Two taxonomic structures and a list of Scott, Foresman's reading comprehension skills may be used to help demonstrate the effectiveness of writing as a reading skills activity. Bloom categorized the cognitive skills into a hierarchy of six functional steps. Drawing from Bloom's taxonomy, Guzak arranged reading comprehension skills into five major areas. One means of adapting a writing approach to the extension of a story is to have the students assume the stance of a news reporter and write a news story based on its events. Another way to include both Bloom's and  Guzak's arrays is to ask the students to identify with the main characters in a story. A comparison of real and imagined experiences reaches the highest of the thinking skills listed by Bloom and Guzak. Exercises in which children produce contexts rather than respond to small segments of information are more economical of pupil and teacher time. Fewer exercises can result in more learning if children are allowed to use their own ideas and impressions. (DF)",

Results of the subjects' readings and interviews suggest that readers are very unlikely to read the disclaimer in its present position and with its smaller typeface. In addition, given the language presently used in the brochure, few readers are likely to believe that the company is not obligated to cover its retirees following a shut-down. (HOD)",

        "description":"Twenty-two fifth-grade teachers participated in a study designed to determine whether, given typical basal text material and the opportunity to learn, the more effective classroom teachers of reading would be those who provided explicit explanations on how to use reading skills strategically when reading. The treatment group of teachers was trained in how to explain to low reading groups what strategies could be used, when they should be used, and how to apply them. The control group participated in a workshop on effective classroom management. Subsequently, the low-group reading instruction of each treatment and control teacher was observed four times at one month intervals. Students were pretested and posttested with the Gates-McGinitie Reading Achievement Test. Results  suggested that teachers were able to incorporate explanatory talk into their lessons and that this talk resulted in greater student awareness. However, no achievement gains were found. Qualitative analysis of the explanations of teachers who were more and less effective in creating awareness outcomes resulted in the identification of distinguishing descriptive characteristics of effective explanation and suggested reasons why some teachers were not more effective.

        "description":"The linguistic form of a nonliteral expression, and the context in which it occurs, can greatly influence young children's succcess or failure in assigning a meaning to a figurative expression. Experiments have shown that the same metaphorical expression can be easier to understand when expressed in a linguistic form that is familiar to young children, and thus more likely to be known given the limited linguistic knowledge of the young child. Because of this limited knowledge, children depend heavily on contextual information when they assign a meaning to a linguistic input. By hearing and trying to make sense out of metaphorical language in a variety of contexts, children can gradually become aware of the different uses of nonliteral language and of the variety of meanings they  might express. In addition, the relationship between the contextual information and the linguistic input can affect the information processing requirements of the comprehension task and thus facilitate or hinder comprehension. Furthermore, experiments have demonstrated that what matters is not so much whether a given metaphorical sentence is expressed as a simile or as a metaphor, or whether it is more or less predictable on the basis of the context, but rather the level of difficulty of that metaphorical sentence.

        "description":"Through a review of data from the Campbell-Ewald Advertising Agency and its creative director, the Chevrolet car company, and a review of the award-winning television commercials, this paper explores the successful relationship between Chevrolet and that agency from 1955 to 1965. Following an introduction and a list the questions asked about both the nature of the business relationship between these two organizations and the television and advertising environment prevalent at the time, the paper presents a brief review of previous literature on television advertising and the automobile industry. The paper next describes the nature and sources of the data reviewed, which includes five videotapes of the award-winning commercials. It then discusses the following aspects of the  relationship between Chevrolet and Campbell-Ewald, based on the materials examined: (1) the commitment of these two companies to excellence in advertising, (2) the creative environment at the advertising agency, (3) the advantages enjoyed by advertising in that era of television, (4) the size and use of Chevrolet's advertising budget, (5) conditions of the automobile market at that time, and (6) the award-winning television advertisements. The paper concludes with remarks on automobile advertising in general during this &quot;golden age&quot; of television. (HTH)",

In addition, teachers can create assignments that require writers to accomplish  real communication purposes, adopt various roles as writers, and appeal to different levels of audience.

First, customer sites are visited to interview representatives from the intended audience and see the environments in which the information will be used. Second, task analyses for new products and functions are performed before a single word is written. Third, interim drafts of manuals are tested on subjects who are similar to the target audience. This last procedure should incorporate a usability edit, not at the end of the writing effort but throughout the writing cycle. In usability edits and tests in the IBM Human Factors Laboratory, volunteer subjects are presented with a  task, the written material, and the system. Subjects are left alone but are watched from behind a one-way glass as they verbalize their way through the process. Results have shown that subjects experienced gaps and ambiguities even though the written material had gone through numerous technical reviews. Readability, then, is not only an attribute of the text but also a function of the interaction between reader and text. Usability edits may eliminate confusion and ambiguity in texts. (DF)",

Data on the use of the text were collected through interviews, requiring approximately one hour, with a sample of 19 users of the text from various segments of the industry. Questions were divided into four categories: (1) background questions involving relevant characteristics of the respondents, edition of the book used, and number of years used; (2) questions of last usage; (3) questions of general use; and (4) problems and suggestions for improvement. Results indicated  that the text was considered by most users as the reference of first resort to which they turned for information, and its scope was viewed as comprehensive. However, respondents did complain that the book did not provide them with follow-up resources--more detailed or alternative presentations. On a scale of 1 to 5 (1=very good, very useful; 5=throw it out of the window), the readers rated the book at an average of 1.8, which indicates there are ways to improve the text. In fact, respondents offered 13 recommendations for improvement. (HOD)",

Each chapter examines some aspect of the interrelations between wordplay activities and the goals of language education. The book is divided into three sections, with the first section exploring wordplay and language learning in the nursery years. It not only describes preschoolers' play with sound and the relation of such play to the task of mastering speech sounds, but it also describes how three-year-olds repeat and create language with a lilt. The second section describes wordplay and language learning during the ages of five to seven and includes jokes, riddles, and the poetic resources of language. The third section, dealing with the middle elementary years,  discusses the three types of teaching/learning experiences for exploring wordplay: appreciation through the exploration of verbal play literature, creation through the presentation of opportunities to play with particular forms, and articulation through the raising of questions regarding patterns of play. Types of play described in this section include introducing confusion in communication by using words and phrases sounding the same as or similar to other words, using metaphors, creating riddles, constructing humorous verse (such as puns and limmericks), and engaging in parody play. The concluding section discusses times for play. (EL)",

        "description":"Written for teachers who want introductions to conducting school assessments and to studying features of writing, this book is intended (1) to provide ways for teachers to analyze writing samples and the writing process for school or program assessment, and (2) to promote the development of teacher research among kindergarten through grade 12 teachers by providing examples of different ways teachers can study writing in their classrooms. The first chapter presents an overview of procedures in teacher research. The next four chapters introduce various theoretical frameworks within which researchers have been working, with each chapter discussing a different level of analysis--syntax, text, information processing, and social context. The final chapter focuses on errors, teaching  practices, and student attitudes toward writing. Appendixes contain information on the results of teacher research, evaluation designs for practitioners, sampling and statistical tests, and using expressive writing to teach biology. (EL)",

        "description":"Noting that composition teachers would like computers in order to facilitate the mechanics of writing, analyze text, and correct problems, this paper argues that classroom computer applications are limited because computers cannot analyze text the way a reader would. The paper first posits that readers look at text in terms of semantics and content while computers look at text in terms of syntax and form. It then illustrates this point by comparing spelling check programs with text analysis programs. It describes the three analysis programs--DICTION and STYLE, by Bell Labs, and the more powerful EPISTLE by IBM--and how they function, and provides output from the first two programs using the document to illustrate that the analysis is more or less useless to the writer. The paper  then discusses the possibilities that text analyzers can be made better, observing that the writer must be skilled in sorting through inaccurate output in order for the output to be of any use, and that those without such skills may be damaged as much as helped by such programs. The paper concludes with the observation that programs can be made more accurate, but that a more worthy goal would be better on-line editors, better systems for communication, and better word processors.

The mission of the writing center, which may vary from school to school, must be clearly established. The organization of the center should be examined. The simpler the internal organizational structure of the writing center, the more smoothly and efficiently it will operate. Thus, one administrator, mature and well-prepared tutors, and adequate financial compensation will create a more effective center. Appropriate facilities and tutorial materials as well as computers, must also be examined. One final factor to consider is the responsibility of the faculty to the writing center.  Ultimately, the mission of the writing center should be understood: to teach students writing skills. (DF)",

In this regard, writing about literature is a form of academic writing that shares the same assumptions as other academic writing. The problem solving activity of the literary interpreter consists of discovering, preserving, or creating complexity. While the scientist's goal may be to solve or reduce problems, the literary interpreter's goal is to preserve problems, playing with them in such a way as to preserve the importance of the text. And, unlike scientific problems that are publicly discernible, limited in number, communal, and generalizable, the problems available to the literary interpreter are comparatively undefined. If there is a continuum within academic  writing from defined to undefined problems, future research on composing needs to examine whether the predefined and well-defined problems of certain kinds of writing alter the nature of the composing process.

        "author":["Elbow, Peter"],
        "description":"Three arguments are proposed in favor of writing without an audience. The first states that even though ignoring the audience may lead to worse writing at first, it will often lead to better writing in the end. The intimidating nature of the teacher or an unknown as audience supports this. The second argument states that writing without an audience can sometimes lead to better writing immediately. The qualities of effective writing include a lack of self consciousness and total involvement with the topic. The Piagetian and Vygotskian developmental models (&quot;language begins as private&quot; versus &quot;language begins as social&quot;) give two different lenses through which to look at a typical weakness in student writing--the tendency to leave so much unexplained and undeveloped--and determine  whether this weakness is a failure to connect with the audience or a failure to connect with the self and the issue. The third argument calls into question the assumption that writing that is &quot;audience aware&quot; is more mature than writing that is not. Many professional poets, writers, and philosophers insist that their most serious work is not communication to an audience at all, but rather a commitment to language, reality, logic, and experience. These arguments imply that teachers must (1) help students not only to fit their words to an audience, but also to write in solitude, without dependence on social interchange; and (2) become a special kind of audience for students, one that trusts and supports them without being judgmental.

Revisions were then counted and categorized according to linguistic size (sentence level, phrase level, and lexical level) and according to operation (addition, deletion, and reordering). Results did not show an increase across grade levels in the average number of revisions nor an increase in the number of types of revisions students used. Although the frequency and variety of revisions remained constant across grade level,  size of revision did not. The eleventh grade students made many more subsentence-level revisions and many fewer sentence-level revisions.

Since focus was on the performative dimensions of the culture, 38 people were formally interviewed, along with more than 100 on an informal basis, in an effort to discern the meaning that particular social actions have for the participants. The hypothesis was that by tracing the oral performances of a middle-aged Gallegan woman, using a year-long participant-observation methodology, her cultural world would be revealed. Culture, for this study, was defined as a group of people possessing a distinctive way of thinking that is in turn transmitted to the young. Analyses of  the data collected show that a stranger can correctly anticipate scenes in which the leading characters place high value on behaving with a deep sense of responsibility to their families; on obeying the moral structures of the community; on being thrifty, hardworking, and practical in order to achieve self-sufficiency; on having some skepticism of authority and things not directly experienced, yet assuming no conflict with the teaching of the Catholic Church; and on exhibiting in public a wide range of emotions from anger to laughter.

What is needed are theories, concepts, and methods that would provide for such learning. One avenue of approach is to search for models and metaphors that would allow for an encompassing comprehension of empathy and empathic communication--moving away from traditional frameworks that anchor empathic notions on the concept of dialogue. Another avenue of approach is to recognize empathic communication as a multichannel process, involving both verbal and nonverbal messages and cues. A final avenue of approach is to study high empathic communicators to determine what philosophies underlie their empathic behavior, and thereby provide effective role models. Of  course these three approaches only scratch the surface of what might be done in the exploration of emphathic communication development. Since it is clear that empathy is a multidimensional cognitive-affective-social macroprocess, nothing less than multimethodological approaches are likely to suffice. (HOD)",

The PRCA-OF is a 20-item, 5-point, Likert-type, self-report questionnaire. The scale scores range from a minimum of 20 to a maximum of 100. Four sets of scores were obtained: rater, peer, self, and supervisor. The assessment center exercises included a decision game, dyadic interview, and in-basket simulation. Multiple regression equations were used, with communication scores as the dependent variable, to analyze the relationship between the  PRCA-OF scores and the other assessment center scores. Convergent validity was found for the PRCA-OF in both the rater and self categories. It was concluded that a valid measure of communication apprehension, specifically the PRCA-OF, should be included in managerial assessment centers and that training in performance evaluation should be mandatory.

These conditions crossed two levels of content cues with two levels of sound effects before and after a dream segment in the program. The content cue condition provided 20 seconds of supplementary information, which indicated that a dream was occurring while the no content cue condition did not. The content/no content cue conditions were either preceded or not preceded by a sound effect which marked these program transitions. Visual attention was videotaped during each child's individual viewing session. After viewing, each  child answered a 22 item multiple-choice recognition test of inferential, central-concrete, and incidental information and then ordered picture sets of events photographed from the awake, dream, and whole program segments.

        "description":"A study was conducted to compare the communication apprehension levels of Puerto Rican college students with those of United States college students. The Puerto Rican students were considered bilingual, having received instruction in English as a second language for most of their school years. In the first phase of the study, 341 students who reported Spanish as their native language completed a measure of communication apprehension. A year later, 661 students with Spanish as their native language completed the same apprehension instrument. Subjects also were asked to rate their perceived competence in English. These scores were compared to mean scores on the communication apprehension report from nearly 20,000 American students. The results indicated that the Puerto Rican  students were much less apprehensive about communicating in their native language than they were about communicating in English. The findings also indicated that apprehension in a first language is a much better predictor of apprehension in a second language than is self-perceived competence in that second language. The results suggest that the problem of communication apprehension must be addressed by second language instructors if students are to be taught to be truly bilingual. (HTH)",

        "description":"A review of current literature regarding the state of the art in the conduct of internal communication and public relations audits by public relations practitioners reveals that these two related measurement activities are of considerable importance to the practice of public relations. Public relations audits are concerned with exploratory research on relations between an organization and its public. Internal communications audits describe and assess the process and structure of communication within an organization. Both types of audits are used by public relations practitioners in managing communication activities of organizations, but they serve distinctly different functions, reflecting divergent origins and perspectives. Open systems theory is used to distinguish the two  different functions of the audits. A public relations audit is a boundary spanning activity that measures the public's attitudes, levels, and behaviors affecting an organization's survival and growth. An internal communication audit is concerned with the structure and function of the system. Because an organization has less control over its external environment than its internal systems, the public relations audit is of greater importance than the internal communication audit. (DF)",

The paper first examines the facets of activity, giving recognition to the psychologist Raymond Bauer, who created the phrase &quot;active audience.&quot; Its other sections discuss the meaning of activity, internalized freedom and cognitive activity, the rift between conscious and the unconscious processing, and a more modest appraisal of activity. The paper  concludes by noting that the concept of active audience defined as cognitive independence, personal freedom, and imperviousness to influence appears simultaneously to be bloated out of all proportion and seemingly anemic and thin.

Specifically, the study investigated whether it is communication apprehension or self-concept or some combination of the two that prevents students from using videotapes to improve speech skills. Subjects, 217 speech students, completed the Personal Report of Communication Apprehension, the Tennessee Self-Concept scale, and an instrument gauging students' views about being videotaped during speech class. Results suggested that students were bothered by the idea of videotaping but thought it would be a good idea even if it did bother them. It also seemed that the immediate prospect of being videotaped was more troublesome than it  might have been later in the semester. A possible explanation for the results of this study is that there is very little relationship between the level of communication apprehension and self-concept. It is suggested that apprehension of videotaping may be no more than a specialized form of communication apprehension. (DF)",

Steps toward understanding the listening problem, outlined in the third portion of the paper, include finding an area of interest, being flexible about notetaking, and working at listening. Sample lessons and activities that  present listening as an enjoyable challenge are discussed in the fourth section, while five suggestions for developing listening as a study skill are presented in the fifth section.

Subjects were 242 international students from 45 countries who completed two versions of a communication apprehension instrument, one to assess feelings of apprehension associated with speaking in the subject's native language, the other for apprehension about speaking in English. Data were also collected on subjects' sex, number of years speaking English, number of years in the mainland United States, and place of ethnic origin. The results  indicated that Middle Eastern and European subjects reported levels of apprehension well below norms previously established by U.S. subjects, while Asian and Latin American subjects reported levels just slightly below those norms when communicating in their native languages. All groups indicated that CA was more of a problem in English, with Asians and Latin Americans reporting the highest levels. Females were slightly more apprehensive overall when communicating in either language, but women in the Latin American sample reported less apprehension than males in every context except public speaking. Neither the subjects' number of years speaking English nor the length of time living in the United States correlated with CA, suggesting that neither competency nor skill in a second language  is related to the amount of trait apprehension experienced by bilingual speakers in varying contexts.

The underlying notion of professionalism in teaching is first discussed as a context for justifying the further exploration of the possibilities of a professional code for teachers. An endeavor is made to clarify the form that a professional code might take by comparing it with the code of practice established by the Advertising Standards Authority in respect of advertisements directed at or portraying children. The content of such a code is discussed, along with how that content may be modified. Finally, the question of the status of such a code is addressed, with particular  emphasis on whether it should be legal or moral. It is argued that such a professional code should primarily have a moral status, but that it should be promulgated as an enabling device under administrative law. (TE)",

Manning theory and social control theory, taken together, predict that larger schools will experience more disruption because a smaller proportion of the student population will be involved in meaningful activities. In addition, previous research suggests that larger schools experience more disorder because they cannot be managed as effectively as small schools due to communication problems. This study uses regression analyses and case studies of schools that underwent shifts in enrollment to examine the tenability of each of the foregoing perspectives. Results imply that school  size is related to school safety, and that administrative problems in large schools, such as breakdown in communication, inadequate feedback about performance, and lack of staff involvement in decision-making, are likely to link school size to school disorder. The results lend no support, however, to speculations that school disorder arises in large schools because they are more impersonal than small schools.(Author/TE)",

Results of the estimations are discussed, and several simulations are used to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative policies and to forecast the teacher market supply. Findings indicate that personal characteristics strongly affect individuals' willingness to teach, and that increasing teacher salaries and/or decreasing supervision of  teachers will increase the pool of teacher applicants.

Part 2 rests on the assumption that teachers as a  profession are motivated by values and beliefs that have little relevance to children raised in the electronic age. To serve these children, the teaching profession will need to adapt to a new set of working principles, shifting their role from disseminators of knowledge to collaborators in learning. Part 3 focuses on the immediate concerns that confront educators. Elements for successful reform described in the literature are reviewed and linked to existing models of growth and change that can serve as bridges to the major structural changes in educational systems that many believe will be necessary to meet the needs of contemporary learners. One model is the Waterford School (Orem, Utah), a private K-12 school participating in the research, development, and implementation of electronic  educational materials and methods. conclusion sets forth a five-point agenda of critical tasks for the educational community. Seven pages of notes and bibliography conclude the document. (TE)",

Performance graphs are presented and discussion is devoted to individualized adaptations of positioning and apparatus. Findings revealed that 18 of the 26 Ss learned to use a switch to produce interesting consequences. Three of the 18 also learned to distinguish between two switches to reliably use the switch which  produced consequences. A second finding was a possible relationship between the pattern of switch use that the children displayed and their cognitive level. There was a modest tendency for pupils to operate the switches with increasing selectivity as their level of sensorimotor functioning increased. Software used in the project is appended. (CL)",

A hybrid methodology was employed to identify existing technology and forecast future needs. Following this framework, each of the technologies is defined, considered in terms of the state of the art, discussed according to ratings of scenarios by a panel of technology and special education experts; and predictions are made for the likelihood of those scenarios. Near-term applications are identified: an object and mechanical device manipulating robot to help students perform independently daily living or vocational activities (robotics); a clinical diagnostic expert system to help in screening,  diagnosis, and placement (artificial intelligence); and a personal management simulator to teach students about practical living skills (computer simulation). A series of eight conclusions are offered, including that certain applications of artificial intelligence and computer simulation appear more promising, in the foreseeable future, than those in robotics; that some significant technical and cost barriers exist; and that most of these barriers are generic to all applications of the technologies, not solely to special education settings.

The research strategy involved (1) detailed analyses of the behavior of subgroups of LD adolescents and of matched normal achieving adolescents in a task requiring the use of complex reasoning skills; (2) a detailed follow-up of the progress made by individuals exhibiting specific reasoning difficulties over a series of individually designed instructional sessions; and (3) the development of materials to help LD practitioners diagnose and remediate reasoning deficits in adolescents. Three LD subgroups were identified and their performances compared with three non-LD control groups: no  discrepancy (ND) LD, low verbal (VL) LD, and low performance (LP) LD. Comparisons were made among subgroups and with same age and younger controls. The intervention phase was designed to explore the utility of a single-subject design and a Piagetian clinical interview strategy for remediating reasoning and problem solving demands. Among findings were that the three LD subgroups demonstrated differential performance on the bending rods task, LD Ss performed more like ninth grade than fourth grade controls, and performance of ND and LV Ss was mixed. It was concluded that not all LD adolescents have difficulties with reasoning and problem solving skills, and that the specific nature of the dificulties varies as a function of the type of LD and of the task demands.

        "description":"Special education teachers (N=167), teacher trainees (N=122), and administrators (N=8) responded to questionnaires regarding their commitment to acquiring basic microcomputer skills. Teachers believed that they were worth more than their current salaries, and that districts could afford to pay them more to aid them in, and as a reward for, the acqusisition of new skills. Administrators, however, believed that the districts had difficulties paying teachers more. Teachers' interest in microcomputers was matched to their desire to enroll in coursework to learn these skills. Administrators were equally interested but did not view coursework as the approach of choice. Teachers considered that microcomputer skills were related to instruction of handicapped children more clearly than  did teacher trainees. Administrators perceived different uses for microcomputers than either group. Teachers wanted at least part of the course costs paid by their districts. Deterrants to learning microcomputer skills included shortage of time, time conflicts, and doubts about microcomputer availability. (CL)",

The paper presents recommendations for identification and placement (such as developing explicit policy  in &quot;child find,&quot; and classifying special education referral as a last resort), for programs (including clear policy describing the primacy of language), and for professional development (such as specific training for bilingual and limited English proficient students).

The initial section, on performance objectives, reviews the development of the Vocational Behavior Checklist and the Subsequent Independent Living Behavior Checklist. The next step in the overall model, task analysis, is considered in terms of choosing task specificity. Instructional research is summarized according to sequence (backward chaining, forward chaining, whole task), mode of prompts (verbal, visual, physical, olfactory, gustatory), placement of prompts (pre-response and error correction), and quality of prompts (stimulus prompts and response prompts). The three aspects are integrated, and implications are  drawn for teaching independence skills to handicapped populations. Among the implications are that specific performance objectives facilitate teaching and learning; that task analysis with more steps may be more helpful than task analysis with fewer steps; and that trainers could more efficiently train complex skills through the use of systematic procedures.

The findings suggest that lexical acquisition is an intricate process which often requires more than simple mappings of forms onto categories, and that children's search for convention is very persistent. Children often conform to convention by modifying and refining their semantic categories on the basis of input data even though they have already mapped the items onto \"good\" conceptual categories, and they seem to continue their search for convention long after they have attained good productive control over the items, and when there is no communicative need to persist.

The examination focused on the nominal reference system characterized by plurifunctionality and syncretism. Data were drawn from two cross-sectional studies of bilingual immigrant children in West Berlin in which the sociopolitical setting is considered along with the psycholinguistic investigation. The age groups were 8-15 years and 5-12 years. Monolingual German and Turkish control groups were used in the second study. The  children's production of definite and indefinite markers during lengthy interviews using a variety of psycho- and sociolinguistic methodologies was analyzed. The data suggest that, while the individual learner's approach to plurifunctional items is systematic, individual interlanguage systems differ from each other. Further research into the points at which the various functions of plurifunctional items become the focus for individual learners is recommended. (MSE)",

Naturalistic language used by the children and their parents, videotaped during regular visits, was analyzed for utterance length and vocabulary and for changes in these factors over time. Significant individual differences could not be explained by simple applications of cognitive theory. Application of a theoretical framework that distinguishes between analytic and holistic processing strategies to explain similarities and differences between the children puts into question the surface validity of some of the objective measures used in  language development research. It is suggested that individual differences in development demand a more refined approach than the generalist approaches used in recent years. (MSE)",

        "description":"A study of the awareness of verb transitivity in the spontaneous speech of two two-year-old native speakers of Quiche was accomplished by examining three factors: transitive terminations given to verbs, subject markers on the verbs, and syntax. The first was studied by counting the number of transitive verbs used with both transitive and intransitive terminations and studying the error patterns. The results indicated an extremely early control of verb transitivity with little of the overgeneralization seen with other forms. The second factor was examined through error patterns in subject agreement, which provided less rich but supporting evidence for early grasp of transitivity. The third factor, syntax, was found to be less easy to assess because of the relative absence of  non-focused, non-emphatic noun phrases in Quiche. However, some evidence supporting early acquisition of transitivity was found in the children's utterances. The early acquisition of this awareness is somewhat surprising in light of the relative lack of evidence of transitivity in adult speech in Quiche. (MSE)",

        "description":"Two studies examined the development of major properties of reflexives and pronouns in English language acquisition by applying the theory of binding of reflexives and pronouns to potential antecedents in the sentence. The children ranged in age from 2.6 to 6.6 years. In the first experiment, the children were presented with two pictures and were asked which corresponded to a specific possessive construction. The constructions used either a reflexive sentence or a pronoun sentence, each having a different antecedent. The second exeriment used the same task, but with test sentences containing an additional prepositional construction. The third study used an acting-out task similar to a Simon-says game, adding linguistic complexity. The results suggest that children acquire the  structural principles governing reflexives gradually and steadily, but that even at the upper end of this age range, they commit many violations of the principles governing pronouns and they show very little improvement from the youngest to the oldest. The findings suggest that, while the essential grammatical knowledge exists in children from an early age, the pragmatic factors are learned later, and performance subsequently improves. This supports the lexical learning hypothesis and a simpler theory of binding. (MSE)",

SLVs provide some of the clearest evidence of sociocultural determination of language variation, on both micro- and macro-levels. An adequate account of these varieties calls for the descriptive techniques and explanatory power of the variationist, interactionist, and sociology of language paradigms within sociolinguistic theory.

Also examined are techniques used to evaluate the plan and to determine the relevance of the revised curriculum to community health needs. After presenting information on primary health care that relates to community nursing education, four phases of curriculum review and development are examined in detail. The first step in carrying out the review is to identify key attributes of community-oriented nursing. The school's curriculum and current program objectives should then be analyzed to determine needs for revision. While implementing changes in the teaching plan at the course level involves only a few teaching personnel,  systematic curriculum revision involves policy changes, teacher preparation, and the development of new resources. Implementing the plan for changes requires the development of content, learning experiences, and course evaluation mechanisms. One aspect of evaluating the effectiveness of the changes is to monitor student competence, course content, and program effectiveness. Appendices include a report on how a nursing school adapted the guide, and protocols for applying health care processes to individuals, families, and community risk groups. (SW)",

After tracing the history of the trustees' efforts to revise the faculty structure since 1961, the report compares the university's current salary schedule to those of comparison institutions. The way the comparison colleges allocated increased 1984-1985 salary funds is also described. Problems with the university's salary structure and ways that it differs from comparison institutions are: (1) it lacks salary overlap among its three ranks; (2) it has short salary ranges for each of these ranks; (3) it has only five salary steps within each of these ranges; (4) it is unable to recognize market differences among most disciplines; and (5) it offers only limited recognition of meritorious  service. The following deleterious effects of the university's salary structure on faculty hiring and promotion are identified: excessive hiring of faculty at advanced ranks; virtually automatic salary increases; compaction of the faculty at the highest professorial step; and noncompetitive salaries in high-demand disciplines and high costs in other fields. Finally, changes that could improve the salary structure and salary administration of the university are identified. (SW)",

        "description":"The characteristics of California's Student Aid Commission grant program applicants and recipients were examined to assess the extent to which aid programs meet state goals. Attention is directed to major problems confronting the three Cal Grant programs and a range of possible policy and program options. The three programs are: Cal Grant A State Scholarship Program; Cal Grant B Opportunity Grant Program, and Cal Grant C Occupational Training Grant Program. Policy options for the number and size of grants, eligibility requirements, the distribution of grants, and improved procedures are addressed, along with the question of program consolidation of the financial aid programs. Ten major trends concerning the aid programs, student applicants, and grant recipients are identified,  including: increasing competition for available awards; low rates of application completion, particularly in the Cal Grant B program; little increase in applications and declines in eligible applicants for private institutions; relative declines in middle-income applicants; an increasing gap between number of grants and number of financially needy applicants; an increasing impact of eligibility limitations; and a reduced proportion of awards to new high school graduates.

Small subject-related files for current-awareness purposes are downloaded from the ERIC tapes and are made available for searching with Apple II Plus microcomputers. Since the target audience for this system is non-online searchers, a user interface has been developed which simplifies searching and uses a formatted screen to guide users through the search process. The small amount of material which can be stored on a 5 and 1/4 inch diskette has been compensated for in part by the subject-matter orientation of the individual discs and in part by providing supplementary programs which permit the contents of the discs to be printed, thus producing a  bibliography with extensive indexes. Field-testing of MICROsearch has guided its current endeavors--the provision of record entry program to permit local files to be created which can also be searched with MICROsearch, and the development of a special user interface for teaching searching.

        "description":"A review is provided of &quot;Literacy in the Open-Access College,&quot; by Richardson, Fisk, and Okum, from the perspective of community college practitioners involved in curriculum reform. First, introductory information is presented about &quot;Literacy in the Open-Access College,&quot; an analysis based on a 3-year ethnographic study of a typical college within a large, multi-campus community college system. The study found that the traditional role of written language in the intellectual formation of students has dropped away without any equivalent form of communication being substituted in the curriculum. The community college, according to Richardson et al, is structured to promote &quot;bitting&quot; (i.e., the use of reading and writing to understand or produce fragmented language when the student is  presented with specific external cues) as opposed to &quot;texting&quot; (i.e., the use of reading and writing to comprehend or compose connected language). As such, the college will inevitably produce students with restricted literacy skills who are socialized to conceive of education as a series of experiences in which they are to memorize discrete bits of information. Other topics of the book that are highlighted include: (1) the relationship of the nature of classroom behavior to broad district-level policy decisions; (2) the relationship of classroom practices with the ongoing negotiations taking place between faculty and students; and (3) the downward renegotiation of norms of literate activity. Next, the paper takes issue with the book's conclusions with respect to &quot;bitting&quot; or &quot;texting&quot;  policy alternatives, arguing that an understanding of the trend toward &quot;bitting&quot; in curricula should be based on an analysis of how the culture has come to represent education to itself and how that conception has become embedded in society's institutions; and suggesting methods of reconceptualizing the functions of education to truly democratize higher education.

        "description":"A discussion is provided of key elements in the success of cooperative programs between high schools and colleges. First, traditional approaches to collaboration, such as the the development of high school courses by university teachers, are reviewed; differences in the cultures of the high school and the college are specified; and the broad range of options available to educators who are willing to accept the need for structural reform and to use the needs of the student as a guide is introduced. Next, the paper looks at factors that are important to successful collaboration, including: (1) the identification of a faculty member with a sense of mission and established credibility to design a realistic program which can gain the approval of authorities at each level of the  system; and (2) the development of a program which offers benefits to both institutions. Then, the paper discusses the need for structural changes to ensure effective collaboration, focusing on mastery learning, lowered student/faculty ratios, limited school size, design of courses for the average as well as the exceptional student, and the inclusion of remedial programs within the curriculum. The final sections specify methods of enhancing the high school/college relationship, and the optimum methods of program evaluation. (HB)",

        "description":"This report, the first statewide master plan for postsecondary education in Alaska, outlines strategies and recommendations to achieve the following planning goals: (1) promote excellence to improve educational service; (2) enhance accountability of the educational process; (3) foster efficiency within the enterprise; and (4) improve access to those citizens who desire postsecondary education. Following an executive summary of goals and strategies, an introductory section traces the growth of postsecondary education in Alaska, discusses the dilemma of declining revenues, explains the master planning process and the goals of the master plan, and discusses the organization of the report. Chapter I explains the underlying assumptions about the planning period from 1986 to 1990,  including rapid rates of population growth in selected areas, the continued availability of the Alaska Student Loan Program, increasing enrollments at the University of Alaska, declining state funding for education, and growth in the coal, mining, fishery, and tourism industries. Chapter II looks at the present state of postsecondary education in Alaska, identifying all existing institutions by type. Chapter III provides a brief overview and explanation of each goal of the master plan, and chapter IV presents the strategies for attaining each goal. (AYC)",

        "description":"An analysis is provided of patterns of community college enrollments between 1970 and 1980, with particular emphasis on variations among the states in enrollment and completion rates. Section I looks at recent trends in community colleges, focusing on enrollment, numbers of degrees conferred, vocational enrollments, curriculum changes, and the effects of economic and labor market conditions. Section II identifies possible causes of enrollment patterns, focusing on demand-related factors, such as direct costs, high-status employment opportunities, and access; supply-related factors, including tax capacity, educational attainment levels, and migration; and demographic factors. Section III analyzes the relationship between the demand- and supply-related variables and community  college enrollments, section IV looks at the interaction of two- and four-year college enrollments, and section V examines the determinants of degrees conferred. Finally, section VI draws conclusions, including the following: (1) community college enrollments were only weakly related to labor market conditions; (2) prospective students were more sensitive to direct costs than to the earnings benefits of attending community colleges; (3) the state's overall tax effort and the educational level of the population influenced community college enrollments; (4) enrollment patterns tended to perpetuate themselves over time, regardless of other economic or political conditions; (5) completion rates tended to be less responsive to economic conditions than enrollment rates; (6) states with high  levels of four-year college enrollments tended to have lower two-year college enrollments; and (6) several economic variables, such as the earnings differentials associated with higher education and the opportunity cost of attending community college, were more significant influences among women than among men.

The student ratings of these faculty members were compared with the ratings given to mathematics faculty and to all other faculty teaching that term. On all three evaluation criteria (i.e., encourages help, grades fairly, and stimulates interest), instructors in computer studies were rated lower than the other two faculty groups. To address the problems revealed by the study, several workshops were organized and administrative procedures were instituted to improve the teaching-learning process in computer studies. A coordinator was assigned to review course syllabi for mandatory features; convene regular faculty meetings to discuss  curricular issues; serve as an advisor for textbook selection; and act as a resource for faculty members. Workshops were organized on presentation skills, syllabus construction, and individualized learning styles and their impact on teaching.

The process was to be modeled on the 3-year planning cycle developed by the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems and to use the college's existing organizational structure. Since November 1981, the planning process at the college has been accelerating. A long-range institutional plan was developed using the college's Self-Study Report as the basis for first-year assumptions. A Planning Council was established as the pivotal committee for the planning process. In order to simplify and focus the planning efforts that had been initiated as part of the self-study process, the Planning Council undertook a five-phase process: Phase 1: Review and Appraisal, which  examines the role and scope of the college, develops planning assumptions upon which the institution's goals are prioritized, and provides information on the service region, college funding, student profiles, facilities and resources, staffing, programs and services, and governance; Phase 2: Divisional Goals, during which faculty and staff meet with deans and department heads to establish divisional goals; Phase 3: Reformatting, which involves a review of divisional goals and their statement as measurable objectives; Phase 4: Approval by the President; and Phase 5: Renewal of the Process. The broad-based goals and objectives that are articulated in the resulting planning document establish priorities for budgetary expenditures and personnel allocations. (HB)",

After a statement of the issues of funding equity within the area college system and among the other postsecondary educational segments in the state, a historical overview is provided of the area college system and the funding mechanisms that have been used to support it. The next section provides a fiscal analysis in terms of types of revenue, types of expenditures, methods of distributing funds, and the issues of equity that are inherent in the collection and disbursement of funds supporting the system. An organizational analysis is then provided of  the roles played by the state legislature, the Department of Public Instruction, the Presidents' Association, and the Trustees' Association with respect to the funding of the colleges. A legal analysis of cases that have come to court in other states to address the issue of funding equity is followed by a discussion of the process of resolving the issue of funding equity. Finally, a solution to the funding question is proposed, along with a discussion of the impact that the implementation of this solution would have on services. Appendices provide financial data, an extensive report on the fiscal development of area schools (Iowa State Department of Public Instruction), relevant state legislation, and a map. (AYC)",

First, a discussion of learning styles is presented, focusing on the cognitive, affective, and physiological aspects of the learning process and situation. Next, the paper addresses the issue of the development of individual cognitive style, stressing that teachers can influence style changes in students. In the next section, the relationship between teaching and learning style is addressed, indicating that instructors tend to prefer to teach the way they prefer to learn unless a conscious effort is made to do otherwise; that choice of teaching area seems to be somewhat dependent upon personal learning style; that left-brain oriented instructors tend to be more  systematic, structured, and organized, while right-brain oriented instructors tend to be more flexible, group-oriented, and creative; and that teachers should understand their own teaching and learning styles to be able to modify their approach depending on the circumstances at hand. A brief overview of brain research with respect to learning styles is followed by a series of suggestions for teachers to help them recognize different aspects of learners. Next, research on the effectiveness and desirability of matching teaching and learning styles is reviewed. Concluding comments suggest that instructors make the instructional changes which allow students a better opportunity to learn and to be more responsible for their own learning. (AYC)",

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to describe a specific method of measuring fathers' childrearing involvement. The conceptual scheme underlying the method addresses involvement in routine child care, play with the child, and school-related interactions. Measures involved the father's share of childrearing (as compared with the mother's) and the father's individual interaction frequency in each area of involvement. The sample, 70 non-black fathers of 6-year-olds, was drawn from the larger database of the Comparative Ecology of Human Development Project at Cornell University. Overall, among child development, socioeconomic, family demographic, and employment variables, the report card scores of male children were most related to measures of interaction frequency with the father.  Father's reported interaction frequency with female children was not found to be positively related to report card scores. Family background variables appeared to be related primarily to the father-mother relationship. Fathers with greater education and white-collar occupations took a greater share of routine child care tasks and school-related responsibilities than did men with less education and blue-collar occupations. As compared with mothers, fathers with more children tended to take a smaller share in involvement with each child.

In addition to basic questions of cost, incidence of school-age children's enrollment in the ECS program, and educational impact of delayed or second-year enrollment in ECS programs, questions were raised concerning the following issues: cut-off dates for grade 1 enrollment, person(s) responsible for the decision to delay ECS enrollment, number of second year ECS enrollments based on formal testing results, tests used, type of ECS programming required by immature children, the child's entitlement to ECS before grade 1, and financial responsibility after a year of ECS programming. A total of 383 surveys were mailed; 281 were sent to private ECS operators  and 102 were sent to public jurisdictions. A total of 299 surveys were returned. Findings and conclusions are reported, and recommendations with accompanying rationales are offered. Appended materals include related policy statements, a copy of the survey instrument, actual and projected enrollment figures for school-age children in ECS programs, cut-off dates for grade 1 enrollment, frequencies by zone of persons making the decision to place immature children, a list of tests used in placement decisions, and information about respondents' points of view on the enrollment of immature children in ECS programs.

The writing tasks were handled the same way. Paper and markers were provided and behavior noted. In addition, the boy was administered a print awareness test. Behaviors observed included playful learning; self-initiated, controlled, and terminated activity; exploratory and discovery behaviors; responses and behaviors that are multi-sensory in nature; and specific behaviors associated with reading and writing activities. Concerning reading, it was found that (1) parents respond positively to the  child's reading and writing attempts; (2) the language arts are integrated even at this early age; (3) the child's reading and writing behaviors are context-dependent; (4) the child's early attempts are approximations which are continually refined; (5) reading and writing concepts are defined in active behaviors, such as pointing, touching, looking, glancing, etc.; and (6) family literacy events stimulate the child's interest in reading and writing.

        "description":"Described in the context of a computer simulation are highlights of a program of research focusing on the storage of mathematics problem solving information in young children's memory and the development of such knowledge structures in older children. Specifically discussed are the problem size effect, the network nature of the memory representation, the development of addition knowledge, and predictions of automatic and conscious retrieval. These topics are broached in relation to a four-stage process model incorporating encoding, search/compute, decision, and response stage processes and two general classes of information stored in memory: a network of stored facts and knowledge about arithmetic. Discussion centers primarily on the network of stored facts, or declarative  knowledge component of the model. It was found that the model successfully simulates the pattern of results found in developmental studies of simple arithmetic. The model itself derives from reasonable assumptions about the nature of human memory organization and processes. An especially noteworthy feature of the model is that the same fundamental mechanism, learning, accounts for all four aspects of the model. With learning comes first a representation of arithmetic knowledge in a network-node structure, and then a strengthening of those nodes across development. Retrieval from the network depends directly on node strength, and becomes more automatic as strength reaches asymptotic values. (RH)",

        "description":"A 2-part investigation was conducted to examine the ways children resolve the inherent ambiguity of spatial descriptions in terms of cues indicated by the three constituents of spatial propositions: predicate, referent, and relatum. In the first study, it was hypothesized that certain objects, structural markers, and definite articles accompanying the predicate would increase the incidence of intrinsic object-related interpretations of spatial descriptions. A total of 30 male and 30 female subjects participated in the study. Of these, 45 were nursery school children in three age groups (mean ages of 3.3, 4.5, and 6r.5 years). Participating adults ranged in age from 19 to 62 years. Tasks included two verbal items to assess the use of definiteness in linguistic referencing and 24  items to examine the interpretations of ambiguous spatial descriptions. Findings indicated that, in contrast to the other groups, young children's interpretations of spatial locatives rely most heavily on the intrinsic features of the objects being manipulated. Although the 5-year-olds' responses were different from those of the two younger groups, their performance was not like that of adults. Accordingly, a second study was conducted to follow changes across the next 2 years. Mean ages of the 23 males and 22 females assigned to three age groups were 5.6, 6.9, and 7.9. Different cues were found to be relevant for the different ages examined. The 5-year-olds responded according to the object and the marker, while the 6- and 7-year-olds responded according to the presence of the definite  article in the predicate. (RH)",

The task consisted in tracking the horizontal displacement of a target spot on the screen by appropriate forearm rotations. Each subject participated in two sessions: first, at a .8 Hz target frequency and, at least 48 hours later, at a .2 Hz target frequency. In all cases, the performances were recorded during 35 full cycles of target movement. Subjects were 50 children 5 through 9 years of age. Results indicated the existence of a 90 degree phase lag at .8 Hz for the younger groups which, with increasing age, approaches monotonically the adult performance. Two control experiments, exploring the role of the velocity of the  stimulus on performance, further investigated the basic characteristics of performance at the age of 6. It is concluded that the tracking of sinewaves by children depends dramatically on target frequency. The acquisition of this skill cannot be adequately described as a monotonic maturational process. One major modification appears at the age of 6 years in the strategy of perceptuo-motor coordination. This modification is relative to the control of the velocity of the movement only in case of spatio-temporal constraints. Two tables and five figures are appended. (RH)",

By contrast, this study examined eight ad hoc play groups of mixed ages (6 and 7 years) and same gender at three levels of social organization: individual status, mutual dyads, and mutual triads. A total of 96 children in groups of 12 nominated three most- and least-liked peers before and after 10 consecutive weeks of after school free-play sessions. Significant age differences occurred in the Age X Gender X Time ANOVAs: at the individual status level, older children were more socially visible. At the mutual levels, older children had more friends and enemies and more triadic relations. No age differences occurred for social preference, or for the categories of popular, rejected, neglected,  controversial, or average status. Age also played a significant role in the composition of dyads and triads: 87 percent or more of mutual liking dyads and 100 percent of triads were between same-age children. The 10-week stabilities of status were quite similar to those reported for classrooms. Preference was more stable than visibility. Rejected status was the most stable and neglected status the least. Mutual liking dyads were more stable (54 percent) than disliking dyads (30 percent). Triads were rare and unstable. Gender had no appreciable impact on social relations. (Author/RH)",

Assumptions for conducting research and allowing for interpretation and integration of findings are specified and discussed. These assumptions include the following ideas: (1) that fundamentally important behaviors can be seen in conflict situations; (2) that all behavior must be viewed with the past history of the subject in mind; (3) that important manipulative skills can be noted directly and that covert behavior can be inferred by  an observer who has been engaged in an extensive longitudinal study; (4) that only unobtrusive observations used to interpret the behavior of single subjects will be unbiased; (5) that all behavior is directly or indirectly interactive with the environment, is homeostatic, or works toward homeostasis and that all species-typical behavioral developments are adaptive; (6) that all behaviors must be construed &quot;within the subject's perceptual-thought system&quot;; and (7) that interpretation involves comparing present behaviors with similar past behaviors and interpreting them in terms of various possible types of behaviors and in terms of specified mechanisms of change.

Parents and caretakers were interviewed, and observations were made of children's physical and social environments. Findings of these investigations revealed differences in the quality of life provided by the different forms of care. Each child was then observed in and out of the home setting and was administered standardized tests. Data suggested eight measures reflecting developmental competencies: autonomy, social reciprocity with mother, social knowledge, sociability with adult  stranger, sociability with an unfamiliar peer, negative behavior to peer, social competence at home, and cognitive ability. Different day care forms were found to be associated with patterns of competence in the children exposed to them. For example, the educational orientation of the nursery school was reflected in advanced cognition and adult-oriented competence, whereas children with untrained sitters in their own home excelled in no domain of competence. Relationships in the data were further analyzed to explore how behavior of individual children was related to features of in-home and center programs. Evidence was found that, while day care programs had some direct effects on development, they clearly were not operating alone. (RH)",

The principles are: (1) intellectual rights of children include access to ideas and freedom of expression; (2) denial of rights on the basis of lack of competence requires empirical justification; and (3) denial of rights on the basis of lack of competence yields an obligation to facilitate intellectual development. The analysis is both legal and psychological. The legal analysis focuses on the intellectual rights that are guaranteed by the First Amendment and the extent to which the First Amendment applies to children. Although the analysis is consistent with a number of judicial decisions, the emphasis is not on rights children have been legally granted but on rights children have in  principle as U.S. citizens protected by the Bill of Rights. Similarly, the psychological analysis attempts to show what sort of empirical evidence is relevant to children's intellectual rights and how such evidence can be brought to bear on specific issues. The principles developed are applied to four major educational controversies of the 1980s: censorship and indoctrination, &quot;scientific&quot; creationism, state regulation of private education, and the Equal Access Act of 1984.

The number of eligible migrant children registered in school increased by 4%; the number of students receiving services dropped 23% due to improved coordination between the Migrant Program and other state and federal programs. Fifty-three percent of the students were from 5 to 9 years old. Approximately 40% of students served received instruction in a language other than English. Migrant projects provided/coordinated educational, health and social services for students; inservice training for staff; and activities to  encourage parent involvement. Former students gained an average 3.8 Normal Curve Equivalents (NCEs) in reading and 5.4 NCEs in math. Fifteen migrant summer programs served 2,055 students. Recommendations included continued efforts to register all eligible migrant children; continued efforts to coordinate migrant programs and services with other programs, district staff and parents; improved technical support particularly in information gathering and record keeping; and continued assistance in reading. Figures displaying statistical information are included within narration. Appendix provides excerpts from the 1984 Migrant Health Report, Colorado Department of Health. (PM)",

Focusing on poverty and coal mining in Kentucky, the second paper, by Cynthia L. Duncan and William A. Duncan, supports community-oriented development policies. The third paper, by Joe B. Stevens, provides an historical overview of the Pacific Northwest's economy; discusses the current status of forest, human, and community resources with a focus on poverty; and, through operationalizing  the concept of &quot;income distribution,&quot; suggests that multiple definitions are needed to examine the impact of forest-related policies. Focusing on blacks, the final case study, by T. T. Williams, Richard Morse, and Avery Webber, is concerned with the impact of government policies on minority rural land ownership, management, and use. After a brief history, the paper looks at contemporary black rural land tenure in the South and suggests implementation of policies designed to strengthen the capability of small farmers to increase their total output, thus enhancing economic viability of black farmers. Comments focus briefly on major points from the case studies and suggest areas for further investigation. (PM)",

Studying the relationship between rural poverty and water resources in the Southwest, the first paper, by Helen Ingram and five others, examines how water is important to the poor and basic preconditions to improved water use by the poor. After identifying the Southwest's poor as mostly Indian and Hispanic people, the paper discusses regional patterns of water control, water use by the poor, economics of water, the poor who do and don't control water, and communal values of water. Conclusions suggest water control by poor people and strong community in-put regarding water allocation could positively  affect economic development. Proposing areas of policy analysis based on current issues confronting natural-resource-owning Indian tribes as landowners and governments, the second paper, by Susan Williams, provides an historic overview focusing on tribes as landowners and their different resources including water, and minerals. It then suggests a research agenda and concludes that although resource development demands careful consideration by tribal members, resource-owning tribes can improve their economic well-being. Comments provide examples of cultural differences illustrating difficulties any outside intervention may face. (PM)",

It can be oriented toward increasing knowledge about the educational reality, generating theories, or confirming immediate educational political decisions. Educational research should be an interdisciplinary undertaking; this variety helps to unify various sciences and disciplines around specific problems. Educational research should be conducted in a systematic manner and with logical order, and with predetermined and controlled procedures and a critical sense in order to generate or improve the relevancy of hypotheses about presumed relationships between events and phenomenons of education as a social process, as an academic discipline, and as an integral system of a given society.  Thus, educational research should be a scientific investigation. This paper discusses the relationship between theory, science, and research; proposes that it is possible to generate theory through educational research; discusses the dichotomy between qualitative and quantitative research; decribes the institutionalization of educational research and the building of an educational research policy; and discusses the personnel needed to conduct educational research and the role of international cooperation in educational research projects in Latin America.

Many worthwhile, well conceived and planned educational reforms have failed due to poor management. Therefore, both ministries of education and international organizations of technical cooperation have placed top priority on educational management matters. International cooperation efforts emphasizing the improvement of educational administration have been conducted by such programs as the Programa Regional de Desarrollo Educativo (PREDE), supported by the Organization of American States; Experiencias de Gestion Participative (Colombia); Investigacion para la Accion y la Obtencion de Logros (Central America); and Modelo del Funcionamiento  de las Escuelas Basicas (Chile). This paper discusses the management of educational systems; explains how educational administration is, and has been, a priority of PREDE; discusses the influence of educational approaches on the theory and practice of management at large; presents some basic definitions of management; discusses problems, needs, and possibilities that, in the field of educational administration, are present in Latin American educational systems; provides some examples of efforts to improve educational administration; and outlines proposals for reflections and actions to improve the administration of Latin American educational systems.

A survey was conducted by mail questionnaire of rural local administrators (n=29) from upper state New York and college faculty (n=30) from an Albany private college. The survey contained 5 open-ended questions asking for characteristics which impact rural educational services to the handicapped and 20 attitude items. Comparisons made between rural educators and college faculty revealed differences in 8 of the 20 attitude items. Regarding the handicapped, more rural  educators than college faculty were concerned about financial ramifications of providing services, had lower academic expectations, and had confidence in vocational education. More college faculty than rural educators expected non-teaching staff to be prepared to work with the handicapped. Results document a knowledge and attitude gap between rural educators and college faculty who train teachers and a lack of awareness of issues research considers important. Teacher training programs must be improved and based upon needs of rural settings. Following the narration are tables displaying questionnaire results, and a copy of the questionnaire. (PM)",

        "description":"Rural areas' population growth, location, level of economic activity and social well-being depend less on natural resource endowments than on such factors as transportation, communication, labor force characteristics, and urbanization. General causes of the 1970's urban-to-rural migration included fewer changes in the structure of agriculture, decentralized nonextractive economic activities, modernized rural life, and a rural residential preference. This migration has accelerated changes in the nonmetro employment structure which is becoming increasingly diverse and decreasingly agricultural. Despite a narrowing of metro-nonmetro income differences, rural America continues to have a disproportionate share of poverty which falls mostly on Blacks and Hispanics. A recent comparison  of demographic, income distribution, economic structure, and human capital differences was made among counties classified as being directly concerned with natural resources. Intercounty variations were explained by investigating the effect of all factors considered. Findings indicated that 42% of all rural counties are natural resource dependent, only farming dependent counties trailed all nonmetro counties in median family income, and what differentiates persistently low income counties is their population profile and location, not economic base. Given these findings, no single sectoral policy will be appropriate in assisting rural development. Welfare reform would greatly benefit these areas. (PM)",

The combined characteristics of urban poverty, an agricultural-based economy and high unemployment, in a predominantly Hispanic population, coupled with a high percentage of illegal aliens produce a situation of poor health status and severe health needs. In 1984, the Brownsville Health Department, Brownsville Community Health Clinic, and the Border Research Institute, with support from the United States Department of Health and Human Services, undertook a health needs assessment survey of its population. An original instrument was developed in English and Spanish and a random sample of low/low-moderate income areas of town were surveyed (n=3,000  families). The survey results provided an analysis of the health needs of the Brownsville area and revealed many health need relationships between the two cities. Twenty-one recommendations were made, which, with the results, will serve as a model to develop more effective health care delivery systems. Following a brief narrative section, results are broken down, discussed by variables, and displayed in both graphic and tabular forms. The survey instrument in English and Spanish, maps, and tables of supportive demographic characteristics for Brownsville neighborhoods from the 1980 census are included. A select bibliography of relevant literature is appended. (Author/PM)",

Three federal policies operating over the past two decades have created an unfavorable environment for agriculture. Further factors such as adverse weather brought many farms and ranches to a point that made them vulnerable to those policies' impacts. Total farm debt rose to over $216 billion in 1983 before declining somewhat in 1984-1985. Unlesss something is done, more than one third of the farmers will move to insolvency, inflicting serious damage upon the rural community. Policy alternatives developed in 1985 could have an  effect on the relationship of commodity prices to land values and capital to labor. As more farms liquidate, the demand for adult education and expanded programs for youth will increase, while available education funds will decrease due to fewer property tax revenues and diminished federal funding caused by out-migration. New education delivery strategies must be formulated as these shifts occur. Statistical information is displayed in graphs and tables throughout the text. (PM)",

        "description":"Although intrusive factors--such as the economy--have limited recent strides toward improving rural education, there are components of excellence within the realm of local determination that are appropriate to conditions, circumstances, and aspirations surrounding the schooling process in rural areas. The educational reform movement in most states has resulted in increased requirements that must be considered by rural educators/boards/citizens. While these mandates set parameters, local communities can determine goals and practices for the excellence components of content, standards and expectations, time, teaching and the teacher, and reinforcement of cultural mores. Rural communities can decide to meet or exceed minimum standards, with provision made to meet the needs of all  children. Communities should take adequate time to identify issues, propose options, develop curriculum, and meet needs of students requiring instructional diversity. Teachers should not only be involved in the content process but should be accepted as members of the communities that recruit them. The additional preparation required of rural teachers should be supported by in-service and staff development, evaluation, career ladders, and incentive pay. Cultural mores can be reinforced by integrating character development into the school environment. These components of rural school excellence do not exhaust the list of items that could be explored.

Quality is the primary criteria for determining successful educational practices today as measured by the Secondary School Recognition Program's 14 success attributes and 7 success indicators. At the federal level, anti-rural bias is being corrected through the &quot;Rural Education and Rural Family Education Policy for the 80s.&quot; The urban to rural population shift, increased pooling of rural resources, and the renewed attention that small schools are receiving from educational associations and citizens groups are trends that may influence local leadership and provide quality rural  education. An agenda for facilitating local leadership and quality education in rural America is in place--the Rural Education Committee is working toward 10 initiatives outlined in the Department of Education's policy for the 80s. Those states critical of rural schools must realize that if they close their rural schools, they close their rural communities. With vision and leadership rural education can continue to successfully contribute to the values which have helped keep our nation strong.

        "description":"Perceived negative aspects of teaching in rural areas, including personal and professional isolation, multiple subject preparation, etc., provide barriers to effective recruitment and retention of quality teachers. The predicted shortage of teachers will likely have a significant impact on an already competitive market for high quality, rural school teachers. Recommended actions to overcome these perceived problems include more aggressive recruitment of new graduates from colleges and experienced teachers from larger schools, better selling of the advantages of teaching in rural schools--such as class size, individualized instruction, etc.--and utilization of more skilled and experienced recruiters. Politics and factors related to certification and accreditation regulations auger  against developing unique approaches to teacher education. With increased emphasis on specialization, the preparation of teachers for rural schools is made even more difficult. Using the strengths of rural schools and proven effective teaching techniques in conjunction with field experiences, quality rural teacher education programs are possible. Reconceptualization of school curricula could provide the leverage for teacher educators to develop alternative preparation programs. Concluding the paper are eight recommendations directed at program and policy decision-makers in state and federal governments, local schools, and college/universities. (Author/PM)",

Characteristics of new technology and environmental changes having particular relevance for rural schools include the abilities to transcend space, network, redefine learning as dynamic and interactive, and stimulate innovations and creativity. While adoption (purchase) of educational technologies is occurring quickly, the rate of creative application (use) depends upon whether the technology: can be tried first on a small scale; has compatability with existing behaviors and practices; is simple; has low cost and high effectiveness; and has a support system. Because of their small size and flexible, adaptive natures,  rural schools--especially in Alaska and Australia--are becoming innovators in applications of technolgy and in networking. The Oklahoma State University Arts and Science Public Schools Teleconferencing Network and the Utah Department of Education Accelerated Learning of Spanish by Satellite programs involve state-of-the-art technology and share similar methodology, purpose, and delivery systems. Their use of multiple technologies, collaboration, and coordination represent important steps in addressing rural education's need to take cost-effective advantage of quality educational resources that fill a specific curriculum need, but are located elsewhere.

The reforms bring challenges relating to teacher certification, curriculum, facilities, student services, and organization to rural educators and policymakers, but they also bring extraordinary opportunities for real progress. The movement toward reduced class size, increased services, higher standards, accountability, competency-based curriculum and expanded learning opportunities for students will probably continue to impact rural schools for the next 5 to 10 years. Trends reflecting concerns related to learning of thinking  skills, efficient use of instructional technology, increases in early childhood education programs, and projected teacher shortages will provide additional challenges and opportunities for rural schools. These trends suggest states should inititate: incentive programs; curriculum development; teacher allocation formulas; rural school networks; allocation of materials, supplies, and equipment; facility renovation; recruitment and retention programs; staff development incentives; and instructional technology implementation. Recommended on the local level are community involvement, partnerships, regional foundations, networks, and use of instructional technology. Appropriate federal roles include collecting, processing, and disseminating demographic statistics; identifying networks; and  supporting research. (NEC)",

Lacking a workable taxonomy which can accommodate the variations in rural reality, there is neither the information to accurately assess the adequacy of educational programs in small rural schools nor the ability to judge the capacity of rural communities to support adequate educational programs. Although rural schools comprise approximately three-fourths of the nation's school districts and enroll approximately one-third of the student population, this lack of information and inability of the rural constituency to coalesce into a viable political force means rural education has received little, if any,  special attention from past school finance reform initiatives. Traditionally, states have acknowledged the \"overburden\" argument in the funding of rural schools which recognizes the higher per pupil costs related to small size. Recent school reform legislation, mandating additional courses and student and teacher evaluation programs, has added significantly to rural \"overburden.\" Until we can assemble a data base on the real educational needs of rural communities and their ability to support those programs, debate about equity of rural school finance can only proceed at the emotional, political level.

While activities vary depending on school and partner needs, interests, and resources, partnerships develop relationships fostering trust, enhancing communication, exchanging information, reducing stress, instilling a sense of participation, and presenting positive images to both school and community. Fundamental elements in partnership development are friendbuilding (through a cultivation cycle emphasizing identification, information,  interest, involvement, and investment) awareness, mutual benefits, leadership, group dynamics, common goals, institutional mission, human parameters, initial financial support, communication, shared perceptions, documentation, guidance from outside agencies and organizations, and institutionalization of ongoing programs. Successful partnership activities include classes for students at business sites, summer youth job programs, career education, school staff internships with partners, executives-on-loan, and adopt-a-school programs.

A survey of programs serving rural adult learners reveals that no one educational provider or program seems best suited to provide services to rural communities. What successful providers have in common are programs which: (1) respond to a specific societal need, (2) respond to the adult learner's expectations, (3) involve extensive cooperation with other agencies, and (4) offer concise and jargon-free descriptive materials. The availablity of educational services in rural areas has been hampered by the increased costs involved in delivering services. Federal and state policy makers need to explore strategies that will (1) remove many of the barriers to continued education faced by adult learners.  (2) remove the urban bias that has denied equal access to educational services to rural residents, (3) encourage inter-institutional collaboration among both formal and non-formal educational providers, and (4) develop a rural education policy that is integrated into rural economic development policy. Rural educators need to act as advocates in accomplishing these legislative and policy objectives and explore collaborative arrangements with other providers. (Author)",

This paper: reviews studies that have attempted to determine whether the basic heuristic employed in thinking about random samples is passive and descriptive or whether it is deducible from a belief in active balancing; discusses the importance of sample size on judgments about the characteristics of random samples; and examines implications for instruction. For example, work done on sensitivity to sample size suggests that basic concepts and principles must be illustrated with a variety of examples if students are to be able to generalize them appropriately. Also, many statistics textbooks  that discuss the Law of Large Numbers attempt to dispel students' belief in the gambler's fallacy; however, they assume that the basic misconception students have is active balancing, and they oppose this mechanism with the notion of &quot;swamping.&quot; Current research suggests that such an approach is likely to be unfruitful because the problem is not that students think in terms of an incorrect process mechanism but that they do not think of random sampling in terms of any process model.

Workshop topics included Piagetian learning theory, creating classrooms conducive to implementing inquiry-oriented science programs, use of the learning cycle, and matching learning activities to students' developmental stages. Workshop participants were matched with a control group of teachers who utilized the exposition method (reading and memorizing science concepts). A pretest-posttest design was used to measure the effects of the workshop on teaching methodology and on the knowledge organization and cognitive performance level of their students. These students were interviewed utilizing three Piagetian tasks (liquid,  length, and weight) and nine objects (such as a marble) which they were to describe. Comparisons between the groups were made, noting the intellectual developmental levels and the language used when describing the objects. Since this research involved a thorough analysis of both the classroom environment and student interviews, an anthropological approach was used (with posttest data being collected during May 1985). Two findings from pretest data are these: intellectual development of experimental and control group students was approximately the same and experimental students could utilize property words better than control group students.

The report examines MESA's administrative structure and financial management and offers observations and recommendations regarding its administration.  Factors found to contribute to the program's success include its base in academic institutions, active participation of industry in its policy development and program implementation, and cooperation among educators at all levels and industry leaders in achieving its goals.

How these structures and processes are acquired has only recently become a major concern. Thus, some of the major research on mathematical and scientific thinking is reviewed, giving particular attention to work that sheds light on the processes of learning and development. Three areas of research are addressed: (1) the role of organizing schemata or structures in scientific and mathematical thinking; (2) the spontaneous construction or application of theories (considering investigations involving simple addition and subtraction); and (3) implicit understanding expressed as the invention of  procedures. The research examined indicates that the kinds of schemata people have made differences in their methods and levels of success in problem-solving. In addition, the schemata of experts may either be refinement of the schemata of novices in the same domain, or the schemata between novices and experts may be in direct conflict. Other research suggests that attention should be addressed to the processes learners use to construct spontaneous theories. These theories, because they are often \"wrong,\" must be constructed by the learners themselves. (JN)",

Biology, taken by over 80 percent of high school students, was the course selected for observation; if girls are turned off to science in biology, they effectively close the doors to scientific or technological careers. Following a brief introduction, eight case studies of teachers who have had a &quot;track record&quot; of success with young women in science are presented. Authors of these studies are Exyie Ryder, Jane Butler Kahle, Ann Haley-Oliphant, Julia Riggs, Frances Vanderdoort, Jane Abbott, Joseph McInerney, and Elizabeth Stage. A summary is also provided in which data  collected at all the case study schools is analyzed, case study sites and teachers compared and contrasted, and general conclusions drawn. Several behaviors of teachers who are successful in encouraging girls to pursue science were found. They include: (1) providing career information and informal academic counseling; (2) demonstrating unisex treatment in science classrooms; and (3) not using sexist humor and not allowing boys to dominate discussions or activities.

The report advocates a strategy that meshes short term needs of desperate families with long term requirements of ecological stability and economic development. A strategy of integrated development to meet basic needs in the Third World demands not just techniques that prevent death but policies that promote health. Statistics are provided of birth and death rates, child malnutrition cases, literacy rates, access to water figures, food production per capita, and work rates of women. Widespread discrimination against females throughout the Third World is particularly evidenced  in health care practices. It is recommended that women receive better treatment in water, health and agriculturally related projects. Aspects of family planning are also discussed, and specific plans are reviewed for implementation in Africa and Asia.

The study analyzed three dimensions of student themes, two sets of computer achievement measures, and three attitudinal dimensions for each of three treatment groups. Results showed no unpredicted differences by treatment group, but significant sex-related differences in theme writing and attitudes toward computers and sex roles. No differences in computer performance emerged in the computer group. Before the experimental treatment, girls held significantly fewer stereotypes and more positive attitudes toward their sex's potential computer abilities than boys, and the predicted reduction in the attitude gap between boys and girls  that used computers emerged in the posttest. This study provides support for the generalizations that: (1) the computer task has greater influence on computer achievement than inherent verbal or spatial skills; and (2) experience using computers reduces sex-related stereotypes. It suggests that new technologies foster educational equity. (Author/JN)",

In this study, learned helplessness has been defined in terms of a debilitating or facilitating response resulting from failure on mathematical word problems. The construct has been called Performance Following Failure (PFF) to distinguish it from attributional definitions of learned helplessness. Algebra students (N=124) were given an ability measure, a mathematics achievement measure, and a PFF measure. Results showed that: (1) females (N=61) scored significantly lower than males (N=63) on the PFF measure, that is, they were more learned helpless; and (2) PFF was related to mathematics achievement for females but not for males. These findings  indicated that a sex-related difference in PFF may be stronger than would have been expected from the related literature. It is suggested that PFF is a variable which needs to be considered when discussing sex-related differences in variables related to mathematics achievement. (Author/JN)",

        "description":"Increased levels of carbon dioxide have contributed to the problematic phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect. Evidence has indicated that the rise in carbon dioxide levels could be accurately correlated with a rise in the Earth's mean temperature, a shrinking of the polar icecaps, and a resulting rise in the Earth's mean sea level. The problems resulting from this situation are reviewed in these proceedings. Individuals presenting testimony and/or providing prepared statements (and when applicable, supporting documentation) include: Carl Sagan; John Trabalka; Wallace Broecker; William Jenkins; John Hoffman; Thomas Malone; Rafe Pomerance; and James Kane. Topic areas disucssed are: (1) climate sensitivity; (2) carbon dioxide's effect on crops; (3) role of the oceans and rise in  sea level; and (4) preindustrial carbon dioxide levels. A research timetable and program strategies are presented for reducing the greenhouse effect. One of the strategies emphasized by the Department of Energy is the expansion of a basic knowledge based on carbon dioxide buildup. It is recommended that data collection in this area precede impact assessments, plans, and policy options. (ML)",

Through this approach, approximately 700 teachers were involved with curriculum writing from 1977-1983. The teachers also helped in the implementation of Science - A Process Approach for Trinidad and Tobago (SAPATT). An evaluative study of the SAPATT curriculum is presented and includes: (1) the research plan; (2) statement of problems; (3) methodology (attitude, implementation, evaluation); and (4) present phase of study (procedures, results). The study reveals that high  scores have been achieved by SAPATT students and that teachers evidenced significant interest and participation levels in the program. It is recommended that all schools, private and public, should use the program and that SAPATT teacher's guides be distributed to all schools. (ML)",

The census was designed to produce normative data relative to offerings and enrollments in Illinois public secondary schools and establish a source of information on secondary school curriculum. Statistical information include: (1) demographic characteristics of the schools; (2) population profiles of science students; (3) science curricular offerings; and (4) male versus female enrollments in the sciences. Data are also categorized by enrollment sizes and community types (rural, suburban, independent and central city). Findings reveal that diversification of course offerings exist in the surveyed schools showing a range of 45 to 59 different courses. Enrollment figures  indicate that the sciences serve only a minority of the total student population (approximately 3 percent in Physics and 6 percent in Chemistry) and that male enrollments exceed female enrollments. It was noted that limited courses exist which are oriented to contemporary societal issues and problems. Implications are given to aid in decision-making for teacher preparation, inservice needs, specific curricular needs, and basic research. (ML)",

        "description":"Previous studies were conducted with 14- to 15-year-old students on the nature of the processes they used to solve tasks given the incorrect/buggy/mal-rules. The computer-based Leeds Modelling System (LMS) was implemented and a database of examples, correct and incorrect, or mal-rules had been established which was sufficient to diagnose the majority of difficulties encountered by 15-year-old students. When the same database was used with 24 14-year-old students, the outcome was very different. A high percentage of the student errors were not diagnosed by LMS. These protocols were analyzed in some detail, followed by individual interviews to determine the nature of the students' difficulties. Results obtained from the protocols and interviews indicate that there are two very  different types of mal-rules at large with algebra students, namely, manipulative (defining a manipulative mal-rule as a variant on a correct rule which has one substage either omitted or replaced by an inappropriate/incorrect operation) and parsing (incorrect representation of a task). Although bug-migration could be explained by repair theory, it appears that this second category of algebra errors (parsing) can best be explained by a mechanism called mis-generalization. (JN)",

        "description":"A group of 24 14-year-old students were presented with sets of algebra tasks using the Leeds Modelling System (LMS), a computer-based modeling system. Four months later, these same students were given a paper-and-pencil test which covered comparable tasks set by LMS. In addition, certain students were given detailed diagnostic interviews. A comparison between the results obtained is presented. Results obtained on the paper-and-pencil test and the interviews were consistent, showing that students had some profound misunderstandings of algebraic notation. Furthermore, from the interviews it was possible to determine classes of strategies some students were using, including (1) searching for solutions (substituting) and (2) applying a &quot;global&quot; rule, such as collecting all numbers on  one side, whether or not they were coefficients. The overall picture evolving from this and other studies seems to be: (1) that the difficulties of learning algebra have been greatly under-estimated; (2) that students have a great difficulty in inferring their own rules, or sometimes higher-level schema, and then using them consistently and often in appropriate situations; and (3) that few students have evolved mechanisms by which they can verify whether a proposed algorithm is feasible.

These same students were given a comparable paper-and-pencil test and detailed interviews some 4 months later. The latter studies uncovered several kinds of student misunderstanding that LMS had not detected. Some students had profound misunderstandings of algebraic notation; others used strategies such as substituting numbers for variables until the equation balanced. Additionally, it appears that the student errors fall into several distinct classes: namely, manipulative, parsing, clerical and &quot;random&quot;. LMS and its rule database have been enhanced as the result of this experiment, and so LMS is now able to diagnose the  majority of the errors encountered in this experiment. Finally, the paper gives a process-orientated explanation for student errors, and re-examines related work in cognitive modelling in the light of the types of student errors reported in this experiment. Misgeneralization is a mechanism suggested to explain some of the mal-rules noted in this study. (Author)",

        "description":"In this booklet, one of a series intended to apply economic principles to major social and political issues of the day, it is argued that although doomsayers claim that world population growth is threatening the ability of the world to feed itself and that drastic measures should be taken to curb population growth, the world population situation is not that bad. By using simple economics to analyze what determines the level and rate of growth of the population, one can show that the rate of population growth is the result of, among other things, economic factors. Given that, it is likely that the economics of population will in time dictate a slower rate of population growth. A look at the world's nations reveals that there is no relation between the income per capita of a  country and that country's population per square kilometer. However, the rate of growth of the population of a country and that country's per capita income are related, in that high income countries have low rates of population growth and that low income countries have high rates of population growth. It is concluded that the major determinant in such growth concerns the cost and benefits of having children, and that as countries become more industrialized, the returns from large families, and hence the desire to have them, will decrease.

        "description":"This booklet, one of a series intended to apply economic principles to major social and political issues of the day, focuses on the relationship between growth of the money supply, growth of productivity, and inflation. Provided first is a definition of inflation along with discussions of price indexes, the value of money, and the concept of money-velocity in relation to inflation. As causes of inflation, the energy crisis and monopolies are briefly examined and rejected. Equations are developed to consider what determines price level, what determines the rate of inflation, and how things like oil and regulation affect inflation, and the conclusion is reached that growth of the money supply beyond the growth of productivity is the root cause of inflation. The section dealing with  the cure for inflation covers: (1) the relationship between money and unemployment; (2) the relationship between an increasing rate of inflation and the reduction of unemployment; and (3) some problems with the solution to inflation, (defined as a reduction in the money supply and possibly a return to money that is convertible into a commodity, such as gold).

Educational attainment for Minnesota women is above the national average. Thirty-two percent of women in the state, compared with 28 percent of American women generally, have some post-secondary education. In Minnesota, women have consistently higher labor force participation rates than the national average. However, women's earnings average less than men's at every educational level, paralleling national patterns. State department statistics show that in Minnesota women are nearly half or more of students in three of the six areas of higher math and science. Performance assessment data indicate that the relative scores of females to males have  improved somewhat in math but show little improvement in science. Most secondary females and males are enrolled in traditional areas. Employment patterns in Minnesota public schools continue to reaffirm students' impressions that certain jobs belong to men and others to women, e.g., most administrators are male. The report concludes that efforts to achieve educational equity must continue. (RM)",

Africa is a continent experiencing a breakdown in the relationship between people and their natural support systems. Famine and the threat of famine are among the manifestations of this breakdown. This decline can be reversed. To do so will require an abrupt departure from the &quot;business as usual&quot; approach that African governments and the international community have mounted so far in response to the food crisis. Beneath the urgent work of providing food aid and resettling families displaced by famine, a long-term strategy of environmental restoration is essential to reversing recent trends. Slowing population growth, conserving soils, restoring forests and  woodlands, and enhancing subsistence agriculture are sure to be cornerstones of successful efforts to reestablish working economies in Africa. These priorities can provide a foundation for African aspirations and an agenda for international assistance. (RM)",

Out of about 700 projects funded by these state councils during fiscal years 1982 and 1983, ten were judged by the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) or state council officials to have raised concerns about advocacy, i.e., the act or process of defending a particular point of view, which is prohibited in these projects. Five projects which were reviewed are discussed. These include two projects dealing with the Soviet Union, one from Oregon and the other from Idaho, and three other projects. These were: a project on the electoral process and money from California; a project which sought to combine a  humanities perspective with the discussion of social issues in Florida; and a project dealing with the moral and political issues associated with nuclear deterrence in Maryland. This report also contains detailed information about how the NEH and the state councils review grant applications and attempt to ensure that a balanced perspective exists, how the membership of state councils is selected, how questions of advocacy arose in the five projects described, and how they were resolved.

The activity employed an instructional technique called \"reformulation.\" First, each ESL student wrote a relatively short essay (300-400 words) on a selected topic. Next, a copy of each essay was given to a native speaking student teacher who \"reformulated\" it, i.e., re-wrote it without altering the content, yet changed it from beginning to end to sound as native-like as possible. Third, each ESL student worked together with the native speaker comparing the reformulated version with the original and produced a final version of the essay. A verbatim example of a segment of an original essay, its  reformultion, and re-write is provided. (JD)",

Decisions about what students at the College of Education should observe and do in the public schools for their preparation are made jointly by college faculty and area school teachers. On-campus course content is decided in the same manner; decisions are arrived at by consensus and no power hierarchy exists. A description is given of how representatives of the university faculty and the public sector are recruited, how they communicate with each other, and how a representative team of planners with the  overall responsibility for leading the planning is established. In the implementation of the redesign, collaboration has become even more important as evidenced by public school teachers and college faculty involved in implementing the planned changes and educating preservice teachers. The organization unit for collaboration is a team composed of one university teacher educator, a graduate student, school representatives from each school in a district, and twenty freshman education majors. The current functioning of the collaboration and anticipated future developments are discussed. (JD)",

It is part of a school-based staff development program for high school teachers and is designed to have faculty members in a department work as a team. Colleagues are asked to help one another develop instructional units and courses that effectively integrate teaching, testing, and the use of test information. The program is divided into a basic training program and an advanced training program. The basic program focuses on six essential teaching/testing practices: (1) formulating learning goals in a unit of instruction, and determining the emphasis each is to receive in instruction and assessment; (2) developing an assessment plan for the unit; (3) matching tests and  other assessment procedures to the learning goals, and assuring quality in test design; (4) setting and applying standards for goal attainment; (5) providing feedback to students and suggesting ways that learning may be improved; and (6) adapting instructional plans and procedures to accommodate student progress. In the advanced program, these practices are extended to the design of courses, and working with slow and fast learning students. The program also addresses the issues of grading, course evaluation, and translation of goal-based course plans into course descriptions for students and parents. (JD)",

The handbook sets forth a goal-based approach to integrating teaching and testing which intends to reflect the contextual factors that influence teacher practices, e.g., student characteristics. The first section of this report presents an overview of the processes followed in developing the handbook, the issues faced in  determining its design, and the distinctive characteristics of the final product. The second section describes the development and pilot-testing of a staff development program based on the handbook. In the final section, descriptions are offered of the content and organization of three manuals developed by the project: the &quot;Resource Guide for Teachers,&quot; the &quot;Planning Guide for Lead Teachers and Principals,&quot; and the &quot;Program Guide for Superintendents.&quot; This section also contains a description of the refinement process and field trials that are planned for the manuals.

The classrooms were observed for four weeks in each case, and descriptions and impressions of classroom life were recorded. Informal interviews were also held with the students. Three major places in the curriculum where consonance was jeopardized were identfied. In one case, consonance was lost within the intended curriculum--the aims held by two of the teachers were inconsistent with their specific curriculum plans. Consonance was also jeopardized  in the translation of intentions into classroom events. A third source of dissonance in the three classrooms was conflict between the explicit and implicit curricula. These factors are analyzed and a discussion is presented on the implications of the findings for educational evaluation, teacher supervision, and curriculum decision making. (JD)",

A survey of beginning teachers sought their evaluation of the relative value of selected competencies (N=35) emphasized in their training programs. Responses to a questionnaire were received from 32 elementary teachers, 15 secondary, and 5 with dual positions. The questions sought teachers' opinions on: (1) importance of the listed competencies to teacher success; (2) how skilled they believe themselves to be in each competency at the beginning of their teaching careers; (3) where did they believe they learned each competency; and (4) in relation to other sources of skill, what contribution did their teacher education  program make to their teaching competence. Results indicated: (1) Teachers felt almost all of the competencies taught were important to their teaching; (2) While the teachers felt the competencies important to their success as beginning teachers, they did not feel skilled in a number of them; (3) Education coursework emerged as a rival in importance to student teaching; and (4) Education courses and student teaching accounted for about half of the total ratings for valuable sources of competence. Data resulting from the survey are presented in tables. Findings are discussed and implications are drawn in the areas of methodology used in the study, possible areas for assessment of teacher education programs, and insights regarding the design of graduate feedback studies.

Next, the current invitational model with its &quot;wide-lens&quot; focus is critiqued from its inability to go deeper into the implications of educating: teaching, learning, curriculum, and governance. Building on these distinct commonplaces, a theory of practice emphasizing educative events is presented. For invitations to be brought down to earth for teachers, and for the inviting process to remain pedagogically fresh, a more sensitive model is needed. An inviting theory of educational practice is proposed, informed by the concept of caring developed by Nel Noddings (1983), by the helping relations, and by the social-judgmental  nature of knowledge suggested by Richard Bernstein (1983).

This paper explores the historical origins and development of the concept and processes of professionalization, both in general and applied to the occupation of teaching. The author argues that professionalization, viewed in its historical and cultural context, presents an inherent contradiction. While the rhetoric of professionalization holds a promise of enhanced autonomy and control for members of an occupation, the reality may often be a \"deskilling\" of teachers. Historical and sociological data are used to support this hypothesis. A history of professionalization is briefly discussed along with the development of an ideology of professionalization. The author describes the processes  by which a hierarchical status structure within education seems to have developed. This is a structure within which practitioners have little power and recognition while research and policymakers may control the knowledge and behaviors of classroom practice. Thus ironically, the language and beliefs of professionalization may be used to mask teachers' lack of autonomy and control. (Author)",

        "description":"This study was designed to investigate the impact of the National Teacher Examination (NTE) Core Battery and Specialty Area tests on the selection of teachers. The areas examined were how states use the NTE Programs Tests; distribution of test takers and test scores by racial/ethnic group; impact of qualifying scores on passing rates of these groups; and implications for the composition of the future teaching force. Most states set qualifying scores for each test they use. Test scores may be used to screen candidates for teacher education programs; evaluate student performance; screen candidates for initial certification; provide an alternative to the approved program approach for certification; and/or select teachers for participation in special programs. Passing rates differ  significantly among racial/ethnic groups when qualifying scores set by states are applied to the national pool of NTE examinees. State policies have a direct impact on minorities. Current efforts are directed toward enacting more, or stricter, standards rather than addressing problems of equity. (DWH)",

This study was initiated to determine what additional advice might be offered to test takers contemplating repetition of the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) and test users confronted with how to interpret multiple test scores in the admissions process. The study provided additional support for advising test takers of the desirability of test preparation. Several techniques for evaluating multiple test scores were presented including use of the highest score, the most recent score, or the average of all test scores. The average of several scores, if earned in a short period of time, may be the best technique. However, regardless of the approach adopted,  it should be used consistently with all applicants. Through a survey of examinees who had repeated the GRE General (Aptitude) Test, this study documented some of the factors involved in GRE test takers' decisions to repeat the test and examined the relationship of these factors to test score changes.

        "description":"Educational researchers have claimed that the quantitative and qualitative approaches to educational inquiry are, indeed, compatible. However, it would be unfortunate to discontinue this debate. The quantitative-qualitative debate began with the interpretive approach to social inquiry. Dilthey argued that since cultural/moral sciences differ from natural/physical sciences, the context of the human experimenters' subjectivity, emotions, and values is significant. Concerned by inconsistent research interpretations, Weber unsuccessfully tried to synthesize a compromise between the two perspectives. Still, two distinct perspectives remained: the quantitative, realistic tradition describing independently existing social reality as it really is, and the qualitative, interpretive  tradition assuming that social reality is mind-constructed according to internal coherence and social conditioning. More researchers considered the debate: Rist proposed a detente; Guba pursued criteria for qualitative or naturalistic inquiry. LeCompte and Goetz, Miles and Huberman, and Lynch de-emphasized the paradigmatic differences, implying that qualitative research is a procedural variation of quantitative inquiry. There are problems with this trend. Although the two approaches may be combined, each one's differing logic of justification affects the determination of validity. Other intellectual disciplines are also concerned with this debate. (GDC)",

Multivariate analyses were conducted on the responses of 758 graduating sniors in regard to specific and overall academic satisfaction as indicated on specific items of Rudolf Moos' College Experiences Questionnaire. Results of the study indicated that, generally, stimulating course-work and good teaching were more important than opportunities for faculty-student interaction or perceived  faculty knowledgeability.

The test score is the number of those items answered correctly. These methods cannot be used with classifications based on weighted composite scores, especially if the composite includes essay scores. This paper presents a modification which will make it possible to apply these methods to composite scores. The proposed method is based on a normal model (with variance stabilizing transformation) for the conditional observed score distribution. The effective test length of the composite is determined from its true-score variance, estimated by Kristof's method or by Gilmer and Feldt's method.  (Author/DWH)",

Ten two-trait configurations and one unidimensional test configuration for 30 item tests were simulated. Each configuration consisted of a specific item parameter configuration and a specific correlation between traits on two dimension. Six conditions were simulated for each configuration, ranging from an easy to a hard test. The accuracy of item and ability parameter estimation was examined using correlations; KR-20 coefficients and factor analyses were also performed. The factor analyses supported a division of the simulated multidimensional data sets  into groups according to the discrimination parameter &quot;loads&quot; on the two dimensions. The tests either both load heavily on both dimensions (both tests are multidimensional), one test loads heavily on one dimension and the other loads heavily on the same dimension (both tests are unidimensional), one test is unidimensional and one is multidimensional, or one test loads heavily on one dimension and the other test loads heavily on the other dimension. Results indicated the poorest item parameter estimations occur for the situation in which one test is unidimensional and one is multidimensional. (Author/DWH)",

An ongoing investigation in causal reasoning in medical problem solving systems illustrates this interaction. This paper traces a dialectic of sorts in which three different types of causal resaoning for medical problem solving are identified in verbatim protocols and simulated by computer program. The first, and most commonly discussed, type of causal reasoning consists of &quot;causal links&quot; holding between states of the world. The second is based on &quot;qualitative simulation&quot; of systems of continuous parameters related by qualitative constraints. The third, the &quot;one parameter simulation&quot;, is a hybrid of the first two. These three types of causal  descriptions are not alternative hypotheses, but apparently coexist in the expert's mind. (BS)",

It is a time-saving method important in formative evaluation when a decision must be made concerning implementation of a course of action. When experts are carefully selected, their opinions add to the credibility of the evaluation. Experts' opinion may be used for the assessment of project goals and strategies which need to be evaluated at an early stage of the project. A systematic process for using experts' opinion consists of five major stages: (1) object identification; (2) sampling of experts; (3) presenting questions to experts; (4) obtaining experts' responses; and (5) synthesizing opinions. A large  scale evaluation project, the Tel Aviv Evaluation (TAE) Project utilized this process. The TAE was developed to evaluate the projects included in the Tel Aviv Reinforcement and Enrichment Program to provide decision makers with relevant informtion to improve the Tel Aviv, Israel public schools.

The three features of the procedure are explained: (1) for statistical control, it adopts and extends the regression-discontinuity design; (2) for statistical inferences, it de-emphasizes hypothesis testing in favor of interval estimation; and (3) it uses the limits of the confidence interval to qualify the level at which a program operates, rather than making a simple statement about goal attainment. Application of this procedure is illustrated with data obtained at grades 2, 3, 7, and 8 for a remedial mathematics program. Methods are suggested for making these evaluation results accessible and practical for educational decisionmakers through  graphic presentations and by linking evaluation outcomes to particular administrative objectives, specific planning procedures, and a set of corrective and/or supportive program activities.

Discussion among presenters as well as audience perceptions would also be considered of importance. All aspects of the program process would be viewed as contributing to the professional development of the participants. Sessions would focus on fewer papers in order to allow deeper study. Wholeness, rather than fragmentation, of the group would be emphasized. This proposed approach would indicate a  concern for individuals and human relatedness. (DWH)",

Evaluation questions must be identified and classified before research can effectively begin. This paper discusses the four approaches to studying evaluation research questions and their implications for practice. The presentation is organized under the headings: Identifying the Question; Posing the Question; Answering the Question; and Reporting the Answer. The importance of selecting the right question for evaluation research is emphasized. Systematic methods for locating appropriate questions for evaluation research are identified. These include: (1) classifying the questions that can be asked before identifying the  question; (2) analyzing the question before posing it; (3) making a dummy of the answer before addressing the question; and (4) stating the question again before stating the answer.

The objective was to determine to what extent means and cross-session correlations are stable over several administrations. Ten individual subtests, the derived ASVAB area composites and the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) were examined for stability. The means for this sample were below the national average and scores were less dispersed. Means increased over sessions .5 standard deviation or more on half the subtests and consequently, on most of the composite scores. Correlations for the subtests and the composites were largely stable over sessions and were slightly higher later in practice. Reliabilities were  comparable to reference populations when adjusted for the range restriction of the present sample. The implications of practice effects for paper and pencil as well as automated selection tests are discussed. (Author)",

Sixty seventh-grade volunteers from two urban junior high schools were assigned to the strategy training group or the control group. The strategy group was instructed to cluster words into their component categories, while the control group was urged to repeat the words sub-vocally. A free recall paradigm was used. Subjects recalled a list of twelve words from three categories (fruit, clothes, or animals) until one perfect recall was achieved. Subjects were then given a five-minute coding task and were asked to recall as many of the previously learned words as possible. Two measurements of test anxiety  assessed state anxiety at both acquisition and at retrieval. The results supported the hypothesis that strategy training improved the performance of highly anxious subjects, compared to the control group. (GDC)",

The Building Memory Test was also examined in an attempt to replicate a previous study which supported its validity. These four tests were administered to 353 undergraduate students, along with two measures of environmental knowledge, a landmark location task and a route knowledge task. Both of these tasks were based on a slide-simulated walk through an unfamiliar urban environment. As hypothesized, the Differential Aptitude Test was predictive of both environmental tasks. Both the Building Memory Test and Embedded Figures Test were related to the landmark location task. However, overall,  the spatial tests were more related to each other than to the two environmental tasks. Although mental rotation and disembedding appear to be part of the skills necessary to replicate a cognitive map, researchers would do well to distinguish spatial ability from environmental cognition.

The first year of the three-year project resulted in the development of multiple choice, true-false, and A or B test items. System programs were written in BASIC for Apple microcomputers. Field testing classrooms were selected from several school districts in North-Central Alberta, Canada. Feedback was obtained and modifications were made as the project continued. There were problems associated  with the way computers were distribued in schools, and the way in which various types of test formats were administered. It was found that this testing program was more readily used at the elementary level. It was also discovered that a simple way to incorporate mathematical characters was needed. Teachers' attitudes, based on preliminary surveys, were positive, but not overwhelmingly positive. (GDC)",

The process requires a team of monitors who examine the adequacy of implementation plans and look at the effect of plan execution upon the organization, individual, and new program. Immediate feedback is provided to adjust the implementation effort to better help the new program succeed. The framework defines questions to ask during the period when implementation is occurring. It shows why these questions are important, how they interrelate, and how they can be used to increase the implementation of innovations as well as to further the study of implementation processes. An optimal use of the framework would be to improve the use of new programs  by implementation monitoring. The framework may be used to raise the awareness in organizations, and among evaluators, of the issues involved in implementing new programs. (DWH)",

In the low compared to the high student-perceived differential treatment classroom, more strategies were used which minimized the opportunity for comparisons between students' ability levels, e.g. divergent tasks, heterogeneous grouping, expressions of respect for individual differences in ease of learning, use of errors for learning rather than for peer comparison.  The model--including the influence of other features within the classroom context which may overcome the effect of potentially detrimental factors--generally received support from this analysis. The importance of teachers' beliefs about the nature of ability and teachers' responsibility and effectiveness in implementing strategies for low achievers was also noted. (Author/EDC)",

Data were collected from two math tests, teacher ratings of reading and spelling skills, a self concept inventory (the Student's Perception of Ability Scale), records of student time on the computer, and three pencil and paper programming tests. In addition, the programming strategies of eight students were studied  closely on the Tower of Hanoi puzzle which has structural similarities to the LOGO language and facilitates similar forms of problem solving. Two main spontaneous problem solving strategies were identified: partitioning and encompassing. These strategies reflected the different ways in which the children represented the task problems (either as extended series or as subunits for unit building), thus managing their memory resources. While unanticipated sex differences in strategies were identified, they were not generalizable due to the research design. (BS)",

Items answered by recalling information based exclusively on course content were coded as \"knowledge.\" Items requiring reformulation of course information were coded as \"thinking.\" The validity of the items' cognitive level categorization was assessed by item analyese data (item difficulty, item discrimination, and homogeneity of variance) and  categorization of the think aloud responses of 12 students. Results indicated that thinking items were significantly more difficult than knowledge items. Discrimination, when difficulty was held constant, was significantly greater for knowledge items.

Each section presents a different teaching principle, explains the rationale behind it, and provides a list of suggestions and/or comments from teachers. The six principles are: (1) Every child can learn if you have high expectations for all of your students. (2) Every child can learn if you approach instruction systematically with clear goals and objectives, emphasizing time-on-task and achievement. (3) Every child can learn if your instruction is multiculturally based. (4) Every child can learn if you accurately assess student achievement and use that data appropriately. (5) Every child can learn if you establish a positive classroom climate that  includes maintaining firm, fair, and consistent discipline practices. (6) Every child can learn if you establish a positive home-school relationship. (KH)",

The guide is divided into four sections. Section I presents an overview of the Friends of Black Children Project (which is located at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill). The goal of this project is said to be the development and testing of strategies involving collaborative work between four local county departments of social services and the black communities. Section II describes specific techniques that social service agencies can use when working with black families and the black community.  Section III, on black community involvement, gives suggestions for local citizens who are organizing and working with county social services agencies. Finally, Section IV contains recommendations, addressed to State and local agencies, on organizing and facilitating the work of State-level advisory groups. Four appendices include: (1) a list of training resources and strategies: (2) a bibliography and resource guide; (3) sample questionnaires (sample of evaluation tools used by the Friends of Black Children Project); and (4) sample media and publicity materials.

Chapter 2 summarizes the history, cultural influences, demographic characteristics, and health status of Latinos in the United States, emphasizing the need to recognize the pluralistic nature of the Latino population and the central status of health aa a group priority. Chapter 3 presents an analytical discussion of Latino families, including cultural and societal sources of stress and of  support. Chapter 4 provides a conceptual framework for health promotion strategies in Latino communities, and deals with four areas: nutrition, infant and child health, reproductive health, and stress management. Chapter 5 addresses the issues of family life program design and community participation. Finally, Chapter 6 argues that institutional orientation or philosophy will determine the success or failure of any program venture.

        "description":"The education of the black child must be perceived as a partnership between parents, school teachers, administrators, and the community. That partnership needs to be cemented with understanding, open communication, and trust. Black children's test scores are the lowest of any group in the country and the gap between the educational performances of black and white children increases as they progress through school. This reflects the erosion of the partnership as children go through school, and parents, teaches and administrators send messages of independence to the child that are sometimes seen as growing lack of interest. The overall goal of any educational system is to produce functionally literate adults: to this end, experiential learning in cultural centers and a suitable  study environment are important. The child should be taught the following aspects of citizenship: ethics; the functions of Federal, State, and local government; the American political system; and the responsibility of voting. The community also needs to address the effects of middle class values on homes that do not depict such values. At the same time, against a backdrop of declining higher education aid for blacks, there is a special need to prepare black children for college, and the trend toward teacher testing as the measure of teaching ability, which threatens the black classroom teacher, must be turned back in favor of a system in which the test is only one of many criteria. Finally, the black family and the black community bear the major responsibility for the quality and  monitoring of the black child's educational experience. The official convention program giving the day's schedule and a note on background and purpose and listing the conventions officers and sponsoring organizations, is attached. (RDN)",

Results suggest that the EIWN-R is a reliable measure when used with groups of this kind. Although the scale seems reliable, further investigation should be conducted to determine the cultural appropriateness of various items in the Verbal Scale. The need for norms for the Puerto Rican population is supported in these studies, though with a limited sample, by the lower IQ mean score. The use of American norms with Puerto Rican children in the United States might result in  inappropriate placement of children in special education. (RDN)",

The report is comprised of five parts. The introduction summarizes the official definition of poverty, provides a background sketch of the characteristics of poor children, and briefly mentions the main programs of governmental aid to the poor that affect children. Part 2, the bulk of the report, describes a score of databases from the mid-1960s to the  1980s that contain relevant data on children in poverty and the educationally disadvantaged. Part 3 describes a smaller set of regular statistical publications in which data on poverty or welfare programs may be found. Part 4 is an annotated bibliography of some of the major analyses that have been conducted using data sets described in Part 2. The final part is a brief assessment of the available information.

The proposed analyses address the following major questions (1) What are the demographic characteristics of United States children from low-income families, and how have these characteristics changed over time? (2) What is the latest statistical evidence about the relationship between poverty and educational achievement, and is there any sign that this relationship has changed over time? (3) What is the  latest statistical evidence about the relationship between poverty and the quality of educational services received by students, and is there any sign that this relationship has changed? (4) What are some of the implications of the demographic characteristics and population trends for the organization and delivery of compensatory education services? For each proposed analysis, the paper provides the following: the purpose of the analysis; the rationale for carrying it out; the databases that could be used to provide the required information; the steps involved in analyzing these data; an estimate of the effort required; and suggestions for coordinating the task with the other proposed analyses.

        "description":"Five local collaborative efforts in several Northwest states addressed the problems created by worker dislocation in unique ways. Each partnership involved educational agencies and other key actors such as employers, organized labor, and government agencies. When the Department of Labor awarded a dislocated worker retraining demonstration grant to the Mid-Willamette Jobs Council (Salem, Oregon), it merged with a project of Chemeketa Community College. The college became the retraining institution, with the Job Assistance Network providing other job assistance services. When Scott Paper Company closed a division in Northwest Washington, representatives of the company, the National Alliance of Business, and the International Workers of America local planned the Skagit/Snohomish  Dislocated Worker Assistance Project. Workers received help in job search methods through workshops and support services. The labor movement responded to projected layoffs in Montana's lumber and natural resource development industries with &quot;Project Challenge: Work Again.&quot; Efforts focused on older workers with few job-seeking skills. When Idaho faced the loss of several large employers, the Consortium of Area Vocational Education Schools sponsored a workshop for dislocated workers. The King County (Washington) Unemployed Committee developed the &quot;Unemployment Resource Guide&quot; to provide information and list sources of information and assistance. (YLB)",

        "description":"An estimated one-third of Sweden's adult population pursues some type of studies. The primary forms of education and training available for adults in Sweden are residential adult colleges, folk high schools, voluntary educational associations or study circles, municipal and national adult education programs, adult basic education programs, public library or audiovisual aid center-sponsored activities, training programs sponsored by employee organizations or employers, educational television and radio, and correspondence schools. Study circle, municipal adult education, and folk high school programs are supervised by the National Board of Education. Except for study circles, all adult educational programming is available without charge. Adult learners in Sweden are also eligible  for study funds payable in the form of hourly or daily study grants. Much of the rapid growth of adult education in Sweden in recent years has resulted from collaboration and coordination among various public and private agencies, including trade unions, employers, municipal governments, and educational associations. Through the national student union and its local branches, Sweden's adult learners have themselves become involved in designing the adult education system, recruiting new target groups, encouraging educational development work, and improving the financial aid system.

        "description":"A study examined the effects of participation in a high school agricultural education program on occupational attainment. Using data collected in the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972, researchers compared the employment patterns and income of 6,585 individuals who had taken at least one semester of agricultural education while in high school to those of students with no history of participation in agricultural education. On initial analysis, participation in agricultural education appeared to affect adversely the socioeconomic attainment of graduates whether they entered an agricultural occupation or not; however, when the effects of such background variables as socioeconomic background, family history, type of community, sex, and race were taken into  account, the results of the analysis changed dramatically. Even when statistically significant differences in socioeconomic attainment were found, however, they were too small to be of practical significance, thus reinforcing the conclusion that participation in an agricultural education program while in high school had no practical effect, either positive or negative, on the subsequent job status attainment of graduates. Nor did number of semesters of participation in agricultural education courses have any marked influence on occupational outcomes. (MN)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine the effect of participation in vocational education on labor market experience immediately after high school. Data were gathered in March and April of 1980 while the young people were seniors in high school, and again two years later. The first wave of data contained various measures of education and grades in school, participation in extracurricular activities, family background, work attitudes, career aspirations, and test scores. The second wave contained a complete history of jobs held since 1980 and post high school educational experiences and earnings. Three measures of the respondents' labor market success--earnings in 1981, number of months in which the respondent worked in the period between June 1980 and February 1982, and average  hourly wage rates during that 21-month period--were defined from the second wave interviews. Data were gathered on a subsample of 1,712 for earnings in 1981 and number of total months, and of 1,256 for wage rates from a total of 12,000 persons on whom longitudinal data were available. Some of the results were the following: (1) males earned an additional $1,800 per year, worked an additional 1.4 months, and got paid 70 cents more per hour than females; (2) the positive impact of vocational coursework on wage rates and earnings was larger for men than for women; (3) trade and technical or other vocational courses had a large positive effect on the wage rates and earnings of men but almost no effect on those of women; and (4) the only type of vocational training that seemed to yield a  significant immediate economic return to women was business and sales. The study also found that higher mathematics test scores increased the earnings of women but not of men, while high vocabulary test scores had the opposite effect. (KC)",

The delegation identified the following major sources of youth programming in China: the All-China Youth Federation (ACYF), the Communist Youth League, the Young Pioneers, science and technology associations, children's and youth palaces, government offices in charge of rural youth programs, and student unions. Chinese and U.S. officials agreed that the Chinese need to strengthen their  extension outreach system and to improve the linkages between agricultural research and extension. The U.S. delegation recommended the following actions: development of an agreement between the ACYF and the National 4-H Council, formulation of agreements between individual universities in the PRC and the United States, and implementation of a pilot project to test the feasibility of undertaking rural youth exchanges between individual youth science and technology associations in China and cooperative extension services in the United States.

        "description":"An idea conceived by federal volunteer agency director Thomas Rauken in 1979, the Vietnam Veterans Leadership Program (VVLP) was officially launched in November, 1981. The program was scheduled to be federally funded for three years, and thereafter to be privately funded and operated. The VVLP formed a network of veteran volunteers who accomplished the following: (1) the establishment of 47 nonprofit corporations across the country to build the volunteer network, enhance its image, build support, develop employment and training opportunities, aid in small business development, raise funds, and collaborate with other organizations on veterans' affairs; (2) the involvement of about 6,000 veteran volunteers who have given 350,449 hours of unpaid time to help their fellow veterans  and to introduce a new, positive image of Vietnam veterans to the American public; (3) the raising of an estimated $1,208,800 in material donations made through the network's contacts; and (4) the creation of workshops and programs that have counseled veterans on starting small businesses and helped them obtain employment. This book is a history of the VVLP and its accomplishments, as well as its hopes for the future. It is organized in six chapters. The first chapter presents a summary of the program's accomplishments as well as a historical perspective on the program. In the second chapter, the need for such a program is documented; this is followed by a chapter detailing the start-up of the program and project funding. The fourth chapter reports on the projects that were implemented,  while the fifth chapter sets the tone for the challenge of the future. The final chapter summarizes the design, approach, and source materials used in compiling the report. (KC)",

Data on the employment status of 98 individuals were collected 60 days and again 180 days after they had registered in a PAPA. Data on the employment status of an additional 121 persons 60 days after they had registered in a PAPA were also examined. The optimal criterion measure for identification of employability variables was found to be employment status 180 days after registration. Four predictor variables were also found to be significantly related to employment status 180 days  after PAPA registration. A prototype employability screening instrument based on these four variables was proposed. Six standards for evaluating existing PAPAs were developed. Preliminary cost-benefit analyses of Florida's three existing PAPAs indicated that the cost-effectiveness of serving all cohorts of clients examined has been improving significantly.

Data were collected via a 50-item fixed-response questionnaire that was completed by 151 older female students at two colleges (Cedar Crest Woman's College and Lehigh County Community College). In addition, relatives of two-thirds of the respondents completed the forms. The results of the study showed that the students responding were white (97 percent) and have had some previous college experience. The ages of the respondents ranged from 22 to 65 with the median category 30-34 years old. Sixty  percent of the students were married, the majority of their husbands had college degrees, and the families were relatively affluent. Almost two-thirds of the women had children (four for older women, two for younger women). More than half of the respondents were employed. All of the participants viewed their education as a self-enriching, self-initiated experience for which they had long-term personal or professional goals. Most had superior academic performances. Based on the data obtained in this study, it was concluded that the major problem areas for these students were exam anxiety, time allotment, and role conflict. The women in this study struggled with doubts and overcame obstacles to continue their personal growth. (KC)",

This report discusses the new challenges that will face the public and private sectors in both responding to the needs and making use of the resources of older Americans. The report discusses five chronic conditions that severely affect older persons. The potential health improvements from behaviors that may delay the onset of chronic diseases, the need for increased biomedical research into the causes of these diseases, and methods to encourage behaviors that promote health are also reviewed. Special attention is given to the potential impact of telecommunications in the home and community in promoting self-health care among the elderly. The housing and living  environment of the elderly are also described. Shared housing, residential care facilities, accessory units, and other types of residences that would expand the housing choices available to older Americans are discussed in the report. The study also evaluates the impact of changes in workplace technology. Job security may be weakened in some industries, while in others technology can enhance job performance, safety, and security for older workers. Finally, the report addresses the retraining of older workers, which would encourage continued employment or provide new employment possibilities. Extensive indexes to the report provide information on morbidity and mortality statistics, the cell biology of aging, nutrition, biotechnology, workplace technology and the employment of older adults,  a glossary of terms, and a list of contractors involved in preparation of the report.

The investigation was conducted by distributing a 15-statement survey to the 140 faculty members at Coconut Creek High School, Coconut Creek, Florida. Forty-six of the surveys were returned (32.9 percent); 16 surveys were returned by vocational instructors and 30 surveys by non-vocational instructors. The null hypothesis stated that there would be no significant difference between vocational instructors and non-vocational instructors at the school concerning their attitudes toward competency-based education. Chi-square tests were used to compare data results. A significance level of .05 was  used. After analysis of the data, the null hypothesis was confirmed (i.e., both vocational and non-vocational teachers were very much in favor of competency-based education). Based upon the results of this investigation, the following recommendations were made: (1) conduct similar surveys in other Broward County High Schools to broaden the base of the survey; (2) investigate the strength of vocational instructors' convictions towards competency-based education; and (3) investigate the general willingness of vocational instructors to conduct competency-based education inservice programs.

This involves both an examination of the characteristics of job seekers who are rewarded in labor markets and an analysis of how employers evaluate worker characteristics when making hiring and promotion decisions. Of special importance to this emerging research has been the role of educational credentials. However, there has been little effort to investigate specific job matches directly. One study conceptualized job matches as employment transactions. To examine these transactions, an interview instrument was designed and used to interview the most recent appointees in 12 occupational categories in 6 organizations, as well as the individuals who  hired them. Questions focused on the role of educational credentials in job assignment, and elicited information on the role of educational choice, the effect of schooling on job performance, the issue of overeducation, and the importance of educational background. This research can lead to important knowledge of the determinants of inequality in the labor force. (Author/KC)",

It focuses on the learning processes of codification, decodification, and recodification. Discussed in the second chapter is the technique of &quot;capacitacion,&quot; which is a method for teaching visual English to vocational students that represents English word order rules in a manner that is systematized through question-words.  Procedures are set forth for using tape and slide presentations and question-and-answer sessions based on the visual English method in bilingual vocational English classes.

The lists of strategies and issues were compiled from a review of campaign materials from organizations around the country. The intent of the book is to provide alcohol coordinators with the  opportunity to read messages and planning ideas used by others and to provide suggestions for further development by local planners, advisory committees, focus groups, and advertising agencies working on the program. This resource is expected to be useful in writing public information plans and position statements, preparing speeches, briefing volunteers, studying for talk show appearances, and the like. Appendixes to the document list drunk driving public service announcements (description includes number on tape, title, length, production year, producing organization, place produced and Highway Safety Research Institute number) available through the authoring agency or state highway safety departments, describe alcohol's trip through the body, reconstruct an alcohol-related crash, and  list drunk driving organizations.

Like the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA), JTPA works through a locally based program delivery system. Unlike CETA, JTPA calls for equal responsibility between the private and public sectors for making fundamental decisions about local program operations. Under JTPA vocational education will have a vital role in training and retraining programs for the unemployed and economically disadvantaged. JTPA administration is the responsibility of each state's governor who divides the state into service delivery areas (SDAs). Each SDA appoints a Private Industry Council. Therefore,  vocational education can be represented potentially on several levels and have a more active role in determining how training funds will be spent. Through its state advisory councils vocational education can work closely with other local public agencies in the new partnership with private business. Some cooperative arrangements between the public and private sectors have focused on meeting demands of the changing workplace. Steps needed to build successful partnerships include conducting needs assessments, identifying resources, choosing partners, and establishing working relationships. (YLB)",

        "description":"Major technological changes are occurring primarily in three fields: telecommunications, computer applications, and advanced manufacturing technology. High technology is having a great impact on every aspect of the labor market. Most new jobs will not be in the high technology field, however, and the newly created occupations will not require a substantial increase in job skills. According to some experts, that is because high technology is based on a reduction in the skilled labor force. Others argue that some businesses and industries have failed to gain a competitive edge through adoption and adaptation of new technology. Consequently, they are becoming obsolete. Vocational education has a vital role in collaborating with business and industry in high technology training and  retraining to upgrade workers with the emerging new occupational skills and to maintain a competitive edge. Vocational education is facing the challenge of producing workers who can manage, operate, manufacture, test, design, program, install, maintain, and repair high technology products and processes. Educators should consider five phases in the construction of successful high technology programs: long-range planning, program planning, development, implementation, and evaluation and refinement.

        "description":"While the Federal Government has been involved in the care of the elderly since the depression, a comprehensive and unified national retirement policy has never been established. Federal programs for the aged have avoided cutbacks, but adaptations in present retirement policy are required to meet the needs of young and old alike. Although public policy gives the elderly the right to work, it provides incentives for those who leave the labor force at or before age 65. The major criticism of present retirement policy is that it discourages labor force participation of older persons through economic disadvantages for continued work and mandatory retirement regulations. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act has been amended to raise the minimum retirement age from 65 to 70.  Changes have also been enacted in the Social Security system. Vocational educators can take action to enhance the participation of older persons in the labor force by expanding public awareness of the needs and abilities of the elderly, examining the recruitment of elderly persons, obtaining training to implement effective vocational education programs, examining attitudes toward older people, reviewing the potential of programs to serve the elderly, and assisting older persons to remain productive in their retirement.

The U.S. Department of Education has responded to these needs by establishing the Defense Preparedness Task Force, convening a Defense Preparedness Review Group, and conducting the Vocational Education and Defense Preparedness Seminar. The Assistant Secretary for Vocational and Adult Education has proposed the following Federal initiatives: identifying the need for defense-related training, fostering training performance that yields increased productivity, disseminating the best research and demonstration products relating to defense preparedness, improving data management for information dissemination,  and encouraging information sharing with school personnel. Many military training needs are similar to those provided by vocational education in the civilian sector. The partnership that the Department of Defense has maintained with the civilian educational community in providing education for the nation's youth can be broadened in the area of vocational and technical education. Vocational educators need to continue to monitor state and national defense-related training developments and to share models of training. Such efforts will assist them in developing stronger collaborative arrangements with defense-related industries. (YLB)",

Three common areas of controversy related to the problem are: (1) definitions of adult literacy, (2) characteristics of illiterate adults, and (3) the purposes of literacy education. Illiteracy can be understood only in relation to a culture's definition of literacy. Due to differing definitions, statistics on the extent of illiteracy vary widely. The concept of \"functional literacy\" is controversial because it is determined by external standards and criteria. A tone of mission and concern for the less fortunate has dominated the perspective of illiterate adults. A picture is emerging now of illiterate adults as individuals who have educated themselves through life experiences and are frustrated with present  literacy programs. Two common models of literacy programs are personal development and improvement and social change. Two primary systems for literacy programs currently serve the individual--the federally funded adult basic education program and national volunteer literacy efforts. Employers are emerging as a third delivery system providing literacy training for individual development. Community-controlled agencies that also offer literacy education are committed to improvement. (YLB)",

More recent investigators, such as Daniel Levinson, Roger Gould, and Gail Sheehy have formulated age-related sequential models of adult development that view the various stages of adulthood in terms of different strategies toward perceiving and coping with reality. In addition, several theorists have postulated models of adult development with a special focus (for example, Jane Loevinger's concentration on stages of ego development, William Perry's scheme of intellectual development, Lawrence Kohlberg's notion of the interconnection between levels of moral and intellectual development, and James Fowler's theory of faith  development). Many of the findings of such research and examination of human development have important implications for adult educational programming. Many aspects of these models, particularly Knowles' theory of andragogy, can be applied by practitioners involved in developing and administering adult education programs or in teaching or counseling adult students.

Although research on the relationship between job performance and basic skills is not definitive, it is clear that it is more important for workers to be able to apply basic skills in a job performance situation than to demonstrate these skills on a standardized test. Examples of successful occupationally oriented basic skills programs include a public and private sector cooperation effort to prepare Comprehensive Employment and Training Act eligible workers as competitive word processing operators, an urban retraining program for wastewater treatment workers, and an  occupational literacy training program sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense (the FLIT Program). Research indicates that individuals who wish to develop job-oriented basic skills programs should strive to maintain an orientation to the mission of the agency for which the basic skills program is being developed, provide training in basic skills within a functional context, arrange program conditions to maximize learning time, and use competency-based mastery learning techniques.

As of 1984, 70  percent of the labor education offered in the United States was provided by universities and 25 percent was provided by labor unions. To enable more workers to participate in labor education programs, the following strategies are suggested: increased dissemination of information concerning educational opportunities and available financial aid, provision of career and personal counseling to workers contemplating participation in labor education programs, development of more flexible work schedules, provision of incentives for participation in labor education, special focus on the needs of women and minorities, and increased availability of tuition prepayment plans.

Whereas distance education in the Soviet Union focuses on improving productivity in the workplace, it is used in the United States to provide extension courses, adult basic education, regular postsecondary education programming, and professional continuing education. Since its beginnings at the University of Wisconsin in 1919, distance education has encountered many obstacles. Included among the media used to provide distance education are teletext, videodiscs, sideband FM transmission, cable  television, and instructional television fixed service (ITFS). Of increasing popularity in the United States is the telecourse--an instructional program usually produced by a community college that involves video and printed materials and that generally relies on an array of support services, including computer-assisted counseling and testing, teleconferencing, and appointments with tutors.

Research reveals that, for a variety of socioeconomic and psychological reasons, dropouts are generally less able to plan, less willing to work hard, and less skilled in writing. Programs available for out-of-school youths range from those sponsored by community colleges and public schools to those offered by educational agencies in conjunction with employment and training programs. Three particularly noteworthy types of reentry programs for dropouts in adult settings are programs sponsored by technical schools, outreach programs, and continuing education high school programs. In general, successful  programs for young adults reentering the educational system are sensitive to the stresses faced by young adults, possess a warm and flexible environment, provide a clear understanding of what teachers expect of students, offer individual counseling and curricula relevant to individual student needs, and offer students continuous constructive feedback.

        "description":"Although 6 of the 20 fastest growing occupations are associated with high technology, only about 7 percent of all new jobs projected for the remainder of the century will be in high-tech areas. Bureau of Labor Statistics data indicate that far more job openings will occur in low- and entry-level occupations than in highly skilled or professional occupations. Many analysts feel that it is still impossible to assess the impact of high technology on the labor market of the future and it seems highly unlikely that individuals will be able to hold the same job for the 40 or 50 years of their working lives. Therefore, vocational educators should concentrate on providing students with sound training in the basic and transferrable skills, encouraging student participation in a system of  recurrent or lifelong education, and developing a program of technological literacy education that would begin in the elementary grades and extend through the postsecondary grades. Most planners agree that, even at the postsecondary level, vocational educators should emphasize development of transferrable skills and should, for the most part, leave job-specific training to those industries hiring vocational graduates.

        "description":"Vocational education, special education, and vocational rehabilitation are the three primary providers of school-to-work transition services to handicapped youth. Each of these three sectors has a vital role to play in the following aspects of transition services: identification, assessment, individualized program planning, program implementation and training activities, service delivery systems, employment services, and architectural barrier removal. By working to coordinate and avoid unnecessary duplications in their services, vocational and special educators and vocational rehabilitation practitioners can achieve substantial cost savings, reduce gaps in service, maintain continuity in services to clients, share state-of-the-art information and approaches, and develop joint  political action campaigns. To improve coordination among the three primary providers of transitional services to disabled youth, practitioners and policymakers must work to resolve conflicting pieces of pertinent Federal legislation, address problems relating to duplication of services, obtain increased cooperation of business, and develop linkages on a one-to-one level. Various exemplary programs addressing current problems in coordinating transition services do exist and are described in the literature on transitional services for handicapped youth. (MN)",

The flexibility and diversity of adult education have been tremendous advantages. They have also contributed to the confusion over what adult education is. Demographic forces that will make adult and continuing education a primary concern for educators include increasing adult populations, increasing adult education participation, and career transition. Accumulating evidence indicates that society is less literate and well informed than was true a generation ago. Mass media are blamed as contributors to that increase in illiteracy. Adult and continuing educators are, more and more,  graduates of doctoral programs. The literature supports contentions that the field of adult education lacks a solid foundation of scholarship and is weak in theory. Implications of demographics for the future imply a substantial demand for occupational and career training, enrollment increases, and changes in student composition enrolled in traditional academia. Educators will have to impart a capacity to learn and provide computer literacy training. Research on adult education will grow. The increased recognition of adult and continuing education will bring it a new status as an academic discipline. (YLB)",

The project aimed to (1) define the uses for microcomputers in construction management and trades; (2) develop prototype applications and computer-aided instruction (CAI) software for use in the community college curricula; (3) develop training procedures for teachers and students; (4) evaluate the use of microcomputers; (5) refine and make available the applications and CAI software for other community colleges; and (6) involve the private sector in the problem analysis and project  tasks. The project began with a survey mailed to the 42 California community colleges; of these only 9 responded, and only 2 were interested in participating in the study. The project, however, took place in three settings: a Merritt College introductory tools and techniques class; a Laney College wood technology class, and two two-week modules at the Santa Clara Carpenters Union Apprenticeship Training Center. Merritt College and the Santa Clara Apprenticeship Center both received remedial mathematics tutorial programs, while Laney College acquired a computer-aided design (CAD) program. The results of the project did not prove that the microcomputer was an effective mathematics tutor, and the CAD program was generally beyond the average students' capabilities. The computers, did,  however, provide an acceptable classroom diversion and socialization factor. Recommendations were made for provision of training in microcomputers for teachers and sharing microcomputer software resources among community colleges. (KC)",

        "description":"The elimination of adult functional illiteracy has been declared a national priority. More than the ability to decipher a given text, functional literacy means the practical application of literacy skills to life in a particular society or group. But this in turn demands that the individual have enough prior knowledge of the surrounding culture and social processes to be able to glean meaning from the text. Functional literacy is both culture-specific and situation-specific, enabling individuals to apply the knowledge gained for purposes of their own choosing; it is also an expansive tool, permitting people to broaden their social and cultural horizons and to participate more fully in the wider context of American life. In order to measure literacy, however, a shared cultural  backdrop is needed, and the U.S. high incidence of functional illiteracy probably reflects more the nation's high degree of cultural pluralism than the failure of the schools. In a pluralistic society there are many different contexts and groups, which necessitate different sets of skills and knowledge. Among contexts in which functional illiteracy is a particularly serious problem are immigrant populations, the military, the workplace, and prisons. In such settings, reading levels--being context dependent--cannot be changed independently of the context; however, when the context evolves, demanding more of its members, the chances that literacy levels will improve increase. The most promising approaches to literacy education now focus on the use of adult learning principles building upon  the sociocultural characteristics of specific groups of learners. These strategies recognize the need to organize learning experiences in distinct units relating to the immediate concerns, perceptions, and motivations of adults, that is, to be of direct relevance to their contexts.

The project's goal--to assemble and report current information on literacy issues--was achieved through three component efforts: information dissemination and technical assistance, research and development (R&amp;D), and policy analysis. Chapter I describes the first component; tasks included (1) development of an organizing model for literacy programs; (2) collection of program information (through surveys of 375 nominated programs and site visits to 32); and (3) a two-day national conference on the state-of-the-art of literacy instruction. The R&amp;D component outlined in chapter II  involved developing a guide to qualitative data collection and an interview guide, site visits, analysis of information from 213 programs, preparation of four research monographs, and creation of an R&amp;D agenda. In the policy analysis phase (chapter III), a compendium of demographic and statistical information on adult literacy characteristics was compiled; a synthesis of the conference presentations was assembled; and a white paper was prepared, discussing problems and issues affecting policy and decision making for adult literacy. Appendixes to this report include the agenda of the National Adult Literacy Conference, the interview guide, a program practice profile, the codebook used for program data analysis, the R&amp;D agenda survey, the call for authors for the white paper, and a list of  references.

Some research has shown children and adolescents consider moral (intrinsic) transgressions more serious than violations of convention. To expand this research by examining in detail the role of intrinsicality in moral discriminations, and to examine Catholic students' judgments of morally and conventionally wrong sexual acts, 101 Catholic undergraduates rated the seriousness of 16 sexual and nonsexual (violations of church rules) acts. The questionnaire contained four scales to measure criteria for distinguishing between morality and convention: seriousness, unalterability, universality, and intrinsicality. The results showed that most Catholic university  students saw a clear distinction between eight acts in the moral domain (intrinsically wrong), four acts in the conventional domain (not intrinsically wrong), and four acts in the prudential domain (not wrong at all). The results also revealed sex differences in the students' attitudes toward rules of their church (males saw violations of church rules as more wrong than did females) and in their attitudes toward some sexual acts (females were more emotional in their ratings of sexual acts). The results cast doubt on the validity of Kohlberg's test of moral development since the results of his test indicate that very few undergraduates can distinguish between morality and convention.

To explore the existence of the personal fable in inner-city female adolescents, 22 eighth grade black females in Chicago completed two tests. The first, the Ability to Say No in a Pressured Sexual Situation Scale, consists of 12 stories describing situations in which an inner-city female might find herself in relation to males. The girls first responded to the stories for a girl-friend, and then for themselves. The second instrument measured the girls' perceptions of future life choices. They again responded for a girl-friend and for themselves. The results showed  the girls were capable of accurately describing life in their neighborhood and their friends' probable responses to sexual pressure, but also were able to maintain that what happens to others will not happen to them. While this research supports the concept of a personal fable as one aspect of the early adolescent's sexual identity, longitudinal research is needed. (KGB)",

A study by Buss and Scheier reported that privately self-conscious persons are more susceptible to attribution bias, the self-focus of such persons leading them to attribute their positive and negative outcomes to internal causes. Three studies, each a near exact or conceptual replication of that research, were conducted to examine this hypothesis. In the first study, undergraduates who tested high (N=40) or low (N=40) in PSC were asked to imagine themselves in eight hypothetical situations whose outcomes were either positive or negative and to estimate the degree of personal responsibility they would assume for the outcomes. In  the second study, high PSC (N=56) and low PSC (N=62) undergraduates completed the Attributional Style Questionnaire while imagining themselves in a number of different success or failure situations and then while imagining another person experiencing the positive and negative outcomes. In the third study, a conceptual replication of Buss and Scheier was conducted with high (N=55) and low (N=46) undergraduates using an actual rather than a hypothetical outcome situation. In none of these studies did persons high in PSC make more internal attributions for events than those low in PSC. Various replication statistics were conducted, each showing that the attributional bias phenomenon reported by Buss and Scheier could not be corroborated. (NRB)",

In studies comparing the social skills of women and men, women nearly always display better social skills than men. Finally, studies comparing the friendships of women and men suggest that women are more involved than men with other people. These studies involve dyadic relationships; little research has been performed on sex differences in group memberships. Entering college freshmen (N=1100) completed questionnaires on their memories about high school groups and their expectations about college  groups. The results indicated that women belonged to more high school groups than men, belonged to larger groups, remained group members longer, enjoyed their group memberships more, and regarded groups as more important than did men. Women reported more positive memories than men about high school groups, even when the kinds of groups they belonged to during high school were taken into account. Similarly, women reported more positive expectations about college groups, even when the kinds of groups that they wanted to join during college were taken into account. These results suggest that sex differences in sociability were responsible for the more positive questionnaire responses of the women in this sample. (NRB)",

        "description":"Festinger's (1954) theory of social comparison holds that in the absence of objective standards, people use the attitudes or judgments of similar others to determine the correctness of their own positions. More recent studies have suggested, however, that people often prefer dissimilar comparison targets. A study was undertaken to examine the effect of subjective versus objective judgments on target choice. Undergraduates (N=103), divided into groups on the basis of their perceptual judgments on a minimal groups task, were asked to review the credentials of a college applicant and predict his likelihood of success. Subjects in the objective judgment condition were told they had sufficient information to make judgments while subjects in the subjective condition were instructed to  base judgments on personal opinions. Subjects were told that ingroup and outgroup members had evaluated the same applicant as they, and were asked to state their preference for comparing their judgments with ingroup and outgroup members. The manipulation of judgmental nature was found to affect subjects' comparison preferences. The results revealed a strong preference for comparison with similar others in the subjective judgment condition, and for dissimilar others in the objective judgment condition. (NRB)",

        "description":"Researchers have called psychologists' attention to the role that client perception of the therapeutic relationship plays in therapy outcome. Past studies assessing the impact on clients of therapist age have used varied research strategies and raised several methodological issues. A study was undertaken which attempted to resolve some of these issues and address the counselor-client age issue as a determinant of counselee preferences for help. Single (N=48) and married (N=48) women, between the ages of 18 and 31, observed one therapist in videotaped simulated interviews handling three client problems varied for interpersonal intimacy. Two older women (61 and 74 years old) and two younger women (26 and 34 years old) served as counselors. Subjects then completed the Client  Satisfaction Form and rated the counselor's attractiveness, expertness, and trustworthiness, using the Counselor Rating Form-Short. The results showed that younger counselors were preferred over older counselors when time management was an issue. No preferences based on counselor age were expressed for more intimate problems. Analyses of data on counselor expertness, attractiveness, and trustworthiness suggested that, although individual differences among counselors seemed to contribute to client satisfaction in dealing with issues of differential intimacy, chronological age did not emerge as a factor in younger, prospective clients' perceptions of counselor attributes.

        "description":"The ability to stand back from oneself and reflect on one's behavior and thought processes has long been considered crucial to the therapy process. Many therapies explicitly require patients to monitor their behaviors and thoughts. This self-monitoring requires considerable metacognitive skill on the part of the patient. Some therapies for the treatment of depression rely on the patient's metacognitive skills, although there is no clear evidence that depressives possess such skills. Two studies were conducted which investigated the relationship among depression, two types of metacognitive skill, and cognitive skill. The first study experimentally manipulated depression in 40 college students with a Velten procedure to examine depression effects on three skills: the ability to  estimate the solutions to math problems (cognitive skill); the ability to accurately predict one's ability to estimate the solutions (metacognitive knowledge about cognition); and the ability to accurately rate one's performance after estimating the solutions (metacognitive monitoring of cognitive performance). The second study measured these skills in 48 college students with severe, mild, or no depression. The results for both studies indicated that depressed subjects were less skillful than nondepressed subjects in both types of metacognitive abilities. These differences were found to be unrelated to response bias and not significantly correlated to cognitive skill. (Author/NRB)",

        "description":"Becoming a psychotherapist involves more than acquiring skills and knowledge. It involves a change in the way the psychotherapist trainee sees himself. Proponents of most psychotherapeutic modalities acknowledge that a clinician's fundamental clinical tool is his self. The therapist's self is involved in the spontaneous process of psychotherapeutic interaction and in the psychoanalytic concept of empathy. Trainees in psychotherapy must bring together their personal identity and the role of psychotherapist and must resolve the struggle between personal self and therapist self by splitting or by integration. When conceptualizing the development of the psychotherapist's identity, six aspects of that identity may be considered: (1) the unique interaction between the psychotherapist's  personal identity and the professional role; (2) the feeling of being a psychotherapist as opposed to the feeling of playing the role of psychotherapist; (3) being or feeling like a therapist in one's day-to-day life; (4) identification with a particular psychotherapeutic figure, theoretical model, or institution; (5) the level of integration of personal identity and the professional role; and (6) the expectations that the psychotherapist has of his work. A better understanding of the identity transformation of psychotherapist trainees will facilitate both the teaching and the learning of psychotherapy. (NRB)",

        "description":"Data from the public health field indicate a shift in emphasis from treatment models to wellness models which focus on individuals' health and how to maintain it. Similarly, school psychologists can enhance and maintain students' competence, thereby reducing the need for remediation. This would create a new role for psychologists in the schools, a specialty in educational school psychology. An educational school psychologist would strive to build students' competence by educating school personnel about research developments which can improve student competence, by implementing intervention approaches, and by conducting research and evaluation to determine the effectiveness of interventions and to generate and expand knowledge. Specific examples of these functions for the  educational school psychologist include: (1) educating teachers about research findings which relate teacher practices to student achievement; (2) offering in-service training to teachers on behavior modification techniques which have been found to be effective in improving student achievement and behavior; (3) developing school materials in accord with instructional system design; (4) helping teachers prepare adjunct questions for text materials and teaching students metacognitive strategies to improve reading comprehension; (5) demonstrating to teachers the usefulness of criterion referenced tests; (6) developing programs of computer-assisted instruction; and (7) conducting study skills training programs and test anxiety reduction training programs for students. These activities are  samples only. Continuing research will modify and expand these functions and more effective interventions will be developed. The vital functions for the educational school psychologist are to train others in order to have the important multiplier effect, and to keep abreast of new developments as they occur. A five-page list of references concludes the document. (NRB)",

        "description":"Although there is extensive literature on interpersonal influence in counseling, there are few studies of the relative influence of counselors on clients and clients on counselors. To investigate the convergent validity of three statistical approaches to relative influence in counseling, 57 counseling interviews were analyzed. The three statistical indices of influence were computed on the counselor-client verbal interactions: Tracey and Ray's topic determination (i.e., ratio of person's topic initiation successes to total number of topic initiations); Goodman and Kruskal's asymmetrical lambda (i.e., the relative decrease in the unpredictability of a consequent behavior when the antecedent behavior is known); and Shannon and Weaver's ambiguity index (i.e., the uncertainty of a  response). Analysis of results showed agreement was greatest (80 percent) between the topic determination and ambiguity indexes. There was little agreement (9 percent) between the asymmetrical lambda statistic and the other indices. While the lambda statistic appeared unusable as a measure of influence in this study it may be useful with broader response categories and less biased responding. (KGB)",

        "description":"Although previous research has attempted to account for the incidence of physical violence between dating partners, little attention has been devoted to the relationship factors that may account for the occurrence of violence between partners. To examine the relationships among violence and dating partners' love and liking, commitment to the relationship, and positive feelings, 270 undergraduate students (95 males; 175 females) completed a questionnaire packet. The packet included the following measures: the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS), the Positive Feelings Questionnaire (PFQ), the Broderick Commitment Scale (BCS), and the Liking and Love Scales. Analysis of results showed 38 percent of the females reported being victims of courtship violence and 49 percent reported violence  against a partner. Fifty percent of the males reported being victims of courtship violence and 30 percent reported being physically violent against a dating partner. The relationship between a history and current experiences of overall and severe aggression and victimization was highly significant for both men and women. Liking proved to be the most consistent distinguishing characteristic of male and female victims and agressors; it appears that decreased liking is a consequence rather than a cause of violence. These findings suggest that violent relationships seem to be characterized by men from violent families who have low liking or respect for their partners and women who have low liking or respect and low positive feelings for their partners. The longer the relationship, the more  likely that violence will take place. (KGB)",

To determine if there is a coronary prone behavior pattern in women preparing for traditionally male professionals, two studies were conducted. In the first study, 168 undergraduate women, in three traditionally male fields (i.e., engineering, management, and pre-medicine), 145 udergraduate men in the same fields, and 83 undergraduate women majoring in traditionally female fields (i.e., education, sociology, and psychology) completed a questionnaire. Measures of personality characteristics, physical and psychological symptoms, and work environment strain that are related to Type A behavior  were assessed. Results showed that the three groups differed significantly on Type A, as well as on other variables. The traditional women were significantly lower on Type A than the nontraditional women and the men. Very small differences were found in Type A for men and women in the same work environment. In a followup study, 216 subjects from the original sample completed similar questionnaires. Results showed that subjects whose current occupations were the same as their undergraduate majors did not differ on Type A. As in the first study, traditional women were significantly less Type A then the nontraditional women or men. The work environment was especially relevant to Type A, and Type A was especially relevant to symptoms for women and, to a lesser extent, for men who were  currently in high status, traditionally male fields. Type A was a better predictor of symptoms for women working in high status, traditionally male roles than it was across all subjects. (KGB)",

In the first, 144 undergraduates (68 male; 76 female) recorded their impressions of a target person, who was or was not depicted as a counseling client. Involvement was manipulated by leading some subjects to believe that they would not meet the target person (low involvement) and by informing other subjects that they would have a getting acquainted conversation with the target (high involvement). Results  showed that negative attitudes toward the counseling client increased as involvement increased. In the second experiment, 24 undergraduates (12 males; 12 females) were presented words as primes (\"client\", \"student\", and \"house\"). Each prime was twice paired with 16 test words. Results showed that subjects strongly associated socially desirable characteristics with nonclients and socially undesirable traits with clients.

        "description":"There has been increased interest in family systems approaches to the treatment of children's behavior problems. A study was conducted to compare children's behavior patterns in clinical and nonclinical intact families and to explore the relationship between family functioning and boys' behavior patterns. Subjects consisted of 16 clinic families who were clients of a child guidance center, and 14 non-clinic families recruited from the community. All families consisted of at least one male child between the ages of 6 and 12, and his biological parents. Families were assessed using self-reports of family process and boys' behavioral functioning. The results showed significant differences between groups on behavioral functioning and family process variables. Boys in nonclinical  families were reported to have significantly fewer and less severe behavior problems than boys in clinical families. The measure of family process indicated that clinical families reported significantly poorer problem solving and communication skills than nonclinical families. In addition, clinical families rated themselves as more disengaged and less adaptable than did nonclinical families. There was also a significant relationship between children's behavior problems and family processes such that more behavior problems correlated with more dysfunctional family processes.

        "description":"Research on family interaction patterns suggests that delinquent behaviors of children and adolescents may be related to, if not a direct function of, disordered interpersonal interaction within the family unit. Family interaction can be seen as a sequence of interlocking events occurring over time and consisting of the three basic characteristics of sequentiality, flexibility, and constraint. Although researchers have been reasonably successful in identifying certain recurrent behavior patterns in family interaction, overall progress has been constrained by limitations of the methods typically employed. Three methods of discrete sequential analysis appear to hold promise for the study of family interaction processes and delinquency. Each is a technique used for analyzing  sequences of behavior in order to search for sequential patterns or redundancies among behaviors. Markov chain analysis, lag sequential analysis, and information theory are all procedures which would allow researchers to identify recurrent patterns and test the hypothesized relationships between family interactions and delinquent behavior, while retaining the sequential ordering of the family's responses and recognizing the reciprocal nature of their interaction.

        "description":"The quality of parenting in dual career families has been the subject of much debate. To determine whether employed and non-employed mothers, varying in psychological identity status (parental and occupational), differ in the maturity of their perspectives on children and the parent role, 37 married women with children were interviewed. The interviews were conducted using the Parental Awareness Interview and a revised version of Marcia's (1966) semi-structured identity interview to determine occupational and parental identity. Data analyzed by one-way ANOVA's showed that there were no significant differences between the employed and non-employed groups in the parental identity, the occupational identity, or the parental awareness domains. The data presented suggest that without  adequate replacement for a mother's nurturing, some mothers express conflict about developing an occupational identity. (KGB)",

        "description":"Research on gender stereotypes has contrasted males with females, describing males by competency traits and females by traits which denote warmth or emotionality. However, it has become clear that these traits do not satisfactorily describe all members of either sex, since not all men possess only masculine characteristics and not all women exhibit only feminine characteristics. To determine if there are within-sex categories of males, 200 college students (100 male; 100 female) rated the traits and behaviors of three types of males: family man, businessman, and macho man. Subjects rated the items for how they described one particular kind of male or all males in general. Results indicated that, although subjects did systematically rate traits and behaviors as being  characteristic of separate categories of males, a few characteristics were considered to be equally descriptive of all males. It seems that both males and females discriminate at least three distinct role categories among males. These findings, when compared with previous work on female categories, suggest a remarkable similarity between the female and male categories, and reveal parallel categories which cross sex lines.

        "description":"Protocols were obtained from 22 subjects as they discovered the conditions under which equilibrium is obtained on a balance beam by predicting and observing the outcomes of a series of problems. The interviews revealed that subjects used a variety of heuristics to make predictions once they had isolated the two relevant features of the problem, weight and distance, but before they could appropriately relate them in one procedure. These heuristics included instance-based reasoning, qualitative estimation of distance, and the use of quantitative rules of limited generality. Variability in the use of these heuristics by individuals suggests that learning to understand the balance beam is not best described in terms of a simple rule acquisition theory, and that reasoning from  instances plays a more important role in inferring a physical relationship than previously thought.

The paper cites numerous studies on the subject, including studies on whether environmental print experiences enable young children to process graphic cues, how beginning readers get started using graphic cues to read words, whether beginning readers could learn to read words more easily using visual or phonetic cues, how phonetic cue readers learn to read and spell words and how they differ from cipher readers, how beginning readers acquire a lexicon of printed words, how spelling can perform a mnemonic function, and how children's memories function for words containing silent  letters. Other studies tested the theory that creating and storing a special spelling pronunciation for words should boost memory for the spellings, examined the influence of spellings on children's conceptions of phonemes in words to see if learning spellings would alter children's ideas about speech, and observed whether spellings influence pronunciations. Conclusions and results of the studies are provided. References and tables of findings are included. (EL)",

Acknowledging that this free software is not without limitations (poor documentation, poor spelling and grammar, etc.), the committee nevertheless felt that most teachers would be more than happy to have these diskettes available for their students. As a result, the project began with a survey of the availability of public domain software and location of sources. Programs were stored on master diskettes in the categories of reading/literature, teacher utilities, content areas, writing, and thinking  activities. The next stage involved the evaluation and screening of the programs that had been collected. Programs that were unsuitable were discarded. All programs identified as appropriate were then field tested by computer-using teachers in New Jersey public schools. At the same time, a documentation set was drawn up and duplicated. Reprograming and modification of the software began when the reports on field testing arrived. Future plans call for the creation of content area diskettes, diskettes for teaching writing, and a diskette of thinking games. (A list of programs on each diskette and documentation for some of the programs are appended.) (HOD)",

        "description":"Two studies were conducted to determine whether the consonant errors displayed by readers with severe reading disabilities are the result of phonetic rather than visual substitutions. In the first study, the reading and spelling performance of three groups of readers with average IQs but with reading levels two years below grade level, was compared with that of matched controls, using a list of 96 one-syllable nonsense words. Subjects in all groups made more phonetic than visual substitutions, showing that even among those with severe reading disabilities linguistic confusions account for reading problems. Also, subjects from all three test groups, but not from the control groups, made as many or more consonant additions than they did phonetic substitutions in both the reading  and spelling tasks. A qualitative, post-hoc analysis of the errors suggested that these additions may have resulted from the test subjects attributing phonemic status to the intermediate articulations approximated when sounding out a nonsense word (such as, ope to olpe). It was thought that subjects might rely on such an articulatory strategy if they had an inaccessible or poorly developed phonological system. The second study was designed to test this articulatory strategy explanation. A list of 262 one-syllable nonsense words was developed to test specific predictions emerging from the study. Results from the second study replicated those of the first, and were consistent with predictions. (HTH)",

        "description":"Two experiments were conducted in order to determine whether children are able to make analogies in learning to read. In the first experiment, 24 children from a primary school were taught three types of word pairs--only one pair of which was analogies--and then tested. Results showed not only that children are aware that consistency of spelling predicts consistency of pronunciation in the way required for an analogy but also that they are able to apply this knowledge selectively when given conflicting information about spelling-sound sequences. In the second experiment, primary school children were given a \"clue\" word from which analogies could be made, and then asked to read analogous and nonanalogous test words. The subjects were tested under three different conditions with  three different types of test words. If children were able to make analogies in reading without any training on the relevant orthographic sequence, they should have been better at reading the target words than the control words. This pattern of results seems to be supported. These results suggest that the ability to make analogies is not a developmental ability but a fundamental strategy in learning to read. (DF)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to examine some of the cognitive and linguistic factors that influence metaphor comprehension in young children. Presupposing that (1) the similarities between the topic and the vehicle in a metaphor comprise the metaphor's ground, (2) salience is the degree of prominence of a characteristic in relation to a concept, and (3) a directed comparison occurs when the topic is examined in terms of the vehicle (for example, &quot;the surgeon is a butcher,&quot; where the surgeon is the topic and butcher is the vehicle), it was predicted that high salience grounds would be easier for children to identify than mixed salience grounds and that directed comparisons would be easier to comprehend than nondirected ones. Subjects were 72 preschool children, who were asked to identify  the grounds between word pairs in statements that varied in salience, directed or nondirected linguistic form, and ordering of salience (topic to vehicle or vehicle to topic). The results indicated that the children were sensitive to the linguistic form of the statements and were able to identify the grounds of statements that were based on ordered, mixed salience that typifies metaphors. Mixed salience grounds were more difficult than high salience grounds. The children did not appear to engage in the type of directed processing that is most efficient for understanding metaphor.

In the early 1950s, the research trend began to shift to a more specific, quantitative, and empirical direction. Both government and private sources provided large grants for projects conducted in a number of important institutions. The most essential work of this trend was a series of reports issued from 1952 to 1956 by the International Press Institute. A review of the studies published since 1970  reveals at least four frameworks that have been used to analyze international news: content analysis of international news, the theoretical proposition in the news, the imbalance in news flow, and factors influencing the process of news flow. Problems inherent in the current research trend involve the limitation of methodological techniques, generalizable knowledge, discovery of subject categories, and research propositions. (HOD)",

        "author":["Michal-Johnson, Paula"],
        "description":"Offering instruction in performance appraisal (PA) skills as well as in selection interviewing contributes to business communication students' potential for finding the most appropriate job and keeping it. Students and faculty can benefit from the recognition that in appraisals of performance effective communication behavior is a key indicator of success on the job. Employee interpersonal communication skills are cited as among the top factors influencing a high performance rating. One of the most prevalent approaches to training for the PA is the case study exercise. However, its weaknesses create problems for students in identifying with the content and the process of the PA. A reality based approach can overcome these weaknesses by creating a one-on-one correspondence between  the appraisal process as it occurs in business and industry and the assignment administered in class. This necessitates a two-part assignment: the informational interview related to the profession of the student's choice, and the PA interview. Students submit tapes of their informational interview for review, and then undergo a performance evaluation with the instructor. While this method requires a great deal of time, students in these interviews generate a higher degree of commitment than students who role-play in case studies. The assignments can often be more relevant for students than their courses, and the informational courses and interview allow them to establish job contacts. (HTH)",

Important appraiser characteristics are credibility, a consistent style between day-to-day behavior and interview behavior, and the ability to engage in active listening. Employee participation in the performance-appraisal process involves preparation for the interview (by engaging in self-rating and working through a structured worksheet) and actual  participation in the interview, including goal setting.

The weekly videotaping of speeches, to be presented in front of an audience for review and discussion, helps develop poise.

        "description":"To determine how high school journalism textbooks published from 1980 to 1985 deal with mass media and to what extent they deal with journalistic skills versus historical and theoretical content, a content analysis was made of nine comprehensive textbooks published during that period. Specific content areas that were analyzed in the historical and theoretical context were news understanding, the individual's use of the media, mass media in society, journalism history, press law/First Amendment freedom, functions of newspapers, responsibility, new technology, careers, and ethics. Among the journalistic skills analyzed were newsgathering, news reporting, proofreading, copyediting, production processes, and news writing. The analysis showed that current high school journalism  textbooks tend to cover similar information for student development of skills. However, the analysis of the coverage of the historical and theoretical content showed a disparity among books. A content checklist for the books and a bibliography of texts reviewed are included.

        "description":"In a high school writing class of eight students, a computer was used as a word processor to permit close observation of students as they learned. The class was studied using ethnographic techniques: videotape, audiotape, teacher/researcher journals, student writing, and interviews. Three types of learners emerged: marginal--those who had protracted problems learning to use the word processor and who made little progress in their writing; selective--those who became proficient with word processing but who made little writing progress; and dynamic--those who were successful on both fronts. Because the class was composed of students from various grades and various tracking levels, different socialization factors were perceived as contributing to students' successes or failures. The  most obvious conclusion is that the computer's presence in the classroom appears unlikely to negate the powerful influence of the differential socialization of students by social class and its effect on their success or failure in school. Among other options for promoting educational equity, teachers must design and implement specific modifications in their pedagogical approaches to find those most likely to work with the range of students in their classrooms.

        "description":"A five-page questionnaire was mailed to 709 persons on the subscriber list of the &quot;Newspaper Research Journal&quot; to determine if a problem existed between academic journalism researchers and practitioner consumers of the research. The questionnaire was constructed to measure the usefulness of various sources of information to the respondents, their frequency of reading several specific academic and professional or trade publications, how much of the various academic journals they read, and the usefulness of the articles in the journals they read. Results showed that more academics reported academic journals as being very useful to them than did practitioners. Surprisingly, both academics and practitioners concentrated their reading in the same academic journals. While a majority of  the practitioners reported reading at least some of the articles in the academic journals they looked into, fully a third of the editors, more than any other group of practitioners, reported reading most of the articles in the journals they read. Both groups stated they would like to see more practical, problem oriented research reported in the academic journals. (HOD)",

        "description":"The failure of 17 newspaper markets between 1957 and 1975 raises the question of whether the 1982 entrance of &quot;USA Today&quot; into the newspaper market demonstrated fiscal prudence. A 20-month advertising content analysis was conducted to assess advertising trends in &quot;USA Today.&quot; These data were compared with industry statistics obtained from Media Records Data. The findings indicated that &quot;USA Today&quot; has outperformed expectations on certain fronts, while failing on others. Although the paper has attracted a small but educated and affluent readership, the media director of one advertising agency believes that the succinct writing and color graphics style of &quot;USA Today&quot; has caused an advertising identity problem, since the paper cannot be neatly categorized. Many advertising industry  executives view the publication as a combination newspaper, magazine, traveler's digest, and surrogate for the evening news. The benefits of differentiation from mass audience newspapers may therefore be lost in the confusion of accurately defining the precise role of &quot;USA Today&quot; within the advertising and media communities. Despite these concerns, analyses reveal a highly stable pattern of advertiser support, and an impressive list of corporations committed to future advertising. If &quot;USA Today&quot; is able to continue its circulation increase pattern and, specifically, increase home and office delivery readership, it will become very difficult to ignore it as an advertising vehicle.

Sixteen commercials, categorized as simple video/simple audio through complex video/complex audio were edited into two globally high- and two globally low-involving programs. Local involvement was varied within each of the four programs. Sixty-nine male and female undergraduate students viewed the programs and commercials and were asked to recall as many as possible of the commercials they had just seen. The subjects were then given a recognition test on which they indicated the product categories for which they had seen commercials and listed the brand names. Attitudes toward the  commercials and television viewing behavior and demographics were also ascertained. The results indicated that recall and recognition of the commercials was lower for globally high-involving programs. Local involvement resulted in mixed memory effects. Audio eomplexity aided recalls and the effect was enhanced by the presence of video complexity. No attitude effects were found. (HTH)",

Attached to each unevaluated and unidentified student report was a form with 15 different response areas that measured on a one-to-five scale the reader's response to the writer. Readers' responses showed that they differentiated between competence and character. The medians that reflected measurement of the writers' control over subject matter were relatively high and consistent. But the readers gave their most positive responses to writers whose reports projected a voice of active participation in the subject matter, a visible connection of self  and subject. For those writers whose voice was, in comparison, objective, the response medians were lower. The one stylistic strategy that stood out clearly was the use of cohesive ties, especially the use of repetition. The data suggest the importance of the high number of oral elements in the reports that received the highest responses. The use of these oral elements calls for a rhetorical approach to technical communication. (HOD)",

For fifteen weeks, the teachers attended each other's freshman writing courses, each of which met twice a week for a total of three hours. Differences in student participation, behavior of the teacher, and lesson plans were observed, with Betsy's behavior and conscious actions setting up the kind of classroom culture that would encourage autonomous behavior within a community of writers. The hypothesis that it is possible to create a classroom culture developed. This hypothesis was tested when Bob began teaching  a course at a community college whose spring semester started four weeks later than the one at NYU. Bob reconstructed his course outline to more closely resemble Betsy's, and the quality of his class improved. (DF)",

The five areas of the survey focused on (1) characteristics of the respondent and organization, (2) communication and decision making within the organization, (3) organizational change, (4) new communication technologies, and (5) familiarity with and adoption of Japanese management principles. The companies that were investigated demonstrated many characteristics typical of more authoritarian, small, nonunion organizations. Communication was typically downward, and most decisions were made by top level management. Most companies reported being affected by new  technologies or advances in their industries, and most indicated high satisfaction with them. Only 60% had computers, 17% used electronic mail, 16% used Telex, and 4% participated in video teleconferences. One-third of those interviewed were not familiar with Japanese management practices, and only 17% were very familiar. Seventy percent of the companies made no attempt to adopt such principles. While 67% of those who had adopted some Japanese principles felt they were successful, 31% were neutral. (HTH)",

Subjects read four scripts describing various problems that a manager might encounter with an employee or another manager of equal status, and explained how they would resolve the problem. Four versions of each script (four scripts are in Portuguese as well as English) were used, matching all posible combinations of American and Brazilian managers with male and female employees. Responses were read and assigned to one of three classifications: (1) communication, if the primary means for resolution was discussion; (2) organizational power, if the employee would be forced to follow the manager's directives; or (3) mixed approach, if the response  included discussion of the problem coupled with either an implicit or an explicit threat of sanction should the employee refuse to comply with the manager's directives. The results gave no evidence that the managers of either nationality would behave differently toward men than toward women. The data also indicated no difference between nationalities in the way they would resolve disputes with employees dissatisfied at having to perform a task not in their job description, in the way they handle employees who had violated the chain of command, or in handling disputes with other managers. The results did indicate that Brazilians were more likely than Americans to resolve challenges to their authority through the use of power. (HTH)",

        "description":"The public controversy surrounding recent government proposals for supporting private schools through tuition tax credits has prompted an interest in studying the impact of private schooling on racial segregation in education. This report examines the degree of black-white segregation in the Catholic schools in the Chicago and Cleveland metropolitan areas with a view to finding out whether the Catholic schools do or do not promote racial segregation. Elementary schools were found to be highly segregated, but Catholic high schools were less segregated than the public high schools were when traditional nearest-school student assignments were used. The accounting model used in the Coleman, Hoffer, and Kilgore study of the issue was analyzed, and after an examination of both sides of  the argument, it is tentatively concluded that the accounting model researchers were overly optimistic and that the data from the present study gives little reason to believe with them that the impact of the private schools is simply benign. At the same time there is insufficient data to support what may be the more likely conclusion: namely, that private schools further school segregation under certain conditions and encourage integration under others.

The project's many goals focused on increasing interdependence among educational resources to support a more individualized, humanized, and effective response to pupil needs. Schools participating in the RPS effort usually selected one or two innovations for implementation from among those suggested. Evaluation of the project's initial progress in 1981 revealed that many local schools had implemented innovations marginally if at all. Expansion of the project to additional schools was halted while a second study was undertaken to determine how local school policies affecting innovation related to the degree of implementation achieved. This report discusses the nature  of the RPS project, the factors leading to the second evaluation study, the theoretical framework of the study, the interviewing method and questions used, the variables found to affect implementation, the local policies identified, the measurement of implementation levels, and the relationships found between policies and implementation. The document concludes with a report on the first stages of a study to determine how local school policies concerning innovation become institutionalized. This study sought further data from schools examined in the earlier evaluations. (PGD)",

The second and third sections review data in order to generate a general understanding of teachers' and supervisors' experiences with and perceptions of instructional supervision. The review of teachers' data first presents respondents' general perceptions of the supervision experienced, and this is followed by an examination of a set of supervisory practices often discussed in the  supervisory literature and an analysis of teachers' perceptions of the relationships between these practices and actual improvements in classroom teaching. The third section focuses on supervisors' data, presenting an initial interpretation of supervisors' reports on their practices and perceptions of instructional supervision. The final section compares and contrasts teacher and supervisor data and briefly describes future directions of the study. Appendix A provides an address to write to for information regarding the survey used in the study, and Appendix B contains a set of tables showing the data obtained from the study. (TE)",

        "description":"Using recent establishment clause decisions concerning vocal prayer, silent meditation, and prayer groups in the public schools, this article suggests that courts have applied the seemingly consistent doctrine of the tripartite test to arrive at quite different results, based in part on extralegal sources. Two such sources are the attitudinal variance among judges and the practical posture provided by administrators. The latter source, as exemplified in the prayer-group cases, can be an important and sometimes ironic influence on the judicial outcome. Hence, those school districts that seek to disallow access to such groups could do so either by developing a policy that severely limited extracurricular activities or, under a more open policy, by allowing access but maximizing  sponsorship, support, and supervision. It is argued that school districts that seek to accommodate such groups should have an expansive policy that does not mention religion and that keeps involvement to a minimum. (Author/TE)",

        "description":"This study was undertaken to assess the accuracy of principals' judgments of the effectiveness of the teachers they supervise. Each of 46 principals was asked to fill out a brief form judging the overall effectiveness of each of the teachers in his or her school. The form asked how effective the teacher was in performing three roles: (1) promoting academic goals, (2) promoting affective goals, and (3) performing other professional functions. Each principal's judgments of teachers of a single grade were intercorrelated with expected achievement gains of pupils of high, average, and low ability in the teachers' classes. Analytical procedures similar to those used in &quot;meta-analyses&quot; were used to examine the resulting large set of correlations. Findings revealed that the relationship  between principals' judgments of teacher effectiveness and pupils' gains on achievement tests is very low. The factor most closely related to the magnitude of the correlation between principals' judgments and pupils' gains was the grade taught by the teachers rated. Other factors tested that were found not to be significantly related to the size of the correlations were pupil ability, subject taught, teacher role judged, and interactions between and among these factors.

        "description":"The purpose of this research was to investigate and describe the relationship of environmental change to superintendent-school board decision-making and superintendent turnover. Assuming the resource dependence model of organizational open system theory, researchers hypothesized that the amount of decision-making autonomy boards grant to superintendents and the mobility of superintendents would be related to the amount of turbulence in the community. To gather data for the study, two instruments were developed: (1) a 57-item questionnaire to measure superintendent-board expectations on the relative dependence or independence of the superintendent in various contexts; and (2) a commnity environment questionnaire with 12 questions illustrating important aspects of the relationship  between community characteristics and environmental turbulence. A total of 273 school districts were surveyed with these instruments in 1979 and again in 1983. Data analysis suggests statistically significant relationships between the management process occurring in education (perceptions of superintendents and boards concerning the amount of discretionary authority in decision making that boards should grant to superintendents) and environmental turbulence within the community.

        "description":"This paper examines the social phenomenon of leadership succession in a school from the perspective of the successor, based on the author's own experience in succeeding to the principalship of a junior high school. Using a combination of participant observation, informal interview, and existing and collected documents, the study was designed to examine a native view of succession--how this principal made sense of the experience from the moment a succession was possible until the role of new leader no longer seemed useful for explanatory or interpretive purposes in the school. The interaction among groups and individuals separates the period of study into three parts: prearrival or pre-succession (April to August), the succession period (September to December), and post-succession  (January to February). Two themes drawn from the data and from other succession studies surfaced immediately: personal traits and others' perception of successor's intentions. Four additional themes that dominated the experience are identified and discussed: (1) perceptions of actors developing across time; (2) actors' expectations; (3) environmental norms, conditions, and events in the school, district, and community; and (4) new social patterns, which developed gradually to a dominant position in the coded references. The discussion illustrates how each of these six themes delineate the three stages of succession. References are included. (TE)",

Between 1980 and 1984 the largest increase in federal support (30 percent as of 1984) went to research at universities and related institutions. During the same period, federal support for elementary and secondary education grew by 1 percent, and support for higher education declined by 7 percent. Among federal agencies, the Department of Education provides the most program funds overall and for all purposes except research. The Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Energy are the leaders in outlays for research at universities.

The study focused on the following topics: teaching self-delivered reinforcement, differential reinforcement of other behavior within small group instruction settings, social interaction with autistic youth, social interaction during  breaktime, between-class generalization, attitude change, and social language use. Findings suggested that teaching severely and moderately handicapped children to initiate and expand social interactions with peers and coworkers could influence the amount and type of interaction occurring in nontrained settings.

A multiple-baseline across subjects design was used to assess the effectiveness of a training package based on concurrent training of chains of responses using systematic prompting and reinforcement of correct behavior. Generalization was promoted using a multiple exemplar strategy. The results showed that all participants acquired a chain of social break behaviors using one peer trainer. Two participants displayed generalization of social responses prior to  the acquisition of the complete chain. Two participants required training with multiple peers prior to the occurrence of generalization. (Author)",

The responses taught were unique to each set of toys. Results indicated that training to generalize wihin two sets of toys was associated with stimulus generalization of other sets that did not formerly show generalization in three participants. Probes were also taken on responses to two additional sets of toys that differed from the previous sets in topography and in the effects that the toys produced. While the  participants generalized to between 50% and 100% of the toys that were similar in responses and effects they did not generalize to toys from the dissimilar sets.

        "description":"The study examined attitude change among 27 nonhandicapped high school students toward 9 severely handicapped autistic peers following two types of direct contact programs, one of a tutorial nature and one of a noninstructional, friendship nature. Ss were randomly placed in one of three experimental groups: tutorial, friendship, or no-contact control. Pre- and posttests on an attitude survey, a 5 minute behavior probe measuring duration and type of interactions, and interviews with each participant were conducted. Findings revealed that contact resulted in a significant increase in amount and type of interaction with handicapped peers during noninstructional periods. Slight differences were found in willingness to interact as indicated by behavioral observations between special  friends and peer tutors, but the differences were not significant. Overall, both the peer tutor and special friends program were successful, as evidenced from interview and observation data, in promoting more positive interactions. (CL)",

        "description":"The effects of a procedure based on differential reinforcement of other behaviors (DRO) on stereotypic responses and task performance were tested with three autistic students (14-21 years old). The procedure was unique because the time interval employed between potential opportunities for reinforcement was the natural length of one instructional trial delivered to a peer. Thus, the procedure was designed to reduce the level of stereotypic respones during small group instruction. The results indicated that the procedure exerted functional control over the students' stereotypic responses. In addition, two of the students had significantly greater percentages of correct responses under DRO conditions. The results are discussed in terms of models for intervention within task contexts  and the usefulness of the procedure under natural teaching conditions. (Author)",

Experiment 1 involved teaching two autistic youths (17-20 years old) to initiate and elaborate social interactions with three age appropriate and commonly used leisure objects; a radio, a video game, and gum. The students were first taught to use the objects and subsequently instructed in the related social skills. The youths generalized these social responses to other nonhandicapped peers in the same leisure setting. A second experiment trained a third autistic youth (18 years old) to emit similar social leisure skills. The use of the leisure objects and the related social skills were taught at the same time. The autistic youth learned these  skills and generalized them to other nonhandicapped peers in the same leisure setting. The importance of teaching generalized social responding in particular subenvironments was emphasized. (Author)",

In the first step, educators are asked to apply criteria of need, effectiveness, cost, divisibility, and adaptation to their practice. In step 2, describing a practice/defining a prototype, educators are guided in developing a prototypical description of practices through questions on such topics as curriculum, essential features, contexts and conditions, organization and administration, and costs. Preparing a  prospectus is considered in terms of program characteristics, minimum standards for replication, and user concerns.

One such teacher involved his high school students in decorating and furnishing the classroom from salvaged materials. Another, a teacher of 8-to 10-year olds, exhibited an attitude of learning from the child the meaning of the child's symptoms and valuing rather than eliminating those symptoms. A third teacher used his knowledge of antiques to inspire in students an understanding of the value of the past.

Clients, who were placed in competitive employment over the past 10 years, responded to a phone or mail survey regarding their current employment and recent job history. Results showed that the industry-based rehabilitation model achieves its goal of competitive employment for handicapped participants (72% were currently employed at short-term followup and 70% were employed at long-term followup). Despite a significant relationship between type of handicap and current employment status, the majority of  clients in all four handicapped groups were competitively employed 1-10 years following placement. The 10 client variables examined in the study did not significantly predict successful employment outcomes at long or short-term followup or for any of the handicapped groups with one exception: employer ratings of clients after 1 month on the job were significantly related to successful employment outcomes for the learning disabled group.

The complex nature of the adult service system is noted, and examples of program models identified as innovative are offered, including those focusing directly on transition mechanisms between high school and adult services, as well as those adult service models emphasizing independent or semi-dependent living. The section on information on federal and state expenditures outlines spending by the Health Care Financing Administration, the Social  Security Administration, the Office of Human Development Services and the Public Health Service. Two approaches to financing and delivery of adult services are noted: (1) increased reliance on smaller community-based intermediate care facilities and home and community-based care allowed by the Medicaid waiver provisions; and (2) growing use of programs stressing independent living and competitive work.

The summaries of P.L. 94-142 (the Education for All Handicapped Children Act) and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 focus on the rights afforded to handicapped children and their families under the law. Information on disabilities is intended to provide resources for teachers and nonhandicapped students in mainstreamed classrooms. The manual covers basic definitions, answers to commonly asked questions, simulation activities, and suggestions for learning for the following disabilities: vision impairments, hearing impairments and deaf-blindness, speech disabilities, physical disabilities, mental retardation, learning disabilities, multiple handicaps, emotional  disabilities and autism, and other health impairments. For each topic covered the manual lists relevant reading materials, films and organizations, and in a section on additional resources provides brief descriptions of books and other media resources that give general information on handicapping conditions and additional resources on approaches to fostering positive attitudes. Suggestions for appropriate behavior when meeting a person with a disability are also provided. (CL)",

Data gathered by pharmacy students from a case study under the supervision of their preceptors, a clinical pharmacist and a special educator, facilitated the physician's decision to reduce the medication for the child as behavioral intervention was implemented at home and school. Findings indicated that while the subject was taking psychostimulant medication, often recommended for children with hyperactive behaviors, the drug alone did not necessarily result in improvement of on-task,  school-adaptive behaviors.

Four of the tests were of skills in English as a second language (ESL): the grammar sections of the Michigan Proficiency Exam, a 100-item multiple-choice listening comprehension test, a cloze test of brief ESL passages, and ESL dictations. Four tests were of technical language, designed by and with passages submitted by the technical faculty, including a 50-item multiple-choice technical grammar test, reading passages, cloze tests of brief passages, and dictations. It was found that the tests of ESL correlated  significantly with the technical language tests. During the next semester, structure and listening tests were administered and the results analyzed to determine the predictability of the learner's future technical performance. It was found that the ESL tests predicted ESL performance slightly better than the ESP tests, while the integrative cloze and dictation tests appeared to be better indicators of a learner's ability to succeed in technical subjects.

Both groups have a limited amount of time for training, and the topics selected for inclusion in the program include: encouragement of respectful, authentic, and mutually interesting instructional conversation between and among language teachers and learners; a theoretical understanding of the nature of learning; and facilitation of language learning through planning learning activities and making and adapting learning materials. Both courses use videotapes of classroom activities in instructional  contexts similar to their own but in an unfamiliar language, first without and then with visual aids, to highlight their effectiveness. The two programs use different materials development needs, the tutor training project focusing on the use of real conversations, and the heritage language teacher project concentrating on teacher-developed materials. It is expected that the videotape use will encourage the tutors and teachers to try new techniques and to feel more confident about currently used techiques. (MSE)",

An apology is seen as consisting of five major linguistic strategies: an expression of an apology, an explanation or account of the situation used as an indirect act of apology, an acknowledgment of responsibility, an offer of repair, and/or a promise of forbearance. The 180 subjects included 96 native English-speaking students at 6 United States universities and 84 advanced learners of English at Israeli universities. Two versions of a language use questionnaire  designed to elicit apologies in varied situations were administered to the subjects. The responses were categorized by strategies used in the apologies elicited and combination or modification of strategies. The findings indicate that nonnatives lack sensitivity to certain distinctions that natives make between forms for expressing apology and between intensifiers, with the nonnative tendency being to overgeneralize or use a variety of forms. It was also found that nonnatives tend to avoid interjections and curses, and do not consistently produce comments providing the appropriate social lubricant in difficult situations. Whether or not it is worthwhile to teach learners these distinctions is still under consideration. (MSE)",

It is proposed that for at least some speakers there is little or no awareness of major structural divergences, and that these kinds of misunderstandings should be examined for insights into the strategies that  speaker-hearers use in cross-dialectal communication. It is suggested that these and other findings from the literature support the assumption that 100% correct identification of structural cues in utterances is not a necessary prerequisite to viable communication between speakers of different dialects.

Hints for classroom implementation include emphasizing repetition instead of rhyme in student poetry writing assignments, because rhyme can be difficult for  language learners; discouraging undue concern about spelling, grammar, punctuation, and neatness in student poetry writing; having enough copies of each poem for all students; and being aware of the special problems of adolescent students, such as shyness, the literariness of some who write and the hostility of some who don't.

        "description":"A three-year research project investigated the effects of instructional practices and patterns of language use in bilingual and English-only classrooms on general academic development and the development of English language skills by limited-English-proficient students, especially those skills needed to participate fully in the society's schools. The subjects were native Chinese- and Spanish-speaking students with two to three years of exposure to English, from 17 bilingual program classes. Tests, classroom observation, and audio and video recordings focusing on instructional situations were used to assess oral and written language comprehension and production, subject-area academic achievement, and the instructional practices and patterns of instructional language use. It was  found that variables influencing development of English production skills included: interactional opportunities, especially for Hispanic students and those with lower initial English proficiency; quality of the learning environment, especially for Chinese students with low initial English proficiency; and quality of language and teaching, largely for Hispanic students. Variables affecting English comprehension skills included: percent of time in teacher-directed activity; quality of learning environment, for Hispanics at all levels and for Chinese at the intermediate level; quality of instructional language, only for Hispanics; interactional opportunities, for Hispanics; and verbal and extended-response practice, for the Chinese.

The subjects, 32 native English-speaking university students, were assigned randomly to four groups, each using as stimuli a series of 48 sentences with a different sentence construction type but similar content for each group. The subjects were asked to write a continuation sentence for each stimuli sentence in the style of the original sentence. The continuation sentences were scored according to the entity in  the stimulus sentence most strongly linked to the continuation sentence. Results show no evidence that readers automatically assume the first noun phrase to be the current discourse topic, but they do suggest that the choice of topic for an ongoing discourse can be affected considerably by the choice of syntactic construction, with readers relying on cues that mark discourse entities as potential topics. Further research on the relative importance of the variables investigated is recommended. (MSE)",

The subjects were 13 Japanese adults (mean age 27.1) and 13 advanced learners of Japanese as a second language (mean age 26.6). The production of the potential inflection by the two subject groups was compared under time pressure. The task stimuli were from the two morphophonological classes of Japanese verbs: vowel-stem verbs (verbs whose stems end with vowels) and consonant-stem verbs (whose stems end with consonants). The results indicated that native speakers were always more proficient than nonnative subjects, but for both groups, consonant-stem verbs were always more difficult than vowel-stem verbs. No interaction was found  between the two variables, native-nonnative proficiency and verb classification. When the stimuli were further reclassified to reflect item difficulty, the distribution of errors was again found to be independent of whether the speaker was native or nonnative. It is concluded that within the area of morphophonological processing, nonnative speakers of Japanese closely resemble native speakers. (MSE)",

This investigation examined the factor structure and factor stability of the FIRO-BC. Additionally, an attempt was made to empirically determine the concurrent validity of the three interpersonal behavior areas measured by the FIRO-BC (inclusion, control, and affection) using peer-nomination data. Data were collected from public school students in two administrations, one year apart (n=282; n=226). Approximately 39 percent of the subjects took part in both. It was determined  that a six factor solution was stable across test administrations, but that the FIRO-BC scales do not appear to adequately measure the theoretical constructs which were hypothesized by Schutz (1958).

Unweighted averages of 12 distinct dimensions of self-concept from the Self Description Questionnaire III correlated about .7 with Global Esteem, but weighting each facet by the importance assigned to it by the entire group, by diverse subgroups, or by each individual made no difference. Even &quot;random number&quot; weights did almost as well, while optimal weights derived from multiple regression did only slightly better, suggesting that differential weighting has little effect. Nevertheless, weak support for the hypothesis was found for the Spiritual and Physical Abilities facets,  and these were the two facets where the importance ratings varied the most. Though Global Esteem was reasonably well predicted by the specific facets, few specific facets were adequately predicted by Global Esteem, arguing against the sole reliance on a single global measure in self-concept research.

The use of implementation analysis is also discussed as a means for analysis and prediction of higher education reforms in Germany. The implementation approach emphasizes the process of carrying out a policy and explores the reasons for the deviations from the original goals. The approach assumes goals will change during the process of program realization. The implementation study of the German Gesamthochschule is used as an example of the utility of the implementation approach as an analytical tool for analysis. The conclusion is drawn that the researcher's perspective on the subject will determine any final evaluation. The argument is presented that the analytical  quality of the approach is of limited use for predictions of outcomes and for prescriptions of successful implementation strategies. (DWH)",

Reviews of 10, 100, and 500 studies (M) were simulated, with degrees of freedom (df) varied in seven steps from 8 to 58. In a two independent groups design, samples were obtained from populations whose mean differences represented a zero, small, medium, or large effect size. One thousand replications of studies within each of the 84 combinations of effect size, df, and M were conducted, and a mean and standard error were obtained for each combination of conditions. As expected, d was a positively biased estimator of effect size, overestimating by as much as 13 percent even with Hedges' correction factor.  Surprisingly, the most unbiased estimator of effect size and the highest relative efficiency was obtained with the approximation to d computed from the obtained t and corrected according to Hedges. The approximations to d from the nonparametric statistic and the obtained conventional significance levels were not consistent estimators of effect size. These simulation results suggest that additional study of the behavior of effect size estimators should precede a more widespread application of meta-analysis. (Author)",

Results from time one and time two both indicated that this hypothesized model was able to adequately explain responses to the Rotter items, that the hypothesized factors were defined and distinguishable, that the factor structure was invariant over time, and that alternative models with fewer  hypothesized factors or a simpler structure did not fit the data as well. In a more general discussion of the Rotter scale it was concluded that, when judged by current standards, the Rotter I-E scale is a poor measurement instrument: its internal consistency reliability is minimal, the rationale for its forced-choice format is dubious, the assumption of its unidimensionality is clearly wrong, and the distinguishable facets of the scale cannot be inferred with sufficient reliability to be practically useful.

        "description":"This report describes the conceptual background, design, and methodology for a study of management of academic tasks in junior high school. Previous research suggests that tasks students accomplish in classrooms determine what they actually learn, and acquisition of higher cognitive skills related to interpretation and planning is essential for curriculum content mastery. Daily observations focusing on academic tasks will be made for one grading period in junior high school classes in each of three subject areas: science, mathematics, and English. Teachers will be selected for their effectiveness as determined by subject coordinators' nominations, class mean achievement gains during the preceding two year period, and preliminary classroom observations. Data on academic tasks will  be obtained from classroom narrative records, instructional materials used, and graded student assignments and tests. Teachers and selected students will be interviewed concerning their perceptions of academic tasks accomplished in their classes. The study will generate information about structuring and directing student work, translating academic content and objectives into classroom tasks, and assessing task outcomes. This report contains a survey of related literature in cognitive psychology and classroom research, a description of the structure and schedule for the study, and a specification of the observation and analysis procedures.

A description of the current status of data analysis, a summary of preliminary findings, and appendices with illustrative materials from the observations and analysis are also included. The MAT study is attempting to extend research in classroom management by including a focus on curriculum content. Data were gathered in junior high school classes during one grading period. Academic tasks that involved higher level cognitive processes were specifically examined. The analysis suggested that most task systems in the classrooms consist  of a series of small increments. Task environments were typically familiar to students and few opportunities were provided to make higher-level decisions about content. When higher-level tasks were used, teachers were required to use a complex set of social and academic skills to manage the class. The analysis also provided descriptions of the factors involved in establishing and maintaining academic work in classrooms and a language for understanding curriculum processes. (Author/DWH)",

        "description":"Random samples of 1979 and 1980 entering freshmen were given the Non-Cognitive Questionnaire (NCQ), designed to assess seven noncognitive dimensions associated with minority student academic success. The predictive validity of the NCQ for each race was determined with respect to cumulative grade point average (GPA) and persistence at several time periods over four years. With respect to GPA, the NCQ was found to be highly predictive at all points over four years for both white and black students. The specific factors associated with performance were positive self concept, realistic self appraisal, and preference for long range goals. The NCQ was found to predict persistence well for black students, but not for white students. The specific factors found to be most related to black  student persistence were: positive self-concept, realistic self appraisal, and academic familiarity. Early black persistence was also found to be related to having support for college plans and having a preference for long range goals. Later black student persistence was also predicted by having an understanding of racism and having demonstrated community service. These results support the validity of the NCQ and shed some light on the different variables related to black student attrition at various points in time. (Author)",

Over 2,000 elementary and middle school students were in the evaluation sustained effects group. The results indicate some decline in most grade levels in reading during the summer months, with grades 6 and 7 having the greatest percentage of pupils who maintained their achievement level from the previous  spring. In grades 2 through 5, over 36 percent of the students maintained their achievement level.

The second narrative section seeks to identify the school's strengths and weaknesses where there was a lack of consensus among respondents. The third narrative section presents the results from comparing 1984 staff responses with 1983 staff responses for each statement. The response frequencies, in percents, from the 1984 survey, are presented in Appendix A. In Appendix B, mean scores from the two surveys, t-values, and significance levels are displayed. (BW)",

The central question is: what are the characteristics of safe and effective school systems and what can schools do to become safer and to be perceived as safe? A social organization model of the public schools is provided which examines: (1) the school as mandatory service provider; (2) school crime and the local community; (3) school crime and the school itself--its physical and social structures, its social functions, and its learning climate. A typology of safe and sound schools is outlined, offering profiles of problem schools,  opportunistic schools, maverick schools, and ritualistic schools. Within a framework provided by effective schools research and delinquency prevention research, current disciplinary practices are analyzed in terms of: (1) system-wide policies and programs that change individual students; (2) strategies that change the students by changing the organization's school-based practices; and (3) what works in juvenile justice. A strategy for organizational change, based on the practices discussion, is then offered. And finally, a detailed administrative observation instrument is provided for use in evaluating the instructional effectiveness of a school or rehabilitative program. (RDN)",

Evidence was heard on discriminatory admissions, on the practice of demanding cash payments before accepting a Medicaid patient, on the eviction of residents once they become eligible for Medicaid, and on racial discrimination.

        "description":"Noting the lack of a comprehensive body of knowledge about Asian American educational achievement and attainment, this document examines recent national data in order to develop an empirical profile of the educational status of Asian American secondary and postsecondary students. According to the data, higher proportions of Asian Americans than of Whites are enrolled in school between the ages of 3 and 34. And Asian American students score higher on mathematics tests than White students and lower on tests of verbal skills, science, and analytical skills. It is argued that, while the average Asian American student does appear to be doing well, those who are recent immigrants or whose best language is not English may be experiencing problems, and that attention to their needs is  warranted. Three factors are identified as accounting for the trends in the data: U.S. immigration and refugee policies; the time spent on learning by Asian American students; and historical labor market discrimination and Asian American sensitivity to job openings under equal employment opportunity conditions. None of the three factors is regarded as being endemic to Asian Americans; all are seen as having implications for the schooling of other students. It is concluded that there is an urgent need for current information on the educational status of specific groups of Asian American students whether by ethnicity, nativity, length of U.S. residence, geographical location, grade level, or school.

        "description":"A number of recent studies have yielded data on the factors affecting the science achievement of disadvantaged students. For example, it was found that students' socioeconomic status (SES) increased as a predictor of their science achievement as the students moved through school. Furthermore, the effect of being Black (or, to a lesser degree, Hispanic) was similar to the effect of SES. Black students were shown in one study to perform best on science exercises most dependent on daily experience and common knowledge, and poorest on those that involve a detached research attitude toward the object and phenomena of science. Other studies found that poor and minority students are most affected by classroom factors such as too little time spent on science instruction and too much time  spent on discipline, that Black students' science career plans are generally less related to their abilities than are Whites' plans, and that minority interest in science apparently does not lead to choosing the appropriate high school subjects for entering a science major in college. The research suggests a complex pool of attitudes and motivations that indirectly affect minority science preparation and the choice of a science career. These include attitudes and aspirations, stereotyping, role models, general academic success, cultural values, and parental influence and support. Research also suggests that the school counselor for whom ethnicity or sex make no difference can play a most important role in increasing enrollment of the disadvantaged in nonrequired science and mathematics  courses.

Both school and housing desegregation were measured with the index of dissimilarity. Results show a clear correlation between school desegregation and housing desegregation. The southern cities, which typically experienced considerably more school desegregation than northern cities and at an earlier date, also experienced greater reduction in housing segregation. Other factors in addition to southern location may have caused both schools and housing to become desegregated, thus rendering the relationship between the latter two spurious. To test these  possibilities, regression equations using region and five other variables were computed. The results do not suggest that the relationship between school desegregation and housing desegregation is spurious. Furthermore, a test of the hypothesis that school desegregation affects housing through white flight (in that the apparent increase in housing integration is really the middle stage of a city in massive racial transition) shows little support for the hypothesis. It is argued that the results suggest that school desegregation is the most effective way of countering housing segregation, thus providing an additional rationale for school desegregation. Following the narrative, appendices present material dealing with the cities and variables examined. (CMG)",

Classroom experience is mainly judged in terms of students' affective dispositions. The objective is to clarify how these dispositions are shaped by the personal and situational factors in a child's social background, and then how they, in turn, shape academic achievement. Two types of affective dispositions are considered: first, a student's inclination or ability to apply himself/herself to the classroom tasks; second, a student's ability to get along with the teacher and classmates. In the first stage of the analysis, these characteristics are specifically related to a student's gender, ethnic membership, his/her neighborhood socioeconomic status, and the type of  school (public or private) he/she attends. In the second stage of the inquiry, these socio-personal attributes, along with the affective dispositions and previous academic performance, are used to predict achievement in vocabulary, reading comprehension, computation, and problem-solving.

The program, which is designed for young people between the ages of 9 and 17, is offered in separate sections for the following groups: mothers and their 9- to 12-year-old daughters, mothers and their 13- to 17-year-old daughters, fathers and their 9- to 12-year-old sons, and fathers and their 13- to 17-year-old sons. Five 2 hour sessions were provided for the younger group and six 2-hour sessions were provided for the older group. Through minilectures, films, discussions, activities, and games, the following topics were addressed: reproduction anatomy and physiology, body changes during puberty and adolescence, health and hygiene, pregnancy and childbirth, values and feelings,  dating, and decision-making and communication skills. The program has been implemented successfully in various communities in the St. Louis and northwest Missouri area and has been featured in a documentary made for educational television and on a national prime-time news show.

This communication was expected to lead to a smoother transfer of students from one level of training to another, to establish a common element or core curriculum, and to serve the needs of industry in a more credible manner. During the project, a master list of machine shop/general metals competencies was drawn up, standards for core competencies were determined, a rating scale for evaluation of competencies was established, and a competency certificate to be used by students as a communication link between training programs and with future  employers was designed. In addition, contact between educational levels was enhanced and career awareness among women about machine shop trades was promoted. Products created by the project included the competency-based curriculum, agendas for workshops that were presented in the area, and a slide-tape presentation aimed at young women.

To gather data for the study, the researcher administered questionnaires to 2,787 students from 39 public and private schools in the state of Washington who had part-time jobs. Data obtained from the survey instrument were analyzed to determine the mutual relation of the following variables: student gender, year in school, postgraduation plans, ethnic origin, grade point average, occupational status, and wages, as well as father's occupational status. On average, males earned more  than their female counterparts in higher-status occupations. The adolescent wages examined in the study produced a statistically significant relationship and a 90 percent wage gap as opposed to the 65 percent wage gap that exists between the wages of males and females in the general labor market. Recommendations called for further research to determine the factors responsible for this discrepancy. (MN)",

The primary objectives of the study were to assess the effectiveness of various methods and models in meeting the needs of mentally handicapped adults, to explore the policy implications of the program strengths and weaknesses, to identify the linkages and overlaps of vocational rehabilitation services provided for mentally handicapped adults, and to propose a method of providing coordinated and comprehensive career education services to all mentally handicapped adults who demonstrate a need for such services. Data from the British Columbia Health Surveillance Registry were used to estimate the career education needs of persons with mild, moderate, and severe and  profound mental retardation. After analyzing the data, the researchers formulated a model of a comprehensive career education program for adults with varying degrees of mental retardation. Addressed in the model were the following program areas: recruitment and referral; student selection; life skills, work adjustment, and vocational skills training; job placement; job stabilization; and retraining. The study also resulted in the formulation of 14 policy recommendations pertaining to program priority areas, guidelines, funding, evaluation criteria, coordination, and articulation. (MN)",

Conservative estimates indicate that hearing-impaired adults participate in colleges and provincial educational institutions at a rate that is 10 to 15 times smaller than that of the general population. Efforts to meet the needs of adult learners with hearing impairments both in British Columbia and elsewhere were reviewed. This review indicated that the following actions are particularly needed to eliminate the major barriers to participation in postsecondary education by adults with hearing impairments: development of clearly articulated policies regarding funding guidelines and the provision of educational  opportunities; provision of support services, including trained interpreters, tutors, counselors, and notetakers; development of individualized admission and assessment procedures; and formulation of community-based planning strategies.

The most significant use of MPS turned out to be in the area of guiding job assignments. The system also succeeded in routinely providing unique and valuable maintenance and performance training data; moreover, the cost of supporting the system was found to be acceptable. Possible future areas of utilization of the MPS include the compilation of a longitudinal  database for use in targeting Army-wide skill deficiencies and fine-tuning instructional training curricula.

        "description":"Currently, there is concern about the quality of Navy training. This concern is best exemplified by the present debate over the adequacy of &quot;self-pacing&quot; in Navy training courses. This paper illuminates some perceptions surrounding self-pacing in Navy training, explores some realities of Navy training, and presents a recommendation about how best to proceed. The paper offers the following conclusions: (1) self-pacing is misunderstood; (2) self-pacing is not the only factor responsible for perceived declines in the quality of Navy training, and may not be involved at all; (3) Navy training courses have more serious problems than their method of delivery; (4) traditional delivery methods will not guarantee instructional quality; (5) all forms of delivery, including self-pacing,  have advantages and disadvantages that involve complicated trade-offs; and (6) there are no simple solutions to the problems of Navy training. Guidance from the Chief of Naval Education and Training (CNET) concerning how to proceed is well founded. Any attempt to effect major changes in existing instructional systems without the controlled test and evaluation called for by CNET would be both reckless and costly. Specifically, changing a course from lock-step to self-paced or from self-paced to lock-step without sufficient evidence that the quality of the instruction will improve and/or significant cost savings will occur would be counter to CNET's guidance.

A questionnaire was sent to the head home economics educator at 67 land-grant institutions in the United States, with a return of 82 percent (69 percent usable). The results of the survey indicated that 50 percent of the 1982-83 home economics education majors secured teaching positions following graduation, and 8.2 percent secured positions with the Cooperative Extension Service. Head teacher educators at two-thirds of the institutions reported that  their programs were not designed to prepare home economics education majors to enter positions other than teaching and/or the cooperative Education Service. The other third indicated that their programs primarily included preparation for employment in business or community and adult education, and/or gerontology practice. Methods used to inform students of career alternatives were advising, guest speakers, student organizations, career reports, brochures, interviewing home economists, observations, and placement services. The study concluded that students are still attracted to home economics education programs for the primary purpose of being prepared to teach, and that teaching, along with the Cooperative Extension Service, is what the programs are preparing them to do.

        "description":"Because of the rapid changes in the world of work, education is hard-pressed to meet society's needs. If education is to meet the needs of the future, it must not merely update, but radically change its model. Because technology changes the workplace so quickly, specific vocational skills are no longer a valid product of vocational education. Instead, vocational education should provide all students with generic skills that are flexible and transferable from one area to another. One state that has been attempting to meet this challenge is Arizona, where partnerships of business, industrial, and educational leaders have been meeting to determine needs and how to meet them. From these partnerships have evolved an emphasis on competency-based education, the provision of career  development skills and employability skills, and better articulation between secondary and postsecondary educational institutions. One new program, called Jobs for Arizona Graduates, has successfully prepared high school students for jobs after graduation by helping them gain employability skills and focus on goals. Although Arizona's approach has been successful, it is but a beginning. Across the nation, leadership must emerge and educators must be willing to tackle the difficult issues and plan for the future. The system of education must change; the Nation's future depends on it. (A section of questions and answers is included in this report.) (KC)",

        "description":"Excellence is required in academic and vocational education to meet the challenges of an information age. There can no longer be divisiveness between the academic and vocational fields; cooperation is needed so students can see the connections between what they learn and what they will need to do on the job. The report issued by the National Commission on Excellence in Education, &quot;A Nation at Risk,&quot; made five recommendations. The first recommendation was to require four years of English, three years of mathematics, science, and social studies, and one-half years of computer science in secondary education. These requirements do not preclude vocational courses; rather, the &quot;new basics&quot; are complemented by vocational education. The second recommendation urges schools and colleges to  adopt more rigorous and measurable standards and higher expectations for academic performance and student conduct. High academic standards and assessment procedures must also apply to vocational education. The third recommendation is for better use of school time, whether longer days, longer years, or better use of time during the day. Additional school time would allow students to explore vocational courses and determine their occupational goals. The fourth recommendation of the report suggests higher pay and more evaluation of teachers. The Commission's endorsement of an 11-month teacher contract is consistent with vocational education's longstanding support for extended year contracts. The last recommendation of &quot;A Nation at Risk&quot; deals with questions of responsibility, funding  allocations, and funding responsibility. The report says that educators as well as society at large will have to address these questions if excellence in education is to be attained. (Questions and answers regarding the Commission's study, particularly as it affected vocational education, are also contained in this document.) (KC)",

        "description":"Jobs in the future are likely to be far different than those in the past, as our society moves into the information age. To prepare for the changes that are coming, the New York State education department developed a new program of career and vocational education to meet the educational needs of today's students as they prepare for the future. To get ready for the program, the state invited noted futurologists such as Alvin Toffler to speak at seminars for the state's teachers. Then committees of teachers from various disciplines developed the curriculum. The main thrust of the new curriculum is its emphasis on the development of transferable skills, rather than on the narrow specialization that often characterized vocational education in the past. The program has components for  grades 7-12, although the program developers are now looking at the whole K-12 structure to see what vocational skills can be integrated into the regular curriculum. The program also has provisions for adult education and mainstreaming of special students. (This report provides specific details of the program for each of the grade levels, as well as statistics on program development and costs, and expected implementation issues.) (KC)",

In fiscal year 1983 vocational educators have continued to be concerned with National needs, vocational education has emphasized closer and more effective collaboration with private business and industry, and vocational education's national professional associations and centers of research have focused on keeping current and improving program quality. In the future, vocational education must face up to three categories of &quot;dimensions of change&quot;: technological, economic, and demographic. Some areas of concern that need special emphasis by vocational education in the future are partnerships and collaboration; curriculum development; skilled work force development; a closer  working relationship with the defense industrial base, active military, and reserve forces; equity and access; governance; dropouts; and educational reform. (Eleven pages within the paper present five tables, one figure, and narrative material on the status of vocational education for the period 1981-83. Topics include appropriations, enrollments, state and local administration of vocational programs, and outlays of Federal funds for such services as vocational instruction under contract, construction of area vocational schools, operation of residential vocational schools, vocational work study, placement, and stipends.

The general view was that a good basic education is the best thing one could provide for high school students. A growing feeling was that vocational education is more appropriate at the postsecondary level. In most cases, legislatures had not addressed differential standards for vocational education. The general consensus was that there was little or no planning for vocational education. Except  for the south, respondents in other areas had a good reaction to the perceived quality of vocational education. Respondents expected vocational education to turn out a skilled work force, but the general feeling was that funding levels needed to be improved to accomplish that. The Federal program had influence on State policy. The legislatures did not see the private sector as having been a major influence on programs. If it existed at all, economic development policy related only to postsecondary vocational education. The growing emphasis on future-oriented, technical training was at the postsecondary level.

        "description":"A well-designed public-private partnership can be a powerful tool to solve pressing education, employment, and economic development problems. Eight steps in building partnerships are (1) review the community's context, (2) define a specific issue, (3) organize a local team, (4) determine whether a new vehicle is needed or an existing mechanism is acceptable, (5) analyze the issue, (6) identify options, (7) negotiate agreement, and (8) implement the plan and follow through. The Private Industry Council (PIC) was established with support that should enable these principles to work. National Alliance of Business studies show that in the initial action year more PICs formed strong partnerships than did not, and the partnerships are flourishing. Business-education partnerships are  growing in popularity. Benefits include understanding of what lies behind an organization's point of view, constraints under which it operates, and its strengths and weaknesses; expansion of participating institutions' capacity to deal with challenges; and increased knowledge, access, time, and human and financial resources. Three features in the vocational education legislation now before Congress will better define the employer's role in vocational education: creation of a strengthened State advisory council, provision for information exchange, and creation of a program to fund training in high technology occupations.

New jobs are there, but many are in the service sector, traditionally for women and mostly part-time. Unions demand high starting wages that are a disincentive for employers to hire young people and pay raises that make job creation more difficult. The United Kingdom has been complacent about training. Firms are not keen to invest in training and cut back funding for training programs during recessions, and the government is skeptical about formal training systems. Four approaches are now underday to clarify what employers should be doing and to identify where training needs are and where the skilled requirements of the future may lie. These approaches are: (1) to  convince managers to assume a greater role in training, (2) to improve students' perception of their future and of the jobs and skills they will need, (3) to meet specific requirements to prevent specific shortfalls in skills, and (4) to ensure the adaptability of the work force.

Papers address pertinent issues in ADN education and practice. \"AD Education: Are the Parameters Real?\" (Julia Perkins) examines the parameters of associate degree nursing education from a historical perspective, in terms of what the literature says regarding the parameters of this type of education and practice, and by performance and use of graduates. \"Transition Shock\" (Anastasia Hartley) discusses the need for cooperative planning between education and service personnel to ease transition into the workplace. \"AD Education: Parameters Espoused and in Use\" (Georgeen H. DeChow and Jo C. Pierce) discusses the espoused  parameters (what educators say) and describes those in use (what educators do). \"Expectations of AD Graduates: An Educator's Perspective\" (Sarah L. Etkin) uses the competency statements and premises of the National League for Nursing to describe the expected characteristics of ADN practice. \"Bridges to Success\" (Ann Larowe) also examines the parameters and philosophyy of AD education. \"A Competency-Based Curriculum: Process at Kennesaw College\" (Ann Crutchfield and Vanice W. Roberts) describes the process of competency development in the AD program. \"Performance Differences in Graduates of Associate and Baccalaureate Degree Programs\" (Annette Bairan, Leslie Brown, Pamela Chally, and Beverly Farnsworth) reports findings from a study conducted at the University of Vermont to demonstrate  performance differences of graduates from AD programs versus baccalaureate programs. \"Proposed Solutions to Issues in ADN\" (Zeila W. Bailey and Dorothy Scott) suggests improvements for ADN education. \"Expectations of AD Graduates: A Nursing Service Director's Perspectives\" (Jacqueline Mardan) cites necessary skills and standards of performance. \"The Reality of the Workplace\" (Mona Raborn) stresses the need for leadership training. \"An Educational Clinical Preceptorship\" (Marianne Crouse, Emily Slunt, and Brenda Carter) and \"An Internship Program\" (Frances E. Casillo) describe these programs. \"AD/BSN Competency Differentiation\" (S. Joan Gregory) compares competencies of nurses from AD and Bachelor of Science in Nursing programs. \"Opportunities for Success in the 80s\" (Katherine Vestal)  considers nurse utilization in a changing health care environment. \"Clinical Competence Validation\" (Carol Singer) summarizes a method of validating clinical competence of AD students.

If the United States is to retain this distinction, however, steps must be taken to reverse the trend toward yearly declines in the rate of gain in U.S. productivity. One way in which vocational education can help increase the productivity of the American labor force is to place less emphasis on the job- and industry-specific skills that can be taught most effectively by industry itself and to concentrate instead on preparing students for a world of work in which they must never cease learning and growing. In general, vocational education has neither the facilities nor personnel to provide effective training in high technology areas. What vocational education can do,  however, is to train workers in the basic, transferable skills that they will need to succeed in the job-specific training that is best provided by the private sector itself. Vocational educators also need to develop courses that will teach students how to handle, manage, and just get along with others. To do this most effectively, teachers and administrators alike must make increased efforts to ascertain first hand exactly what skills business and industry require of their prospective employees.

        "description":"Various surveys were conducted to determine the current level of personnel on Montana farms/ranches and in agribusinesses as well as the projected number of persons to be employed in those occupations through 1990. The study found that the current family work force on farms and ranches in Montana has remained the same since 1981 and it is likely that this figure will remain constant through 1990. The study also found that a reduction of 9,000 full- and part-time agricultural production workers took place in the state between 1974 and 1981, and a further reduction of about 5 percent is expected between 1983 and 1990. About two-thirds of these workers are considered part-time employees. In addition, the surveys found that there are about 1,900 agribusinesses in the state. In 1983,  these businesses employed 15,704 persons, and they are expected to employ 19,660 persons, a 25 percent increase, by 1990. Finally, four regional corporations/cooperatives who operated 200 agribusiness firms in Montana in 1983 indicated that they had 1,303 employees in the state in 1979 and 1,243 employees in 1983. They expected this figure to decrease by 5 percent by 1990. (A number of statistical tables are contained in this report.) (KC)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to determine what personal characteristics are prerequisites to successful agribusiness employment in Montana. A questionnaire about vocational students' personal characteristics and home and school background was developed, pretested, and mailed to 306 agribusinesses in the state. Seventy-seven responses (26 percent) were received and analyzed on an Apple II+ computer. The study concluded that the personal characteristics most desired by Montana agribusinesses are (1) honesty, (2) willingness to fulfill obligations and promises, (3) ability to listen, speak, and write effectively, (4) ability to follow orders, (5) being on time and using time effectively, and (6) friendliness and cleanliness. The study also found that prospective employees with a  farm or ranch background are preferred in Montana and that the chance of obtaining employment in Montana agribusiness is greatly increased by two years of postsecondary education. About 25 percent of the agribusinesses preferred high school graduates with vocational courses, and most businesses gave preference to persons who had been involved in school activities such as Future Farmers of America and athletics. The study recommended that since Montana agribusinesses are often not aware of the vocational agriculture program, teachers should increase their public relations activity. The study also recommended that efforts should be made to increase the number of students being employed on farms as part of their occupational experience, that students should be encouraged to participate in  extracurricular activities, and that schools should strive to improve their programs to prepare students for employment. The survey instrument and sample responses are appended. (KC)",

While policy commitment for adult literacy promotion has not been lacking, intensified action has been. In 1979 the government accepted the Unesco Mission Report to undertake a functional literacy program on the successful completion of the pilot project. More recently, in 1982, the Government of Malawi joined the Harare Conference and committed itself to elimination of illiteracy. Despite troubles in the installation of the Malawi functional literacy project, a National Board and a National Center for Literacy and Adult Education have been established. Although concrete possibilities of interagency linkages were explored, meaningful and sustained collaborations  have yet to materialize. Content of the self-contained functional literacy curriculum is developed from themes most frequently mentioned in development literature and policy documents. A general paucity of training materials for use by trainers-supervisors or trainers of trainers has caused uneven training. The pilot project has established all the infrastructures the country needs; a clearly articulated and sustained national will is now required. (YLB)",

        "description":"A study examined the nature, status, and trends in the delivery of technical content and instructional methods courses to prepare industrial arts teachers. The members of the Mississippi Valley Industrial Teacher Education Conference were used as a representative group for the preliminary survey. Data collected from the individuals indicated that most schools (86 percent) offer industrial teacher education programs within an academic unit that offers technology programs. Most schools do not offer special technical content courses designed exclusively for technology majors or for those preparing to teach. Approximately 90 percent of the schools offer one or more professional teaching or curriculum courses to those preparing to become industrial teachers. Of those schools, over 90  percent include experiences and activities in the technologies contained in the content of such methods courses. It was concluded that including those preparing to become industrial teachers in comprehensive technology programs that also prepare other types of professionals has several advantages. For example, this practice results in increased course and section offerings, affords students the opportunity to select in-depth specialized courses, enables future teachers to study with potentially better qualified faculty, and frequently results in enriched career development opportunities for them.

Of the 12,242 surveys that were mailed to Louisiana high school graduates of 1978-1982 who had taken home economics, 1,442 were returned. Of these, 1,309 surveys were completed by females and 121 by males. Of the 503 home economics teachers who received questionnaires, 357 completed and returned usable surveys. Analysis of both groups of completed questionnaires revealed that the students and teachers registered a high degree of similarity in both the tasks that they perceived as needing to be taught and the tasks  they perceived as actually having been taught. Generally, those tasks perceived as being most needed--making responsible decisions, repairing or altering clothing, making a home more energy efficient, storing food properly, and preparing nutritious meals--were also perceived as being among the skills taught most frequently. Implications were drawn for minor curriculum revisions. (The survey instrument is appended, and 17 tables of data are included in this report.) (MN)",

The first section defines competency-based education (CBE) and explains how this approach differs from traditional education. It also advances reasons why the competency-based approach is superior to traditional methods. In the second section, the paper outlines the steps to be taken to make the transition to CBE. These steps include focusing instruction on specific competencies (tasks) rather than on content or material, and shifting from large-group instruction delivered by or dependent on the instructor to a modularized, well packaged and well mediated approach in which students can master each task at their  own pace before going on to the next. The final section deals with management concerns and approaches in competency-based learning, such as planning each student's work, keeping up with daily and weekly progress, and organizing and managing the facility (learning resource center). Samples of instructional materials and administrative materials are included in the outline. (KC)",

        "author":["Klein, Robert E."],
        "description":"A study compared the personal income and educational attainment of male war veterans and nonveterans as of March 1983. Using data from the March supplement of the 1983 Current Population Survey, the researchers compared the educational attainment and income of 9 separate age groups of a sample of 22,823 veterans and 47,792 nonveterans. For the most part, male war veterans had higher personal income and higher educational attainment than nonveterans. However, the relative difference in median income for Vietnam-era veterans--those 25 to 39 years old--was smaller than the relative difference between veterans and nonveterans of all ages combined. Since veterans were overrepresented in the relatively high-income-earning middle and older ages, part of the difference in income between  veterans and nonveterans could be attributed to their age differences; if veterans had the same proportionate age distribution as nonveterans, then their median income would fall by one-fifth. The differences in educational attainment between veterans and nonveterans had also diminished; whereas veterans had distinctly higher educational attainment than nonveterans in 1973, the gap in median education virtually disappeared by 1983. (Appendixes to this report contain three tables summarizing educational attainment and income levels by age group as well as an explanation of the age-adjustment techniques used in the study to arrive at median education levels.)

They are presented under two headings: (1) demographic, economic, and employment circumstances; and (2) learning and education circumstances. The state's approach to adapting and pursuing Education Commission of the States project goals is presented. The next section details purposes, procedures, and results of project activities from mid-1980 through September, 1982. These activities are included: informal interviews to solicit views on issues, problems, and cooperation; a survey on  issues in Colorado adult learning and education; a survey on responsibility for solving adult education problems; a conference on improving adult education services in Colorado; an interorganizational planning group; a staff paper; and project presentation. Activities planned for coming months are also discussed. The final section provides conclusions and suggests a number of implications about state planning and policy development.

A section on organizational options is designed to illustrate a few of the many ways to deliver the minimum instructional content required for an approved vocational cluster program. Content is illustrated by course titles for the instructional levels to recognize that students from different grades may enroll in one or more levels of a program. (KC)",

        "description":"The objective of a research project was to describe how undergraduate home economics students perceive their work lives in the year 2000 according to age, race, gender, marital status, and geographic region of the country. A valid, field-tested survey instrument developed specifically for this project was administered to 324 volunteer undergraduate home economics students from New York, Ohio, Wisconsin, Kansas, and Texas. Results were analyzed using factor analysis, MANOVA, and ANOVA and seemed to point out perceptions representing both traditional and nontraditional lifestyles. Implications for vocational education, and particularly home economics, curriculum and instruction were deduced, namely that: (1) curriculum needs to be written to account for differences in perceptions  due to age, gender, and region within program areas; (2) curriculum needs to be written to aid students in sorting through preferences for traditional versus emerging societal patterns and values; (3) the changing relationship between work and family expectations needs to be stressed; and (4) students need to comprehend and learn to manage the stress that may result from a multidimensional lifestyle. The methodology was recommended for use in research with students in other vocational program areas to determine if similar perceptions of work and family roles exist. (YLB)",

Recognizing the amount of time Americans spend viewing television and the new possibilities for service delivery offered by such technological developments as cable TV, videocassettes, and videodiscs, the document presents a classification scheme of literacy levels, examines literacy programming of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, and describes the British Broadcasting Corporation's pioneering outreach programs. Advantages and disadvantages of TV as an instructional medium are considered, as well as the potential audience; kinds of programming at Federal, state, and local levels; new  applications of existing programs; and the use of innovative technologies to reach adult illiterates. The authors conclude with a moderate view of electronic media as part of an ecology of learning and stress the need for engaging leadership to meet the literacy challenge, perhaps in the spirit of campaign or competition that motivates other areas of American life. An appendix provides a comprehensive list of literacy television programs, including titles, descriptions, and information on availability. References are also listed. (SK)",

The emphasis on excellence puts concommitant pressure on the other end of the spectrum--remediation programs such as the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), a program that mandates closer collaboration between the public and private sectors. Research on education and employment demonstrates the link between educational attainment and successful employment, though there is little agreement on how best to measure basic skills and how competency factors operate in the labor market. The employment impact of lack of basic skills upon functionally illiterate adults cannot be denied. Therefore, improvements in local practice and in Federal and state policy are imperative.  At the local level, JTPA-funded programs can expand the focus on basic skills and literacy, increase services to dropouts and adults, devise meaningful credentials jointly agreed upon by educators and employers, and create coherent systems of local services to improve input (assessment and program assignment) and output (credentialling and outplacement). Federal policymakers can enhance coordination and collaboration by providing: a multistate overview of policies and practices, leverage through initiative and regulation, financial resources to attack problems on a large scale, visible cooperative leadership through the Departments of Labor and Education, and technical assistance.

        "author":["Radwin, Eugene"],
        "description":"Section 309 of the Adult Education Act of 1966 provided discretionary grants for special projects and teacher training in adult basic education (ABE). The 309 program played an important role in innovations, recruitment, instructional materials, and teaching strategies, and it demonstrated how active Federal officials could boost state and local practices and policies. Yet, the Federal role antagonized some constituencies and figured in the program's demise. The U.S. Department of Education's Division of Adult Education guided the program by setting priorities, soliciting and shaping proposals, awarding grants, and disseminating project information. This activist role affected the 309 program's accomplishments and impact on ABE, influencing such areas as policy, curriculum  development, interstate efforts, print and electronic media use, and staff development. The program promoted communications and provided a sense of mission for the ABE field. Two major shortcomings, however, were the failure to build its own constituency and the alienation of a politically strong segment--state adult education directors. Lack of state-level involvement in policy and grant decisions and aggressive management by Federal officials led to the reconstitution of the 309 program as a state discretionary grant activity in 1974. The 309 program contributed significantly to the ABE field despite the lack of an elaborated, integrated dissemination system and despite too many low visibility projects. A revived Federal-level grants program that builds on past strengths and  acknowledges previous shortcomings would better serve the diverse ABE community. (The appendixes include a list of potential 309 projects and a reference list of past project reports.) (SK)",

        "description":"The phenomenon of adult functional illiteracy in the United States is examined, and strategies are considered for addressing the problem. Reasons for the failure of existing programs (schools, adult education, and volunteer tutoring) to close the literacy gap are explored; among these factors are the relative growth of underserved populations, increased technological demands, and the small proportion of the target population that is currently receiving literacy training. It is argued that stimulation of informal literacy training and spontaneous acquisition of literacy skills form an important, but neglected strategy. One-to-one interactions to help someone accomplish a literacy task afford critical opportunities for informal literacy education. Next, a preliminary theoretical  framework for adult literacy development, encompassing both formal training and spontaneous acquisition, is described. Implications of this model for reaching nonparticipants are explored through the concept of situation specificity; this section illustrates general and specific barriers to participation for different age groups, Hispanics, Blacks, and offenders and exoffenders. Finally, an outline of a research agenda suggests ways to enhance outreach efforts in adult literacy. A reference list concludes the document. (SK)",

To compare these two classes of stressors along with two stressful life events (threatened job loss and reorganization of the work setting), and to investigate the buffering effect of coping responses on stress-related strain, 139 employees of a mental health organization were surveyed. The state-funded organization had been threatened with shut-down and was undergoing a major restructuring in which supervisors, co-workers, and duties were changing. The participants were asked to complete a packet containing seven instruments designed to measure stress, coping, and health. A comparison of the strain scores of these subjects to normative data  indicated that they were experiencing considerably high levels of acute strain. A composite index of stress, made up of the three classes of environmental stress, was found to be a better predictor of psychological and physical strain than any of the measures of which it was comprised. Stress and coping had an interactive effect on strain. Coping reduced state anxiety and enhanced general well-being in the high stress group; however, coping had little impact in the low stress group. The findings indicate that adaptive coping behaviors can effectively moderate life stresses. (LLL)",

Teachers checked to ensure that the students properly recorded the temperatures, and an observer from the research team visited each classroom at least once every 2 weeks. Results showed that wrist temperatures increased significantly during the relaxation exercises, and that the increases grew larger as the study continued, indicating that students learned to relax more fully with more practice in the program.

In order to examine the effect on declining enrollments of the recent trends toward professionalism for counselors, surveys were mailed to 100 randomly selected counselor education programs and to 10 additional programs randomly selected from programs accredited by the Council for the Accreditation of Counseling and Related Programs (CACREP); usable data were obtained from 92 programs. The number of applications to Master's degree programs by Accreditation Status (Status), whether or not programs had increased their credit hour requirements since 1975 (Change), and years (1975-1982) were examined. Results showed that programs which were either accredited or had applied for accreditation received  significantly more applications, and programs that increased their credit hours had significantly fewer applications than those that did not. Partial correlations for 1976-1982 using the number of applications in 1975 and the number of full time faculty equivalents (FTE's) as control variables resulted in no significant correlations for Status or Change with applications even though all zero order correlations had been significant. Trends over years were tested for each level of Status. The results for Accredited/Applied programs approached significance (p=.06). The actual number of credit hours required generated significant zero order correlations with applications, but when FTE's and applications in 1975 were partialed out there were no significant relationships. No relationships were  found for new enrollments. (The study questionnaire is included.) (Author/BH)",

To investigate typology differences in the population enrolling in the course, the Strong-Campbell Interest Inventory (SCII) and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) were used. The results of the SCII are intergated with and organized by Hollands'(1973) model, which describes people and work environments by their resemblance to six categories: Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, and Conventional. The MBTI reflects personality type as a four-letter code which represents four basic processes by which people take in information and evaluate or judge that  information: Introversion(I)-Extraversion(E); Sensing(S)-Intuiting(N); Thinking(T)-Feeling(F); and Judging(J)-Perceiving(P). Results of examination of students' Holland types showed that Artistic, Enterprising and Social students are the most common in the course, and that Investigative students are significantly underrepresented, suggesting that this group may be more decided as a whole, or less willing to admit career indecision. Results of the MBTI showed that, in general, the course draws more introverts than extroverts (particularly introverted sensors), while all four extroverted sensing types are underrepresented. There was significant overlap between the Holland and Myers-Briggs models, indicating that they are describing similar phenomena with different labels. Data on the range  of types in the course population are useful in designing activities and in insuring a wide range of approaches.

        "description":"The Maryland career course is a one-credit career planning course for undecided undergraduates based on William Perry's (1970) model of intellectual and ethical development. The Perry model can be described using four major and sometimes overlapping divisions which represent a series of positions on learning, i.e., Dualism, Multiplicity, Contextual Relativism, and Commitment within Relativism. Data were collected on the students enrolled in the course using the Measure of Intellectual Development (MID) which assesses the intellectual dimension of Perry's scheme. The results of pre- and post-tests indicated that over 40 percent of the sample showed some increase in cognitive complexity, and that seniors increased dramtically compared to the other groups, suggesting that they are  most able to respond to the challange of the course. Students also completed the Myers Briggs Type Indicator, which indicates personality type and the process by which people perceive and judge information along four diemnsions: Introversion-Extraversion, Sensing-Intuiting, Thinking-Feeling, and Judging-Perceiving. Comparisons of students' MID and MBTI scores showed that there seems to be a strong tendency for Intuitives, particularly Intuitive/Perceiving types, to be found more frequently at higher levels of cognitive complexity, while Sensors and Judgers tend to be found less often at those same levels. Analysis of the stage/style interactions in cognitive development shows obvious overlap between the two frameworks. (Data tables, overviews of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and the  Myers-Briggs Learning Styles, and Career Exploration worksheets are appended.) (LLL)",

To promote the skills needed to make sound decisions regarding drug use and to develop general skills for healthy living, an alcohol and drug education program was presented to third and fourth grade pupils in 21 elementary schools in a large, urban school district of the Southwest. During the 1983-84 school year an evaluation of the program was conducted with 520 third and fourth grade pupils at five elementary schools. A measure of decision making and self-esteem was administered as a pretest, a posttest, and as a second posttest to a treatment group and to a comparison group. Grade-level repeated measures analyses of variance provided  evidence of a group by time interaction effect on decision making and self-esteem at the third grade. An interaction effect was also found with respect to decision making at the fourth grade level. Post hoc tests did not locate significant mean differences, although trends in the data supported an effect of the program over time. (Author/JAC)",

        "description":"Self-selection bias poses a major threat to the validity of research findings in naturalistic, quasi-experimental, or single-group designs. A new method of addressing self-selection bias in naturalistic evaluations of prevention programs was implemented. The study, involving voluntary exposure to multicomponent interventions, was developed and applied to an evaluation of an alcohol abuse prevention program in which student participation in hall-based programs was conditioned by choice of where to live. A longitudinal mail survey of students in 1978 (N=274) and 1980 (N=197) assessed the impact of the alcohol abuse prevention program implemented in the intervening years. The effects of three interventions were compared: (1) alcohol education; (2) structured drinking environments;  and (3) living group self-regulation activities. Choice of living environments and other variables were controlled. Outcome measures included alcohol consumption and alcohol-related problems. Results generally showed a lack of program impact. Aggregate levels of both drinking and problems differed substantially across living groups, and a strong selection rule was found predicting the probabilities of being in each living group. Problem drinkers did not avoid program exposure even though programs were offered in the living groups. The findings suggest that after correcting for possible self-selection bias, differences in alcohol consumption and problems must be accounted for primarily by sorting between living groups rather than by living group climate or other environmental factors.

In order to examine the relationships between burnout and four commitment dimensions (commitment to a theory, to agency philosophy, to a particular job, and to client service), 47 professionals (37 females and 10 males) serving the developmentally disabled in a day treatment program completed questionnaires. Burnout was measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). Results showed that in an agency where the staff shared no strong ideological theory (which is felt by researchers C. Cherniss and D. Krantz to increase commitment and reduce burnout), reduced levels of burnout were correlated with commitment to the agency's  philosophy and objectives, and to one's job classification. There was no isgnificant correlation between burnout and commitment to clients. (BH)",

To study the relationship between the appraisal of self-initiated activities and dimensions of positive or negative affect 36 graduate students (22 female and 14 male) engaging in a total of 202 activities appraised dimensions of the activities and responded to a 60-adjective Mood Checklist (M. A. Zevon and A. Tellegen) before and after each activity. Activities reported were academic, leisure, work related, daily living, and miscellaneous pursuits. Results showed that the expectation of pleasure and control over participation appraisal dimensions were important in accounting for post-activity positive affect but not for post-activity negative affect. The subject's usual level of enjoyment in the  activity was not an important contributor to post-activity positive affect.

This paper reports a method for studying Healthy Features in parental communication, aspects of verbal style that counteract a child's exposure to genetic and social environmental risk factors. A set of coding categories was applied to Rorschach protocols from 61 parents of 10-year-old boys selected (from the ongoing University of Rochester Child and Family Study) to be at risk for the development of severe mental disorders. One parent in each family had previously been hospitalized for a mental disorder. Healthy Features measures were developed that correlated with criterion teacher and peer ratings of the child's school  adjustment. Positive attentional and affective features of parental communication were found to occur independently of parents' psychopathology. They also add significantly to Communication Deviance in predicting offspring adjustment, indicating that beneficial and pathogenic communication are separate domains of parenting.

Multivariate analyses of covariance revealed a significant interaction between sex and announcement on the CRF-S trustworthiness dimension and effects for announcements on three specific problems (parental conflicts, career choice problems,  and marital difficulties). No differences occurred on the CERS. Results indicated information in the announcements made no difference in perceptions of therapists' expertness and attractiveness, but women were more distrustful of the feminist therapist. Participants held lower expectations of obtaining help for marital and parental difficulties from the explicit-feminist(E-F) therapist but held most confidence in the E-F therapist for help with career problems.

        "description":"Criminologists and gerontologists have reported increases in crimes perpetrated by elderly persons, but arrest data do not necessarily reflect this trend, due to failure to prosecute. To explore the influence of age, sex, race, and offense type on arrest and prosecution outcomes, Detroit Police Department arrest and case disposition data (1981), arrest outcomes, and conviction rates for a stratified elderly offender sample (N=571) were compared. Generally, dismissal rates among the elderly offender sample for all Part I offenses suggest the younger elderly, 55 to 59, have a higher dismissal rate than the older elderly, 65 and over. However, rates of dismissal for violent crimes among the elderly groups remain fairly stable--at a high rate. Dismissal rates for property offenses  tend to decrease with advancing age. Factors such as race and sex appear to play a major role in case dismissals. Data on conviction rates for the elderly offender sample indicate that once the decision to prosecute the offender has been made, elderly suspects are more likely than younger offenders aged 17 to 21, or 35 to 44, to be convicted and sentenced to jail.

To examine different processes by which autonomy might affect individual outcomes, 430 youths in four Michigan boys' training schools were surveyed. The questionnaire used included two measures of autonomy and scales measuring perceived need for rehabilitation and satisfaction with the institution. Research focused on a model which differentiates the direct effect of autonomy on youths' antisocial values from the indirect effect of autonomy which operates through increasing youths' acceptance of institutional treatment goals. Data were analyzed using a structural equation model. Results indicated the  model fit the data very well. Predicted correlations generated from path estimates closely matched the actual correlations between measures. The findings support the combined effects model, which predicts both a direct effect of autonomy on prosocial values and an indirect effect of autonomy mediated by the youths' acceptance of treatment goals. The largest path, between autonomy and acceptance of treatment objectives, suggests that persons who do not feel coerced are more accepting of authority. (Author/JAC)",

Using data from the sophomore cohort of the High School and Beyond project, patterns of cognitive development for graduates and dropouts over a 2-year interval were compared. With the effects of social background, sophomore test performance, and prior academic adjustment controlled, the average difference in cognitive  test performance that may be attributable to the effect of staying in school is about one-tenth of a standard deviation. Moreover, dropping out of school has its most severe negative effects upon disadvantaged students. (Author)",

The children's reading performance was first scored according to procedures outlined in the Durrell Analysis manual, and a second scoring was made according to recommendations for administering informal reading inventories given by M. S. Johnson and R. A. Kress. Results suggested that the procedures yield significantly different overall grade level designations. Further analysis of the significant reading level by scoring procedure interaction showed that (1) the average independent level established by the Durrell Analysis  procedure was significantly higher than that obtained by the IRI procedure, and (2) the instructional level mean was significantly higher than the independent level mean only when the IRI procedure was used.

        "description":"Planned, individualized vocabulary instruction is an essential ingredient of developmental reading classes, and deserves special attention, since expanding word knowledge is the one area related to reading comprehension in which student progress can be directly observed and measured by the learner in daily or weekly increments. The two factors that appear to exert the most positive influence upon vocabulary acquisition are the utilization of students' personal experiences and existing knowledge, and the use of context, or deriving a word's meaning from the surrounding text. A teaching strategy that integrates these two factors refines the vocabulary acquisition process through carefully structured, active individual involvement. Each week students are required to identify 10  previously unknown or partially known words from within a range of printed materials designated by the instructor. Students print the unfamiliar word on one side of an index card. On the other side, they write the sentence in which the word was found, the dictionary pronunciation guide entry, and a paraphrase of the dictionary definition. Teachers then check the cards for semantic appropriateness. The cards may be used as flashcards to evaluate student word knowledge. This method enhances student/teacher interaction and the initial and cumulative word knowledge evaluations, while growth in the students' card decks helps to increase their confidence. (HTH)",

Morrison's conceptualization of reading disability as the failure to master the complex irregular system of rules governing sound-symbol correspondence in English (1980), a study investigated the speed with which disabled and normal readers processed short vowels, long vowels, and vowel digraphs. Subjects consisted of two groups of male students: (1) seven disabled readers in the third, fourth, and fifth grades having a mean IQ score of 103 and a mean word recognition grade equivalent score of 3.0; and (2) seven non-disabled readers in the second and third grades having a mean IQ score of 107 and a mean word recognition score of 3.1. Both groups were presented pseudoword pairs on slides and asked to identify a target word. Reaction time was measured with  voice-operated relay and digital millisecond clock counter. The pseudoword pairs were formed such that each was matched with another that was identical except for one or two vowels in the medial position. When the effects of type of reader and type of letters in the medial position on reaction time were assessed, results showed no significant effects involving type of reader or type of pseudoword. An analysis of reaction times for individual words found significant differences. An inspection of the effects of practice on the reaction times found differences between disabled and non-disabled readers. The need for an empirically supported \"complexity scale\" is discussed.

        "description":"A teacher's theoretical viewpoint is pervasive. It determines not only the materials chosen and the way the materials are used, but also the perception the teacher holds of the reading process. It is important, therefore, for teachers to understand the theory on which their views are based so that they can understand why they have chosen a particular book or basal. Basically, teachers use two different approaches to teach children to read: the synthetic/analytic approach and the holistic approach. Underlying each is a theoretical, psychological assumption of how children learn and how teachers relate to children during the learning process. Teachers using the synthetic/analytic approach present reading to children one piece of information at a time (letter, letter-sound relation,  word)--from outside the children's realm of knowledge. The intent in this approach is to work on meaning after children have learned to read. In contrast, teachers using the holistic approach begin with what is meaningful for children and work from the inside out. Print is used in stories, directions, announcements, and other written forms that hold meaning for children. Teachers and prospective teachers need to understand the theoretical bases of both reading approaches and then identify with one or the other. This would stop the debate about which approach is better and allow teachers to consider what effects their choices have on students' conceptualizations of reading and reading performance. (FL)",

A study was conducted to investigate the simultaneous effects of the rank of students' reading groups in first grade and their first grade achievement on their assignment to reading groups at the beginning of second grade. The twelve first grade classrooms analyzed in the study came from six schools in three Chicago-area school districts. During the 1981-82 school year, researchers gathered information on first grade organization, instruction, and learning. Follow-up data were gathered during the next school year. Data analysis revealed two  patterns: one in which a student's reading group level in second grade depended on his or her first grade position, and the other in which achievement appeared to be the criterion for placement. Examination of the composition of first and second grade reading groups, however, revealed that in both cases, teachers had attempted to reduce the heterogeneity of low and middle reading groups between first and second grade.

        "author":["Walker, Barbara J."],
        "description":"Based on gestalt psychology, guided fantasy is a technique that uses sensory images related to a particular situation to create a subjective understanding of that experience. For the young child, guided fantasy can be a process of creating an inner subjective experience that is subsequently integrated with objective knowledge (language) to produce holistic learning. The method begins with a teacher-directed journey eliciting vivid imagery about an imaginary trip and using vocabulary words which are to be introduced. After the journey is complete, the students share their journey in pairs, verbalizing inner experiences immediately. The children are reminded that words signify the pictures and feelings they had when their eyes were closed. After the immediate sharing of the story,  the students write a story that will symbolize the individual experiences each person had. Used as an approach to reading instruction, the fantasy experiences should incorporate target sight vocabulary so that inner journeys can produce a regular and controlled vocabulary. Subsequent fantasy experiences can be constructed to encourage the students to use these same words or other vocabulary words. After the story is recorded, skill development appropriate for each student's level can be created using the language patterns in the story. Starting with a preconceptual experience, fantasy experience allows reading to flow from a dream-like experience into meaningful written communication. A description of the use of a guided fantasy in a classroom is included in the document. (HOD)",

        "description":"A series of experiments investigated the role of prior knowledge in tasks involving the operation of equipment from written instructions. The experiments covered two situations. In the first, the prior knowledge was already possessed by the subjects before the experiments. The studies involved comprehension and memory of technical prose, expertise in descriptions of familiar and unfamiliar pieces of equipment, and expertise effects in following instructions that differed in organization. In the second situation, the prior knowledge was provided as part of the training involved in the experiments. These studies concerned the role of knowledge of how a system works and transfer of training from previously learned operating procedures to new procedures. The results support  methodological, theoretical and practical conclusions. Methodologically, many traditional prose recall paradigms should be used with caution in the investigation of prior knowledge, and careful attention should be paid to the relationship between the knowledge being supplied to the subject and the exact tasks that the subject is expected to perform. Theoretically, the results support what is perhaps becoming the consensus model of cognitive architecture, namely the ACT class of theories described in Anderson's most recent textbook, the &quot;Architecture of Cognition&quot; (1983). Practically, the results provide a good foundation for future applied research on the arrangement, sequence and content of instructional materials. (FL)",

        "description":"A study investigated the effects of a spatial adjunct aid--maps--upon probed comprehension and free recall with respect to a text in which map-related information (macropropositions) could be clearly distinguished from more abstract information (micropropositions). Forty-eight tenth grade students were randomly assigned to either a control group or a map processing group. assigned to either a control group or a map processing group. Approximately half of the students in each group were of average and half above average reading ability. Students in both groups were instructed to read a 775-word story carefully so that they could answer questions about it afterwards. The students in the map processing group were told to complete a map as they read. After reading, students in both  groups participated in 10 minutes of filler activities, then were told to write as much of the story as they could remember. Next, they completed a multiple-choice comprehension instrument. Results indicated that the map processing affected text comprehension in several distinct ways. In free recall, it increased overall recall of details and main ideas, but this superiority largely concerned map-related information that by itself was not important for the central meaning of the text. In fact, map processing resulted in a decline in the recall of some abstract macropropositions, particularly for the average readers. In terms of comprehension, map processing resulted in higher scores for inferential questions, but this was largely due to better performance on two spatial questions and was  in spite of worse performance on one abstract question. Less able readers did worse on one elaborative inference after map processing. (The map used in the study is appended.) (FL)",

        "description":"Fulfilling a need for careful and thorough synthesis of an extensive body of findings on reading, this report presents leading experts' interpretations of both current knowledge of reading and the state of the art and practice of teaching reading. The introduction contains two claims: (1) the knowledge is now available to make worthwhile improvements in reading throughout the United States, and (2) if the practices seen in the classrooms of the best teachers in the best schools could be introduced everywhere, improvement in reading would be dramatic. The first chapter of the report stresses reading as the process of constructing meaning from written texts, a complex skill requiring the coordination of a number of interrelated sources of information. The second chapter, on  emerging literacy, argues that reading must be seen as part of a child's general language development and not as a discrete skill isolated from listening, speaking, and writing. The third chapter, on extending literacy, stresses that as proficiency develops, reading should not be thought of as a separate subject, but as integral to learning in all content areas. The fourth chapter concerns the teacher and the classroom and notes that an indisputable conclusion of research is that the quality of teaching makes a considerable difference in children's learning. The next two chapters note that standardized reading tests do not measure everything, and that teaching is a complex profession. The last chapter contains seventeen recommendations for conditions likely to produce citizens who would  read with high levels of skill and do so frequently with evident satisfaction. In the afterword, Jeanne Chall comments on the history of the report, and three appendixes contain 260 references and notes plus lists of project consultants and the members of the National Academy of Education.

In view of this, and in light of the many educational reform commissions' directives, a one- or two-semester journalism course should be considered a worthy writing course in either the college bound or the general curriculum. The paper then examines several concerns raised by the commissions about language arts, writing's role in learning, writing competencies fulfilled in journalism courses, research related to journalistic writing, problems with English education, programs for English  educators, and the reform movement and nonwriting journalistic competencies. In conclusion, the paper recommends that the credibility of journalism as a vital part of the language arts curriculum needs to be studied and that evidence supporting that part needs to be widely disseminated; that high school journalism classes need to attract and keep good teachers; and that press associations on all levels need to become active in disseminating research and concerns of journalism educators to influential groups and decision makers.

The nine articles in the first section of the book use Maya Angelou's \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\" and Carl Sandburg's \"Abe Lincoln Grows Up\" to illustrate a wide range of possible classroom applications of biography and autobiography. These articles focus on techniques teachers can use to get beyond surface facts into the significance of the works, and draw upon Bloom's Taxonomy of Educational Objectives and other analyses of mental activity to sketch lines of inquiry and discussion from various disciplines. In addition, the  articles concentrate on one salient concept from each discipline and develop it through the use of one of the approaches offered.

        "description":"No teaching method is more widely used and yet more strongly criticized than the lecture. Yet, an examination of more than 40 basic public speaking textbooks reveals that lecturing is seldom mentioned. There are, perhaps, several reasons for this omission. For example, authors of textbooks might feel that (1) material on lecturing duplicates their regular textbook content, (2) the topic is not the province of speech communication, or (3) lecturing is unrelated to undergraduate students. Other authors might omit it from their texts simply because they do not know what to say about it. In response to this last possibility, the literature shows that there are a number of options for improving the lecture. Textbooks, then, could concentrate on discussing these options, such as  lecturer qualities, lecture construction techniques, lecturer-student interaction, feedback-lectures, small group work, and the so-called Doctor Fox Effect, in which the students are \"seduced\" by the lecturer into feeling that they are his or her associates. Textbook authors are overlooking an important body of literature, and should include material on lecturing in their basic public speaking works. In addition, speech communication professionals have an obligation to take lecturing under their collective wing--they can do much better with it then what has been done to date. (FL)",

        "description":"Recently, there has been a definite shift away from United States government support for the unrestricted exchange of new, unclassified scientific and technical information at professional meetings. This has been substantiated by numerous specific examples of censorship by branches of the government. Scientists in the target professional associations frequently work on basic research and advanced technical systems for the Department of Defense. Since in no case have the scientists sought judicial relief from what is undoubtedly governmental prior restraint, any projection as to how this conflict between the First Amendment and national security interests would be resolved must rely on previous case law. The Supreme Court has never enunciated a clear description of what  constitutes justification for prior restraint; nor has it deferred judgments on the validity of prior restraints to a case-by-case evaluation. Some minimal standards have been identified to guide the judiciary in application of restraints. First, the restraint must be specifically authorized by legislation; and second, the government must prove that the communication &quot;inevitably, directly, and immediately&quot; causes serious damage to the government or the population. There is serious doubt as to whether the government could meet this test of inevitable harm, but given its repeated efforts to prohibit presentations at scientific symposia and the minimal resistance the government has encountered, this trend is likely to continue.

        "description":"A study examined the relationship between the personality constructs of self-concept and communication apprehension and the use of self-confrontation (self-viewing of videotaped speeches) as a potential self-concept enhancement strategy. The question of whether the constructs of self-concept and communication apprehension overlap was investigated for both theoretical and empirical support, and both constructs were, additionally, related to the intervening self-confrontation variable. Subjects were 168 college students in a public speaking class who completed a self-concept scale, a report of communication apprehension, and a video confrontation scale at the beginning of the semester (before participating in public speaking activities in class) and again at the end of the semester  (after each had delivered four in-class speeches). Each student was shown the videotape of his or her speech performances after each presentation. Results indicated that future speech communication self-concept research might benefit from a reexamination of the construct under consideration. Although self-concept is normally viewed as a \"state\" variable, the results suggested that the construct might be resistant to change in the limited communciation course context. Communication apprehension, a dimension of self-concept, however, was found to be susceptible to change in this setting. Public speaking appeared to be the intervening variable that invoked the change, while self-confrontation appeared to inhibit the reduction of apprehension. (FL)",

The Dyadic Interview Activity is one that can help students apply the principles of audience analysis in planning their classroom speeches. The Dyadic Interview Activity is used during the first or second class meeting of the semester. This getting acquainted activity involves the students in pairing-up and gathering information about one another. Additional information such as hobbies, goals, interests, group memberships, and concerns about current events is generated in the interviews. The structure of the introduction speech is then discussed, and  students outline a short speech about their partners. Students then stand before the class and introduce their partners via their speech. The remaining students take notes on the characteristics of each of the students as they are introduced, and the resulting list becomes the basis for viewing the class as an authentic audience. As a written follow-up assignment, students are asked to write down five topics that the class would be interested in based on the data from the introductions.

The study analyzed sample rebuttal speeches (in English) of 14 Japanese debaters using the Toulmin model of argument. In addition, it made comparisons with a sample of speeches made by 5 American high school debaters. Audiotapes of the speeches were transcribed, and selected portions of the transcripts were then divided into arguments. Within each argument, each simple utterance-act was coded into one of the six categories of Toulmin's model: (1) claims, (2) grounds, (3) warrants, (4) backing, (5) qualifiers, and (6) rebuttals. The picture of Japanese logic that emerged from the analysis was one that emphasizes the use of complete arguments; depends heavily upon  grounds; rarely uses backing, qualifers, or rebuttals; and omits warrants when a part of the primary argument is missing. Compared to the argument used by American debaters, the Japanese version is more complete and uses more evidence. The findings suggest that the Japanese can use logic in a fashion similar to that of Westerners. This, however, says little about their standard way of using logic, and suggests that in debating in English, the Japanese clearly try to conform to Western standards--and probably succeed. (FL)",

By developing predictions derived from the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), the study hypothesized that only noninvolved receivers would respond negatively to deceptive nonverbal cues in a message. Subjects, 160 college students, were told that the study was examining advertising effects and were told they would see a videotape that contained several ads. Half of the students were induced to become involved with the one of the ads by a promise of a free product, the other half were told that the target ad was not properly representing the product. In addition, the target ad had been manipulated so that in one version the  speaker avoided eye contact, did not smile, and shifted posture--all behaviors associated with deception. After viewing the videotape, the subjects completed a questionnaire that dealt with the ads and the program, with their television viewing habits, and with their responses to the ads. Using a 2 X 2 X 2 factorial design, the study found that the speaker who engaged in deceptive behavior received only negative appraisals from the subjects who initially cared very little about the product. Conversely, subjects who saw the speaker as being highly relevant tended to base their evaluations on the strength of the arguments the speaker used to construct the message. (FL)",

An initial technique for introducing students to negotiation involves brainstorming. As a class or in groups, students could list examples of situations in which negotiation, in some form, frequently occurs. Next, they could examine recent situations in which they have personally negotiated, analyzing what occurred and why. The second step, incorporating both theory and practice, should examine four of the theoretical perspectives of negotiation: personality approach, the economic or learning model, strategic analysis, and  process analysis. Students could examine research concerning each perspective and later incorporate those findings into their own negotiations. The third step involves the use of simulation to provide opportunities for practicing and developing the negotiation skills. Regardless of type of simulation used, the critical factor is the follow-up analyses in each negotiation so that students can relate their own verbal and nonverbal behaviors and the negotiation outcomes to the theories and principles already studied.(HOD)",

Adler's &quot;The Paideia Proposal&quot; and from related publications, this paper identifies aspects of the proposal that relate to basic communication instruction. The first part of the paper summarizes &quot;The Paideia Proposal,&quot; pointing out the major points in each of its four sections, which concern schooling the people, the essentials of public schooling, teaching methods and learning, and higher and continuing education and earning a living. The second part of the paper concentrates on points raised in the third section of the proposal, discussing the role of the teacher as lecturer, as coach, and as Socrates. The third part looks at the implications of the proposal for communication instruction, concluding that implementing the proposal in the public schools  would mean (1) making formal instruction in speech communication a part of elementary as well as secondary programs; (2) including listening as a formal subject of basic instruction; (3) encouraging students to use their acquired knowledge of communication to produce speeches and writings beyond the text; (4) having students write and speak more often, and teachers listen and read more; and (5) balancing the speech curriculum. The final part of the paper discusses challenges presented to speech communication educators by the proposal. (FL)",

        "description":"In the last two decades, the federal government's role in state and local affairs has shifted markedly from subsidy to regulation. This report examines the origins and effects of the new &quot;regulatory federalism&quot; and proposes reforms. Chapter 1 delineates the subject, chronicling the growth of intergovernmental regulation and discussing the legal basis, the mechanisms, and the adverse effects of such regulation. The next two chapters analyze, respectively, the judicial and the legislative origins of intergovernmental regulation: chapter 2 examines the federal courts' application of constitutional provisions for regulation, their gradual assumption of managerial authority, and their role in future regulatory reform; chapter 3 discusses the history of legislated regulation, policy  instruments selected by lawmakers, and political influences on intergovernmental regulation. Chapters 4 and 5 report the consequences of growing regulation for regulatory and regulated bodies: chapter 4 examines difficulties in writing and promulgating regulations, concerns about the scope of regulations, and enforcement problems; chapter 5 reviews research investigating how regulation affects state and local governments. Recent federal reform initiatives--procedural and substantive--are reviewed in chapter 6. Finally, chapter 7 presents six conclusions and recommends policies to reform intergovernmental regulation as a whole, a reform strategy for the newer forms of such regulation, and approaches to improving the regulatory process.

        "description":"Twelve United States Agency for International Development (AID) education projects were evaluated between 1980 and 1981. Four were in Asia (Philippines, Nepal, Thailand, Korea), two in Africa (Kenya, Nigeria), four in Latin America (Colombia, Brazil, Paraguay, Ecuador), and two in the Near East (Jordan, Afghanistan). The evaluations measured the extent to which selected, completed, AID-funded projects achieved their goals, and the extent to which these projects left a lasting imprint on the countries in which they were implemented. Descriptions of the AID-funded programs in the 12 countries are provided. The findings and analyses presented are suggestive, but not conclusive or definitive. They are presented under the following categories: (1) who benefited; (2) impact on  institutions and institutional practices; (3) curriculum reform; (4) spread effects; (5) unanticipated impact; and (6) factors explaining effectiveness and impact (political/social strife; culture and commitment; economic conditions; financial, structural, and organizational constraints; agency/contractor performance, and cultural knowledge). Concluding that the impact of AID education projects over the past 30 years has been profound and widespread, the report points to the importance of improved educational services as they contribute to reducing birthrate, improving health services, increasing agricultural productivity, and changing group and individual attitudes. Two appendixes include the individual project data sheets and the proceedings of the education-sector impact evaluation  conference where the findings were presented and discussed. Also included are a short bibliography and seven tables. (MD)",

Examples of &quot;voodoo excellence,&quot; in which proposed policies will likely work against their stated objectives, are widespread. While advocating excellence for all students, states raise standards beyond the reach of many. Likewise, broad humanistic studies are advocated, yet in practice schools increasingly emphasize rote learning. States are lengthening time in school without considering the use of time; they propose to make teaching a more attractive profession but use inadequate, demeaning, and divisive means to do so. Promises of equity contrast with increasing gaps  between advantaged and disadvantaged students, and endorsements of community involvement contrast with increasing centralization. Moreover, certain &quot;anomalies&quot; arise as state programs filter down to the grassroots. These include endemic complacency in school districts, reform proposals that stress structural and programmatic change but overlook instructional change, and widely varying viewpoints. Despite these obstacles, the public's awareness of and confidence in education have increased, as have aspirations for and expectations of children; finally, belief in the importance of thorough student assessment has spread, and the social status of teaching has risen.

Each section contains specific steps to follow to achieve the desired standards. Included with the document is an extensive appendix in 17 sections containing future discussion and research regarding the program components. The state board of education anticipates that these standards will continue to be reviewed and upgraded in the future. (MD)",

        "description":"The Center for Educational Policy and Management at the University of Oregon has developed a professional development term for improving teaching skills of secondary school teachers. The content of the program has been drawn from two major categories of instructional research: (1) classroom management and organizational strategies that promote and sustain student academic engaged time, and (2) research-based instructional design components that improve students' mastery of skills. The program includes four major sets of activities: a summer seminar, three followup sessions, peer observations and coaching, and an administrators' seminar. The summer seminar is 1 week long and introduces teachers to classroom management and organizational strategies, and to the principles of mastery  learning. Three 1-day followup sessions are scheduled, 1 month apart, during the following quarter. The sessions provide ongoing assistance to the teachers as they apply the new strategies in the classroom. The peer observation and coaching components are introduced during these followup sessions. A brief seminar is provided for the school administrators with an overview of the instructional principles presented to the teachers and suggestions for ways they can support teachers in the implementation of the instructional strategies they are learning. An intensive staff development effort, this program has a narrow focus and is solely concerned with improving students' achievement through research-based instructional strategies. An extensive reference list is included. (MD)",

        "description":"The history of the school choice idea is briefly traced, and then some contemporary family choice models are examined in detail. &quot;Tracking&quot; was the major choice mechanism in public schools prior to recent efforts to expand the options. The alternative movement within individual schools began in the late 1960's, with many forms institutionalized in diverse ways, followed by programs of choice for entire school systems. Choices among the educational components of curriculum and content, instructional methods, and teachers are limited by logical, ideological, political, and professional considerations. However, the choice arrangement evidenced in schools or units within schools has flourished. Selected from 36 categories and subcategories of family choice models for detailed  examination are the following school types: open enrollment, magnet schools, schools-within-schools, minischools, satellites and separate alternatives, and interdistrict choice plans. Concluding comments point out that neither localized alternatives nor those in an alternative system are without disadvantages. Another concern is that the exit option may make overall improvement within the deserted institution less likely. However, for the benefit of all students, alternatives and options in schools offer the best hopes for educational improvement. A 79-item bibliography is appended. (MLF)",

After an introductory overview, these issues are discussed first from the perspective of the consumer, then from that of society. Finally, in a section addressing the compatibility of choice and educational reform, prospects for increased choice are considered in light of the political and administrative relationships predominant  within the contemporary public school system.

        "description":"This essay reviews research pertaining to the relative merits and drawbacks of expanding family choice in public education. A primary objective is to identify and explore tensions among competing objectives in the design of expanded choice systems. After an introductory section on goals and definitions, the second section explores how more family choice might improve public education by providing incentive for students and teachers to work hard and cooperate. A third section addresses ways in which more family choice might be detrimental to the United States's commitment to universal and compulsory education. Problems raised include (1) availability of information, (2) criteria for students' choices, (3) teacher accountability, and (4) access to education for the disadvantaged.  The fourth section explores the present consequences of family choice in private schools, addressing two relevant concerns: (1) Do children in private schools learn more than they would in public schools? (2) If so, what practices contribute to private schools' effectiveness? The fifth section concerns presently available choices in public education, including choices of residence, choices within schools, choices among schools, and choices among programs (with particular attention to magnet schools as the fastest growing family choice plan in the United States today). Issues discussed include consumer information, access, location, and role of teachers in program development and management. The sixth section summarizes (1) research issues (limitations in sources of evidence), (2) what  family choice can and cannot accomplish, (3) sources of tension in the design and operation of family choice plans, and (4) the importance of program design. References are included. (TE)",

        "description":"This essay offers a preliminary examination of public support for private elementary and secondary education as it is incorporated into the systems of Denmark, Australia, and Holland. Its purpose is to stimulate American thinking about family choice systems. After a brief introduction on the ad hoc quality differentials in American public schooling, a discussion ensues of the ambiguous definitions of &quot;private&quot; and &quot;public,&quot; as these terms are alternately used to refer to ownership and use. The third section addresses the implicit values and the historical context behind the American policy of denying aid to religiously affiliated private schools. The following three sections discuss the history and structure of education systems in Denmark, Australia, and Holland, respectively.  Denmark has a national system of public elementary schools, coupled with the right of minorities to establish &quot;free&quot; schools at public expense. Australia provides comprehensive government aid to private religious schools, primarily because of pressure from a large Catholic constituency; as a result, the quality of Catholic education has steadily improved. In Holland, two thirds of the children attend private religious schools fully supported by the government. The paper concludes by recommending a carefully deliberated shift to a choice system that recognizes the centrality of religious values to the educational process and that provides alternatives for families with different interests and values.

Based on prior studies and on interviews with 120 education leaders in 15 states, the paper reviews compulsory education policies throughout the nation. It concludes with a recommendation that compulsory education requirements be kept at a minimum and that reforms be achieved through a public education program that is so enticing that students will want to take advantage of it. After a brief introduction, a series of tables compares compulsory education laws and policies in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the trust territories. Thereafter, compulsory education laws are discussed in relation to public and private  schools, respectively. Another set of tables illustrates state regulation of private schools throughout the nation, followed by a brief survey of court challenges. The third section discusses compulsory education laws in relation to home instruction, and likewise presents comparative tables for the states and territories, along with a survey of litigation. Remaining sections discuss political considerations, examples of revised compulsory education in selected states, and conclusions.

Skills included ways to give negative feedback without hostility, life space interviewing, surface behavior management, and basic behavior modification concepts. Evaluation of teacher attitude revealed no significant change from pre to post test for either the experimental (N=16) or control (N=13) Ss.

These disabilities may include: (1) not being able to make appropriate choices and decisions; (2) not utilizing strategies such as checking things out with people, and monitoring one's own performance; (3) not being able to transfer learning from one activity to the next; (4) not being able to break tasks into small parts; and (5) not choosing a successful work context. These unrecognized learning disabilities in young adulthood may interfere with the primary life tasks of adults such as choosing and beginning employment, marriage, and family support. Building on previous childhood difficulties with learning to read, write, spell, do arithmetic, or other school subjects only  compounds these disabilities. The best definition for a person with learning disabilities, once he or she moves out of school and into adulthood, is a person who cannot change his or her behavior through experience despite an average or better intelligence. The unrecognized learning disabilities in adulthood can be translated into instructional sequences fundamental to change and success. Instructional programs which address transfer, decisionmaking, and task analysis could be made a part of experimental work settings such as at continuing education centers and community programs.

A distinction is made between leadership and the related constructs of creativity, management and group dynamics. A useful definition of leadership is provided, and a four-stage program for actually providing for the emergence of leadership is described. The program is drawn from theories and models in many disciplines, developed over 6 years, tested and found to enable gifted children to become leaders, not merely to teach them \"about\" leadership. Stage 1 encourages familiarity with leader characteristics, and use of creativity, expecially divergent thinking. Stage 2 includes role playing, observing and analyzing the leadership of others and doing creative thinking exercises. In stage  3, ambiguity is created and shortcuts are removed to allow students to struggle for solutions. The fourth stage consists of real life experiences with leadership. Four tables contain: traits of leaders; behaviors of leaders; a comparison of management, group dynamics, and leadership; and a model for fostering the emergence of leadership.

While numerous significant differences between autistic and normal children were found, autistic and developmentally disabled children differed only along one dimension of temperament (intensity). These findings highlight the essential similarities between these two diagnostic groups, and are consistent with previous research.

Conclusions indicate that an extended array of residential alternatives are available, with nearly one-third of the states having residential programs represented by each of six general facility types. Despite growth in smaller community-based facilities in recent years the primary provider of residential services is still the  large group residence. While over 70% of mentally retarded residents still live in rather large facilities, there has been a shift in the direction of private operation of facilities and smaller facility sizes. Resident characteristics vary by type and size of facility. Data support the trend towards increased age at first admission to residential care and decentralization of living arrangements. Among problematic issues identified are the need to develop resident based reimbursement systems and to accommodate individuals with severe disabilities. (CL)",

Disability-related research and development is addressed in terms of the federal role and private sector involvement. Evaluation of technologies is said to be deficient and the need for a coherent, adequately funded evaluation program is needed at all levels of diffusion and adoption. Issues in resource allocation are briefly addressed. Policy options are set forth for five issues: (1) production, marketing, and diffusion of technologies; (2) involvement of disabled people and other consumers; (3) research, development and evaluation of technologies; (4) financial barriers to the use of  technology, and (5) personnel issues.

Beginning with a review of the requirements of P.L. 94-142 (The Education for All Handicapped Children Act) and a discussion of transportation as a related service provided to handicapped students, the manual proceeds to considerations and recommendations regarding vehicle ownership, cost, length of ride, and location of pick-up and drop-off points. Implications of the individualized education program for transportation services and decisionmaking are analyzed, as are disciplinary and suspension procedures as they relate to transportation issues. Additional topics include transportation safety (assistive devices, emergencies, evacuation drills) and personnel  training (handicapped student management, aides' roles, first aid).

Observation of interactions, comprehension development, acquisition of productive signals and of use of supplementary communicative devices revealed deviances in language directed to severely multiply physically handicapped (SMPH) children which may have a profound effect on the developing communicative systems of these children. Peculiarities were noted in lexical and conceptual input, control of the interaction, (relationship of self to others) function of the interaction, and exposure to speech events. It is noted that there are \"holes\" in the lexical input of the language adults direct to SMPH children. One possible explanation for the gap in  conceptual/lexical input may be adults' disinclination to \"go half-way\" with non-oral SMPH, their seeming lack of enthusiasm for an extensive acceptance of different levels of participation. The interactions of SMPH children are predominantly initiated and terminated by others, interactions seldom allow the SMPH student to express preferences or choices, and SMPH children are largely excluded from the conversational aspects of events. Findings stress the importance of the quality of adult-SMPH child interaction for the child's communicative progress. (CL)",

Three types of data were collected: present placement and related special services received in 1982-83 by all Ss referred between 1976-1982; year-to-year placement histories on a sample of approximately half the Ss referred during 1977-78 and 1978-79; and in-depth case studies for a small sample of Ss (N=13). Findings addressed three major issues related to the clinic; appropriateness of the policy for  acceptance for evaluation, most of the Ss evaluated by the clinic were found to be handicapped and to require special education for the next several years); stability of the diagnosis (evaluations were found to be comprehensive and accurate in identifying handicapping conditions and/or deficits in preschool Ss); and the effectiveness of early identification and intervention (almost 70% of the evaluated children were still in self-contained special education classrooms 5-6 years later). The existence of multiple impairments in many referred children affects the findings on intervention effectiveness. (CL)",

Speech production accuracy was assessed by the number of consonant errors in words and sentences, intelligibility of speech, and the suprasegmental features used during conversational speech. Transcriptions were typed, stored, and analyzed via computer. The total duration of bilateral and unilateral otitis media during the first 3 years of life ranged from 4 to 884 days; the total duration of bilateral or unilateral otitis media ranged from 8 to 937 days. Preliminary speech analysis revealed that  the otitis media durations were correlated with two specific types of speech errors: final sounds at age 3 and voicing at age 5. Otitis media durations were not correlated with the overall number of errors or other error types. Results suggest that otitis media is a predictor of only certain types of speech errors and must be interpreted cautiously because of the small number of subjects at each age level. (CL)",

Accomplishments included development of a process to analyze federal, state, and local programs (such as P.L. 94-142, the Education for All Handicapped Children Act; Head Start; Medicaid; and Maternal and Child Health) and  implementation of a Delphi needs assessment polling 80 special education directors and midmanagement personnel to determine major issues affecting the delivery of special education and related services.

Trained parents (those who received information about P.L. 94-142, the Education for All Handicapped Children Act), untrained parents (without prior information about P.L. 94-142) and special education teachers were presented with two stories on an IEP conference to elicit responses about attribution and perception. The stories included the same content, people, and problems but the interactions and endings were varied in order to make one story appear to have a successful outcome and the  other an unsuccessful outcome. Significant differences were found on several subscales between the three groups by level of story outcome. Untrained parents rated both the story outcomes significantly less successful than did trained parents or teachers. Generally parents had higher expectations for their own behavior than did teachers, and attributed more responsibility to the parent for story outcome than did the teacher. Trained parents agreed significantly more than untrained parents that it was important to attend IEP conferences regularly. Results suggested that providing parents with information about their rights is conducive to fostering more positive attitudes and cooperative behavior.

Data analysis addressed four areas: (1) identification of themes (including outside factors affecting parental reactions, parental relationships with the evaluator, parental involvement in the evaluation, and parents' perceptions of the validity of the child's performance); (2) comparisons across time; (3) parents' ratings of evaluation features, and (4) relationships between  evaluation features and parent reactions (including the finding that parents with more involvement during the evaluation appeared to remember more information from the evaluation). Results were used to devise a model for developmental evaluations that seeks to meet parents' needs at the time of their child's evaluation.

The relationship of increased direct instruction to increased academic engagement was reported as the most dramatic overall ALT finding. Section 1 of the document  consists of the text of a teacher's manual summarizing the research findings and suggesting strategies for increasing ALT and student academic achievement. Sections 2, 3, and 4 present a review of the literature, a summary description of project activities and methodology, and results and discussion. In section 5, conclusions and limitations are discussed, and questions for further research are posed.

Case study methodology was used, and data were obtained from multiple sources, includng document review, consultations, and interviews. Data were analyzed qualitatively, both within-site and cross-site. It was reported that faculty were increasingly aware of and knowledgeable about P.L. 94-142 (the Education for All Handicapped Children Act) and, to a lesser extent, had more positive attitudes toward education of the handicapped, and that teacher preparation curricula were being revised to  incorporate content on the handicapped largely through infusion of content into already existing courses. Factors which affected the implementation-and-change process were explored in the areas of (1) project leadership and management, and (2) culture and context (institutional features and characteristics). Modifying the incentive-and-reward system for faculty was described as a key strategy in effecting academic innovation and change. (JW)",

Information differed only in racial image (as indicated by a label of Black or White, or by a photograph) and in written descriptions of social behavior. Teachers were asked to make recommendations regarding the need for special education services and to predict future reading levels and social adjustment. Among reported results were the following: (1) teachers tended to recommend equally both Black and White students for special services  regardless of whether or not there was a stated behavior problem; (2) there was a relationship between predicted social adjustment and predicted reading ability, regardless of the race of the student; and (3) teachers referred students with ethnic backgrounds identical to their own less frequently than they did youngsters of other ethnic backgrounds.

        "description":"Two separate studies were conducted to determine what factors contributed to and predicted mainstreaming of handicapped youngsters, and to study the impact of early intervention and P.L. 94-142 (the Education for All Handicapped Children Act) on mainstreaming. In Study A, 434 elementary-level special education student records were examined, and subsequent student placement 1 year later was recorded. Current IQ, data on the family's stability, and a rating of the student's hostile behavior, were the variables that tended to discriminate the most between handicapped youngsters who were placed in less restrictive educational settings and those who remained in a segregated special education school. Study B examined the impact of early intervention (no preschool, regular school,  special education preschool) on educational placement in the mainstream continuum for 281 handicapped children, aged 5-8, and compared the amount and type of mainstreaming before and after the implementation of P.L. 94-142. No significant trends were found in either case. However, higher socioeconomic status of parents, regardless of type of early intevention, seemed to indicate a trend toward mainstreaming after the implementation of P.L. 94-142. (JW)",

        "description":"The study examined teacher-student interaction patterns in 21 classrooms serving mainstreamed third and fourth grade mildly handicapped (mildly mentally retarded, mildly emotionally handicapped, and learning disabled) students. Three groups of target students were observed: nonhandicapped high achievers, nonhandicapped low achievers, and mildly handicapped mainstreamed students. Observational data were correlated with 16 characteristics of mainstreamed classrooms (including social environment, parent-teacher interaction, classroom management, instructional methods, curriculum flexibilty, and affective education). Multivariate Analysis of Variance was used to determine if an overall difference existed in teacher-student interaction among groups and canonical correlation to  determine which elements of the classroom learning environments were related to patterns of teacher-student interaction. Results of the study and comparison with previous ones in Utah and South Dakota/Iowa are detailed. It is concluded that although there is substantial evidence that teacher-student interaction varies among the student groups observed, there is no strong evidence that general preferential treatment or treatment likely to result in better educational gains or a more effective learning environment is consistently provided to any single group of students. Among findings are that teacher feedback was generally neutral to all students when the feedback was about academic or procedural matters and that teachers were engaged in academic interactions with all student groups an  average of only 60% of the time.

Analyses of cooperative goal structering and academic learning times as influences in the environment are presented. Three concluding sections review research on homogeneous versus heterogeneous grouping, teacher behavior and attitudes, and the role of peer interactions. Implications for LRE are addressed for each topic. Four general goals for special education research are identified, including comparison of specific environments or types  of environments and intervention toward improvement of environments.

Responding to teacher requests within 5 seconds was measured under three conditions: decreased commands, increased commands, and unconditional commands with contingent consequation. A multielement design employed across conditions demonstrated that the use of increased commands was the most effective condition for controlling behavior. Commands issued at a frequent and consistent pace reduced inappropriate responding to zero, suggesting the potential of this antecedent as an alternative to purely contingency-based systems for decreasing noncompliance.

Self-monitoring activity focused on the child recording correct sounds immediately following correct sound production. Analysis of the children's generalization to their natural environments revealed that all of the Ss demonstrated increases in the use of the target sound outside the clinical environment. Ss consistently used the correct sound 90% to 100% of the time and continued to use the target sound correctly following termination of recordkeeping. A replication study was performed which showed at  least measurable improvements in 27 children. Study recommendations included increased involvement of therapy clients in their own therapy programs.

The most striking result of the study was the stability and the progression in the subjects' knowledge of French despite the relatively small number of occasions they had to use it. In addition, it was found that the proficiency level upon completion of training was less significant than other factors in predicting maintenance of proficiency, and that the work environment of most subjects did not provide much opportunity for using or improving French skills. The majority of subjects were at level 2 or 2+, according to the Foreign Service Institute rating scale. (MSE)",

The second paper, &quot;L'enseignement du francais dans classes terminales des lycees allemands&quot; by Able and Lang, examines the objectives and methods of French instruction, looking at the changes in instruction in the last 15 years. The changes in the approach to the first few  years of instruction, which now focus more on authenticity than formal language, are considered. The role of the text &quot;Salut A,&quot; which first appeared in 1968 and whose content and approach correspond largely to contemporary governmental attitudes and programs, is discussed, and French language instruction in the universities, for both the general college population and foreign language teachers, is examined. A few notes are provided on journals currently and widely used in the field in West Germany. (MSE)",

        "description":"A study of rural Quebec's language showed that by comparison with the urban version, it is less influenced by anglicisms, and the borrowing that has occurred is not solely of terms of civilization designating objects or notions susceptible to exchange between anglophones and francophones in Quebec. Certain anglicisms seem to have become integrated into rural Quebecois in diverse domains, including forestry, business and commerce, and industry, and have stayed outside the realm of family and farm life. In other cases it seems that English words have been adopted to fill gaps in French vocabulary. The study's report outlines the characteristics of both monomorphemic and polymorphemic borrowings, including: (1) the mechanisms of interference, both the borrowing of entire words and  the borrowing of meaning only; (2) interlinguistic coincidences; and (3) modes of adaptation of borrowings (phonetic, graphemic, morphological, morphosyntactic, and semantic). The overall balance of lexical interference and the prospects for persistence or disappearance are also discussed. An appendix contains tables of the frequency and distribution of a variety of borrowings, and a bibliography and an index of borrowed terms are also included. (MSE)",

        "description":"A study of the effect of function words on reading comprehension had as subjects 99 college students of English as a second language (ESL) divided into four groups. The treatment was the reading of a set of passages, written in four versions. In version 1 all function words were deleted; in version 2 function words with semantic weight were retained; in version 3 the same number of function words were retained as in version 2, but were randomly selected; and in version 4 the full text was used. Comprehension of the passages was measured by a multiple choice comprehension test. Results showed no significant difference between the comprehension scores yielded by versions 2 and 4 or between those of 1 and 3. However, the scores for versions 2 and 4 were significantly higher than for  1 and 3, indicating that function words carrying a semantic load contribute to reading comprehension for ESL students while those that are lexically empty, although essential for grammatical correctness, do not contribute to reading comprehension for this population.

        "description":"The display of Spanish and English communicative competence of two Hispanic children is explored in a study analyzing directive speech acts (orders, requests, suggestions, hints). The linguistic, sociolinguistic, and strategic resources of the Mexican-American children, aged 4-1/2 to 6 years, are examined qualitatively in data taken from naturalistic tape recordings made in their homes and school classrooms. The data show that the language in which the child has the most grammatical competence is also the language in which communicative competence in issuing directives is best demonstrated. Sociolinguistic and strategic competence appear to compensate for the lack of grammatical competence in the weaker language. Examples from the data indicate that these bilingual Hispanic  children know a variety of directive types in Spanish and English by the age of six. Confirming what previous studies have shown, these children tend to use the direct imperative with peers and siblings, and inferred and indirect requests with adults or children whose special favor they seek. The issue of communicative performance is also explored, with particular attention to how the circumstances of the speech act may mitigate against the child's demonstration of communicative competence.

Attitude surveys showed that the majority of teachers and administrators viewed the school as a success.

The data are intended for use in deciding whether existing programs should be curtailed, maintained, or expanded, and to decide about recruiting and training limited-English-speaking soldiers. It was found that the majority of limited-English-speaking soldiers are insular Puerto Rican and have at least high school diplomas. Those enrolled in ESL  programs reported favorable feelings about programs and teachers, but also felt that greater emphasis should be placed on speaking and listening rather than on reading and writing the language. Gains in English comprehension test scores averaged two points per week during the six-week programs, and soldiers with final scores above 50 were more likely to succeed in the Advanced Individual Training than lower scoring soldiers. A high correlation was found between the reading and writing based English comprehension test and an oral proficiency test. Across installations, ESL programs differ in size, curricula, teaching techniques, and philosophy, but all produced improvements in English language skills. (Author/MSE)",

        "description":"With some imagination, songs can be used to teach all aspects of foreign language. The language teacher can take advantage of the cultural content of songs by playing holiday music during the appropriate season; explaining the traditions and history of songs; discussing songs with cultural flavor; presenting a variety of music types; and discussing instruments, harmony, and composition. For use in teaching listening comprehension, songs can be viewed as a type of exaggerated speech, and exercises can be developed for listening practice, including having students fill in the blanks of the text as they listen, write down all words they recognize as they listen, and reconstruct the theme. Activities for highlighting the linguistic aspects of song include using a song that reinforces  recently learned grammatical structures or vocabulary; using a song with regionalisms, dialect, or slang; and comparing English and target language translations. Songs have potential for literary analysis, including analysis of rhyme, vocabulary, meter, and constructions; investigation of a particular author or composer; comparison with formal literature; and analysis of literary devices. Communicative activities involving songs include creating a survey based on a song's theme, student descriptions of the action in a song, and discussion of the author's intent or feelings. Finally, a substantial benefit of using songs is that they provide variety in the class routine and are enjoyable and relaxing. (MSE)",

        "description":"A study to determine whether college students in first-, second-, and third-year Spanish courses who saw and heard dialogs between native speakers would score significantly higher on a listening comprehension test than those who only heard the dialogs had as its subjects 178 students randomly divided into two treatment groups. Twenty-seven dialogs, each containing items of varying degrees of difficulty and each less than one minute long, were videotaped for one group and the soundtrack was dubbed onto audiotape for the other group. The comprehension test consisted of 60 multiple-choice completion items in English. The statistically analyzed results indicated that students in the first- and second-year courses who saw the videotapes performed significantly better than those  hearing the audio portion only. It is theorized that this occurred because the videotape provided more stimuli contributing to redundancy. Followup interviews indicated that students seeing the videotape may have had more interest and greater motivation to pay attention than those hearing the sound only. The test's ability to discriminate was about equal for audio- and videotapes, but teachers are cautioned to use discrimination indices only when using tests to rank students rather than when assessing progress. It is also suggested that if students do understand more of the videotaped version, they will feel greater success and incentive for developing their language skills. (MSE)",

After exchange of ideas by mail, an all-day meeting of independents from several campuses was held. A chief academic officer was also invited so that an administrative viewpoint could be built into proposals. One issue that  could not be resolved at the meeting was the definition of an independent scholar (i.e., whether it should be based on degree attainment or work in progress). The protocol identifies facilities that colleges might extend to independents. Provisions of the protocol are flexible, based on a wide range of geographic, disciplinary, and human variables. It is concluded that the consortium's efforts grew from the recognition that independents could enhance the intellectual and artistic ambience of colleges. (SW)",

        "description":"Research on factors that influence college choice, including sociologic and economic explanations, is reviewed. It is suggested that the following four factors strongly affect college choice: family background, student achievement or ability, some college attributes, and labor-market conditions. School context and college effects moderately affect college selection. The variables of family background, neighborhood context, school context, and student achievement or ability represent sociologic theory, as do college attributes and effects relating to status. Other college attributes and effects represent economic theory, including availability, price, and price adjustments, along with labor market conditions. The basic economic model of the decision to attend college, the  human-capital model, considers the costs and benefits of working after high school versus completing various degrees. It is suggested that since student decisions about college are theoretically eclectic, policy and research should not rely on a single theoretical perspective. Omitting any of the variables from a choice model presumably will limit the model's applicability. The use of multivariate analysis of longitudinal data for research on college choice is also supported. (SW)",

        "description":"Views of 705 state legislators about higher education in New England were surveyed in 1984. Five major topics in higher education were covered: quality, role in economic development, finance, communication between educators and legislators, and role in retraining mid-career workers. A large majority of the respondents felt New England colleges and universities were vital to the economic development of the region. They rated the quality of postsecondary institutions as good or excellent and favored direct aid to higher education or special incentives to industry to promote retraining programs. Overall, respondents felt strongly about the need for better communication among government, higher education, and business, and favored better information about retraining needs, retraining  programs, and model legislation on retraining. Respondents were strongly disposed to regional collaboration on retraining programs. Of the 36 public colleges represented by the respondents, 27 operated one or more retraining programs, while 29 of the 65 private colleges had one or more such programs. The respondents represented Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. In addition to the survey report, which contains narrative and statistical information, a press release and summary on the survey are provided. (SW)",

Campuses offering correspondence courses need to evaluate both demand for classes and students' personal/educational interests. In developing a curriculum area, attention might be directed to student educational objectives, appropriate learning activities, organizing the curriculum, and evaluating the learner. The faculty member should determine what objectives should be emphasized in the correspondence course: student interests in subject matter, their need for vocational skills and knowledge, or their recreational and artistic interests. A second source for establishing objectives is to study society and implement selected trends in the curriculum, while a third source of educational goals emphasizes what  subject matter specialists believe is worthwhile to learn. Correspondence work completed by students should be comprehensively evaluated. For each correspondence lesson completed, the faculty members should consider depth of learning and comprehensive coverage of the subject matter, along with the mechanics of students' writing. Finally, each student should be provided continuous feedback. (SW)",

After reviewing common course numbering in other states, information is provided on the intersegmental system currently operating in California: the California Articulation Number (CAN) system. CAN is a cross-reference system that identifies transferable lower-division, introductory, and preparatory courses commonly taught at two- and four-year California campuses. The statutory specifications for a common course-numbering system are designed to promote the transfer of community college students to four-year institutions and to identify courses with similar educational objectives related to  student competencies. The Commission concludes that: (1) a course numbering system would help students to plan studies and to evaluate transfer choices; (2) a uniform course-numbering system like Florida's is unnecessary in California; (3) course-equivalency guides and matrices of equivalent courses in particular programs are of limited value in California; and (4) a generic numbering system including a common course prefix and number which retains schools' own course numbers/titles, would be suitable. Steps to further implement the CAN system are recommended. (SW)",

In addition, standardized exams to establish minimum standards for student progression in higher education are a limited but growing response to concerns about quality. Some systems are using these exams to screen students seeking admission to  teacher education programs. Georgia and Florida require all students to pass a minimum competency exam for advancement to upper-division programs.
