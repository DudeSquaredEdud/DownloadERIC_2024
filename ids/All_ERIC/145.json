        "description":"As change occurs in various health sciences programs, evaluational strategies should be developed so that adaptive decisions may be made. Evaluation models taking into account inputs, methodology, and outputs (Stake, 1967, and Astin and Panes, 1971) need examination. Alternative measurement instruments for formative and summative evaluations, including simulation techniques (McGuire and Babbott, 1967), need consideration. It is particularly important to define adequate criterion levels of performance, including analysis of the implications of criterion-referenced measurement, (Popham and Husek, 1969). Systematic evaluation strategies should provide reliable and content-valid information from which decisions can be made concerning adequacy of student preparation as compared to  content experts' a priori academic judgments.

Records of school observations and audiotape transcripts were selected to represent the concepts or categories which were developed in the process of evaluation. These qualitative data were collected in a project which used a variety of methods, and, in conjunction with quantitative data, formed the basis of an evaluation report somewhat analogous to a case study. This view of evaluative research within the case study tradition should, in the long run, provide a more detailed analysis and understanding of the process and outcomes of education. (Author/BB)",

These techniques make it possible to apply some kinds of theoretical insights to the data analysis phase of a study: either by seeking synergistic effects implied or predicted by theory, or by seeking evidence of synergies as alternative explanations for results which would otherwise imply the existence of interactions where theory would deny such interactions. In complex factorial designs particularly, where high-order interactions are often called &quot;uninterpretable,&quot; these techniques may often permit more appealing explanations and interpretations of the experimental results.

        "description":"The adequacy of a test developed for statewide assessment of basic mathematics skills was investigated. The test, comprised of multiple-choice items reflecting a series of behavioral objectives, was compared with a more extensive criterion measure generated from the same objectives by the application of a strict item sampling model. In many instances, the two instruments provided different classifications of students regarding mastery of an objective. Many of the discrepancies were attributed to the small number of items per objective and to the multiple-choice format of the original test. Consequently, the use of criterion-referenced tests in situations that severely limit test length and item format options was questioned. In addition, the problems associated with the practice  of assuming content validity for criterion-referenced tests were discussed. (Author)",

The course materials identify 13 moderator techniques which teachers practice, and 13 participant techniques which students practice. Behavioral data were collected by audiotape recording a 25-minute classroom discussion on on a controversial issue both before and after the course. Questionnaires, vocabulary tests, weekly logs of issues, and classroom observation were utilized and inter-rater reliability was computed. Behavioral results for students and teachers are presented. Critiquers, students, and teachers each used the same scale to rate the  discussion. Postcourse Teacher Questionnaires were filled out by the teachers and in general, strong support was given to the usefulness of the course. Overall, DCI produced an improvement in the use of discussion techniques. Because of feedback from students and teachers, several revisions will be made in the course materials and techniques. (RC)",

Examined are ways in which current psychological knowledge, particularly psychometrics and learning theory, is relevant to: the selection of appropriate criterion measures, the measurement of educational processes, the description of the initial status of the learner, and the analysis of field data. Predictive validity, treatability, and parsimony--three key principles of criteria selection--suggest that the most important criterion for assessing educational programs is general intellectual development. Refered to is work on process measurement in which the author proposes a model of classroom learning which identifies four major process dimensions  which assess the opportunity for learning, the degree to which the environment enhances motivation to learn, the quality of the structure of the curriculum, and the effectiveness of the instructional events. To measure the initial status of the learner, the author suggests measuring the dimensions of individual differences that are expected to be affected by the program being assessed, prior to its initiation. Characteristics of an effective statistical model for deriving useful information from these observations are discussed. (Author/RC)",

Phase one of the Study was conducted on the concept that the school and classroom, as a social system, provides the setting within which the self-system of the learner is expressed in three output areas: learner-oriented behavior in the cognitive domain, learner-oriented behavior in the affective domain, and the interrelationships of these cognitive and affective behaviors. These behavioral outputs were considered as indicators of self-perceptions, verbally expressed behaviors, and manifest behaviors which the learner originally possessed on entry to the school and classroom. Phase two,  concerned with the psycho-motor (P-M) domain, yielded information about the nature of the P-M domain, data regarding instruments of measurement, and incidence figures for the school population. Eight separate areas of P-M functioning were assessed. Through Phase two of the needs assessment study in all three domains, Virginia hopes to become fully accountable for providing quality education for every child in the public schools of the commonwealth.

Data from 93 superintendents were analyzed to determine the relationships between information usage and perceptions of assessment information relevance, problem identification, and origin of superintendent. Local dissemination of assessment results was also examined. Information usage was predicted by superintendent, school, and assessment data variables. Results indicated that perceived relevance of information was related to information usage, but problem identification and origin of superintendent was not, nor was dissemination related to favorableness of results.

This study examines the accuracy of observers coding a standard stimuli. In this procedure the observer's bias is examined, as well as the confidence that can be placed in the observation code itself. Through these procedures the exact nature of the confusion of codes can be identified. In order to avoid the problems encountered with the paired observer method, an attempt was made to assess the accuracy of observers through the use of controlled videotape examples which allow each interaction (a frame) and sequences of frames to be analyzed for accuracy. Ten videotaped skits were produced to present concise, clear examples of each code used in recording classroom  interactions on an observation instrument. Confusability (low observer agreement) matrices were constructed by tallying the observer code sequences. Results of the confusability study identify the specific codes that appear to be reliable as well as those that are confused and need to be redefined. Inter-rater accuracy and videotape simulation accuracy are compared. While the two systems of examining observer accuracy do yield some different information, it is not contradictory, and the videotape system is easier to interpret. (Author/RC)",

His response is then scored by an admissible scoring system designed so that the student will perceive that is is in his interest to report his true subjective probability. With regard to admissible probability tests, two issues are treated surrounding the relation between external incentives and optimal student behavior. It is shown that excessibe competition or the use of a strict &quot;pass-fail&quot; system can lead to responses which misrepresent the student's true state of knowledge, and that the use of admissible scoring systems should influence students to study fewer topics to a higher degree of mastery than do  other objective scoring systems. Issues treated here are theoretical. Controlled field experiments will discover whether the advantages and dangers theoretically inherent in computer-aided admissible probability testing will show up in real life. (Author/RC)",

Researchers and educators are reminded that Mexican Americans represent a complex, heterogeneous group affected in varying degrees by mixtures of culture and values and that their unique multivariate socio-cultural and linguistic characteristics must be recognized and accounted for. Alternatives suggested and discussed are: the use of criterion-referenced tests, use  of culture free tests, use of \"balanced\" research and program evaluation methodology, sensitive interpretation of test data when the use of tests is unavoidable, and the development and use of culture-specific and dialect-appropriate measures.

Considerable effort, therefore, has been devoted to the specification of objectives that the test should assess. The steps involved in the  process of test development are outlined.

IBE was used to evaluate a Comprehensive Diagnostic Teaching Center (DTC) which, in addition to providing teacher training and services to handicapped pupils, would bring together and focus all of the resources of the Indianapolis Public Schools on this problem. Students were referred to the DTC by the school psychologist usually in cooperation with the classroom teacher. The philosophical approach which guided the diagnostic activities of the DTC is that of diagnostic/prescriptive teaching seen as an on going educational process wherein instructional strategies, selected as a result of diagnostic activities are matched to a student's  unique learning mode. IBE places the information needs of concerned persons as the overriding concern of any evaluation. Reasons are stated indicating the inadequacy of traditional performance objective evaluation. However, IBE is not free of the use of objectives; their use is justified when feedback is important to information users. When looking at the evaluation process for any program, it is recommended that one concept of evaluation is adopted and maintained through the life of the project insofar as possible. (RC)",

It assumes that to function well, an individual must have a well-developed system for perception and a well-developed system for making decisions or judgments. Four interacting preferences are used to generate each of sixteen types. In each type, one pole of each of the four preferences is preferred over the other, and through use becomes more highly developed. The four preferences are: Extroversion or Introversion, Sensing or Intuition, Thinking or Feeling, and Judgment or Perception. The types are described in detail and the concepts are illustrated with data from a sample of 3275  freshmen and transfer students who entered the University of Florida in September, 1972. An overview of research that has been conducted on the teaching-learning process with the MBTI is presented. Past data and present research indicate that the use of type as an organizing principle increases the power of prediction in educational research. (RC)",

Six hypotheses were formulated and investigated. Subjects were students in two sections of a college course and the sample was replicated using the same course the following terms. Contract grading was randomly assigned to one section and conventional grading was assigned to the other section. The same instructor taught both groups. Contract grading affected student  performance no differently than did conventional grading.

Special interest is given to the implications for the evaluation of experience-based programs, and the problems and challenges encountered are given attention. The primary goal of the EBCE projects is to integrate a student's knowledge of a variety of careers with the acquisition of cognitive, interpersonal, and affective skills through a series of planned  experiences with identified learning outcomes. The benefits of an experience-based system are noted, but also described are many of the difficulties inherent in it, especially for evaluation. It is concluded that evaluation must bend to accommodate the experience-based educational system. (Author/RC)",

Our approach was to compare this procedure to the standard method of forming random split halves of items on the test. In addition the reliability of an instrument was obtained by both methods.

        "description":"Basic to many psychological investigations is the question of agreement between observers who independently categorize people. Several recent studies have proposed measures of agreement when a set of nominal scale categories have been pre-defined and imposed on both observers. This study, in contrast, developes a measure of agreement for settings where observers independently define their own categories. Thus, it is possible for observers to delineate different numbers of categories, with different names. Computational formulae for the mean and variance of the proposed agreement measure are given; further, a statistic with a large-sample normal distribution is suggested for testing the null hypothesis of random agreement. A computer based comparison of the large sample  approximation with the exact distribution of the test statistic shows a generally good fit, even for moderate sample sizes. Finally, a worked example involving two psychologists' classifications of children illustrates the computations. (Author)",

Similar comparisons were made with independent groups drawn from the same perceptual orientation groupings. It was predicted that field-independent subjects would obtain higher scores on tests of creative ability than would field-dependents. Individuals with field-independent cognitive styles were found to be consistently more creative  on the tasks used in this study than individuals with field-dependent orientations. Factor analysis of all test scores for 114 subjects revealed six creativity factors and one factor composed of IQ and perceptual test scores.

One substudy investigated Kinds of Keys, Agreement, Evaluation, and Needs Improvement. The second, NO TUP, (New Observation of Teaching of University Professor Rating Scale), investigated numbers of positive rating categories. The third, Wording, investigated the same items worded positively, negatively, and neutrally, respectively. Practically important differences in level of ratings obtained in Kinds of Keys, and practically and statistically significant differences obtained in NO TUP and Wording. Additional research is necessary to determine if apparent differences in teaching effectiveness are actually differences in teaching effectiveness or differences in  the methods of measurement.

        "description":"Summarized briefly is the research conducted at the University of Texas on the concerns of teachers. Two branches of research have been pursued. The distinction lies in the type of assessment used. The first, the Teacher Concerns Statement (TCS), an open-ended free-response instrument, asks the question: &quot;When you think about your teaching, what are you concerned about?&quot; The second instrument, the Teacher Concerns Checklist (TCCL), asks the same question as the TCS and is followed by a list of 56 items. The subject responds by placing a check under one of five categories representing the degree of concern felt. Studies of the TCS and TCCL have led to the conclusion that teachers are most concerned about: self-survival, teaching, impact on pupils, and about the teaching situation.  The TCCL promises to be a viable research instrument, largely because of its improvement over the earlier TCS in terms of reliability and increased ease in scoring. (RC)",

The question of what to measure in an assessment program is addressed at a global and a specific level. Once a developer has identified the areas to be assessed, it is necessary to consider the reporting plans for the program. Whether reporting is by group or individual, the nature of the reporting planned and the types of instruments needed to accomplish it need to be considered. After assessment areas are selected, appropriate instruments need to be selected. Some helpful sources (listings and evaluations of existing tests) are given. In the development of new assessment instruments, six areas are to be considered: initial planning  and allocation of responsibility, development of instrument specifications, item development, pretesting, use of item analysis, and final test assembly. Each of these areas is considered at some length. (Author/RC)",

To investigate the possibility that these seemingly minor alterations might change the statistical characteristics of the Achievement Anxiety Test, 104 Ss were randomly assigned to each of the three versions of the Achievement Anxiety Test--the original and the two &quot;revisions.&quot; An analysis of covariance revealed significant differences between the three forms on all three possible scales: Facilitative, Debilitative, and Facilitative-minus-Debilitative. The three  versions of the Achievement Anxiety Test also differed in terms of intro-form correlation between the Facilitative and Debilitative scales and internal consistency reliability estimates. Also of interest is the finding that, within each of the three forms, the negative correlation between Facilitative and Debilitative scales caused the Facilitative-minus-Debilitative scale to yield a higher reliability coefficient than either the Facilitative scale or the Debilitative scale.

Two assumptions are implicit: (1) one wants to obtain a maximum amount of information with respect to an item using a minimum number of subjects; and (2) once the item is validated, it may well be administered in the classical correct/incorrect manner. One way to satisfy these assumptions is to initially administer the unvalidated item to a small number of subjects using confidence testing procedures. Then subjective probabilities can be translated to pseudo-classical item scores which are, at least in theory, guessing-free. Using pseudo-classical scores, a relatively sophisticated item analysis table can be constructed, typical item  statistics can be calculated, and a kind of item reliability independent of total test reliability can be assessed. As a useful bridge between subjective probabilities and classical correct/incorrect scores, pseudo-classical scores appear to be of potential use in the analysis of criterion-referenced items.

Regarding data collection, measurement techniques, testing concerns, statistical methods, followup studies, attendance figures, teacher attitudes, etc., 19 ways were formulated to test the hypothesis. It was suggested that the middle school evaluator should first find out whether the school is operating as a middle school. Then the decision should be made as to how much of the operation he has the resources to evaluate. It should be remembered that good sampling will save time and  money and will secure further cooperation from those being evaluated while providing useful data. Finally measures should be gathered over time, sufficient time for the middle schools to have any impact, and particularly sufficient time to see what happens to middle school pupils when they proceed to the next level.

In those cases where the raters' judgments  did not coincide, a third rater reviewed the audit report in question and served as an independent adjudicator. This procedure yielded interesting and useful data on three principal features of the educational program audit: the procedures employed by the auditors, their judgments on the quality of the evaluation procedures, and the scope of the audit activities.

By implication, evaluators must agree when criteria are or are not met. Fourteen instructors evaluated 10 posterior bridges. Interjudge agreements for total bridges and individual attributes were low, as they tend to be whenever dental technic products are evaluated. A method for developing more reliable rating forms is described. It consists of: (1) limiting discriminations to the dichotomous decision \"acceptable\", \"unacceptable\"; (2) initially resolving differences among faculty; and (3) defining characteristics of acceptability on observable terms, and providing a photographic example of a minimally acceptable product for each attribute.

A variety of techniques has been employed: selection of sites for new schools, zoning of new schools and rezoning of existing schools to improve ethnic balance, transfer programs that enabled thousands of students from racially isolated districts to attend better-integrated schools in other districts. The decentralization of the city school system in 1970 has placed the responsibility for many programs in the hands of the community school boards, but the central Board of Education has retained the  responsibility for furthering integration wherever feasible, including pupil movement across school district lines. Those factors which are beyond the control of the school system have had the greatest impact on the programs for school desegregation and the reduction of minority group isolation. These include segregated housing; unemployment rates, especially among unskilled workers; growth of the population on welfare; influx of minority group poor from other areas; and others.

The cities (Boston, Chicago, Dayton, Indianapolis, Newark, New York, Savannah, and Seattle) were chosen not only for their geographic and population representativeness, but also because they were reported to be making some noticeable impact on their communities. However, these few cities have been used only as a base for an analysis of the full program. Findings of studies conducted by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and others (plus other studies done by the author) involving as little as one city and as many as all 147 cities in the Model Cities Program, are used for comparative  purposes, to confirm or qualify some points. The document is in the form of eight case studies and deals with the major components of the Model Cities Program and what impact they have had on relieving urban problems in each area. Its focus is on the operation of local general government and how this has been affected by the objectives, organization, and methods imposed by the Model Cities Program. The overall analysis is a synthesis of these experiences and how they have measured up to the program's main objectives. (Author/JM)",

The Bilingual Early Childhood Center Program has completed its third year of operation. This year the program served approximately 200 students divided into seven classes; one prekindergarten, two kindergarten, two first grade, and two second grade classes. The staff included a project director, two community-liaison workers, seven teachers, and 11 paraprofessionals. About 85 percent of the students were Spanish-dominant. The aim of the bilingual program is to offer a school program in which children receive instruction in both English and Spanish depending on language dominance. According to long-range objectives  in the area of academic performance, students should be at or above grade level in listening, speaking, reading, and writing in English by the end of the fourth grade. Furthermore, children should also be competent in Spanish. Another long-range goal is the creation of a positive orientation toward school. The instructional program consisted of language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, music, arts and crafts, and storytelling. The Distar instructional program was used for language arts and reading. (Author/JM)",

The second problem is our definition of the disadvantaged today and in the future, that is, for whom is the planning effort directed. The third problem is the presentation of hypotheses and illustrations from various fields of activity, in order to demonstrate to ourselves and to others that our view and approach to the matter do indeed differ from existing ones. Development-planning is a rational, planned, comprehensive, and integrated effort to initiate and guide a process of systematic improvement of the educational system or parts of it. A study of the development of Israel's educational system reveals four major stages in the society's awareness of the problems of the disadvantaged in the  past, and a fifth stage, which should shape the development of the educational system in the future on the basis of planning for the coming decade. The question, Who are the disadvantaged? should be raised in the context of seeing the condition of certain groups from the perspective both of expectations of the modernization stages and patterns and of the challenge and assistance offered by a system aimed at helping individuals and groups confront the expectation of survival and advancement.

Board of Education\" summarized here leaves little doubt that the message was not misunderstood. There exists today more segregation in the large cities of our nation than there was in 1954. The schools, though not responsible for the exodus to the suburbs, did however contribute to it. We did not in the 1950's develop a strategy nationally, on a state basis, nor even on a large-city basis, that would seek to meet the challenge of Brown. By the early 1940's we had begun to intensify our work on intergroup relations. This movement assumed a more formal, institutional structure after 1954. School districts did establish human relations departments, but in most instances these had no effect on  school programs or practices. A review of the literature of the past 20 years reveals so much involvement with tactics to achieve or prevent desegregation that the educational effects are almost obscured. In addition to the legal issue, we were preoccupied with open enrollment plans, the Princeton plan, the educational park, the \"magnet\" school, and last but not least, busing. And since school systems tend to be highly decentralized, a concentrated effort for educational planning becomes a most difficult and unmanageable task to evaluate. (Author/JM)",

In the spring of 1964 the achievement of school desegregation seemed almost as far off as ever. We asked ourselves: When will the law be enforced? But without a clear understanding of what the law was--and without a solid political coalition to rally behand a clear view of the law--enforcement and obedience could only become more problematic. For 10 long years the Supreme Court did not decide even one major case to define just what school \"desegregation\" meant. Between the years 1964 and 1974 the Supreme Court has spoken at last. Freedom-of-choice plans in the South have been swept aside, for example. And both busing and assignment on an explicitly integrative basis have  been upheld as reasonable means to achieve that end. The present breakdown in enforcement and obdience to the law is tied--as it was in 1964--to a new and troubling uncertainty as to the substance of the law. What is uncertain is the extent of applicability of the principles originally set forth in \"Brown v. Board of Education.\" It is our job to build the doctrine we once thought secure and to re-establish integration in our school as the basic goal. (Author/JM)",

The Rooms of 15 program serves elementary schoolchildren who have difficulty in mastering basic skills. The program included 79 classrooms, each of which contained no more than 15 students, located at 34 sites. Lincoln High School was established for students who have serious difficulties coping in a regular high school. Each student is assisted in working out his academic and behavioral problems to the point where he can adjust to a regular high  school, or alternatively, to vocational training or employment. The Work-Study high school was established for high school students in the Title I high school attendance areas who find a traditional academic curriculum unsuited to their needs and interests. The educational needs of children in parochial and private schools are addressed through the Title I nonpublic school program. During 1972-73, four Lutheran and 18 Catholic schools took part in the program. (Author/JM)",

Male and female teachers judged the academic ability and school behavior of three black and three white male student speakers representing upper-middle-class, middle-class, and lower-class backgrounds, based on their spoken language. Teachers heard tape-recordings of these junior high school students reading the same brief passage. Black and white teachers, 13 of each, were selected by a random procedure from a junior high school in the Dade County, Florida, Public School System. This particular school was selected because of the black and white ratio (21 percent black, 79 percent white) of faculty  desegregation, and the diversity in the teachers' birthplaces, educational backgrounds, and geographical locations of their teaching experiences. The findings indicate that white speakers were perceived with a significantly higher degree of favorableness by all teachers. Black teacher judgments were found to be significantly more favorable than those of white teachers. There were no significant differences found in the degree of favorableness with which upper-middle, middle, or lower-class speakers were perceived by all teachers. (Author/JM)",

Shortly thereafter the Congress authorized one-half of the President's 150 million dollar request for a short-term, crash program for project grants to school districts who were under court orders to desegregate. The President asked that the second part of his desegregation aid program, which requested a 1.5 billion dollar authorization for fiscal years 1971-72 be enacted during the 1970 session. At the time, the presidential proposal gave little hint of the legislative fate which awaited it, a litany of frustration and confusion which culminated in the passage of the act on June 23, 1972. Its history  provides a highly interesting subject for investigation and theoretical speculation by students of the politics of education. Each of the following elements are important to understanding the emergency school aid story: early forewarnings of impending policy reversal; the strategems of the Executive Branch; public concern over the effects of school desegregation and busing; competition with existing legislation; and the pursuit of some seemingly erratic actions by all the policy-makers involved.

        "description":"The political behavior and orientations of 1027 fifth-grade students in 18 inner-city, racially segregated, low socioeconomic status elementary schools were examined in two Michigan cities in 1970. The political effects of racial composition were different for each race. As elementary schools became increasingly black, average student political orientations were reported as more nonsupportive of the political system, and political behavior was more activist. In those schools where classes were increasingly white, political orientations were more supportive, and political behavior was less activist. Students of both races in predominantly black schools knew more about political problems and candidates and were more skeptical of government and political authority than students of  both races in predominantly white schools. This research shows that black, racially segregated, low socioeconomic status schools are positively beneficial for black and white students when using the criteria of participant political behavior. It may mean that the political effect of racial integration of black people is to depoliticize the black American people, which, unfortunately, for many Americans is a desirable goal. (Author/JM)",

Changes in policy and practice were comprehensive. The district adopted the 10 goals of quality education, developed by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, as the basis for program planning and implementation. In order to examine the progress of pupils toward achieving these goals and in order to evaluate the effects of school district reorganization on pupils' achievement and attitudinal patterns, two analyses were conducted. The first examined basic skill patterns of one class of Harrisburg pupils as they progressed from the beginning of grade 5 in 1970 to the end of grade 6 in 1972. Separate analyses were performed for black  and white pupils. The second examined attitudinal patterns of one class of Harrisburg pupils as they progressed from the beginning of grade 5 in 1970 to the end of grade 6 in 1972. Separate analyses were performed for black and white pupils. Three areas were included: attitude toward self, attitude towards others who differ in race and social class, and, attitude toward school and learning. Attitudinal scores for the Harrisburg sample were compared to scores from a statewide longitudinal study. (Author/JM)",

The target population consisted of approximately 400 Caucasian, inner-city elementary school students in a large midwestern city, whose general academic performance was severely depressed. The model was to augment the specific instructional skills of the classroom teachers in working with given children or groups of children. Classroom teachers received instruction in building, implementing, and  recording the specific instructional activities, concepts, and/or reinforcement techniques for their classroom; the teachers received university credit for implementing these procedures and recording the target behaviors in the classroom. The project was designed to provide a resource center where teachers could seek guidance, suggestions, assistance, and additional materials. Also, a child could be taken there for a brief period each day to be worked with by the project staff. (Author/JM)",

Two sampling procedures were required. The first drew a national sample of school districts which provided information on what desegregated schools were doing to help their staff adjust to the climate of the racially mixed school.

An inventory of 40 bi-polar traits used extensively in previous research was given to secondary school students to measure their self-concepts and their reflected selves--how they think their teachers rate them, their parents, and their classmates. The teachers and parents were given the same traits for rating the same adolescents. A sample of 120 students was randomly drawn from an urban area secondary school population. There was a minority composition of 36 percent blacks and 18 percent Puerto Ricans among the 60 disadvantaged youths. There was a white majority of 75 percent in the advantaged group. Both  disadvantaged and advantaged students indicated positive self-concepts, with the disadvantaged having significantly higher self-concepts than the advantaged youths. For both groups of students, the level of reflected self seems to be a function of the self-concept. The parents' perceptions were very close to all the self-perceptions. The teachers' ratings were at a considerable distance; and even though the teachers rated both advantaged and disadvantaged students positively, the disadvantaged children were rated much lower than the advantaged children.

        "description":"The desegregation decision by a local school system sometimes is perceived as the result of pressure, and at other times as unrelated to overt pressure for desegregation. Contrary to both of these views, this exploratory study suggests that a positive desegregation decision may stem from the personal values of school board members. These values may change under the impact of dissent over desegregation. Such change, however, seems to be relatively unaffected by political factors and often appears as the result of an individual identity conflict and a &quot;secular conversion.&quot; Models of change as the result of forced compliance, political accommodation, and secular conversion are examined, and several significant elements of secular conversion tentatively are identified. This study  focuses on seven board members during desegregation decisions in three California school districts. Six board members, two in each district, were selected for the study; they changed from a public position opposing desegregation to one of support; all voted for the desegregation plan. One eventually proved unavailable for the study, while two other board members from these districts were added, one who never changed in opposition to desegregation and one who never changed in support for desegregation.

With this design the researcher sought to: (1) find if there are differences in normative climate between white and black schools; and (2) generate further tentative insight into variables which may affect the differential academic performance of students in white and black schools. A nonrandom sample of schools was selected through the aid of the Michigan Department of Education State Assessment Program. The department provided aggregate scores of all fourth-grade students, by school, on achievement and SES, as measured by a questionnaire of family consumption patterns, education, mobility, and student's  future aspirations. Data were collected in 1970-71 via questionnaires from 16 schools with a total population of 2,743. The 1970-71 fifth-grade students whose achievement and SES data were collected by the State department in 1969-70 were the primary student sample in each school. An additional sample of fourth- and sixth-grade students in each school was included to obtain a wider range of student reports. Measures of school climate were sociopsychological scales and factors derived from the student questionnaire. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Drawing largely on data from Los Angeles, but with reference to other cities where appropriate, this paper attempts to clarify the distinctive positions taken by advocates of community control as opposed to proponents of administrative decentralization. While community control is essentially a political demand, oriented toward citizens influencing actual policy making, most decentralization plans, though responding to demands in the political arena, are primarily organizational, facilitating local participation in the implementation of policies already decided. Though different, both approaches represent attempts to deal with the relatively low levels of achievement and high dropout rates characterizing schools in minority areas. Whereas proposals for community control regard the  poor outcomes of schooling as centering on the question of staff accountability, an organizational system perspective suggests that school ineffectiveness results from local administrators lacking both adequate resources and sufficient discretion in the use of such resources as are available. It is argued here that at issue are alternative definitions of the situation, one based on the theoretical perspectives of a political system model, the other on those of an organization as an open system, responsive to environmental constraints and contingencies.

The objective of this study is to determine minority student achievement gains or losses, attitudes toward busing and school desegregation, the degree of interracial cooperation and acceptance in Waco schools, and the effect of busing on each of the above. Two items in the Equality of Educational Opportunity Survey were used to identify the interracial climate of participating schools: intergroup hostility and interracial friendship. The primary question for this paper is: Do differences in students' perceptions of the interracial climate of the school relate to differences in individual student achievement? The original sample, drawn in the  spring of 1971, consisted of a stratified random sample of seventh and eighth grade students. Approximately 240 minority students from that sample were bused to Waco Independent School District schools. The overall design of the study is that of a 3-year longitudinal panel. Data reported in this paper are from the first and second waves of collection (spring of 1971 and 1972). Multiple regression analysis is used since it allows one to weight the relative effects of contextual and individual attributes with all other factors controlled. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"System-wide school decentralization is now implemented both in New York City and in Detroit. It is important, therefore, to inquire into alternative explanations of the origins of the school decentralization movement with a view to constructing models of school organizational behavior and change which may have utility either to other school systems facing the decentralization question, or to other problems of organizational behavior. Two such models, the sequential and the organizational, have been proposed for these purposes. The sequential model postulates a sequence of key events leading to the decision to decentralize a school system. Its interesting implication is that the goal of the community control movement is greater citizen participation in organizational  decision-making. The logic of the organizational model implies that greater authority for organizational decision-making be delegated to local administrators. What is at issue here is the distinction between community control and administrative decentralization. The tension between these two not necessarily compatible models for the restructuring of educational governance is at the heart of this paper, and at the heart of the disappointment with the results of school decentralization in New York City and Detroit now felt by many of its early proponents.

The responses of 303 students from a racially mixed school. Berkeley High School, were grouped in terms of the degree to which the individual students are socially integrated and the students were examined in light of the violence they had personally experienced. It was hypothesized that students who were socially integrated across ethnic boundaries were not involved with perceived violence and conflict on the campus, while aggressive acts, in the main, involved students whose friends and companions were of their own race. Data were collected by means of a questionnaire sent to about a third of the 1970  graduating class of Berkeley High School. The Tryon clustering of objects was used to identify independent groups of students who were socially isolated or integrated across races. That procedure was effective in that it generated six clearly identifiable groups of students who were socially isolated or socially integrated across the Asian, black, and white students in the school. Because of the low frequencies, the hypothesis that conflict and violence centers around students who are not socially integrated is not supported. (Author/JM)",

Methodologically, the course is addressed to coordinate the aims of the CBE component  with the realities of community needs, priorities, and resources in the educational field, and to elucidate the role of the intern in this process. The modules in this manual are designed to shed light on the problems and prospects of community development in South Texas; they have also been sensitized to reflect the perceived needs of depressed rural communities in the Southwest.

Late in the school year, a program funded under Title IV-A of the Social Security Act was implemented which provides day care services for 40 preschool children of the Towns School Community and an extended day program for school-age siblings of the preschool group. This program is designed to make it possible for mothers of these children to be trained for and/or obtain gainful employment and, thus, to be self-supporting and to benefit from interaction with the larger community.

The Career Opportunities Program was a training program for selected paraprofessionals. Seventy pupils took part in the English-Reading program, funded under Title I of the 1965 Elementary Secondary Education Act, with a staff of one lead teacher and three aides. The Health-Medical Service, also funded under  Title I, was to serve seven children by providing corrective visual and hearing aids. Title IV-A of the Elementary Secondary Education Act provided funds for a preschool unit for 20 children and an extended day program for 40 children. The Education Professions Development Act was a cooperative effort of the Atlanta Public School System and the Atlanta University. The goal of the project was to provide the classroom teachers with the techniques and strategies of specialized education through special training. (Author/JM)",

The primary goals were to provide an educational program which would meet the needs of the pupils and would correct academic deficiencies in reading. This goal was supported by the following: (1) to provide an environment in which each pupil had the opportunity to learn and to learn how to learn; (2) to implement a reading program which met the needs of each pupil; and (3) to involve parents in the school. The Comprehensive Instructional Program focused on diagnostic teaching of reading in grades 1-3. Grant Park has been involved in pilot testing of two units of the Comprehensive Career Education Model Program, a national model under development by the Center for Vocational  and Technical Education at the Ohio State University in cooperation with six local education agencies. The Follow Through Program is a national project which has been incorporated in the instructional program at Grant Park, one grade per year over the past four years. The Atlanta Comprehensive Day Care Program is funded under Title IV-A of the 1967 Amendment to the Social Security Act. Grant Park was funded for a preschool unit of 20 and an extended day program of 32. The program was staffed by a lead teacher, group leader, and two aides. (Author/JM)",

The goals were: (1) to provide a reading program which emphasized the development of basic reading and communication skills by diagnosing each child's strengths and weaknesses and then individualizing activities for him; (2) to improve the child's self-concept and attitude toward school and especially to improve peer group relationships; (3) to increase parental involvement in school  activities; and (4) to improve academic performance in the areas of reading and mathematics. Title I, Elementary Secondary Education Act, was the only supportive program that provided supplementary personnel, services, and funds over and above those supplied through the regular school program. Title I provided for one lead teacher and two educational aides. In addition, limited funds were available for materials and supplies.

The State initiated the effort to meet the educational needs of disadvantaged learners. This report describes the nature of the target population by such factors as grade intervals, degree of deficiency, ethnic origin, demographic considerations, etc. Included also are descriptive statistics addressing the types and numbers of staff, the means by which students are selected, the degree to which compensatory education teachers and paraprofessionals receive inservice training, and the relationship of Title I funded activities with other sources of categorical aid. The larger portion of  the report concentrates on the degree to which treatments, formulated according to approved district proposals, were implemented. The focus of the report is on the degree to which specific objectives in the basic skill areas of instruction were achieved. Therefore the overriding question surrounding compensatory aid is: Is there evidence that educationally disadvantaged learners achieved more growth in basic skills than would have occurred if the Title I dollars had not been expended on remedial treatments?

One important structural variable is racial balance, new and objective indicators of which are developed and discussed in chapter 3. Chapter 4 discusses currently available effectiveness measures that school districts can use to determine changes in students' achievement and racial attitude occurring as a consequence of desegregation. Chapter 5 discusses five major types of evaluation study designs  which can be used to evaluate the effects of desegregation programs. The advantages and disadvantages of each design approach are discussed in detail, and evaluation issues which school districts must bear in mind while planning and implementing desegregation programs are identified. The nature and extent of the information provided by each design approach, the facilities and capabilities required to execute studies belonging to each design type, and important cost factors associated with each design type are also described.

The purpose of this study is primarily to discern the range of possibilities for school desegregation in each of 44 districts when account is taken of the districts' particular demographic situation; it is decidedly not the purpose to identify a single plan that is recommended for that district. The primary contribution of this study has been the development of a method that not only calculates the extent of achievable  desegregation and the associated burden in terms of student busing, but also takes into explicit account the characteristics that are unique to specific school districts. Since there is so much diversity within the 44 cities studied, the specific results of the study must be displayed either in graphical or tabular form for each area, or in summary tables that display a limited set of results for all areas.

        "description":"In this retrospective review of demographic aspects of race and the metropolis, presented as a basis from which to speculate about the 1970's, the period of mass migration of blacks out of the rural South is seen as drawing to a close. The U.S. black population is more urban and more metropolitan than the white population. The development of black majorities in a few large cities is the harbinger of the same occurrence in perhaps another eight cities in the 1970's. During the 1960's the nation's 243 metropolitan areas displayed an enormous diversity of patterns and rates of white and black in- and out-migration to and from central cities and suburbs. In the 1970's the essential similarities between blacks and whites in housing demands and residential location preferences may  become more evident. Whether or not there is significant diminution of racial residential segregation, black suburbanization is likely to become a dominant migration stream. Too narrow a focus on racial aspects of the metropolitan scene may obscure broad social, economic, and demographic dynamics. Population redistribution of the 1970's and 1980's seems likely to develop in new ways that are inadequately captured by our traditional terminology of rural, urban, central city, suburb, and metropolis.

        "description":"In January 1970, the Department of Labor restructured its Neighborhood Youth Corps (NYC) out-of-school program and made age limits for entering the program more restrictive. Education, skill training, and work experience were emphasized. The restructured NYC-2 program was carried out in urban or growth areas, but the original NYC-1 program was continued in the remaining locations in the country. To test whether the department's restructuring had improved the program, the General Accounting Office (GAO) reviewed five NYC-2 projects in Birmingham, Cleveland, Philadelphia, San Antonio, and San Francisco. In 1969 GAO reported to the Congress that the NYC initial out-of-school program was essentially a work experience program serving as a temporary holding action until enrollees could  find better jobs or secure training through other Federal or local programs. GAO questioned the need for the out-of-school progrm operated at that time because of the availability of other programs to meet enrollees needs. The restructured out-of-school program objectives were to place enrollees in suitable jobs, advanced training, or further education after they leave the program. Community sponsors, such as public or private nonprofit agencies, plan, administer, coordinate, and evaluate the program. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Intellective measures such as aptitude test scores and previous school grades have long been used to predict a student's future academic potential. The information is relatively easy to obtain and has shown high correlations with college grades. Among minority students, however, there is evidence that they often defy what one would predict on the basis of aptitude test scores and past grades. If intellective measures are not significantly related to the academic performance of minority students who generally perform poorly on aptitude tests, perhaps it would be wiser to look at noncognitive areas of behavior. It may be that such factors as self-concept or level of aspiration or parental expectations are more strongly related to minority student achievement than aptitude test  scores. In this document, studies which have examined the relationship of various nonintellective variables to the academic performance of minority populations are reviewed. The nonintellective factors fall into two broad categories: personality traits and family characteristics. It is found to be difficult to draw any definite conclusions regarding such relationships for several reasons. First of all, not enough research has been done. Secondly, much of the research that has been done is marred by methodological limitations. (Author/JM)",

It sought, by closer contact with the home, to improve pupil attitude, attendance, punctuality, and reading competence and to make pupils and parents aware of those services available in school and community that would facilitate learning and maturity. The program began at High School A in Manhattan in 1968. It was added to High Schools C and B, Brooklyn, in 1969 and 1970, respectively. The prime school service utilized in all three schools to improve reading was tutoring. At School B and School C the Reach-Out Program located, placed, and encouraged candidates for the Homework-Helper Program. Parents received information from the school by phone, letters, and parent program assistant visitation  in an effort to improve the educational climate at home. At periodic teas and meetings parents were given information on school regulations, attendance requirements, and diploma requirements. Programs were adjusted to coincide with pupil interests, abilities, and financial needs. Circulars were distributed throughout the high schools to acquaint faculty members with Reach-Out. Anyone in the school could make referrals to the coordinators. The coordinators also observed attendance records and grade results to locate pupils having trouble. (Author/JM)",

Project Read was an individualized, self-pacing reading program designed to increase the  interest and reading abilities of selected pupils in P.S. 140. The Supportive Training for Inexperienced and New Teachers consisted of 10 master teachers. Each supervised 8--10 new teachers. The goal of the Mathematics Laboratory Project was to identify third, fourth, and fifth grade children who were lowachievers in mathematics, and through the use of small group and individualized instruction to: (1) increase motivation to learn mathematics, (2) improve computational skills, and (3) assist teachers in using new materials and techniques.

Average class size was 15 students. Students received guidance services of the Community Liaison worker staff. Students were provided with additional tutoring, visits to cultural and  business organizations, and other special activities. A student who remained at the Urban Prep School through his course of study, would receive full credit toward his diploma from a cooperating public high school or from the Dalton school. The student population was 98, 95, and 84 during the three semesters respectively. Learning laboratory facilities were provided utilizing multimediated and programmed instructional materials.

During the 1972-73 school year approximately 16,300 pupils were enrolled in the NPS program and were serviced by the following components: Corrective Reading, Corrective Mathematics, English as a Second Language, Clinical-Guidance, Speech Therapy, Homework Helper, and Services to Handicapped Children. Formerly the programs functioned as independent entities. This year, Federal and State guidelines required that children suffering from multiple handicaps be provided with concerted remedial services. Reading, Mathematics, and English as a Second Language  were recognized as priority programs, to be supported by Clinical-Guidance, Speech, and the Homework Helper Program. The &quot;umbrella&quot; project, encompassing both instructional and supportive components, was conceived of in order to offer this spectrum of Remedial Services to Eligible Nonpublic School Pupils. Pupils receiving these supportive services had to be referred through the priority remedial instructional services. An overall evaluation sample of 30 schools was chosen in conjunction with the central offices of the NPS ESEA Title I program. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The purpose of this report is to stimulate discussion, promote understanding, develop better awareness, and thereby bring about action to make necessary changes toward racial equality and justice. The public hearing conducted on March 3, 1973 by the Washington State Asian American Advisory Council brought attention to the fact that racism has and still does exist against Asians. The hearing and this report addressed itself to the issue of racism, whether individual or institutional, overt or subtle, intended or unintended, and how its resultant effects have excluded and subordinated Asians in ways unique only to Asians as well as in other ways similar to other minorities. Testimony was heard from Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, and Korean. Their experiences and observations indicate  the depth of racism and its permeating effect on Asians. Being made to feel inferior; subjected to ridicule; rejecting one's own identity; feeling helpless, enraged, frustrated are no strangers to Asians.

        "description":"1974 is a watershed for New Jersey public schools, a time when the State is under court order to reform its discriminatory and ineffective method of raising and distributing educational revenues. The existing approach to financing education in the state of New Jersey assigns higher educational resources to pupils in richer school districts, yet taxes the poorer districts at higher rates. Its basic flaw is the low proportion of equalizing state funds relative to the proportion of local revenues. Thus the state fails to overcome the disparities in local ability to support schools. Two alternative directions for reform seem to emerge. The first assumes that the Court opinion was essentially directed at requiring the state to meet the educational needs of its pupils. This view  implies that policy-makers should concentrate their efforts on establishing the costs of a &quot;thorough and efficient&quot; education. The second direction is grounded in an attempt to reform the existing state aid structure to meet the Court's objections. By markedly increasing the proportion of state equalizing aid, the plan is intended to eliminate discrimination against low wealth school districts and thus guarantee the ability of all districts in the state to provide an adequate educational program.

Unless it examines and declares its theoretical base reflecting planning in response to what it views as its purpose and mission, it will continue to be treated as a marginal, residual institution and user capriciously as a political and social instrument. Day care's unavowed goals have been almost exclusively work oriented, spiked with programmatic doses of education and social work geared toward the prevention of family breakdown--toward the family deemed inadequate socially or economically--the dysfunctioning family. Even its original avowed goal--prevention of juvenile delinquency--has consistently been vulnerable to the whims of governmental legislation and social attitudes.  Day care is a prime example of organizational adaptation to precarious values. In the 1960's, as day care itself began the push for professionalization and viable educational goals, and with the development of Head Start programs as a way of operationalizing both community control and self-determination, the long dormant concept of viewing day care as a social service emerged. The reconceptualization of day care as a social service resource not limited to dysfunctioning families falls within the purview of preventive models of intervention. (Author/JM)",

The major objective of this program was to focus on the task of developing more positive classroom management techniques for the participants. The design of the study specified six structured 2-hour sessions for each experimental group. Each session began with communication exercises stressing self-awareness and awareness of other school personnel. After the exercises, some typical classroom problems were presented through films, role play simulations, and other written materials.  The participating subjects then proceeded to discuss and develop various positive coping techniques for dealing with the presented problems. The subjects were experienced teachers from three representative Title I, Elementary Secondary Education Act school in the Milwaukee Public School System. The general findings seem to suggest that teachers may have more success in dealing with elementary pupils than secondary students. Results suggest that this program may assist in dealing with relationship problems confronting urban schools. (Author/JM)",

The affects of various school inputs (teacher quality and equipment, for example), socioeconomic inputs (family income and race, for example), and school climate inputs (the number of disruptive incidents and the proportion of low-achievers) are being analyzed in relation to changes in pupil achievement over a period of years. Inputs important to low-achievers will be sorted from inputs important to high-achievers. Similarly, sorting will be done by race and income levels. The findings presented here suggest that, in comparison with the Washington, D.C.  public school allocations condemned by the U. S. District Court in 1967-71, the Philadelphia School District comes out very well indeed. On the average, where policy dictated equal distribution, the disadvantaged received resources equal to those received by the advantaged. Moreover, where policy delegated more resources to the advantaged, with the important exception of federal funds, they received them. The results differed, however, for some resources, some levels of schooling, and some disadvantaged groups. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This paper presents results, using data from the National Longitudinal Surveys, which support the economic disadvantage of a non-Southern ghetto environment for young black males. Controlling for differences in age, years of school completed, region and character of current residence, it is found that the mean earnings of young black males educated in the metropolitan non-South are substantially less than those of their peers educated in the rural South. It was not possible to confirm this disadvantage for older black males, however. Examining several attitudinal and labor force characteristics of young blacks leads to the conclusion that a major problem in reducing black poverty--contrary to the implications of the Coleman Report--lies in improving the environment of the  non-Southern ghetto. The analysis is also extended to whites in order to examine the rural-urban dimensions of environment and migration and their effect on racial earnings differentials. The National Longitudinal Surveys constitute a five-year longitudinal study of the labor market experiences of four subsets of the United States population. The present study is based on data collected in the first round of interviews with two cohorts of men, the first 45-59 years of age and the second 14-24 years of age. (Author/JM)",

This book is an effort to see that the Title I program works by making sure it is properly understood. It is divided into four parts. Part 1 contains the basic information parents need to know about Title I--what activities it can fund and which children it can help. The second  part summarizes the rights and responsibilities of the parent advisory council and other parents under Title I. Helpful suggestions for parents also appear throughout the guide. The third part concentrates on local, state, and federal responsibilities under Title I; that is, what parents can expect their state or local education agency and the U.S. Office of Education to do.

A second objective was to examine in detail a critical phase of the occupational cycle, the first few years in the labor force, which research has shown is critical for occupational and economic mobility. The study, funded by the Social Security Administrative, was distinctive in that the data were based entirely on the collation of high school records of graduates with Social Security work-history records. It was decided to concentrate the exposition to a single school: the High School of Fashion Industries (HSFI) in New York City. HSFI is a unit industry school. Unit trade schools are generally superior to  multi-industry schools. Not only are their facilities oriented toward a specific industry, they are in close communication with employers concerning standards of training and job placement. By reducing the range of trades, it is possible to explore the data in much greater depth. Graduates from June 1956 to June 1963 were selected for study. Of 2,293 graduates in 13 curricula selected for study, the Social Security Administration was able to locate the work-history records of 1950 graduates, approximately 85 percent. This account dealt with the four core curricula: Fashion Design, Technical and Vocational; Trade Dressmaking, Vocational; and Garment Operating. (Author/JM)",

Comparisons are made with the mid- and late 1960's. The time period used varies in the report; however, the most current data available are always presented. Generally, to date, the 1970's characterized by a mixed pattern of development as compared with the 1960's, the decade when major social and economic advances were made by blacks. Blacks have shown continued progress in education and the acquisition of elected offices. In other areas such as income, the picture is  particularly mixed with significant regional and family status variation, although the overall income ratio between black and white families has declined. Most of the estimates in this report are based on data from the Current Population Survey of the Bureau of the Census.

From the early and primary emphasis on school desegregation in the southern and border States, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has expanded its program to treat many of the special kinds of discrimination suffered by national origin minorities and women. It is the responsibility of OCR to ensure that HEW-assisted activities are conducted and services are provided without discrimination because of race, color, religion, national origin or sex. OCR turned its attention to hospital and extended care facilities, for example, with  the advent of Medicare in 1966. For the most part, such facilities were desegregated by 1967. While desegregation of public school districts has attracted more attention, OCR has also been seeking to eliminate the dual system of higher education, vestiges of which still exist in many southern states. In early 1974 OCR was given enforcement responsibility for Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibits discrimination against physically or mentally handicapped individuals in Federally assisted programs.

We want to support the developmental tendency in the child to deal with things indirectly, to symbolize them, to reproduce in his own particular way the experiences that have been meaningful for him. Finally, the child must be helped to a skillful and rich use of words and language forms. We must try to understand what really are the basic life deficits of most of the four- and five-year-old children of disadvantaged families and then, after that, think  about what adaptations of usual school procedures, or relationships, should be made to meet the children where they are. Three different deficits can be associated with the family life patterns in negative conditions of poverty. First, these children do not have the language skills expected at their stage of development. At home, there may be a lack of close relationships. The third kind of deficit results from psychological uncertainty reinforced by the disorder of the physical environment. (Author/JM)",

This ideology has increasingly come under attack by a variety of persons. The purpose of this paper is to outline several legal grounds on which this ideology has been and will be challenged and to spell out some of the implications of successful challenges. The \"melting pot\" ideology provided some of the impetus in all the states (except Mississippi). Finding in it the state's interest to both compel children to attend school and prevent them from working. At the same time, through the exercise of its policy powers, each of the states has developed a system for selecting and licensing those entrusted with the education of the state's  young. There arises out of these interrelated state actions a complex web of issues. In other instances, the state has sought at least in theory to protect the public interest through occupational and professional licensing. But in virtually no other situation besides education is an individual compelled to use the services of one or more specific licensed practitioners. One would consequently expect that the process for designating and licensing of teachers would be extremely rigorous. (Author/JM)",

The participants looked at creative and productive ways to demonstrate the pupil's right to attend school, to receive an education, to have the protection of the courts, and the right to due process. The conference participants also explored methods for  building into school board policies the pupil's right to adequate notice of a violation and to an appropriate hearing regarding its charges. Students, as citizens, are protected by the First and the Fourteenth Amendments. We must assure due process rights for students by suggesting, recommending, and demanding that those in positions of power correct the evils that presently exist in student displacement/exclusion.

        "description":"The Fort Worth Independent School District continued its court-ordered desegregation plan implemented in 1971-72. The evaluated design utilized in 1971-72 was extended to include bused black students in grade 3 as well as those in grades 4 and 5, and to ascertain any effects on the achievement of white third, fourth, and fifth grade students in cluster schools to which black students were bused. Standardized tests were administered to all students in cluster schools, grades 3, 4, and 5, and to students continuing to attend neighborhood schools that were not involved in the cluster arrangement. The spring achievement of students with similar mathematics ability, as measured in the fall, was the basis for the comparisons of achievement between cluster and non-cluster students. At  all three grade levels, bused black students were found to have exhibited academic gains on reading and math skills during th year that significantly exceeded those of nonbused black students attending black-majority neighborhood schools. A trend for effects to be greater for higher ability black students emerged. White, third, fourth, and fifth grade children attending cluster schools to which black children were bused made normal academic progress. (Author/JM)",

Thus this paper focuses on the utility of indicating the historical processes which, following the genesis of two cities, produced differing milieus for an influx of some 20,000 Portuguese immigrants (divided almost equally between the two communities) during the past 10 years. The cities are separated in their town limits by some 20 miles, but they are actually linked by a series of interdigital suburbs and small towns. They exist in a coastal area of southern New England and have very different  economic bases. Each, for historical reasons, has created a different stereotype, or ethnic identity, of Portuguese-Americans, has established different positions within the total network of the community for the Portuguese-American to occupy, has provided different strategic alternatives for the immigrant who must adapt to his new life, and thus has created areas which the Portuguese immigrants themselves perceive as different--a perception that influences their choice of settlement.

        "description":"The investigation reported here examined the power of a set of 31 situational and attitudinal variables to predict delinquency among inner-city youth and to draw some conclusions about the causes of delinquency insofar as they may be empirically determined. The data were obtained through survey interviews with 837 male youth living in traditionally high delinquency areas of Chicago. Respondents ranged in age from 10 through 16 with roughly the same numbers, 119, at each year of age. 62 percent were Negro; the remainder were from Italian, Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Anglo backgrounds, in that order. The variables emerging as best predictors are: age, educational expectations, occupational aspirations, group memberships, and race. The most important finding of this exploratory study  is the significant connection between the expectation for success in the conventional sense and differential rates of official misconduct. In addition, at least one of the components of this relatively poor outlook for conventional achievement, Educational Expectations, is antecedent and causally related to delinquency. This pessimism about later school achievement develops prior to the age of 10 and does not relate closely to objective measures of academic achievement. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The passage of Title I of the 1965 Elementary Secondary Education Act embodied not only the high hopes of reformers, but also an implicit challenge. Title I implied that current practices are inadequate, and the schools were given the assignment of self-renewal. However, almost a decade after the passage of Title I, the general verdict is that educators have not successfully met that challenge--that Title I has failed as an instrument of national policy. But it is possible that Title I programs, as they have been evaluated, have never existed--that Title I has not yet been implemented as intended by reformers. There are four factors which are assumed to promote compliance to policy directives: goals, an incentive system, information feedback, reliable knowledge about effective  strategies, and effective authority. Weakness in any one aspect is likely to undermine the others; in the instance of Title I, each was deficient or unstable in some respect. Thus the more immediate, and possibly more difficult, task for federal educational policy makers is not just the identification of more effective educational treatments, but the formulation of incentives which encourage local districts to establish &quot;special educational programs for the disadvantaged.&quot; (Author/JM)",

Specifically, the study was to provide information to the Regional Director for Region II (New Jersey's region) in order to assist his efforts in strengthening recruiting programs; improve the administration of the Basic Opportunity Grants; assist the TRIO Program components in improving the delivery of services to Spanish speakers; and, enhance the use and administration of the RD (Research and Development) Review and sign off procedures. Four populations were involved in the research: university or  college administrators, and Spanish-speaking community organizations. Fifteen colleges representatively distributed in the three regions into which the state is usually divided were selected because they are located in areas with large concentrations of Spanish speakers. Fifteen high schools in the state were also selected on these bases. In addition 15 community organizations which primarily serve the Spanish-speaking community were selected. (Author/JM)",

Among the findings were the following: While 30 percent of the educators indicate it is methodologically unsound to evaluate the educational development of children with a language barrier (primary language of communication being different from the language of instruction) in the same manner as for children who speak and understand English  fluently, all 21 districts do so. Only 13 percent of the educators indicated that they were trying to correct this procedure, despite limited resources, by using bilingual test monitors and reportedly intensive Spanish-speaking personnel recruitment. Seventy percent of the administrators stated that they agreed with accountability, but only if it were shared equally by parent, student, teacher, principal, superintendent, board, funding source, and 10 percent even included in the school custodian.

Program procedures also utilize certain key components which include: wide range of alternative instructional techniques, variety of reading materials, feedback to classroom teacher, and, parental involvement. Key findings indicate that the services of the program during 1972-73 produced a significant improvement in the reading  performance of children who participated in the program. Children receiving consultant services in grades 1, 2, and 3 reflected higher scores on vocabulary and comprehension tests than their controls. Such differences were not statistically significant, however. Greatest impact was observed at grade 3 where experimental pupils achieved an advantage over control pupils in word and analysis, oral reading, use of comprehension skills, and acceptance of the reading task responsibility.

Findings indicate that three out of eight pupils improved their performance levels to within one year of their reading expectancies. Long-term pupils--the most severaly disabled group--showed an average gain of almost 16 and one-half grade equivalent units between their performance levels and reading expectancies. Moderate-term pupils made an average gain of six grade equivalent units between performance levels and reading expectancies in an average service period. (Author/JM)",

Differences in achievement gains are hypothesized to be a function of bused student attitudes toward busing and the interracial climate of acceptance in the receiving schools. The design of this study is that of a three year longitudinal panel with before busing and after busing achievement and attitudinal measures for bused and non-bused black students, and white receiving school students and teachers in Waco, Texas. Independent variables included in the analyses include measured intelligence, parental authority structure, educational expectations, self-concept, racial prejudice, integration attitudes, busing attitudes, school socio-economic  climate and two measures of school interracial climate. Findings reveal the achievement performance of bused black students declined significantly from that of non-bused blacks. While all minority students had lower achievement scores after two years of busing, school interracial climate and the attitudes of bused students accounted for the significantly lower scores of bused students. The major conclusion is that rapid school desegregation in communities with great resistance to busing erodes student achievement performance. (Author/JM)",

The estimates in this report for 1973 and some of those for 1960 and 1970 are based on data obtained in the current population survey of the Bureau of the Census. The present sample is spread over 461 cities comprising 923 counties and independent cities with coverage in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Some of the highlights involving female heads and the members of their families featured in the main part  of the text include: Since 1960 there has been a 10 percent increase in the number of white female family heads and a 35 percent increase in the number of Negro female family heads. Between 1960 and 1973 the median age of women who headed families declined by about five years, with Negro family heads now about nine years younger than their white counterparts. There has been an increase in the proportion of female heads who are divorced, separated, or single and a decline in those who were widowed. (Author/JM)",

Compelling forces accelerating the need for consumer education have originated within schools to make education relevant to the problems of real life as well as outside the schools, as evidenced by the problems of people living in a modren, industrialized economy. A survey of Maryland schools showed consumer education to be included in the elementary curriculum but in no systematic pattern; consumer education was included at the high school level, not as a separate subject, but most frequently as a component of home economics or business education. Recommended strategies involve  development and implementation by the State of initial management activities, assistance to counties in program planning and identifying personnel, assistance to teachers in acquiring attitudes and skills, establishment of a course and seminar available to all teachers, and the development of a research design for program evaluation.

The study evaluates the effects of training adult basic education teachers in behavioral attending skills. Two basic questions were investigated: (1) Would the training of instructors in the use of behavior attending skills lead to a corresponding decrease in test anxiety on the part of examinees? and (2) What was the degree of permanence of the subjects' learned behavioral skills? A 1-hour micro-training session with an experimental and control group was used. It was found that the experimental group of teachers differed significantly from the control group in the behavioral skills of attending after training and that this difference was maintained 2 months  later. It was also found that test anxiety was lower for examinees tested by the experimental group than those tested by the control group. The methodology of the study is presented in detail, and the appendix includes pertinent statistical data, a bibliography, the behavioral training manual, and the testing environment rating scale used in the study.

Pluralism is a critical value to be preserved and promoted through public policy decisions which emphasize freedom and independence. Educational institutions must receive the financial support necessary to maintain viable programs and to assure diversity, difference, and competition. The public has a right to know how public funds are being used to educate and to demand that the monies be spent wisely, but it does not have the right to interfere with basic principles of academic freedom and professional judgment. There must be educational  accountability but business must not be the model. Educators' self-imposed model of accountability should focus on the outcome of the learning process as a developed value, the development of individual persons. The model might come from religion--an understanding of human relationships and performance of covenants. (Author/AG)",

The survey provides information on the number of persons who worked at some time, the number of weeks they were employed, the industry and occupation at which they worked the longest, the number who were unemployed for a week or more during the year, and the number of weeks they were unemployed. In addition to the report, a 63-page appendix offers an explanatory note defining basic labor force concepts, sample design, estimating methods, reliability of data, supplementary tables detailing statistical information from  the March 1972 survey, and 27 supplementary tables describing March 1971 figures. Topics dealt with include work experience and unemployment statistics by age, sex, race, and marital status. A major finding of the survey was that service industries accounted for the greatest proportion of the over-the-year increase in the number employed at year-round full time jobs--85 percent of the increase among women and 20 percent of the rise among men.

Toward this end, research relating to six factor-analytically derived attributes of employees' task goals is reviewed to ascertain which attributes are more consistently related to performance. The six &quot;task goal attributes&quot; are: (1) goal specificity, (2) participation in goal-setting, (3) feedback, (4) peer competition, (5) goal difficulty, and (6) goal acceptance. While goal specificity and goal acceptance were found to be most consistently related to performance, several intervening variables emerged which  tended to affect significantly the impact of certain attributes on performance. The findings are discussed within a motivational framework and it is argued, based on the data, that performance under goal-setting conditions is a function of at least three important variables: the nature of the task goals, additional situational-environmental factors, and individual differences.

One important development has been the rapid growth of the area vocational-technical school, a growth made possible in part by the Federal money assigned by the Vocational Education Act of 1963 and the amendments of 1968. All kinds of vocational schools have one thing in common: they receive Federal funds, and their eligibility to continue receiving Federal assistance depends on their compliance with Federal civil rights law. The Office of Civil Rights (OCR) will examine the compliance status of some 1,500 area vocational schools, in all States. This figure of 1,500 represents those schools with Federal financial assistance for which OCR has not yet been able to make a determination of  compliance with civil rights law. Preliminary findings showed that compliance problems based on the race of students appeared to be relatively small, less than 10 percent. Two other findings of the survey that will have impact on each State vocational system were the chronic lack of minority instructors and discrimination on the basis of sex. (BP)",

Three main simplified behavioral response levels characterize this system: (1) cognitive, (2) psychomotor, and (3) affective domains. Each of these objectives are classified by one of 16 descriptors. The second major characteristic of the system is that it is based on taxonomics (keyword indexes) of curriculum areas, which might appear in any K-12 curriculum. The third distinguishing feature is a coding procedure which allows an entire objective to be specified in a maximum of 30 characters. Coding of more than 100 objectives per hour is possible. Two of the significant outputs of the system are the performance objective chart, whose major function is  to promote continuous curriculum development, and the Management By Objectives System (MBO) which is an economical data compiling aid for administrators in: (1) planning, (2) monitoring, and (3) evaluation. Two printouts from this processing are the Gantt Chart and the monitoring report. The cost for a school district to implement and maintain the computer program is also discussed. (BP)",

        "description":"Black high school seniors were administered a questionnaire asking them to evaluate the importance of 25 job-related factors in their decisions to take a job. They also received an adjective check list which was designed to assess the students' self-concepts. Navy recruiters also received the job factor questionnaire and were asked to predict how the black high schoolers would respond. Results indicate that recruiters don't predict the factors which appeal to blacks with any great accuracy. Black recruiters and more experienced recruiters are significantly more accurate than others, however. Some of the factors affecting recruitment were whether a respondent was a high or low academic achiever, or from a high, medium, or low income family. Students from middle rather than lower  income families were disproportionately represented among volunteers. It is felt that this may be a reflection of the tight job market in some professions--particularly education, the most frequently entered profession for blacks. Finally, six self-characterizations were found to differ significantly between volunteers, nonvolunteers, and the undecided. It was interesting to note that five of the six characterizations are part of what some have called an authoritarian/military personality structure. (Author/BP)",

Statistical and conceptual flaws are noted in Duncan's work and their implications explored. A reanalysis of primary survey data is presented and, based on a reinterpretation of this data, a reconceptualization of the reward distribution process is offered. The implications of this reconceptualization for stratification research are noted. It is further suggested that a plausible source of Duncan's research error is that of presuppositional bias, particularly American egalitarian achievement ideology. It is also suggested that this presuppositional bias did not emerge as analytical error in Duncan's research as an isolated case, but is  present in every functionalist theoretical statement about the stratification system.

The value of industrial arts was recognized in the emergencies of career education and in the Educational Amendments of 1972. A definition of industrial arts included its concern with the interaction and interface between society, man, and technology. Career education in Michigan is developing on basis of identified life roles being legitimate concepts to guide educational program development. Industrial arts contributes to many facets of career education. In career development,  particularly, it has specific roles and responsibilities. Five recommendations for future action by groups and individuals in industrial arts and in education in general are presented in the light of concern with the developmental status of career education, compliance with the accountability model, and lack of fiscal appropriations.

The study seeks to identify those characteristics that appear to be most important in explaining variations in several facets of labor market experience: participation, unemployment, and mobility. The present report summarizes some of the information yielded by the third round of interviews conducted during the first quarter of 1970. The focus is on the magnitude and patterns of change over the first three years of the study in the educational  and occupational aspirations of the young women, in their labor force and employment status, and in their affiliations with particular firms. The report is based entirely on tabular data and is intended primarily as a process report on the longitudinal study.

Three tables are presented: length of employment of workers on their current job, by sex; median years on current job, by sex, age, and race; and median years on current job, by occupation, industry, and sex. Among the broad interpretations of the data, it was noted that the length of job tenure is closely related to the sex and age of the workers, and, as workers age, the difference between the job tenure of men and women tends to widen. Median years on the current job varied for women by marital status. Job tenure for white and Negroes was about the same overall, but there were differences by sex. Self-employed persons had longer job  tenure than wage and salary workers. Tenure was longest for farmers and farm managers. The occupation of shortest duration for men was nonfarm labor or service work; for women it was sales and service work. (AG)",

An individualized approach to curriculum development utilized three basic techniques: (1) the person-centered interview, (2) the organizing-center approach to planning, and (3) the career visit. Responsibilities of Career Education staff, building principals, teachers, students, advisory councils, and consultants are clearly defined. The history and setting of the project, its scope, selected project activities, a developmental program model for grades K-12, and an evaluation of the program and its future needs are dealt with in detail. A 56-page appendix includes interview worksheets, a career education fact  sheet, professional bibliography, books and instructional materials purchased, and examples of public relations activities.

It was an individualized program utilizing Infra-Code equipment; the primary goal in 12 of the 17 cases was speech production. The remaining five had normal speech and requested auditory training. The bulk of the report consists of individual profile summaries. Also included are the results of audiometric examinations and the subjective evaluations of parents, caseworkers, and students. The audiometric examinations were judged inadequate by professional consultants whose evaluation is included in the document. Accompanying the individual profiles, separate sections detail program objectives, test procedures, and therapy sessions. Sample forms and materials are  included in the appendix.

The study focuses on comparisons of social networks associated with 100 jobs of 31 people who graduated from a training program for data processors. The dual intent of the study was to ascertain differences between the network sets of people who were satisfied or unsatisfied on their jobs and between sets associated with people who had stable and unstable job histories. Detailed statistical analyses accompany the text. The authors did not find expected differences between happily and unhappily employed people. The study also concludes that sets  associated with jobs found by informal contacts are different from those jobs found through institutional contact or personal public knowledge. There were no significant differences between sets for those with &quot;chaotic&quot; job leaps or &quot;orderly&quot; careers.

The use of lap and shoulder belts, the lowering of maximum speed limits, and the decrease in total traffic volumes on streets and highways because of the fuel shortage have all helped reduce traffic accident statistics. Drunken driving, however, still poses a considerable hazard. The relationship between lowered drinking age and driving accidents involving youth has not been positively determined. It is known that young people are involved in more traffic accidents and more fatal accidents than their proportion of the driving  population. The foremost reason for holding this conference is to explore ways young people can be involved and participate in planning and executing local and State safety programs.

The principal objectives of this analysis are to: define the inputs (goods and services) required to provide a given day care program; develop cost factors which can be used to estimate a range of costs for any particular type of day care; analyze the sensitivity of total costs to charges in program quality, size, and location; and reduce uncertainty among government, corporate, and private planners about the cost of adequate child care programs. The findings presented are based on a computer model, DAYCARE, which simulates the operation of a day care program and calculates the total cost under a wide range of assumptions. Two basic conclusions emerge. First,  there is no one cost of day care; second, the cost of day care is highly sensitive to small changes in certain factors and relatively insensitive to changes in others. Included in the document are factors affecting day care costs, case studies, 10 computer outputs, day care program documentation, and the potential economic benefits of industrial day care. (BP)",

It attempted to determine child care practices and preferences of working mothers and to examine the child care-related factors which, in the mother's judgment, affect her job performance. It also analyzed the findings and determined the implications for development of child care services and possible employer actions. Special attention is paid to odd-shift working mothers. More than half of the working mothers in the study were the sole support of their families (52.8 percent) and black  (51.8 percent). On the basis of New York requirements, at least half the working mothers would probably be eligible for public assistance if they were not working.

The concept can be understood most readily by examination of the writings of humanist psychologists such as Carl Rogers, Fritz Perls, Gordon Allport, and Abraham Maslow. Some characteristics or dimensions of an education of and for being-becoming-belonging are: (1) the comprehension of both the affective and the cognitive domains; (2) the complete time dimension of past, present, and future; (3) the acceptance and achievement of living and dying; (4) the incorporation of economic, social, aesthetic, political, and spiritual goals; (5) the occurrence of self-discovery, self-expression, and fulfillment; (6) the acceptance of being of this world  and the possibility of other forms of consciousness; (7) the dialogue, introspection, action, and thought qualities of learning. Being-becoming-belonging comprehends three of the major concepts about education that have been developing in the past two decades: education permanente or lifelong learning with its many points of entry and many renewed episodes; the &quot;learning system&quot; that includes formal and informal activities; and self-directed learners with the increasing capacity to initiate and take charge of their own learning.

The next two chapters are devoted to discussions of study questions and design. Major demographic and social characteristics of WIN participants, such as sex, race, age, residence, marital status, education, welfare status, and employment are described. Chapters 5 and 6 contain an analysis of incentive and disincentive features associated with the personal characteristics and living situations. The following three chapters consider the effects of the requirements to participate in WIN,  the monetary incentive, and other program features (training, job placement). The next two chapters compare the incentive-disincentive responses to one another and identify patterns among the responses. Finally the details of how the WIN program evolved among the study cities is discussed in detail. The WIN interview schedule is included as an appendix and tabulated responses to the questionnaire are used throughout the document as the basis for the discussion. (BP)",

The implications of the findings, which in general matched those of the earlier study, are discussed in detail, and it is suggested that the fact that the laid-off men are already proven workers outweighs their disadvantagement in other areas is of significance.

The three major desired outcomes of the project are: (1) development of a curriculum model for career exploration at the elementary school level, (2) the development of an instructional system to implement the curriculum model, and (3) the evaluation of the instructional system materials and outcomes. The CEC project is involved in achieving career development behaviors at the K-6 levels primarily within the following three domains: (1) concepts of self, (2) economic-occupational and educational concepts and skills, and (3) work values and attitudes. Brief descriptions of the awareness and accommodation stages  follow. A basic characteristic of the CEC project is its relevance on activity-based experiences to achieve desired behavioral outcomes. The CEC developed a Curricular Language which is discussed in detail in Appendix A. The CEC staff then established guidelines in the form of eight principles of career development to be used in elementary career education. Also included is a 34-item bibliography. (BP)",

Some of the conclusions drawn from this study were that students completing a model office course make different decisions as a result of the course, while no such difference was observed for the other types of office training.

The instrument sought the needs and preferences of those most directly involved in carrying out Title III ABE programs: teachers; local, State and regional program directors; staff development directors; and selected professors of adult education. The data obtained from several national surveys utilizing this instrument is presented and analyzed in the document. Highest priority items are identified for all groups of respondents; cross tabulations determine priorities of given subpopulations and the significance of  differences among subpopulations. Sample groups are compared (e.g., State versus local directors), as are the priorities of directors from different regions and program type. Clusters of priorities are determined for certain subgroups, correlation matrices established, and correlated priorities determined for the highest priority items. The analysis was undertaken to suggest special projects that could be designed to meet a number of high priority needs simultaneously. (AJ)",

        "description":"The paper approaches the problems of lack of communication and the development of stereotypes that have grown up between vocational teachers and counselors. Developing a strategy to deal with a portion of the problem, counselors' perceptions of vocational education, a program was conducted during the summer of 1972, placing counselors in skill training programs to increase their reality experiences in vocational education. Three objectives of the study were: (1) to determine the effects of four weeks of skill training experiences in eight occupational areas on the career guidance practices of 15 secondary counselors, (2) for each counselor to develop two measurable job objectives related to vocational counseling to be implemented during the fall semester, and (3) to judge the  practicability of continuing the program. The author points out that the use of paid volunteers limits the validity of the results, and the study should be considered quasi-experimental or as a comparison level study. Results of the study indicated the program should be continued with modifications. Included with the document are the instrument used, the job objectives developed by the 15 participants, and their individual progress reports on job objectives. (MW)",

The primary grades (1-3) career education program taught units on the home, school, neighborhood, community and self-image. In the intermediate grades (4-6) units on the county, State, regions, nations, and the student's self-image all in terms of occupational awareness were studied. The junior high program made indepth studies of Occupational Clusters and all factors involved in job preparation, and in  acquiring and performing jobs. Sample integrated units were included which listed the objectives, suggested activities, audiovisual materials, and resource materials needed for each unit. The curriculum committee also suggests some activities and techniques for integrating career education into the classroom which can be applied to all grade levels. These suggested activities, field trips, and resource people are discussed in detail. The document also lists audiovisual equipment, films, cassettes, filmstrips, games, resource kits, and books that can be made use of in the program. (BP)",

The basic problem was: How is the teaching of reading in Nebraska being carried out? In trying to answer this question the document lays the groundwork by opening with a review of related literature and then discusses in detail the type of data collection used in the survey. Two variables remained constant: the size of the ABE programs and the students enrolled (one group mainly English speaking and a second group who used English as a second language). The data gathered is presented in 28 tables and discussed together with the general findings on reading material used, techniques and methods, medium and equipment, measurement and evaluation of reading progress, comprehension, and  retention. The author concludes that previous 1970-71 findings have been replicated, that a clearinghouse on information is needed, and that there is congruency in procedures and materials used in regard to the size and population of the program.

The possibility exists that two different analysts could reach different conclusions in analyzing an occupation, and thereby provide divergent guidance to management. Two analysts, working independently, performed job typing using CODAP on occupational data collected by a single administration of a job inventory. Each analyst selected the same size sample, at random but without any cases common, from the total survey. The job types identified by each analyst were compared to determine whether they were significantly different in any respect. Superficial differences appeared between the results of the two analyses,  but were largely resolved when job types reported by the first analyst were compared not only on a one-to-one basis with job types reported by the second analyst, but also with combinations of job types reported on the second occasion. The contents of this report are highly technical and will be of primary interest to persons working in the field of occupational analysis, both in terms of content and application of techniques.

Results indicate that nonprior service officer trainees are motivated to some extent by draft pressure. In general, prior service personnel and minority groups express a more favorable attitude toward voluntary military service. An increase in positive attitude is also perceptible after the military pay increase became effective.

Three criteria relate to the necessity and possibility of modification of the materials for usability. An annotated list of the materials is appended; the largest portion of the document is devoted to tables representing the ratings of each set of materials by each set of criteria. A brief summary of the findings reveals that many of the materials were rated as excellent,  although only 15 sets were judged to be organized to fit specifically the intended grade levels. Half the materials needed modification before use, because of ethnic or socioeconomic differences in particular school districts. The teachers reported that 45 sets of materials suggested reasonable classroom activities.

Licensing procedures were analyzed by the Educational Testing Service with reference to the following points: what is licensed and where, who does the licensing, what are the requirements, how is competency tested, what about applicant failure, transfer of certification, minority goup membership, and future expectations. The four occupational areas compared are health occupations, construction trades, service occupations, and transportation occupations. The report comments on the appropriateness and effectiveness of performance tests and written tests. Discrimination in testing procedures and the validity of testing criteria are  considered. The study concludes that the licensing structure must be modified and improved so that it may serve its societal function and provide fair and equitable treatment to those who are licensed. Among the possible modifications suggested by the researchers are improved testing procedures, job analysis, validity studies, language assistance, and procedures for candidates who fail. A reference section is also included. (JC)",

Part three comprises two-thirds of the book, presenting courses guidelines for five business career objectives, personal use skills, basic business and economic education, and cooperative and distributive programs. The final section discusses the business teacher as a professional. No attempt has been made to prescribe a given program; the focus suggests that effective teaching goes beyond curriculum. (AJ)",

The papers describe one approach to relating interests and occupations based on the circular configuration of interests and occupations proposed by John L. Holland. This approach labels occupational categories as: realistic, intellectual, artistic, social, enterprising, and conventional. The papers offered are: (1) An Empirical Occupational Classification Derived from a Theory of Personality and Intended for Practice and Research, (2) An  Analysis of Spatial Configuration, (3) A Spatial Configuration of Occupations, (4) An Analysis of the Structure of Vocational Interests, (5) On Measuring the Vocational Interests of Women, (6) The Vocational Interests of Students in Career-Oriented Educational Programs, and (7) Relating High School Interests to Occupations Five Years After High School.

Recommendations are limited to the study of personal and environmental factors influencing career paths toward the sciences and technology during the educational years. Two primary purposes of the study are: (1) to guide future research and (2) to identify environmental factors which can be manipulated by manpower agencies to influence both the scientific manpower supply and the composition of that supply. The first major section organizes literature related to stimulus or environmental variables. The stimulus variables reviewed are the macro-social systems of: (1) social class, (2) geographic influences, (3) religion, (4)  community, and (5) racial and ethnic background, and the micro-social systems of: (1) the family, (2) peer groups, and (3) the school. A second section discusses response variables including academic ability, aptitudes, academic achievement, interests, personality, and vocational choice. The final section synthesizes the research results, using the educational structure as the basic organizing system, and is divided into three major sections: the early school years, high school years, and collegiate years. Two brief appendixes offer a synthesis model and a survey of work in progress. A 43-page bibliography completes the document. (MW)",

        "description":"Over the past 10 years an effort has been directed toward developing a new conceptual formulation related to the professional development of and functions performed by the adult/extension educator-practitioner. The purpose for such a new formulation is one of providing a more adequate conceptual basis for: (1) designing professional development programs, and (2) viewing the role of practitioner. A greater proportion of scholarly resources in the field of adult education should be deliberately directed toward further development and refinement of existing conceptualizations and the creation and testing of new ones. Such scholarly efforts must be viewed as developmental, employing a different orientation to inquiry than much of what is typically undertaken. There are inherent  difficulties in testing new conceptual formulations. The conceptual formulation explored in this paper to illustrate the above points has been demonstrated in practice to have potential utility to the profession--both as a basis for designing curricula and in conceiving the functioning of the practitioner-professional more adequately. It has not been possible, however, to test this conceptual formulation rigorously against other possibilities. (Author/AJ)",

It is, rather, more like the central thought of a story and is considered a method for planning activity-focused teaching units in which the teacher is the key to successful instruction. Attractively illustrated, the publication explains several concepts important to the organizing center: (1) Planning can be carried out in terms of work to be done, e.g., a bakery involves the work of the baker, the clerk, the entrepreneur, and the wholesale supply salesman; (2) new images of teaching can be developed through the use of the organizing center; and (3) it helps people communicate about the work of teaching.

The advanced booklet ends with a review of the key ideas advanced by ABLE. It contains charts, illustrations, and useable sample forms. ABLE's capsule philosophy for the development of career education is: A &quot;teacher's imagination is the key instrument of instruction,&quot; and this publication stresses that outlook. (NH)",

Observational data, consisting of the verbal behavior of teachers and students in 30 elementary stenography classes, were categorized and analyzed. From this initial analysis, a basic model of teacher-student behavior was defined. Deviations from the basic model were noted as they appeared to cluster around three variables in the classroom environment: teaches, point of time, and type of learning activity. An analysis of the data in terms of these three variables defined profiles of individual teaching style, of a longitudinal pattern that coincided with patterns of skill acquisition, and of contextual behavior patterns for each of the major types of learning activities.

Three experimental conditions were created: (1) occupational prestige manipulated, (2) prestige and age varied, (3) age, race, and prestige varied. One hundred forty nursing students participated. Interaction was scored from videotaped discussions. Some of the findings were that groups in condition two brought more information into the discussion, and their decisions were judged higher in quality. Other data suggest that performance in the other two conditions was inhibited by the occurrence of a status struggle. Also  included are 11 tables and a 14-item bibliography. (Author/BP)",

Rational and irrational occupational decision making models were unsatisfactory in capturing the many dimensions of the decision making/occupational choice process. A model developed by Blau, Gustad, Jessor, Parnes, and Wilcock rests on the thesis that occupational choice involves the interaction of the individual's valuation of the rewards offered by different occupational choices and his assessment of his chances of being able to realize each of the choices. Eight factors were identified as major intermediate determinants of occupational choice and were tested  in three populations through an interview schedule and questionnaire. The pragmatic utility of the Blau model was also investigated through curricular materials for an 11th grade mini-course. Positive comments from participant-users suggested further revision of the materials to achieve a conceptually and pragmatically useful curriculum for improving the process of occupational decision making.

A second and important part of this research was the estimation of the interrelationships of the health manpower education system with the economic and health-care delivery systems. The results varied between inconclusive and  fruitless; in view of the lack of fundamental information on the nature of health manpower education programs, additional research in three target areas is recommended before it can be meaningful to suggest the optimal location of programs.

The primary purpose of the study was to enable office educators to develop relevant instructional programs based on current practices found in the business world. Data were compiled from 132 usable questionnaire responses returned by the randomly selected sample of 250 administrative office managers. Factors studied were: sex, age, number of years in present position, number of subordinates, level of education, major in college, previous work and supervisory experience, and frequency and percentage of response for managerial activities. Characteristics having the greatest influence on the extent to which participative management is being utilized are age and sex of  the administrative office managers. Background factors having significant influence are military experience, military officer experience, other office experience, and number of subordinates. It was also concluded that both managers and office employees need training in developing a participative atmosphere. Implications for business education teachers include the increasing need for preparing students to assume roles in decision making activities and encouraging the utilization of appropriate training materials.

Both the individual dimensions of leadership (psychological) and the group or organizational dimensions of leadership (sociological) must be considered, and also the interaction between the two. Implicit in most leadership research has been the idea that the effective leader is high in both initiating structure (goal achievement) and consideration (group maintenance) behaviors. The vocational teacher of the future must become more competent in organizing and directing the learning environment and in using educational technology, and the teacher must have many of the same leadership skills and  competencies needed by administrators and supervisors. There is considerable evidence to support the idea that the quality of local programs of vocational and technical education is dependent on competent administrative leadership. The Federal leadership role in vocational education over the years has shifted now to the State and local level, and often the new breed of local administrator needs to assume the role of change agent in his schools and communities.

        "description":"It is stated that the United States is experiencing in the agricultural sector two simultaneous surpluses which together are referred to as the &quot;farm problem:&quot; these are surpluses of products and labor. The primary reasons for the labor surplus are relatively rapid adoption of technological innovations, the approximation of a competitive market structure which facilitates a &quot;technological treadmill,&quot; and lack of an explicit manpower policy related to agriculture. Removing the excess labor from farming appears to be the only currently viable solution; other measures aimed at improving the conditions of agricultural labor are short-run and will eventually lead to reduction of the labor force. Whether or not the policy to move manpower out of agriculture is accepted, analysts agree  that there is a need for research which focuses specifically on the agricultural labor force. Occupational mobility studies have served as a useful mechanism through which to perform this research. The paper concludes that two major possibilities exist: conceptual clarification and analysis of the heterogeneous quality of the agricultural labor force. (A six-page bibliography is included.)

        "description":"During the last few years the research enterprise dealing with the status projections of youth, and in particular, the numerous empirical studies focusing on occupational aspirations and expectations, has increasingly come under criticism within the sociological community. The paper acknowledges the criticism directed toward projection research as generally valid and attributes the difficulties to the lack of agreement on an adequate sociological model. The main thrust of the paper is to construct a cumulative model of the selection process that is both a reaction to, and product of, some of the more obvious weaknesses in projection research. This cumulative model incorporates a restructured concept of &quot;occupational choice&quot; in the form of a six component typology of occupational  orientation identified as: specific (+) versus diffused (-), desirable (+) versus undesirable (-), anticipated (+) versus unanticipated (-), realistic (+) versus unrealistic (-), high motivation (+) versus low motivation (-), and adequacy (+) versus inadequacy (-). Developmental patterns along with differing configurations of orientations are viewed as key variables for analysis. The paper concludes with questions for future research and a bibliography.

A critical report of the implementation of the pilot project in Mali, it contains a description of the events, in their actual sequence, and an assessment of what was achieved under the project and of the way in which the activities were planned and executed. An evaluation of the project was undertaken based on three surveys--before, during, and after the project--collecting data in four categories: (1) educational, (2) psychological, (3) socioeconomic, and, most importantly, (4) economic. Significant results of the project  were: (1) the establishment of functional literacy centers, (2) the strengthening of Malian functional literacy services, (3) increased popular support of literacy training, (4) evidence that education can be geared to development, and (5) the renewal of cultural life through literacy activities. Of interest to development specialists, educators, and Africanists, the report concludes that functional literacy teaching provides the Malian authorities with a practical method for training the illiterate in rural and urban areas, and so promoting the economic, social, and cultural development of the country.

The second chapter is devoted to the problems of functional literacy training and the fuller utilization of human resources, defining the frame of reference for educational action and the noneducational conditions which govern it. Chapter 3 discusses the purely educational level of integration and the development of  a methodology with tables, illustrating programs, training sequences, and teaching materials. Chapter 4 deals with the confrontation between the old and the new, and the development of an evaluation program. The final chapter raises questions related to future developments, the concept of life-long adult education, and the international consequences of the Iranian experiment.

In addition, the study sought to determine the manner in which community setting influences awareness of 4-H, enrollment and involvement in, and attrition from 4-H. The 889 young people who filled out the questionnaires were either current 4-H members, former 4-H members or nonmembers of 4-H from three Pennsylvania counties. The major portion of each group of youth perceived 4-H in a positive light. The majority of former 4-H members feel that they did not leave 4-H, but rather 4-H left them. While there was little in the way of negative perceptions of 4-H, those expressed centered around the  emphasis on competition and recordkeeping. Youth from large urban areas and those from more isolated rural areas receive least in the way of 4-H programing opportunities. Some of the findings indicated problems in the areas of assistance with personal problem resolutions and concerns relating to educational, vocational, social, and psychological futures.

        "description":"Public Service Employment slots can be developed in three ways: (1) by establishing a pool of jobs into which trainees can be placed; (2) by developing individualized slots for each trainee; (3) by combining the pool and individualized approaches. In terms of administrative and cost efficiency, there is little difference between the pool and the individualized approach. The pool approach has several drawbacks from the employer's standpoint: some slots may be unfilled for long periods of time; some slots may be negotiated with the business manager, leaving the supervisor somewhat in the dark until the trainees are on the job and ready for his supervision. In terms of client outcomes, those in individualized slots are more likely to complete training, but there is no significant  difference between the two groups in the rate of permanent placement. The best method of slot development is probably &quot;individualized placement&quot; within a pool of slots. (Included also are a list of tables and illustrations.) (Author)",

        "description":"In a Public Service Employment program of subsidized work training, nonprofit employers in the areas of health, education, social services, and government can be evaluated in terms of the client's employability growth, wages, supervision, retention, transferability, and client satisfaction. Client employability increases in all four areas of employment, though slowly for classroom and day care aides. Wage levels are in the $2.00 to $2.40 range; they are highest for municipal employees, lowest for paraprofessional aides, with clericals in the middle. Clients seem generally satisfied with their jobs and with the supervision in all four areas. Retention is especially high in health, higher education, and government owing to large payroll, high turnover, wide job variety, reliable  budgeting, and favorable employer attitude toward the program. Retention is low for classroom and day care aides because there are few openings and little turnover. A tight job market restricts transferability.

The work experience is valuable for the trainees. However, the actual structure of their training needs close attention. Supervisors are likely to rate the effectiveness of on-the-job training highly, while trainees give at least equal credit to the &quot;common sense&quot; which they bring with them to the job. Also, there may be little consistency in the training experience of different trainees. One answer to this problem is for employers to be more flexible in accepting the practical experience and &quot;common sense&quot; of the trainees as a substitute for more formal requirements, while at the same time formalizing the necessary on-the-job  training into a regular curriculum. Transferability and placement prospects for trainees in paraprofessional slots are limited, especially in view of the tight job market. (Also included is a 22-item bibliography and a list of tables.)

The first was a Special Work Project (SWP) directed toward providing work experience rather than skill training for welfare recipients, and also for low-income families. A second approach was through the Public Employment Program (PEP). This latter program was created to subsidize jobs for the temporarily unemployed when the general U. S. economy could not absorb these people. Eligibility and wage subsidization for each program differed. The SWP program was oriented toward the working poor and those with multiple nonjob related personal problems. Participants in PEP were usually the recently unemployed. Each program could underwrite up to 90 percent of the client's salary.  Subsidized wages paid for each PEP slot averaged $7,000 annually, while $4,000 was spent under SWP.

The paraprofessional coach, or &quot;employment service aide,&quot; acts as a client advocate who helps the client adjust to a work environment. As one part of a three member employability team, the coach's duties begin after the client has been accepted for placement in a Special Work training situation. Constant communication is maintained until the client's barriers to employability are overcome. Responsibilities of the coach vary from acquainting the program enrollee with simulated interviews, to helping resolve family friction which may hinder the individual's effectiveness. Described here is a case study of one man who was helped to overcome  physical and emotional handicaps so he might qualify for a desired job.

A study of 279 Aid to Needy Families with Children (ANFC) recipients was conducted to address this question. The median annual dollar value of tax-free welfare payments in Vermont was $4,075. When added with Medicaid and food stamp bonuses, this is equivalent to $4,465 taxable income for the family unit here. Given the median $2.26 hourly wage realized by program enrollees, male ANFC clients experienced an economic disincentive to work. Females improved their welfare status modestly when allowed certain income disregards. Real income rose sharply for the study group only  during Special Work training. When a graduated welfare support schedule was combined with a subsidized wage program, per capita income rose to $6,793. Otherwise, there was no real financial incentive to leave the welfare status.

Clients were placed in subsidized employment for 6 months, with the exceptation that their work experience would lead to permanent, nonsubsidized employment.

        "description":"This paper attempts to provide initial perspectives on guidelines for the preparation of counselors in dealing with client problems as they relate to death. Four elements of a training program are presented: (1) sensitizing counselors and prospective counselors to the topic of death and its potential importance; (2) helping those same people investigate available clinical research and popular information about death; (3) promoting the exploration of their own experiences, emotions, and opinions about death; and (4) having them provide actual services to clients for whom death is a possible concern. In addition to the preparation of counselors for direct service to clients, the writer also relates a number of issues which could benefit from investigation, including the frequency  with which counselors come in contact with death-related problems, the attitudes and opinions of counselors about death-related issues, and the experiences with death of students who are interested in serving in particular work settings.

        "description":"This study investigates the social interaction between foreign students and American students. Data were collected through interviews with foreign students and two roughly equivalent forms of a questionnaire; one designed for foreign students and the other for American students. Analysis of the data shows that although social contacts between the two groups are infrequent and superficial, these contacts are viewed positively by both groups. Most of the contacts take place within the classroom and, contrary to general belief, language is not perceived as a barrier to communication. Ninety-five percent of the American students believe that the presence of foreign students on campus contributes to their general education. Conclusions and recommendations from this study are: (1)  international students represent a valuable potential resource for psychological education programs with an emphasis on intercultural, international dimensions; (2) informal contacts between American students and international students are somewhat limited, with both groups desiring more contacts with each other; and (3) counselors and other personnel workers with an interest in personal and social development of students should devise programs that actively involve foreign students in extracurricular activities with American students.

        "description":"The purpose of this project was to assess the degree to which the most popular method of calculating reliability of interval data, the I-I method, served the author's scientific purposes. Data were collected and analyses performed to assess the adequacy of I-I reliability scores in serving three functions: (1) as an index of how precise, clear, objective and complete the definition is; (2) as an index of how competently the observer is recording; and (3) as an index of the believability of the experimental effect reported. Findings from the study indicate gross unreliability of I-I scores as an index of definition adequacy, observer competence or believability of experimental effects. This unreliability is attributed to the fact that I-I scores are highly subject to influence by  the rate or duration of the behavior being recorded. Conclusions by the authors stress that, because the I-I reliability scores are clearly inadequate, it is likely that a significant body of applied behavior analysis has seriously misrepresented the relationships between certain environmental factors and certain significant human behaviors.

These focuses were: (1) the curriculum, i.e., individualizing instructional materials; (2) personalizing classroom interactions; and (3) personalizing classroom interactions through classroom videotapings. The productivity of the teacher group consultations was measured by changes in the degree of likeability among the children, i.e., their Peer Acceptance scores. Significant gains were observed in the Peer Acceptance scores of those children whose teachers participated in group consultations focusing on personalizing classroom interactions both in the presence and the absence of classroom videotapings. Similar findings were not observed for  those children whose teachers participated in group consultations focusing on individualizing instructional materials. The results of the study suggested that more benefits accrue to children when counselors provide teachers with opportunities to personalize their classroom interactions than when teachers have opportunities to individualize their instructional materials. The findings also indicated that elementary school counselors who provide systematically organized group consultations with teachers can make a positive impact on the learning environment of children.

Eleven hospital chaplains collected data by interviewing dying patients. Results indicate that emotional adjustment to the awareness of a limited life expectancy was not related principally to religious orientation, although this was an important factor. Emotional adjustment was influenced more by the patient's physical condition (level of discomfort), by previous experiences with dying persons, and by interpersonal relationships. The most important aspect of the religious variable was the quality of religious orientation rather than mere religious affiliation or verbal acceptance of religious beliefs. (Author)",

Under Bill 2848, funds would be allocated for comprehensive demonstration programs in school-communities which would focus on the causes of abuse rather than the symptoms. Money under this bill would also be available for creative primary prevention and early intervention programs utilizing an interdisciplinary 'school team approach.'

The selection of study individuals was conducted, first by random sampling of all adults who enrolled and sequentially participated in the General Educational Development Test in the Hickman High School Adult Basic Education program, Columbia, Missouri. This random sample was then stratified into four different groups according  to success and sex. The study analyzes the relationship of socio-economic status and self concept to success and sex in Adult Basic Education. The two instruments used were the National Opinion Research Center Socio-economic Scale and the Tennessee Self Concept Scale. Multiple discriminant analysis, intercorrelation among the different variables, and one way analysis of variance were used to analyze the data so that those variables which indicate academic success may serve to help in the preparation of teachers whose task is to teach adults.

        "description":"This paper focuses on two issues related to changing attitudes toward the female sex role among college students. First longitudinal analyses are presented in an attempt to document the fact that sex role attitude change has occurred during the past decade of student activism. A five-item scale of attitudes toward the female role used in 1961 by Kenneth Kammeyer was administered in 1973 to 1,096 undergraduates at a large state university. Comparisons of responses by single women in these two studies provide evidence for a dramatic shift from \"traditional\" to \"modern\" attitudes toward the female role in recent years. Second, cross-sectional analyses of the 1973 data attempt directly to relate this \"modernization\" of sex role attitudes to the impact of student activism. Female and  male respondents are both increasingly likely to hold \"modern\" attitudes toward the female sex role as their reported level of past participation in student protest activities increases. However, the relationship between protest participation and sex role attitudes is significantly stronger among women than among men. Women in the highest category of protest participation overwhelmingly reject \"traditional\" attitudes toward the female role. These findings are highly consistent with previous discussions of the special impact of feminist activism on the attitudes of college women during the late 1960's and early 1970's. (Author)",

Three intact families with completely different life styles, all chronically malfunctioning, and with previously unsuccessful treatment were chosen at random from the Clinic intake. The most striking feature of this group was each member's total isolation, both within the family unit and outside. The expectation in placing these very sick families in an MFTG was to crystallize within the group process the inherent pathology contained in each family system, thereby helping individuals and/or families to move towards appropriate, motivated treatment. Not only were initial goals realized with most of the group members, but an  important further social dimension became apparent. As a direct result of the group experience, color, cultural and age boundaries were crossed, allowing the common humanity in each individual to emerge. As the social isolation broke down, concurrently so did the individual isolation.

The growth and progress of WATCH (Women Attentive to Children's Happiness), an organization of family day care mothers, is discussed from the point of view of the professional supports necessary to build leadership into the group. These mothers organized into groups in order to meet their own needs, to improve their image in the community and to provide an arena for them to exchange practical solutions to common and unique problems. By making an invisible network of women who  informally care for children visible to themselves and their community, it becomes possible for the group to deal with issues relevant to developmental care.

        "description":"This compilation of papers, presented at the 1974 Summer Workshop in Guidance and Counseling at the University of Wisconsin, Madison represents a variety of approaches related to individual counseling and supporting strategies. Farwell provides a rationale for the primacy of the individual counseling function within the total counseling and guidance program. Eherenman's approach to the interpretation of school records to children highlights one way in which the \"integration\" goal of Farwell may be achieved. Hosford, writing from the perspective of behaviorism, links the behavioral philosophy and method to the goals of self-development. On a more practical level, the papers by Dilley and Thompson outline intervention strategies which may be used individually or in groups to  facilitate affective development both within the counseling function and the broader educational context. Wolleat argues for greater concern on the part of school counselors for the unique needs of girls and women. Where we are now with the conceptualization and methodology of counseling as described by the former authors may not be where we will be in the future. Pulvino's article provides a glimpse of the future as he examines the implications for counselors of a number of discoveries related to levels of consciousness and psychic energy. (Author/HMV)",

Small groups of students met for 15 weeks with a counselor who adapted the &quot;Deciding&quot; program (College Entrance Examination Board) as the decision-making paradigm. Coppersmith's Self-Esteem Index and Behavior Rating Forms and Gordon's Survey of Interpersonal Values were administered before and after the program to determine if there were any changes in the behavior of students as revealed through self-esteem, value changes, and behavior ratings. Results of the tests indicated almost no significant changes, which was viewed as a result of deficiencies in the instruments themselves. Some measurable changes, however, did occur following the program, and  included: (1) a decrease in the number of times the students were removed from class; (2) significantly improved grades; and (3) increased self-worth and self-esteem feelings, as self-reported via tape recordings.

By using workshops, large and small interactions with a consultant, and individual consultations, the entire teaching staff has been reached. Extra funds and as much direct contact between supervisory staff and teaching staff as possible also support the change to individualized reading programs. Teacher input is actively sought in both formal and informal meetings. Teaching staff interactions are encouraged through the establishment of a teacher center which stocks equipment and resources and is operated by the teachers themselves. The direction of change toward  individualization in the reading program was set by the administrative staff, and teachers are encouraged but not forced to follow the lead. Within the Carleton schools, this method of staff development and change utilization is working. (TO)",

Five experiments were conducted to establish a developmental trend for ability to use imagery-related mediation in whole passage learning. Observations indicate that six year olds are inhibited in paraphrase recall of heard prose when they are asked to illustrate the passages with cut-out figures, but that nine year olds show no imagery effect. After an extensive training session, nine year olds show a positive effect. Adults show a spontaneous positive effect. The results do not appear to require imaginal-visual-spatial explanations. Information gathered in observations suggests the hypothesis that differential attention to and structuring of  working-memory content imagery instructions facilitate prose learning. Further research involves various experiments designed to test this hypothesis. (Author/JM)",

A large number of common words can be elicited from children in a word-association game, to which children respond with words that are highly meaningful to them, and often to their culture. The children then use these words to create sentences. Every associative response is greeted by the teacher with a verbal reward, maintaining interest and enthusiasm. Learning takes place because (1) following a cognitive model, reinforcement of the child's own creation produces high interest and attention and builds a sense of competency; (2) a large number of readily available associations strengthens meaningfulness, thus aiding recognition and enhancing comprehension; and  (3) the recognition of a word increases the chances of recognition of its associates. The difficult function words, low in meaningfulness, are taught as connecting words, embedded in meaningful phrases created by the children. In pilot studies, children have read fluently words and sentences they created weeks earlier. (Author/TO)",

Therefore, it is the responsibility of the school to develop a positive attitude in all students toward work and to foster the idea that all work is honorable. In Anne Arundel County, Maryland, the process of internalizing the objectives of career education as part of the total school program can be described in four distinct phases. The first step in this infusion process is the realization that content is the basic building block of the instructional unit. Educators are asked to be more precise concerning the ideas and skills which make up the content and to focus their attention on the essentials of good reading and language arts and other content  programs. The second phase of the infusion process requires an analysis of the concepts and objectives of career education in terms of their relevancies to the educational philosophy of the school system and their applicability to each particular area of instruction. Phase 3 asks teachers to construct the specific behavioral objectives to achieve the integration of content with career education.

        "description":"The relationship between the reflection-impulsivity dimension, a dimension of cognitive style, and selected aspects of oral reading behavior was investigated in this study. Fifteen impulsive and fifteen reflective average readers were selected from a population of 109 second graders. Measures of intelligence and reading comprehension were obtained, followed by reading and taping a story from a basal reader, thus providing a sample of oral reading behavior. Comparisons of the two groups were then made with respect to miscue frequency, semantic acceptability of miscues, hesitation and repetition frequency, and self-correction of miscues. Analyses of the data revealed significant relationships between measures of the reflection-impulsivity dimension and repetition frequency and  self-correction behavior among the subjects. No significant differences were found with regard to the other variables. The findings suggest additional directions for investigating the role of cognition in the reading process. (Author/TO)",

The training program is competency based. Some of the competency tasks require interns to become acquainted with various academic aids and catalogs available at the LAC; to understand the relationship of these aids to the LASS tutorial program; to participate in a county fair which is designed to orient  potential users to LASS programs and equipment by doing; to familiarize themselves with all the hardware and software in the LAC; to take an audio tour of the university library; to assume responsibilities of a LAC aide, which include such tasks as opening and closing the center, familiarizing themselves with the LASS referral system, and attending two or more weekly staff meetings.

These children need mentally superior teachers whose ingenuity and imagination enable them to suggest stimulating activities, provide children with a feeling of enterprise and optimism, and nurture children's development. The gifted child also needs early identification so that he may be teamed with other bright children or be given individualized reading materials, and he must be allowed to progress at his own pace. Various classroom learning activities which enrich the gifted program include building a list of unusual words which can be discussed and used, playing Scrabble, creating crossword puzzles, writing an imaginary diary, conducting spontaneous discussions,  recording a humorous short story, planning an advertising tape, and doing research. Special art and music activity centers in the classroom may provide additional learning stimulants. It is most important that the teacher always be receptive to the gifted child's expressions of ideas and suggestions. (JM)",

It was concluded that pseudo-empirical is a correct description of Dolch's method in compiling his basic sight vocabulary.

        "description":"As a follow-up to an original study reported by Hershberger (1963), the present study assessed the instructional effectiveness of typographical cueing in both conventional and programed texts as a function of reading ability, reading instructions, and cueing complexity. A total of 118 eighth graders were divided into eight groups. Each group read a lesson on the history of Texas and was tested a week before the lesson and again the day after the lesson. Each group read a different form of the lesson with four groups reading programed versions and four reading conventional, non-quizzed versions. From each of these sets of four, one group read lesson booklets incorporating complex typographical cueing, another read booklets incorporating simple typographical cueing, and a third  group (control) read booklets without typographical cueing. The fourth group from each set read lesson booklets incorporating complex typographical cueing, but, unlike the other cued books, these did not include a detailed explanation of the purpose or use of typographical cueing. The major findings were: the programed, or quizzed, versions of the text were more effective; self-evaluational test items facilitated the learning of essential core content; and the effects of typographical cueing and self-evaluating quizzing are independent and additive.

Authorities have accepted cloze tests as valid and reliable instruments capable of measuring general comprehension skills. Agreement now exists as to the accepted methodology of cloze test construction. A deletion system of every fifth word with standardized blank length has been accepted, although recent studies have submitted that blank length is not crucial to the construction of cloze tests. Three studies indicated the suitability of the cloze procedure as a method of determining the instructional levels of  elementary school pupils. In reviewing the literature, many research weaknesses become apparent. Many researchers failed to mention the procedures which were employed in cloze test construction. Deletion system and scoring procedures are often described inadequately. More needs to be known about the construct validity of cloze tests. Several affective components operating during the completion of a cloze test also need to be investigated. (WR)",

Increasingly the cloze procedure has come to be used in preference to multiple-choice questions. Other readability scales have been based on previously scaled passages, on carefully graded books, and on the combined judgments of a group of experts. Two variables have consistently stood out as providing the best combination in the measurement of readability. The first is the difficulty of the vocabulary used, which is usually measured by finding the percentage of words that do not appear in a specific list of common, easy words. Spelling patterns as indices of vocabulary difficulty have just begun to be explored and seem  promising. The second widely used variable is average sentence length, which seems to represent the many specific reasons why beginnings have been made in the automatic computer scoring of complicated linguistic variables such as syntactic depth and density. The specific factors that make some reading material hard to understand, such as vagueness, ambiguity, and lack of explicitness, are areas in which more research is needed. (WR)",

The objectives called for development of a diagnostic test especially suited to the needs of rural mountain children to be used by teachers as an aid to grouping pupils for reading instruction. The lexical cloze technique was applied to selection judged representative of the language and experiences of children in grades 1 through 12. Pupils participating in a longitudinal evaluation of the effectiveness of other Title III teaching techniques at two demonstration schools were administered Language Experience Approach (LEA) cloze tests in March 1973, and again in March 1974. Raw scores on  the locally-made instrument were compared with those of the same pupils on reading related subtests of the Stanford Achievement Test, given in 1973. It was concluded that the LEA instrument had potential as a quickly administered, easily scored test of comprehension--based on the pupils' own idioms and experiences--for use by teachers in forming instructional groups.

The college campus is the whole county and the LSC is offered in more than one location in the county. The disadvantages of the scattered-campus LSC include complicated decentralized record-keeping, the necessity of duplicated services and personnel, and the complexities of supervising and coordinating operations at several locations. However, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. The public supports and appreciates services brought close to them. The duplication of services means the student has an opportunity to be exposed to different personalities and methods of teaching. The public benefits from the need to hire extra paraprofessionals in the various centers. Graduate  credit given by a nearby state university for tutoring in the program provides an opportunity for practical experience in adult education. The variety of teaching guarantees flexibility and creativity. Holding classes in buildings other than school buildings often has a beneficial effect for students with negative feelings toward school systems. Finally, the teachers and administrators in a college without a campus feel a great deal of responsibility for the success of the students and the system. (TO)",

The Picture-Vocabulary-Story (PVS) medium is designed to provide students with suitable experiences, knowledge of vocabulary, comprehension of what they are doing, and the ability to synthesize. The construction of a lesson includes: (1) selecting a picture that tells a story, (2) identifying a list of words related to the picture, (3) mounting the picture on a piece of cardboard, (4) dividing the back of the picture into equal-size rectangles, (5) printing the vocabulary words in the rectangles, (6) dividing the right side of a file folder into the same number of rectangles as the  back of the picture, (7) printing the vocabulary from the back of the picture onto the file folder in the same sequence, and (8) cutting the picture into the same number of rectangles that appear on the back. The pupil then uses the PVS by matching the vocabulary cards by placing them on the file folder, closing the file folder and flipping it over, opening the folder with picture on the left and vocabulary on the right, studying the picture and vocabulary, and writing his own story using the picture and vocabulary words.

It aims to facilitate education of all students so they may appropriately choose and prepare not only for their life's work but for all aspects of living. Since career education emphasizes the importance of developing vocational and intellectual skills, and, as such, pervades all subject areas, the need for good reading skills is axiomatic. The necessary reading skills, even at lower-level job entry, include more than decoding or word attack skills.

The microcounseling training model is based on five essential propositions: that it is possible to lessen the complexity of the counseling or interviewing process through focusing on single skills; that the microcounseling training model provides important opportunities for self-observation and confrontation; that interviewers can learn from observing video models demonstrating the skills they are attempting to develop; that model training can be used to teach interviewing skills from a diverse and practical perspective; and that microcounseling training sessions are real interviewing sessions. The twelve basic  microcounseling skills around which the reading instructor or trainee would focus his initial training in interviewing are: attending behavior, open invitation to talk, minimal encouragement to talk, reflection of feeling, paraphrasing, summarization of feeling, summarization of content, learning client's attitudes toward tests, expression of feeling, sharing behavior, direct mutual communication, and interpretation.

Specific predictions were based on the theoretical consideration that requirements of different modes of instructional content were sufficiently different to produce different ability-performance relationships. Seven passages of about 225 words each were selected from science instructional materials containing both test and diagrams. Four questions were written for each passage, two asking for information from the text and two asking for information from the diagrams. One hundred eighty-five high school students were randomly assigned to one of six treatment groups in  a three (text, diagram, or no inserted questions) by two (highlighting or no highlighting) factorial design. Subjects who highlighted were instructed to mark important information with felt-tip marker. The results indicated that answering inserted questions facilitated acquisition of information from diagrams while answering diagram questions had a lesser effect on acquisition of information from the text and that highlighting seems to inhibit performance on relevant posttest questions.

The model is based on data gathered from pronunciation errors of words presented in isolation. An analysis of the errors reveals that different kinds of errors are made by children at different ability levels. Less able readers make errors that reflect reliance on a decoding strategy that assumes an invariant letter-to-one-sound language structure. More able readers make errors that connote use of a strategy in which letter clusters are decoded instead of single letters and letter-sound invariance is not assumed to exist.

The development of personal working definitions of reading by each student after sufficient research and interaction and the application of the definition to actual reading instruction are involved. Interaction based on the Goodman Model of Reading focuses analysis and development of instructional programs on the systems available to readers: the graphophonic, syntactic, and semantic. Analysis of children's language from the perspective  of development and dialect features is related to actual reading instruction. Addition of this basic knowledge to accepted content dealing with basic reading skills--phonics, word processing, comprehension, and study skills--and their acquisition, materials evaluation, and various approaches used in teaching reading, prepares reading teachers who not only know what to teach and how to teach it, but also why they are doing it and when it is appropriate to do so.

Once the reading objectives were formulated, they became the framework within which the reading exercises were developed. The majority of the exercises were in a multiple-choice format; some exercises required the correspondent to supply his own response. In summarizing the data, a group's overall performance relative to the national level  on sets of exercises is described. Tables summarizing the data by age, group, sex, objective, and exercise set conclude the report. (TO) Primary type of information provided by report: Results (Technical Summary).",

In the first five experiments, organization of simple prose materials is varied. Effects upon both accuracy and order of recall are discussed in terms of retrieval strategies determined by organization. The fourth and fifth experiments consider transfer effects in prose learning as a function of organization. The sixth experiment considers how the context of the prose passage influences retention of sentences embedded within it. The remaining four experiments consider the retrieval of the simplest type of proposition: \"Response j is paired with stimulus i.\" Using time to recall the response, several alternative theories of retrieval were tested. Good fits  were obtained employing a mathematical model of a strength theory. (Author)",

This study was a more systematic attempt to replicate the findings of the pilot study and a test of the formulation that reading is more than the decoding of visual material. Sixteen good and sixteen poor seventh grade readers were given comprehensive questions taken from a standard reading test under four conditions: graphic form/story and questions, graphic form/questions only, auditory form/story and questions, and auditory form/questions only. It was  hypothesized that under the questions only condition and the stories and questions condition, good readers would score higher than poor readers on both modes of presentation; And, although poor readers may score better on the auditory presentation than on the graphic, their performance would still be lower than that of the good readers. The data show that, while the groups did differ for the most part as predicted, good readers scored lowest for the graphic form/questions only condition. The implications of these findings are discussed. (TO)",

The sign test for significant differences was applied in an inter-book comparison of readability levels of each of the nine samples across the three collections. The interquartile range was calculated for each of the nine, 100-word samples taken from the twenty-four textbooks. The findings indicated that readability levels of textbooks for culturally disadvantaged students were significantly lower than readability levels of  textbooks for slow and average students in grades one, two, and three; for slow and average students were significantly higher than textbooks adopted for fast students in grades one, two and three; and for fifth grade culturally disadvantaged and slow students were significantly lower than the readability level of the textbook adopted for the fast students.

To create such an environment, the teacher should use the humanistic approach, becoming aware of how children feel about what they learn and accepting the dialect as these learners read, write, and express ideas orally. The teacher should also teach reading in such a way that students can make errors without fear of causing the teacher to \"explode,\" and should help children feel good about themselves by knowing what to say to them when they make errors.

        "description":"This paper reports on the results of several experiments concerned with instructions to forget certain information and to remember other information presented in the context of a variety of laboratory tasks of short-term memory. Assessment of the retention of remember material indicated that it varies directly with the degree to which clear cognitive differentiation of forget and remember material is permitted and the extent to which one is able to devote all rehearsal activity to remember material. These mechanisms of differential grouping and differential rehearsal were also implicated by the observation that information one is directed to forget is not expunged from memory but is still largely available in storage. The effects of these two processes permit the later operation  of a third directed forgetting mechanism, selective search (focusing at retrieval time on the to-be-remembered information). The results of various studies of non-intentional forgetting are also reported. The significant conclusions which they suggest include: tip-of-the-tongue states are relatively transient, the temporal dating of to-be-remembered events may not be important to their retrieval, and selective rehearsal may be at the root of a number of situations in which short-term memory is facilitated.

        "description":"In learning the skills of reading and writing, it seems most probable that the child has to become aware of certain aspects of spoken language which he has not previously perceived. Although the child is capable of saying and hearing words and can easily tell them apart from other words, to spell them phonically he must understand the concept of phoneme and the way in which phonemes follow one another in a special order of time. It is concepts like these--word and phoneme--which seem to be essential to the child's thinking about the tasks of learning how to read and how to write. A fair amount of evidence has accumulated to show that the problem of learning to read lies in this development of cognitive clarity. Research studies suggest that there are specific concepts of language  which are important in learning how to read, including the concepts of word, phoneme, sentence, reading, writing, letter, and so on. The key to effective concept learning is the provision of experiences which stir the child's curiosity, and provide sufficient reliable information for discovery of the concept. (WR)",

A first effort in developing specific psychological examination procedures within an overall plan of psychological assessments was directed toward developing a test that could be used in assessing level of development in verbal ability. The result was the Basic Word Vocabulary Test, which was developed to provide a measurement instrument of word knowledge acquisition with two additional properties that are not extant in any other standardized  vocabulary test (1) a carefully specified population of words with (2) a range of application from about the third level of literacy to the highest level of word knowledge acquisition.

They must be able to explain the appropriateness of standard English usage in certain situations, while they still maintain respect for the students' language. Urban black speech is not a separate dialect from standard English but it is a functional variety of American English, characterized by ellipsis, jargon, and slang. This is demonstrated in the way educated blacks shift from Black English to formal English. Joos, the author of \"Five Clocks,\" defines urban black speech as the sixth clock, a variety of English between casual and intimate speech with the features of both. He  believes that everyone uses several functional varieties of English. Some of these styles are: the frozen style, which is used for print in legal documents or in briefs before the Supreme Court; the formal style, which is usually used in lectures and is the style most English composition teachers require; the casual style, which is the speech used with friends and acquaintances; and the intimate style, which is used in intimate conversation with close friends or lovers.

The drop in college enrollments combined with the increased costs of publishing and the amount of educational materials flooding the market in an unstructured manner are reducing profits. These reduced profits will result in decreases both in funding of research and development projects and in assistance to teachers in the form of option guides, instructional manuals, and other teaching aids. Aside from the economic factors, the greatest challenge confronting publishers at the college level lies in keeping up with the changing needs. Efforts to solve these and other problems are being made through  extensive pre- and post-contractual reviewing, assessing manuscripts to determine reading levels, field testing, and the development of a variety of supplementary and supportive teaching aids.

In the H.E.P. classroom, groups of students are involved with various sets of materials, while the teacher is free to circulate, giving guidance wherever necessary.

There is no adequate theory to allow for a thorough comparison of dialects, and educators feel that English orthography is either phonetic or phonemic, instead of recognizing that spelling represents a level of phonology in which each morpheme is assigned an abstract phonological representation. Spelling is uniquely related to standard American pronunciation and departure is an interference. However, the word\"bidialectal\" will sell these textbooks. (SW)",

In addition, linguistic research has resulted in two competing theories about teaching standard English: that teaching standard English to a dialect speaking child enables him to succeed in activities dominated by the white middle class (bidialectalism), and that such insistence on the teaching of standard English is racist. This dilemma indicates the real problem to be ethnocentrism, not racism, which is merely a subcategory of ethnocentrism. The vicious cycle of an ethnocentric society may be broken both through the growing awareness that not only is black beautiful  but all ethnic groups are beautiful, and through a learning of the standard form of the language of America.

A behavioral definition of listening is \"the act of hearing sound sequences or patterns, purposefully directing attention to these, and actively applying appropriate cognitive skills  which result in the listener's obtaining meanings, forming concepts, interpreting data, and predicting outcomes from these patterns.\" To be effective, instruction in listening must be on three levels--sensory, perceptual, and cognitive.

The responsibility for effecting this objective falls on the shoulders of those educators in composition and communication. Currently, students express themselves in terms of what the teacher expects them to say or in terms of the fashionable orthodoxy acquired through the mass media. Instead, teachers should ask students to write about those things which they have never heard discussed and for which there are no preprogrammed expressions.

Four recommendations for insuring the realization of education in CBTE are the encouragement of the individual differences of student teachers, the retention of open-ended competency requirements, the creation of the connection between theory and practice, and the development of evaluation tasks which require transfer of learning and which assess teacher and student originated objectives.

Since all writing depends on the full resources of the imagination, students need to be taught how to recreate or vivify people, objects, scenes, and feelings. A process which helps students learn to do this, TOTCOM, involves thinking, observing, and composing. Associative thinking provides students with ideas on which to focus in their writing. Another aid for students is the close observation of all their sensory perceptions, while a third is training in the importance of detail--close scrutiny of one small portion of very common things. After thinking, observing, and training, students may proceed to composing,  beginning with simple basic structures and continuing on to longer pieces. This training and composing may then be used in aesthetic writings, such as limericks, lyrics, ballads, or fold songs. (JM)",

A two by three analysis of covariance (covarying for pretest) was computed on each of the subtests of the SRS, WADT, and ITPA.

However, t-tests for correlated means indicated that irrespective of instruction, sex, or  background the children showed improvement from pretest to posttest on almost all of the subtests of the SRS, WADT, and ITPA.

The journal is never evaluated by the instructor unless the student specifically requests it, but it is used later in writing the essays. The instructor works closely with the student during the initial stage to help him decide on a thesis statement that he can develop with specific examples and evidence. To avoid spending too much time in pointing out mechanical errors in the final draft, the teacher calls attention to these problems during the early writing stages. Style is more important in  the final writing. The student submits the final draft along with a cassette tape to enable the instructor to record his reaction to the essay. (SW)",

Second, \"teachers\" become \"learning facilitators,\" so that instead of thinking about what he wants to teach, the teacher focuses on the child's learning. Third, the child's approach is always the starting point. Every activity is planned to begin at the point where the child is when he is ready for it. Fourth, the educated life is for here and now; we can never be certain that tomorrow will come for any of our students. Therefore, we must be accountable to them each day of their lives in our schools and classrooms. The problem with implementing open education in American  schools is that American educators try to do in three months what it took the British a twenty-five or thirty year period to do. Open education is a philosophy, not a facility. Attention should be turned away from the naive concept of open space buildings and toward how to implement the philosophy and principles of open education. (SW)",

Data for this investigation was collected from 246 undergraduates enrolled in 18 sections of the basic speech course at the University of Oklahoma in the fall of 1973. A close inspection of the two scales revealed that Mach IVis the more precise of the two scales, and it was recommended that the Mach V scale should be avoided until scoring and other measurement difficulties are resolved. It was also suggested that a shortened form of the Mach IV be used. It was concluded that since the use of summed  raw scores per factor did not differ significantly from factor scores, the 4-factor, 13-item Mach IV scale using the raw score method is the most practical and best measure of Machiavellianism available at the present time.

Camera angle and image size were manipulated in eight video taped television newscasts which were subsequently presented to eight sections of an introductory communications course at Illinois State University as taped auditions for the position of student newscaster on a campus newspaper. The students were asked to evaluate the tapes. The findings of this study suggest that televised newscasters would enhance their credibility and perceived task attraction if the preponderant shot (that shot which appears in each treatment the majority of the time) is of a higher  angle than its corresponding reference shot (that shot which appears in the remainder of the sequence). It was found that low angle shots may increase credibility and attraction, but only when used sparingly. The study emphasized that the effect of the shot, whether preponderant or referent, depends on its relationship to the other shots utilized in a sequence. (LL)",

Results showed that: (1) news viewing begins early in life, increasing with age; (2) boys watch more news programs than do girls; (3) there are only slight differences by race, academic ability, and political interest; (4) children do not tend to imitate parents' news viewing behaviors; and (5) opportunity (exposure to surrounding early evening and Saturday morning programs) is a major factor in producing news viewing. Moderate correlations were obtained  between frequency of news watching and indices of political knowledge and general familiarity with current events.

Comparisons were made between the coverage produced by the press reports and manuscripts of Agnew's speeches in order to discover how much of the original speech remained in the press reports, what thematic content remained, and what stylistic content remained. In addition, democratic and republican newspapers were compared on these same three dimensions. Conclusions were that the newspaper reports of Agnew's speeches accurately reflected the themes, the style, and the emphasis of his original speeches; the opposition (democratic) newspapers generally contained longer, more  thoroughly detailed reports with more direct quotations, more paraphrases, more prominent placements, and more often provided complete texts of Agnew's speeches than partisan (republican) newspapers; and Agnew's repeated charges that the liberal (democratic) press contained unfair, inaccurate, and distorted reports of his speeches were not supported.

Of the 204 in-depth questionnaires, 60 were returned and 47 provided usable data, while 188 of the 300 shorter questionnaires were returned. Analysis of data showed that in Omaha approximately 62 percent and outside Omaha approximately 40 percent of those teaching speech, oral English, drama, or debate were certified in speech. The most frequently taught course was speech fundamentals. Most schools do not require a  speech course, although 60 percent offer some kind of speech program.

Four conclusions were reached: some demographic and attitudinal variables are related to a child's susceptibility to stereotypes of social role models projected in television commercials; television commercials reflect the present values and characteristics commonly associated with the roles of husband and wife; whether a mother works outside the home or stays at home has no measurable effect on the degree to which her child accepts the stereotypic roles in  television commercials; and since a child's self concept level can influence how he responds to commercial messages, advertisers would be wise to explore the reactions and preferences of the different self-esteem groups and attempt to capitalize on these preferences in their commercials.

College theatre programs have become more professional, with some universities having developed their own companies or cooperative arrangements with nearby regional theatres. The variety of performance spaces in new performing arts centers on some campuses attracts many professional theatre companies. In addition, interdisciplinary college programs--drama, dance, and music--combined with campus fine arts centers have generated recent programs in theatre management and arts administration. Another trend has been the reflection of current political and social movements, with special interest in ethnic minorities--black theatre workshops, Chicano  studies, and Oriental theatre.

When a develop-user relationship conducive to open communication allowed users to convey their perceptions and problems to developers, developers listened, interpreted, reformulated and re-presented the product to the user. The authors suggest that pilot testing of prototypes for adult users can be regarded within the framework of a two-way communication system. The communication model identifies barriers impeding the sending and receiving of messages, such as differences of role, expectation, and language. These barriers must be acknowledged and broken  before the developer can obtain information critical to further development of the product. (Author)",

In order to accomplish a wider range of research and increase the number performing research, formal programs (Facilitator of Research in Urban Schools and Communities) at universities should be developed to train individuals who would (1) be trained to do relevant research at the local  level; (2) be urban problemsolving and information oriented; (3) train local school or community personnel in the planning and execution of research projects; (4) be a consultant to local urban personnel involved in projects; (5) be a researcher sensitive to the needs of the urban school and community; and (6) manage research projects in the urban community.

Since developments in the finance area were extensive and needed to be covered in considerable detail, the report treats that area more fully than it does the others. Background data include the many documents available in the State and related studies done by other scholars. In addition, 39 formal interviews with policy actors were conducted, and a number of other informal interviews were conducted with other informants. For the most  part, these data were collected in 1972 and early 1973 with some updating in 1974, particularly in the finance area. (Author)",

The data came from investigating the way in which three recent education decisions -- one each in the areas of school finance, teacher certification, and educational planning and evaluation -- were determined and from obtaining the perceptions of the influence relationships characterizing the operation of the State education policy system held by a cross-section of participants. In late 1972 and early 1973, formal interviews were conducted with  major policy actors including the Governor, members of the Governor's staff, legislative leaders, the Commissioner of Education, members of the State Board of Education, staff members of the State Department of Education, and leaders of the education interest groups.

The commissioners were asked to indicate the degree of concern in their State on each of 18 issues confronting education in the States. Financing schools and colleges was identified as the most urgent concern by those polled. The next greatest concerns identified were collective bargaining and providing education services for handicapped children. Three emerging education issues identified by the commissioners were coordinating and expanding lifelong learning and community education programs, coordinating State education services with other agencies, and equalizing employment opportunities for women in education. Issues of little concern  included interstate school finance, equalization, and comparing achievement among the States. (Author/JF)",

        "description":"A study conducted in the winter of 1973 attempted to investigate how elementary school principals in innovative schools perceive their roles compared to the role perceptions of principals in more traditional school settings. Thirty-two schools were designated as innovative by a panel of four elementary school principals. It was assumed that the responses of a random sample of an equal number of principals of more traditional schools were representative of all elementary school principals in more traditional schools. A 6-page questionnaire was mailed to respondents that consisted of items designed to provide descriptive data about the principal, the school, and items concerned with experiences or activities of the principals in various task areas, such as instruction and  curriculum development, school organization and structure, school plant and transportation management, and finance and business management. The general conclusion is that principals in innovative schools view their roles in supervision and administration as a cooperative effort with teachers to improve the teaching/learning situation more than do principals in more traditional schools. The conclusions made on the basis of the data collected in this study are, in part, that innovative schools are more likely to be in the larger school districts; all principals communicate with parents and the community by utilizing various media; and that principals of innovative schools have been in their buildings from three to ten years and have greater freedom to modify plant facilities than do  principals in more traditional schools.

The intent of the series is to provide a simple means for determining the consequences of the various possible decision options open to designers and school officials. This section, the first of the series, examines what can be done in designing or  redesigning the building's shell to make the wisest long-run use of resources. The text explains how the building shell affects the building's energy consumption, identifies energy conserving ideas for use in the design (or redesign) of the shell, gives examples showing how these ideas could be applied to new construction and modernization projects, provides a simple method for determining the effects of each of these ideas, and identifies sources of further information to assist design professionals in complete analysis of the effect of the building shell on energy consumption.

Options that may be applied to one or more models are described, and the preferences of a wide range of persons who have participated in the  State governance of education are shown.

The authors describe in some detail one approach to improved accountability in education, that of the Planning-Programing-Budgeting System (PPBS). Following the description of a model accountability program, the authors identify the roles that seem to be most appropriate, attempt to highlight areas of conflict or disagreement, and suggest ways in which conflicts could be resolved in the  future. A selected bibliography is included. (Author)",

        "description":"This paper was commissioned to present a point of view not widely expressed -- that children who live and attend school in &quot;segregated&quot; high economic neighborhoods suffer from such isolation from the reality of the world in which they live. The authors consider the consequences of rearing the affluent young in settings which physically and psychologically isolate them from the realities of American society. Since the initial socialization processes of the young occur in the home and the school, they are the primary focus. First, current educational structures are discussed briefly in terms of the functions of education as traditionally conceived. It is argued that in some crucial respects, the schools and extant housing patterns deny the affluent young an opportunity to acquire  and develop essential skills that prepare them to cope with their roles as emerging citizens. Finally, the paper reports on recent research that suggests ways in which schools and housing patterns can be reconceptualized to meet the critical needs of the young. (Author/MLF)",

        "description":"The scores which students get on tests are the result of many factors, only one of which is the school program of instruction. The unique traits of the individual develop as they interact with the environment. Family life style, the way parents and siblings use language, and the presence of reading materials and television in the home all have an impact on children. The community exerts an increasing influence as children grow. By the time students enter school, their friends and neighborhood have shaped their lives and learning patterns in important ways. The family and the community continue to be important learning environments during the school years. As a result, not all a student learns is learned in school; and what is learned there builds on a foundation provided by home  and community. The strategy adopted in the Performance Indicators program is to use these kinds of influences to make an estimate of what learning can be expected. The influence of the school is purposely omitted. Thus, a score is obtained which shows what learning could be expected for students with certain characteristics under certain community and family conditions. This manual is designed to describe the Program. The system is designed to aid districts in reducing the element of chance in educational decisionmaking, describing district performance by taking into account noncontrollable variables, identifying areas in mathematics and reading in need of more detailed evaluation, determining needs, and facilitating the calculation of the cost-effectiveness of alternative instructional  programs.

To date, virtually all program audit activities have occurred as a result of specially funded State or federal education programs. Once the program ends, or changes its requirements, the audit is eliminated. The author argues that the only way in which educational program auditing can have a long-range impact on improved decisionmaking and accountability is to have the audit conducted at the school district level as a regular and continuing activity.

At present, 10 teams exist which are composed of small groups of 6-12 persons including citizens, professional educators, and students. Each team is charged with the development of long-range proposals in a specific area of school life, such as alternatives in elementary education, the education of early adolescents, and variety and depth of curriculum. Teams have numerous volunteers and research support provided by a small professional staff. The teams relate administratively to the board of education and with other teams through a Design Management Team. Three sets of variables are being studied to ascertain  the impact of the teams on the educational process: (1) those relating to who participates in the teams, (2) those relating to the successful functioning of the teams internally, and (3) those variables relating to how the work of the teams is utilized by the board of education and the rest of the school system.

Kenneth Burke's dramatistic system clarifies the five sources of motives in the drama--purpose, agency, scene, agent, and act. This pentad creates a possibly fruitful model that highlights the drama of the classroom. Contrasting three long recognized orientations in education--knowledge transmission, socialization, self actualization--with Burke's taxonomy highlights the ways in which the three frames of reference shape various dramatic situations. This dramatistic interpretation provides additional perspectives that appear to clarify and enrich analysis of the educational process. (Author)",

Parents are encouraged to stimulate recreational interests by taking children along on shopping and other trips, by engaging a child in parallel play to discover the reason for the activity's attraction, and also to introduce the child to social recreation, and by using community resources. Common sense in choosing activities and in reacting to children's play choices is urged. Children's preferences are listed in the area of toys, collections, music, travel, arts and crafts, playground equipment, dramatics, dance, games,  sports, outdoor activities, and other special interests, such as mathematics, astronomy, and electricity.

Normalization is the focus of the services which make maximum use of mental and physical capacities to reduce the handicap of mental retardation. Described are general principles, and four stages involving development of services (diagnosis, specialization, differentiation, and decentralization). Administrative facts and regulations are explained in terms of authorities responsible, legislation, and planning of services according to legislation. Discussed in a section on epidemiology and etiology are aspects such as early identification of the MR, causes and additional handicaps, incidence, and trends (indicating a decrease in number of cases of children and  increase of adult cases). Principles of residential care which are discussed include community group homes, social adaptation, single room provision, provision for small heterogeneous groups, and integration by sex. The following are among services described: special schools and boarding homes for children, preschools and nurseries, vocational education, residential homes for children and adults, standards for residential facilities, day care services, sheltered workshops, and services for leisure activities. Explained are individual rights of MR persons, costs of care, and responsibility of authorities in safeguarding rights of the MR.

Discussed by R. Bourgea is a Pennsylvania cooperative vocational education project for 10-24 educable mentally retarded high school students, who have rehabilitated old homes and built new homes, and who have been employed in building trades after graduation. Recounted by B. Posner are a gasoline station owner's  techniques of teaching job skills to a mentally retarded pump attendant and providing stimulating experiences, which have resulted in a father-son relationship. B. Freeman and J. Mundy give an overview of recreation, which began for the retarded in state schools and hospitals for purposes such as personnel respite and now consists of offerings for all age groups and levels of retardation (the article is noted to be the first chapter of a monograph). Reported by C. Rodlund are reductions in South Dakota institutionalization (half of 101 patients) due to patient evaluation during a 4-year hospital improvement program; and explained with five case studies are casework, special class placement, foster home placement, and vocational training.

The most difficult area is supportive case work with parents which involves such tasks as becoming aware of one's own reactions so as to be able to deal constructively with parental anger and frustration, providing emotional support to parents and helping them feel more comforable in relating to their child, and providing parents with an increased repertoire of activities in dealing with their child. The social worker facilitates contact with local  and state agencies (such as the Visiting Nurse Association Assistance, which might be helpful in times of family disorganization, and the Massachusetts Commission for the Blind) and educates parents concerning laws which mandate a variety of services for the visually-impaired, multihandicapped child and his family.

Hagger discusses the concept of specific learning disabilities and stresses the trend to search for causation in organic factors within the child, the importance of early identification, and the need for providing adequate remedial instruction. F. N. Cox's paper focuses on psychological assessment for remedial teaching and concludes that assessment should identify learning needs and be periodically repeated. The consequences on initial failure in learning to read is the topic of the third paper by Hugh Esson who examines the characteristics of the adult illiterate such as high scores on performance aspects of intelligence tests. The next paper  is by Angela Ridsdale and is on identification and intervention in the early stages of learning difficulties with emphasis on symptoms such as hyperactivity which the potentially learning disabled young child may exhibit. The final paper, by J. P. Phillips, on remediation programs for retarded readers, provides information on diagnosis and developing a program based on the child's individual needs and interests.

        "description":"The diagnostic-prescriptive observation checklist is designed to allow the regular classroom teacher to diagnose and prescribe for each child's learning abilities or disabilities in the sensory-motor, perceptual, or language areas. Five to ten observable characteristics and five to eight suggested teaching strategies are listed for each of the following areas: auditory association, auditory and grammatic closure, auditory discrimination, auditory figure-ground perception, auditory memory, directionality/laterality, orientation, spatial awareness, verbal expresseion, visual association, visual closure, visual discrimination, visual figure-ground perception, visual memory, and visual-motor coordination. It is suggested that the child for whom four or more characteristics in one  area are checked be diagnosed as experiencing difficulty in that area and an appropriate prescription selected from the teaching strategies be implemented. Examples of observable characteristics listed are poor verbal fluency (auditory association) and difficulty with comparing and classifying information gained from visual materials (visual association). Sample teaching strategies are having the child place cut apart comic strips in correct sequence (visual association) and having him draw and trace increasingly complex designs (visual-motor coordination). The appendix provides definitions of each area. (DB)",

The first section of the manual covers such tasks as initial identification and referral, presenting the program, securing child and parental consent, signing contracts, and recording observational data. Section 2 provides exact instructions for implementing the program and descriptions of the procedures to be used in each day of the program. For example, on the second day the consultant is to check the  program summary chart, coordinate program design with the teacher, explain what the student must do to earn points, have the child select a reward for the session, proceed with rewards immediately after the period, monitor class behavior to insure that the student is being reinforced by the activity and his peers while the class is participating in the group reward, and contact parents after school. In section 3, common implementation problems and possible solutions are considered. Appendixes contain forms required for program implementation. (GW)",

The results made it apparent that more and better foreign language courses had to be offered to attract and hold students. Between 1968 and 1971 the foreign language program in the district was expanded, and in May 1971, the present survey was conducted. A total of 2,253 responses were tabulated, representing approximately 75 percent of all students enrolled in foreign language courses in the district at the time of the survey. Some of the observations and tentative conclusions of this survey were as follows: (1) attempts to broaden the program had been successful; (2) attempts to attract students on the basis of intrinsic value of foreign  language study rather than college requirements had been successful; (3) because foreign language classes were opened to all students, not only the college bound, the number of negative responses increased; and (4) the continuous progress program was endorsed.

        "description":"Bilingual education in the United States has been directed by various language education policies to which there are three dimensions: (1) the language or dialect the child speaks on entering school; (2) the type of language policy in the school, which may be monolingual or one of three types of bilingual policies; (3) the divisions of language functions which reflects the appropriateness of each language or dialect for the spoken and written channels and various social situations. To propose a language education policy, particularly in the design of bilingual education programs for nonstandardized languages, three types of languages or dialects must be considered: world, standard, and local, all of which interact in advancing the community to a modern life. On this basis, the  problems of bilingual education for the Navajo have involved the development of an orthography; standardization, so that the written language may be taught; and modernization, to facilitate the handling of modern concepts. The last five years have been marked by a growing acceptance of the potential value of Navajo bilingual education, which is recognized as more than an answer to a language problem; rather, it is a central element in changing education from an alien function to one shared or controlled by the community.

        "description":"The paper proposes, on the basis of a study of relative clauses and WH-interrogative constructions, to reflect the time-oriented character of the sentence by replacing neutral expressions like &quot;#&quot; with explicit time references like &quot;beginning&quot; and &quot;end.&quot; These boundaries are to be universally associated with all phrase types since, apparently, no major type (S, NP, VP) is symmetrically structured. A subsidiary proposal calls for a view of &quot;underlying representation&quot; which would, even under the assumption that all material relevant to semantic interpretation appears in that representation, relax an &quot;all and only&quot; requirement to an &quot;all&quot; so as to admit structurally essential but semantically empty or redundant material. The evidence in support of these proposals arises from: (1)  the exclusion of WH-relative pronouns in relative clauses of the type [noun phrase, subordinate clause, head noun] and their obligatory clause-initial positions in relative clauses of the type [noun phrase, head noun, subordinate clause]; and (2) the inadmissability of a pronominal &quot;introducer&quot; in the first type (the prospective clause) as opposed to the admissability of such an introducer in the second (the retrospective clause). The distinct character of the two types can be explained in terms of time-orientation, as that factor reveals itself in WH-interrogatives. (Author/LG)",

A new rationale for these errors can come from an investigation of the perceptual strategies common to error analysis, and thus it is postulated that researchers and educators should shift their emphasis away from interference theory toward error analysis theory. One of the immediate consequences of promoting the error analysis theory is that language teachers must be made aware of the role that the processes of lexical incorporation, inchoation, and causation play in the acquisition of language. Another consequence lies in the realization that language teachers must provide the learner  with pertinent semantic information in order to allow him to adequately process speech events.

        "description":"A disjuncture between Ontario high schools and universities in the aims of their German language programs has become apparent in the last few years. In the high schools, the methods used in language classes have been fundamentally audiolingual, whereas in the universities, the emphasis has been on reading literature, with classroom analysis conducted in English. As a result, students entering the universities are unprepared for the level of reading demanded, and unsatisfied with the lack of conversational German courses offered. This problem could be solved by the development of a Canadian School for Translating and Interpreting, which would satisfy those students seeking a practical use of language, and would also help to diversify the career market for Canadian language  students. Trade between Germany and Canada is growing, which will create a greater need for German translators and, to a lesser extent, interpreters. At this time, most are recruited from abroad, because local training facilities are not available. Heretofore, Canadian programs to train translators and interpreters have been concerned almost exclusively with French and English. Translation is a demanding profession with exacting qualifications, but it is not at present organized or legally recognized in Canada. One of the tasks of the proposed school will be to remedy this situation. (LG)",

BBE should enable the child to: (1) learn basic concepts initiating him into the school environment in his dominant language; (2) expand his knowledge of his dominant language; (3) expand his second language; (4) learn subject matter and concepts in his dominant language; (5) learn  subject matter and concepts in his second language; (6) develop self-assurance, confidence, and a positive identity with his cultural heritage. BBE is not: (1) a remediation program for non-English speaking children; (2) exclusively an ESL program; (3) a program of foreign language instruction; (4) a program for only the non-English speaking child.

An example of this is bilingual education, which is growing in popularity throughout the country as a means of instructing non-English speaking children. An examination of historical documents reveals that bilingual education was a reality in California as early as the mid-1860's in San Francisco's Cosmopolitan School. In recognition of the young child's language learning facility, French, German, Spanish, and English were taught, and classes in other subject areas were taught in several languages. Thus, the current trend of bilingual educational research and experimentation would be benefitted if the educators involved recognized the  difference between those ideas which are new and those which are not, in order to gain from experience.

This evaluation is based on the results of interviews with members of the community, staff, and student body. The information collected was in four areas: (1) fall 1973 student pretest information; (2) spring 1974 student posttest information; (3) winter-spring 1974 community reactions; (4) spring 1974 staff reactions. The questions presented to the students tested their knowledge of present and past native cultures. The results demonstrated a marked increase in knowledge of historical culture due to the instruction of the bilingual/bicultural programs; their knowledge of the present native culture was already high. In regard to reading and speaking skills in native  languages, 68 percent of the children were able to read some of the native language materials by spring 1974, but there is still room for movement toward equal native/English-speaking ability.

The following reports were presented: (1) &quot;The Psychological Aspects of Teaching Modern Languages to Young Children&quot; by C. F. van Parreren; (2) &quot;The Pedagogical Aspects of Teaching a Modern Language to Young Children&quot; by K. Schroeder; (3) reports of the delegations of France, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom on the status of teaching language to children in their respective countries; and (4) the report of the German delegation on the teaching of English at the primary  level. Recommendations made at previous symposiums organized by the Council of Europe are summarized. The recommendations made by this symposium concern: (1) teaching methodology; (2) curriculum organization; (3) the importance of an audiolingual emphasis at the beginning of instruction; (4) the establishment of criteria for the preparation of textbooks; (5) the length and frequency of the language classes; (6) the need for continuity in language study; (7) teacher qualifications; and (8) the establishment of a permanent, international information exchange system.

A questionnaire, sent to members of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine, was designed to cover: characteristics of medical physicists, nature of work in medical physics, distribution of effort, publications, administration and supervision, training of medical physicists, budget for medical physics, and regional medical programs. Following a tabulation of questionnaire results, a discussion concerning duties and responsibilities, estimate of manpower needs, certification and accreditation, and emerging areas of specialization for medical physicists are included. Recommendations suggest: (1) At least one full-time  professional medical physicist is needed in each medical institution with more than 300 hospital beds. (2) Graduate training programs in medical physics shall terminate in a master or doctoral degree. In addition, experience shall be provided in clinical applications of pertinent subspecialities of physics. (3) Since projected needs would require doubling the number of medical physicists over the next 10 years, sufficient support of graduate training programs is essential. (4) Training programs in medical physics should be accredited. (5) Certification procedures for medical physicists need to be studied. (6) Courses on medical physics should be made available to premedical and medical students, as well as to paramedical students enrolled in schools of allied health sciences.  (MJM)",

The factors which should determine public policy with respect to support for independent higher education can be divided into four broad questions: Is the existence or survival of these institutions a matter of state concern? Is the quality of these institutions a matter of state concern? Are the functions of these institutions a matter of state concern? And are the purposes of these institutions a matter of state concern? Once these questions are answered, the question of how such support should be given may be answered. This can be divided into the following areas: aid provided directly to students, and  aid provided directly or indirectly to institutions. Tables are included that specify the limitations of each form of aid and the states employing each form. State policy should be made with an understanding of federal policy, so that state programs may be designed to work cooperatively with, and take advantage of, federal programs.

The survey covered studies of one or more medical schools that either produced figures for average annual per-student cost of education and/or discussed the methodologies and problems involved in producing such figures. Many problems can prevent the accurate estimation of per-student costs of education in medical schools. This is especially true if one is attempting to estimate an average cost or construct a \"cost curve\" using data from many schools; or if one is attempting inter-school comparisons. Studies of medical school costs have utilized three general methodologies. These have been labeled \"net amount contributed,\"\"costing,\" and\"input-output analysis.\" No one of these appears to be clearly (empirically) more accurate than the others. However, the input/output method would appear to be the most accurate. The empirical results of these studies show no consistent pattern of costs of education over time. One might expect that these cost estimates, when adjusted for inflation, would show some rising trend due to increasing quality in the medical education process. (Author/PG)",

        "description":"This review on the gifted student reveals quite forcefully that those who are young, gifted, and black have neither been observed nor served to any appreciable extent. The findings of this survey of programs show that most schools that responded to the questionnaire had more than one program for student with high academic potential and that these programs had been in existence on their campuses for several years. The programs themselves, however, usually were not highly structured and were independently administered units with their own curricula. Although labeled differently, most of the programs described seemed to share an emphasis on providing opportunities for indepth, independent pursuit of special interests and for meeting with similar students to discuss and exchange  ideas. It is recommended that institutions that serve black students collect and study data on this segment of the student population so that unique needs may be identified and met. Counselors and teachers should be encouraged to assist in the development of methods of identification of black students with higher academic potential, instructional techniques, and program design. Persistence should be shown in the search and identification of students with high academic potential so that their presence will contribute to institutional character and reputation.

        "description":"This study was designed to collect data concerning the characteristics of the higher education faculty of Pennsylvania. A population of 21,228 teaching faculty in 118 colleges and universities in Pennsylvania were surveyed by means of college catalogs, records of the Pennsylvania Human Rights Commission, and a mail questionnaire. The catalogs provided information about source of degrees, and limited data on race were obtained from the Human Rights Commission. Tenure status, age, rank, teaching load, sex, place of birth, highest degree, length of experience, and number of national professional conferences attended were obtained from the questionnaire. Highlights of the study indicated: (1) Almost two-thirds of Pennsylvania faculty had tenure in the academic year 1972-73. (2) A  comparable bulging at the higher professorial ranks has not yet occurred in Pennsylvania. (3) The faculty of Pennsylvania institutions of higher education appears to be an aging faculty. Those over 40 years of age now constitute 56.8 percent of the total. (4) The average teaching load for Pennsylvania faculty is about ten hours. (5) Faculty in the Commonwealth are not particularly inbred. Less than 20 percent have returned to their alma maters as teachers. (6) Women compose only 21.1 percent of the faculty in Pennsylvania; and they are less likely than Pennsylvania men to be tenured and to be at the senior academic ranks. (Author/MJM)",

        "description":"Throughout the history of the university the autonomy and control of the faculty has oscillated. In the middle ages faculty sustained self-government through academic guilds; in America faculty control was rekindled through the development of science and the assertion of professionalism. However, faculty again perceive a decline in their control over the university and academic policy, and they are turning to a new means of influence: unionization and collective bargaining. This analysis explores the effectiveness of this process in altering the authority structure of a college or university and the systemic changes that result, using the City College of New York as a case study. Although the experience of City College and CUNY reflect a unique set of conditions, much of what is  now occuring may be generalized to other institutions of higher education. (Author/PG)",

This paper, however, is concerned with learning within contemporary school settings. Ethnic segregation is one major type of group separation within American schools and within the society. Socioeconomic status, age, sex, religion, and physical or mental exceptionality are among the principal other group distinctions used to segregate groups in American society. Each ramifies profoundly into the organization of American schools--public and nonpublic, lower and higher systems, alike. Correlatives which are also used to segregate students and staffs include region of origin, mother tongue, dialect, and even life style. Among all of  these, perhaps the only categorical distinction to be given a stronger emphasis within schools than within the society is imputed mental ability. Our purpose is to understand students--the social and educational forces that influence their learning within the school context. Therefore we narrow our attention to the kinds of segregation which are carried into classrooms in American schools, and to the kinds of cognitive skills that are conventionally recorded as school learning.

The KAPS Program consists of six components. They include: Daily Program, Service to Aid Youth Centers, Community Liaison Assistants, Earn and Learn, Teacher Accountability Plan, and Management. The intent of each of these program components is to mediate the powers of various environmental and conditional factors which have caused students to leave the Baltimore City Public Schools, and to strengthen the roles played by parents, teachers, and community leaders in combating school dropouts. Operation KEEP refers to the KAPS  Experience for Elementary Pupils through the Daily Program component. In 1972-73, the component serviced some 400 pupils in 14 pilot classes of four elementary schools within the KAPS cluster. The component's operation was based on identification of dropout-prone pupils on the upper elementary level. Its terminal goal was dropout prevention through early diagnosis of instructional needs and the immediate application of prescriptions. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The subject of this paper is the schooling of children of the poor. In the past most children of the poor obtained very little education in the school; in fact it operated largely as a sorting agency for them. With the increasing demand for universal education, the schools and the public have become conscious of the schools' inadequacy in reaching disadvantaged children. As public attention focused on this problem and funds were appropriated to help in dealing with it, extensive efforts were made to improve the education of the poor. At first few programs were successful; now many more effective programs are in operation, but they are still in a minority. The slow development of successful efforts has partly been due to the wide acceptance of the notion that a child's capacity to  learn is the chief factor in limiting his education rather than the inadequacy of the learning experiences. Also the notion that the learning programs that work with middle-class children need only minor revisions to be effective with the disadvantaged has misdirected many projects. What has been found in the last 10 years is that effective learning programs for children of the poor can be constructed by designing them so as to provide the essential conditions for learning.

Assuming that children are continuously learning, this curriculum material is written to be used for individualization of instruction to meet the needs of children at the teacher's discretion. Four- and five-year-old children learn through intensive sensory-motor activities and the manipulation of things. They learn a great deal from each other as well as from the language and behavior of the adults with whom they are  involved. Aides and parent liaison workers play an important role in the educative process of our children. Likewise, parents are expected to become involved in the program as much as possible, as e.g., classroom volunteers, teacher substitutes, paraprofessionals, or resource persons. \"Home Follow-Up\" kits used by parents in the home serve to reinforce or teach what children need to know.

Students are freely transferred between the units based on their abilities. The environment of the 111th Street School is dynamic. Frequent faculty workshops, team meetings, and staff development activities result  in improved procedures for managing the ungraded instructional program and the general operation of the school. The staff at the 111th Street School have supplemented and modified the basic instructional design as necessary to accomplish the objectives of the school and the Los Angeles Unified School District. Since 111th Street is a Title I school, receiving funds under the 1965 Elementary Secondary Education Act, they have received the support of Title I administrative staff and from the Compensatory Education Activity Support Unit, Program Development.

It deals with such issues as: the social criticism of testing through numerous lawsuits, court rulings, and in the positions taken by the Association of Black Psychologists and the American Personnel and Guidance Association; the use of IQ tests for grouping purposes; experiments related to the test environment; the self-fulfilling prophecy; and the effects of language differences on test results. It is held that the present trend points toward an expansion and elaboration of psychometrics rather than an abolition of objective tests. Among the trends are: a recognition of the need to train the users of tests to ensure that test scores  are not misinterpreted and also train them in the potentialities of a variety of errors of interpretation due to technical and psychological factors which contaminate test results; a focus on measures of environment to bolster and supplement the scores from traditional tests; a call for a \"pluralistic sociocultural\" perspective on the testing of minorities; the development of new measures consistent with the special language characteristics of the minorities; and, an emphasis on description and prescription rather than on selection and prediction in order to facilitate equal educational opportunities.

        "description":"\"Children and Intercultural Education\" culminates the Association for Childhood Education International's three-year emphasis on a project, \"Neighbors Unlimited,\" in which thousands of members and their local branches worked to broaden and intensify efforts toward bettering intergroup relations. This resource kit of three booklets is aimed at those educating children in the home, in school or through other programs, and at those whose concern is in making intercultural education an integral part of all learning. Part 1 gives the reader insight into how minorities feel about themselves. Part 2 develops the concept of cultural pluralism, frames the need for development of cultural awareness in children at an early age, and states the importance of second-culture experiences.  Research related to children's prejudices is explored; implications are considered. In part 3, 11 educators examine the content of programs and practices that may make minorities feel unwelcome and inadequate in the classroom. Attention is also focused on the identity crises faced by the black, Chicano and Puerto Rican child; myths about native Americans; and testing and evaluating. Questions of busing and multicultural instructional materials are discussed. (Author/JM)",

        "author":["Brown, Frank"],
        "description":"During the school year of 1972-73 a large Northern urban school district requested that a feasibility study for a community policy board to govern a junior high school be conducted. A committee was appointed to conduct the study. A part of the committee's task was to sample the opinion of students, parents, and teachers regarding: what should be taught in the school; and how much parent involvement in school matter seemed desirable. The inquiry included the school under consideration for community control plus three other schools not involved in the feasibility study. A questionnaire was administered to a representative sample of students, parents, and teachers at the four schools. The study provides strong evidence suggesting that black students and parents desire a school  curriculum that includes the teaching of basic skills: reading, writing, spelling, speech, mathematics, and the basic social sciences. It seems clear from this study that parental involvement in school matters is less desirable for those who have never witnessed full parental involvement than for those who have experienced it. Overall, black parents have expressed a strong desire for parental participation in school matters. Black students seem to be somewhat less concerned about parental involvement. Teachers are mildly receptive to the idea. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This study focused on two methodological issues by testing for discriminant validity in a multitrait-multimethod matrix which contrasted the set of estimates obtained from two methods and the \"regression weights\" derived from each subject's estimates from the second method. In order to change the conceptions of social behavior held by persons from different cultural backgrounds, it is necessary to be able to measure the similarity of such conceptions, or attributions. A method for quantifying attributions requires that values be assigned to five weights incorporated in an equation. This raises the question of how to obtain good estimates of these weights. A direct method is to simply ask subjects to estimate the weight of each predictor in the equations. A second method of  measurement is to have the subject estimate the perceived relationship among all possible pairs of variables in each equation. This is tantamount to asking the subjects to estimate directly the correlation coefficient between all pairs of variables in the equation. The question as to whether the subjective correlations estimate fails to mirror processes actually used by the subjects can only be answered empirically. If the two methods produce different types of estimates, they may not yield similar interpretations of the subject's conceptions. (Author/JM)",

The program accepted a theoretical construct based on the premise that a school is a social system. A four-point proposal was developed, featuring: (1) Focused preparation--personnel trained to identify and to respond to urban school problems. (2) Coordinated preparation--personnel communicating their own and others' problems and functions in an effort to develop understanding of their roles. (3) Cadre formation and placement--personnel establishing a group which would foster a working relationship in which problems could be solved. (4) Demonstration and induction school--a mechanism for disseminating methods,  materials, and projects. The program adopted all four phases of this proposal. This report emphasizes the second and third areas, touching on all four aspects. These &quot;Resource Papers&quot; are divided into five sections: (1) the introduction; (2) the practicability of a theoretical model; (3) the quality and procedure of curriculum development; (4) the effect of the Ford Training and Placement Program on role function and role development; and, (5) the conclusion. More empirical documents will hopefully be available within the next year. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"In terms of training teachers, the Ford Training and Placement Program is unique. It uses the cadre-model in the internship and placement year of the training program. The teacher training is focused on an attempted immersion of the university-based student into not only the grade level or subject-matter specialty in which he seeks a degree, but into the entire social system of the school and the outside institutions which affect the school as it operates. Thus, an understanding of the school and the milieu in which the student is placed is necessary as well as an understanding of the use of tools necessary to operate effectively. Focused preparation includes training in working with the established faculty of the school and becoming aware of the policy-making operations and  procedures of the Chicago Board of Education. Cross-role preparation is provided whereby the MAT and MST students are joined by experienced teachers who have worked in the schools and the administrator of the school in which the intern is placed. The cross-role concept includes educational specialists, adult educators, social workers and social psychological workers. The entire experiment is complex, but in its complexity many different innovative ideas have emerged in almost all areas dealing with urban education. (Author/JM)",

In direct and indirect ways, the \"evidence,\" especially in the broad public domain has been mounting to suggest a genetic cause for discovered differences between racial groups on test of aptitude and achievement. It is the purpose of the paper to present an overview of this \"conversation\" and its implication, to discuss a sample of relevant but often overlooked research, to present a slightly extended set of additional references in the bibliography, and to suggest directions for future research. The primary focus will be on research pertaining directly to the black child and adolescent. However, the points which are developed are relevant to the treatment accorded to any  racial, or ethnic minority or economically powerless group. There are too many examples of black growth, often in the face of overwhelming odds, for us to be satisfied any longer with a situation where national educational policy is overly influenced by excuse makers whose research is detached from significant reality and whose understanding of what it takes to help minority children grow is nil. There are people in this country who know how. It is from this group that educational policy recommendations should be sought. It is this group which should be made more visible to the profession so that the new professional talent can see that there are exciting, productive alternatives to the despair which is suggested by many who ought to know better.

The program completed its second year of operation in June 1973. During its first year in existence, the bilingual program served kindergarten and grade 1 children. Grade 2 classes were added during the 1972-73 academic year. The project serviced both Spanish and English dominant children, in the proportions which reflect the population of the community. The program accomodated 219 children on three grade levels. Eight full-time teachers and eight educational assistants worked in the program. An English as a second language teacher was added to the staff at midyear. The materials available in the program were adequately suited to their needs.  In each classroom there were various kinds of learning games (in English and Spanish) which were frequently used by the children. In each classroom there were special interest areas located around the room. The teachers developed materials on their own for children who needed additional assistance in their weakest skill and concept areas. The low adult-student ratio allowed frequent small group and individualized instruction. The program placed its primary instructional efforts on the small group learning unit. The materials, available in both English and Spanish, were geared to different levels of ability in reading and math. Culturally enriching field trips were an integral part of the program, especially for the second grade children. (Author/JM)",

The first ESAA report, issued on September 23, 1972, covered the administration from August 1970 to September 1972 of ESAP, which served as an interim program to provide assistance to school districts facing critical and immediate needs in the desegregation process. The second ESAA report,  issued on June 29, 1973, presented a review of the period from September 1972 to March 1973 and dealt with the developmental activities involved in designing policy objectives and program procedures for the administration of ESAA. The report described in detail the ESAA budget allocations and funding cycles, regionalized program administration and developmental assistance, and the preparation and dissemination of pregrant materials to potential applicants. The third report, of September 28, 1973, covered the period from April 1973 to September 1973. It dealt with the actual implementation of the ESAA programs and listed all of the grants and contracts awarded in fiscal year 1973. (Author/JM)",

There is a major need for rigorous program development; a number of continuing, and some newer, specific guidance development  initiatives have been undertaken by the National Center for Adult, Vocational, Technical and Manpower Education. A new National Guidance Handbook has been developed as a tool for interrelating vocational instructional programs with classifications of other materials.

There is an increasing separation between students and the world of work; career education is a revolutionary approach based on the idea that all educational experiences should be geared to preparing each individual for a life of economic independence, by improving their base for occupational choice, facilitating their acquisition of occupational skills, enhancing their educational achievements, making education relevant to their aspirations, and by increasing the real choices they have open to them. It is a lifelong systematic way of acquainting  students with the world of work, of which career guidance and counseling are essential components. The Federal government has recently taken some very positive actions affecting women. Teachers' organizations have called attention to the problem of women in education: the higher the grade level, the lower the percentages of women. Women faculty are paid less and not promoted as often. Career education can help women to achieve their vocational goals. (Author/AJ)",

        "description":"After a review of literature on the subject of vocational interests the authors go on to define the main problem investigated in this study, that of determining the relationship between expressed and tested vocational interests of four groups of people (disadvantaged males and females and nondisadvantaged males and females), in this case with grade students. A list of 24 interest areas was used. The findings are tabulated, analyzed and discussed in detail. Differences were found with respect to expressed vs. tested interest areas as follows: disadvantaged males, three areas; advantaged males, ten areas; disadvantaged females, eleven areas; and advantaged females, two areas. Disadvantaged males showed greater interest in all areas than advantaged males, while the findings were  mixed for female subjects. Males and females of both groups gave similar rank ordering to the interest areas. Some differences were found between high and low ability students. In comparison with national norms disadvantaged males displayed consistently higher scores. Recommendations for counselors, and others who interpret vocational interest information, are made in the following areas: sex differences, sociocultural differences, and ability differences. (SA)",

Also, in the same vein, the following comparisons were made: (1) $1,000 vs. $3,000 bonus, and (2) two years free college after four years of service vs. four years free college after four of service. There was no support for \"more is better.\" Furthermore, \"more is sometimes worse.\" The most attractive items showed a pervasive interest first in opportunities for self-determination as well as traditional incentives.

The data from questionnaires sent to all 725 New York State member agencies of the American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA) indicated preparation was sufficient, since they saw no need for a specialized high school curriculum for training travel counselors. However, only 277 responses to the questionnaire were received, and four-fifths of the population surveyed is located in the immediate New York City area, so caution must be  used in interpreting the data. Data tables were compiled citing the number of reporting agencies by staff size, the number and types of employees, location from which travel counselors are drawn, the relationship of education to the travel industry, and skills needed by travel counselors. It was concluded that related distributive education subjects, as now being taught, could be made more applicable to the training of travel counselors. (AG)",

The format used in the document consists of using three vertical columns to present the information. The first column presents one of the 23 travel-related questions under the title &quot;Understandings&quot; and offers possible answers. The second column lists suggested pupil and teacher activities; the third column cites sources of information for assisting  in the execution of the suggested activities. Ten of the ideas presented are emphasized in illustrations.

        "description":"To assess efforts in Adult Basic Education (ABE) on a nationwide basis, a longitudinal evaluation was conducted in 1971 of State programs funded under the Adult Education Act of 1966. Data were gathered across a variety of ABE programs and a representative sample of 2,318 program participants was studied over an 18-month period through a series of basic skills tests (arithmetic and reading) and participant interviews covering background, educational goals, employment experiences, earnings, and opinions related to ABE experiences. Information also was collected on program and classroom characteristics through interviews with local ABE administrators and instructors. Gains in test scores showed no statistically significant relationships to program participation between tests. Some  findings noted over the 18-month period were an increase in the percentage of participants working, wage increases, a decrease in public assistance, and a decrease in the percentage of students with college aspirations. Interviewees had very positive opinions about their ABE experiences; a majority felt their experience had helped them in their jobs. A limitation of the study was the absence of a control group. Further research needs to be directed toward experimental research rather than survey research. (EA)",

Marland in 1971. Career education is moving toward a focus on the working role that individuals play and is concerned with helping each individual identify, enter, and progress in a field of work that will provide maximum benefits to him, to his family, and to society. Of the several early efforts to produce a comprehensive set of goals and objectives for career education, common elements were: developing self-understanding, developing career or occupational understanding, developing general skills, establishing career plans, and pursuing career plans. The elements must be related to various growth stages of  individuals in education programs. Several systems for grouping occupations have been developed to make individuals aware of the many occupations available; the occupational clustering system used by the U. S. Office of Education is the most common. To be successful in achieving its place in education, career education must have focus and direction. (Author/AG)",

Acting Assistant Secretary for Education: America has made progress in education and social justice but many problems (high school dropouts, jobs not commensurate with employee skills and abilities, and unsatisfying work) are far from solved. Current programs and Federal career education initiative have the potential to alleviate many of these problems. Three broad goals identified for career education activities are the improvement of: the quality of career choice, the individual's opportunity for career entry, and the individual's opportunity for career advancement. Title NINE of the Education Amendments of 1972, pertaining to the elimination of sex discrimination will result in many changes and will open educational opportunities to  women now. All courses of study and classes must be open to all students, vocational schools will become coeducational, and the content of some courses will need adaptation to eliminate traditional sex biases. Moreover, significant changes will occur in physical education to provide money and facilities for equitable boys' and girls' athletic programs. Another major change required will involve the reexamination of the employment situation of women in our educational system (number of women in administration, lower salaries of women, and promotional practices).

        "description":"To provide information on the target audience for the Adult Learning Program Service (ALPS), a television series being developed by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, interviews were conducted with a small national sample of potential viewers. The main focus of the study was an examination of the social-psychological aspects of a decision making process in a carefully selected sample audience. Respondents were restricted to those who had eleven years or less of formal education, had access to a television set, and had achieved a sixth grade reading level. They included whites, blacks, Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Indians from all areas of the U. S., both rural and urban dwellers. Fifty-eight respondents returned usable questionnaires that formed the basis of the  analysis. It was concluded that the respondents would watch adult educational television programs and desire to implement their aspirations. A significant proportion were well informed about education and training sources and are enrolled, or plan to enroll, in educational programs. (A supplement containing a review of research studies related to adult education, a copy of the interview instrument, and a section on media use by the survey sample are included.) (Author/AG)",

An advisory council established an evaluation system utilizing four components: (1) existing situation, (2) resources available, (3) process evaluation, and (4) product evaluation. For the process evaluation component contemporary students evaluated classes and faculty for all required courses for secondary education majors and additional data were collected from first-year graduates of the program. Product evaluation utilized mailed questionnaires and visits to some first-year teachers. An appropriate interaction analysis code was developed for the visits. These teachers were also evaluated by their students, peers, and supervisors. Over 30 pages of tables  summarize the results. It was concluded that the evaluation model developed was workable.

The second, longer section, is devoted to a collection of data of two orders: the results of research into diverse questions concerning education of the disadvantaged adult, and information received in conferences with directors of three types of adult education programs.

In addition to the social action component, the author collected and analyzed field data to determine effectiveness of VTR as a tool for community development. The report comprises three major sections: Section One describes the VTR Risk Model, a theoretical model developed from the available field data, and operationally defines the various stages of the Risk Model and the factors drawn from the field data and influencing each stage. Section Two illustrates the process and rationale used to identify and develop a series of emergent hypotheses which  ultimately led to the development of a comprehensive theory and the subsequent Risk Model. Finally Section Three describes a set of observed phenomena that both reinforce the emergent theory and supplement it with the proposal of a Force theory for VTR as a tool for social animation. Examples of the field data used in the study are presented in Appendix A. Appendixes B and C offer a case summary and proposed hypothesis. (Author/MW)",

A sample of 1,000 tutors, each representing themselves and one of their students was selected. Information was acquired regarding personal, occupational, educational, and program characteristics of students and tutors. The findings revealed tutors to be a relatively homogeneous group, white, college-educated, female, and between 40 and 60 years old. Students were about evenly divided by sex, an average of 36, urban, mostly married, typically elementary grade level, and 62 percent English speaking. The Adult Basic Learning Examination reading test was  used to measure reading change. A positive reading grade level change was demonstrated by 68.5 percent of the students; Mexican-Americans and orientals showed the highest percentage gains, followed by whites and blacks. Previous educational attainment, number of hours taught, and length of class were other factors related to reading change. None of the selected tutor characteristics were associated meaningfully to student reading grade level change. Future recommendations involved the study of program dropouts, student recruitment, tutorial attitudes and mastery, and testing/data collection procedures for literacy councils. (EA)",

The behavior on which this study focused was off-task behavior, defined as that behavior inconsistent or incongruent with the lesson plan for that particular day, or with the subject being discussed. Behavioral data were collected through the use of video equipment and an instrument developed by the experimenters. Working hypotheses stated that: (1) the level of off-task behavior, demonstrated before the experimental condition, would decrease when the three variables of social reinforcement, extinction, and a discriminative stimulus were applied as the experimental condition; and (2) the level of off-task  behavior would return to its pre-experimental level when systematic social reinforcement was removed. The findings corroborated these hypotheses. It was concluded that systematic social reinforcement was a necessary condition for bringing about behavioral change, but the data did not permit speculation on whether social reinforcement alone would have effected the observed results.

The outcomes of adult career education are optimized in corrections through the systematic use of analyses, synthesis, simulation, and modeling. When simulation is used to process problems from different corrections settings through a  generalized model, the result is a systematic evaluation of alternatives in order to select the best possible plan for meeting needs and achieving objectives which will alleviate the problems and implement the mission of career development for staff and offenders in that setting.

It is also a useful resource for persons entering or reentering the work force at different stages of their lives. For hundreds of occupations the handbook answers such questions as: What does a person actually do on the job? What abilities and interests does the job call for? What are the working conditions like? What will be the job opportunities in coming years? This edition of the handbook presents occupational materials in new clustering system designed to organize occupations by related activities. The new Handbook also includes expanded earnings information, additional information on job  characteristics as they relate to young people's interests and abilities, and finally an extensively revised guide on how to use the handbook for career guidance.

        "description":"Many have expressed concern about manpower policy and programs as instruments of social change and with the role of manpower training in easing economic downturns, inflationary pressures, and poverty. This report is offered because seven years of experience in the Training and Technology (TAT) Program located at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, have provided some cogent answers to queries concerning the &quot;best way&quot; to provide effective skill training to the disadvantaged. In the TAT Program, a group of mostly young, disadvantaged individuals has been trained by craftsmen on a setting similar to &quot;real-life&quot; working conditions in a factory. The report presents in detail the program accomplishments and suggests that the key to TAT's effectiveness might be the partnership of industry and  government in training and placing the unemployed and underemployed. Private and public resources were combined in the three fundamental components of the project: (1) industrial facilities and personnel, (2) program development and administration, and (3) sources of financial support. Movement toward replication of the TAT model is described, and the possibility for its wider application is explored, in the final section. An appendix includes summary findings, course outlines and case histories. (Author/MW)",

The lack of empirical data on police behavior led to the project, limited in scope to the study of the effects of stress, fatigue, and individual psychology of the policeman on the outcomes of police-citizen interactions. The analysis focuses on the uniformed police officer's street contact with the citizen. Project goals were to understand factors influencing police behavior, and to modify police functions accordingly. The pilot study was conducted in three stages: (1) available data were reviewed, new tests  procedures evaluated, and police behavior on the street observed; (2) twelve police officer volunteers were tested and observed for six months; (3) data were analyzed. The findings of this study are presented with the authors' recommendations for future research and study regarding selection, training, performance evaluation, and communications systems. (MW)",

        "description":"This report was designed mainly to develop information on the need and available resources for providing adult education programs for the hearing-impaired population of Illinois. Information was gathered through questionnaires mailed to persons identified through the records of the National Census of the Deaf, and follow-up interviews on a 200-case sample of respondents to the mail questionnaire. Questionnaires were sent to 4,300 and returned by 1,200 hearing-impaired persons--about 7 percent of the estimated total of such persons in the State. The survey indicated that about 75 percent of the respondents were interested in resuming educational activities, largely in basic education and upgrading of vocational skills. They also indicated an overwhelming preference for direct  supportive communication in the classroom. The community college system in Illinois was rated an ideal one for delivery of adult education services to hearing-impaired persons in meaningfully-structured programs. Site visits to about one-third of these colleges established the acceptance of their directors of that principle. The report therefore included a recommendation for establishment of a State fund to finance special supportive services by community colleges and certain other educational institutions for that purpose.

Current law requires that only male students be counted. This bill would permit females to be counted, a change wholly consistent with military services policy of full and equal opportunity in the Armed Forces. It is viewed as a logical extension of the college Reserve Officer Training Corps program, already accepting the enrollment of women. The committee on Armed Services, on October 2, 1973, a quorum being present, recommended enactment of H.R. 8187 without an amendment. No increased cost will result from enactment of this bill.

The Great Lakes Apprenticeship Center (GLAC) approach utilizes some education principles which have wide support in adult education literature. The criterion used to judge program success were the former students' own evaluations and job improvement after training. The trainee evaluations were generally positive. Also, substantial improvements were made in the trainees' pay levels and hours worked after training. The study reveals that: (1) some important adult education principles facilitate effective programming for the disadvantaged learner and (2) if such principles  are properly implemented, it is possible to reduce the gap between the underemployed and those with relatively better employment records.

There are four avenues of daily activities available to the teacher to establish these skills: (1) homework reading assignment, (2) dictation-for-control material, (3) dictation for in-depth-proofing, and (4) daily dictation of copy containing error. It must become second nature to the student to &quot;hawk-eye&quot; every dictation for editorial errors. The basic foundation for this skill must begin in teaching clerical proofreading in the beginning typewriting and shorthand classes and systematic followup by the transcription teacher with a carefully planned and persistently applied simulated program.

It is intended that it will meet current and future preservice vocational-technical teacher education demands resulting from expanded Federal and State legislation to increase vocational-technical education offerings in grades 9-12 in the State of Tennessee. The program is designed to permit both the preservice and inservice vocational-technical teachers to pursue their educational development at 2-year post secondary institutions that are within commuting distance of their residential communities. Each student would be individually evaluated for prior work, teaching, and educational experience and be given credit for these experiences. The curriculum consists of three major components totaling 112 to 128 quarter  credit hours to fulfill the regional college accreditation association requirements. The components are: (1) vocational-technical specialty (48 quarter hours), (2) professional education courses (20-28 quarter hours), (3) related courses (44-52 hours). The 2-year associate degree program was implemented the spring of 1973 at the State Technical Institute at Memphis. (A short bibliography is included). (Author)",

A career education program can be viewed as consisting of five categories from which the teacher is to form a basic career education philosophy. (1) To develop in the student self-awareness and a positive attitude toward self, school, and work. It includes ways in which a business teacher can help the student perceive a clear picture of his capabilities and potential. (2) By the end of his formal education a student should have developed an occupational awareness of the kinds and numbers of jobs available in our society. (3) The general goal of occupational exploration is to help students examine their needs and interests in the light of career opportunities. (4) The major role  of the business education teacher is preparing the student for immediate job entry or post-secondary technical training following high school graduation. (5) Business educators should develop a placement and followup program. The placement function has a major contribution in helping the pupil toward his optimum development. After a student has left school, followup procedures can provide information on how the school could have served him better. Although these categories are developmental, each will continue throughout an individual's lifetime. (BP)",

Experiment 2 determined the extent to which self-regard and learning performance are influenced by the type and extent of feedback received during stages of a mathematical learning activity. Differential performance by men and women was also investigated. The purpose of Experiment 3 was to  find the effects of presenting sets of introductory mathematical learning materials which are differentially structured with respect to a concrete-abstract dimension. The effects of the adult learner's subject matter background and sex on learning and transfer were also investigated. The results of the three experiments are presented graphically and discussed in detail.

Using both objective and subjective information, it analyzes individuals' education and career patterns against changes in the educational system and trends in the economy, and, to deepen the perspective, compares these analyses with related studies in Canada and abroad. Physical scientists were chosen for the investigation because of their importance and the possibility of comparing study results with a similar study of Canadian engineers done in 1967-68. Questions posed in the study are: (1) How well did the science graduates of the late  1950's and 1960's integrate into the world of work? (2) How easily did they make the adjustment from education to employment? (3) How do those performing research and teaching utilize their education? and (4) How effectively is the education of science graduates used in other areas of activity? Those graduates not actually working in science may be of great significance, because they may well be the majority of tomorrow, as opportunities in teaching and research are currently not expanding very rapidly. The success of graduates who have sought jobs outside the traditional areas can give clues to the kind of education-employment relationships existing in the changed conditions of the 1970's and 1980's.

The goal of the workshop was to increase participant tolerance to a variety of patterns of sexual behavior. To measure attitudinal change, the Minnesota Sex Attitude Survey was administered one month prior to and two months following the workshop. The results showed a tendency toward an increase in tolerance on the total attitude score, although two survey items showed a decrease in tolerance among participants who generally expressed a positive reaction to the workshop as indicated on the &quot;Happiness Quotient&quot; Evaluation as well as unobtrusive measures of further contact with the agency regarding involvement in human sexuality  programs.

The program established seven three-year regional projects, each with a center providing leadership to smaller satellite settings. A center-satellite project clusters a university, community, and school districts. During the spring of 1973, the center-satellite project based at the University of Pittsburgh conducted a series of six workshops. Workshop sponsors and topics included: (1) Buffalo Satellite, \"Humanistic Education and PPS-Building Team Skills,\" (2) Boston Satellite, \"A New Look at Clinical Competencies,\" (3) Brockport Satellite, \"Reinforcing Administrator Roles  Through Counselor Education,\" (4) Pittsburgh/Duquesne Satellite, \"The School as a Training Site,\" (5) Washington, D.C. Satellite, \"University-School Relations: Implementing the Waddy Decree,\" (6) Pittsburgh Center, \"The Multi-Cultural Community and the Counselor.\" This document reports the proceedings and materials emanating from the workshops. Each satellite project is described, and an introductory paper reviews the staff and program development strategies employed by the project as a totality. (Author/NM)",

Three separate studies (N=19; N=20; N=81) were conducted in order to refine and develop the interview instrument. One purpose of the research was to determine if parents of heterogeneous background, who have children of high school age, have specific goals for the education of their children, and if these goals could be elicited during an interview. Parents consistently expressed concerns in the following areas: vocational education and basic education--reading, writing, and mathematics; development of self;  necessity of preparing students to cope with the practical aspects of adult life; development of social skills; development of civic responsibility; and the training, qualifications, and classroom methods of teachers. An assessment of the content of the goal statements suggests that parents' goals for secondary education are based on their own experiences as well as those of their children. (Author/PC)",

No longer does the practitioner-researcher have to rely on the difficult and time-consuming comparative group research design. Rather, he has available to him an intensive design or empirical case study approach to research. This design is well suited to the school counselor for several reasons: (1) focus is on specific individual behaviors rather than on average group comparisons; (2) the counselor can integrate research with his current counseling responsibilities; (3) the design minimizes drastically the use of statistics to control for individual variability; (4) it allows for more effective intervention because of continuous examination of changes in  the client's behavior; and (5) it provides a controlled method for examining covert as well as overt individual behavior. The intensive design is further recommended as a valuable method of evaluation of counseling effectiveness and as a tool for research contributions by and for counselors in the field. (Author/PC)",

The instruments used were the Career Maturity Inventory (Crites), and the Career Development Responsibility (CDR) scale (Thomas). Results showed that the main effects of occupational choice and levels of the CDR scale were significant. Students who were able to state an occupational choice had more mature career attitudes than those who were undecided. Although the main effect of sex was nonsignificant, the interaction between sex and CDR levels approached significance suggesting that sex and level of career development responsibility may have differential effects on the  development of mature career attitudes.

        "description":"The advent of federally funded programs to promote career development within the regular school curriculum has posed the problem of identifying or developing instruments which provide valid and reliable information to assess the effects of these programs. This study investigates the relationship between a number of noncognitive variables and the cognitive content (career information) of a career development project. A variety of instruments were administered on a pilot basis to a sample of 80 seventh and eighth graders. A revised form of the original instruments was administered to a sample of 122 students from the same school the following year. The samples consisted primarily of low socioeconomic blacks and represented the school's composition. Results indicate that there are  substantial and apparently stable correlations between control of environment, acceptance of responsibility for choice, and the amount of career information that students acquire in a career education program. There was an absence of correlation between program assessments by students and the other variables although such assessments were solidly positive, suggesting strongly that student assessment of the program is not a reflection of student maturity or cognitive success in the program.

Interviews with a small group of identified potential dropouts who remained in school and graduated resulted in the identification of factors associated with staying in school. A Svan-type scale (APDOS) for gathering and recording data from cumulative folders was adapted in 1969 and has been reviewed and validated annually since then. Data from the scale (APDOS) were used as major input to a committee working on modification of school practices. Teachers were offered inservice training to familiarize them with &quot;dropout&quot; factors and data gathering, and guidance program expension was effected. Conclusions and recommendations were:  (1) the continued involvement of local school personnel is needed; (2) the local coordinator of the project must be thoroughly sold on its value; (3) basic identifying information for each pupil should be provided to teachers before school starts to help establish this as a routine guidance procedure; (4) case conferences should be held with individual children with three or more checks on the APDOS; and (5) great need exists for specific attention to the development of study habit skills and attitudes.

This document suggests that the old methods are not workable, and therefore attention should be directed toward helping the child develop a good self-concept and teaching decision-making skills. In the You and Your Decisions project, written audiovisual and workshop materials were developed to help parents and teachers create an environment in which a child can learn about the decision-making process. An inservice training program was developed to motivate the teacher to provide a decision-making atmosphere in the classroom. Student materials emphasized the importance of a good self-concept and how it applies to the decision-making process. The  parent component stressed the importance of the child's right to make certain decision which affect him in his family situation. Good decision-making skills were viewed as helpful not only in preventing drug abuse, but in helping children deal more effectively with other temptations and frustrations in life. (Author/PC)",

Research into causes of drug abuse indicates that there is a strong relationship between certain behavioral characteristics and the tendency to abuse drugs. Some of these characteristics include: lack of self-esteem or self-worth; lack of a clear values system; child/parental attitudes toward sickness and the use of medicines. A teacher's manual is also included which suggests that teachers should allow at least one class period per chapter to enable students to verbalize their ideas and feelings about the subject matter. The teacher should act as a facilitator, introducing the topics and  keeping things moving, while encouraging the children to do most of the verbalizing. In preparation for the guide, questions were asked of several classes of elementary students. The children's own remarks are used throughout the booklet. The program covers areas such as \"feeling good\", decision making, values, bad feelings, having fun, and \"I Like Me.\" (Author/CJ)",

The author disputes the traditional method of counseling wherein the counselor attempts to identify single talents of the counselee. Instead, he contends that today there is a premium on adaptability in today's world of work. Shifting manpower needs, the geographic mobility of industry, and automation all contribute to the importance of an need for vocational adaptability among today's work force at all levels. Research in the area of vocations has more often focused on permanence of choice rather than mobility and transition between occupational choices. Although,  according to Super, \"each person has the potential for success and satisfaction in a stated number of occupations,\" research in this area has been sadly lacking. A career counseling process which supports the concept of multipotentiality will be better able to help the client anticipate change in his career coupled with the need to develop other abilities. The author concludes by describing the multipotential approach as having five phases: (1) readiness, (2) awareness, (3) exploration, (4) reality testing, and (5) confirmation. (Author/HMV)",

Traditionally, behavior analysis concentrated on how behavior is learned and how it can be taught, but not on which behaviors should be learned. Four steps are outlined in the analysis process, the first having to do with determining what behaviors are needed, and the other three having to do with the planning, implementation, and evaluation of behavior change procedures. Applied behavioral analysts, perhaps because of the laboratory origins of their approach to problems, have often ignored the processes and issues involved in \"setting\" behavioral objectives. Suggestions are made regarding how behavioral analysts can become  knowledgeable, skilled, and responsible through professional identification, training programs, and research and professional literature. A preoccupation with diagnosis is not generally recommended for analysts, although a greater concern for this aspect of the field is indicated. (Author/PC)",

Discrepancy scores derived from self-ideal differences were analyzed and found to support the hypotheses that inexperienced counseling students report greater self-ideal counselor discrepancies than experienced counselors. The differences dissolved, however, when the effects of increased formal training achieved by experienced counselors were controlled. Indices of both experience and formal training were shown to be related to reduction in counselors' self-ideal counselor discrepancy scores. Experience and formal training were also shown to  be interactive, and when their interaction effects were partialed out, counseling experience was shown to have a greater influence on reducing discrepancy scores than was level of formal training.

Since cohabitation arrangements are generally not brief but long lasting, their investigation should help clarify the nature of the cohesion of couples, whether cohabiting or married. It was found that couples advanced along a hierarchy of commitment, in which each step was evidence of a given level of commitment and in time lost its potency as commitment evidence as the relationship became more intense and additional evidence was sought. Cohabitants had to decide if they would be sexually exclusive and thereby give evidence  of commitment or if they should be nonexclusive so as to realize growth through sexual expression. Generally, their resolution was to give lip service to sexual nonexclusivity but to practice self-restricted sexual exclusivity. In this way, sexual exclusivity was added to the means available for proving commitment, and the cohabitants could still see themselves as sexually free. Shortlived cohabitant relationships were impermanent because expected commitment evidence was not forthcoming, and it became apparent to one of the cohabitants that the partner was holding back.

Vocational interests, as measured by the Strong Vocational Interest Blank for Men (SVIB-M), academic pursuits, campus involvement, and other factors were considered in an attempt to define a NSWL. Eighty-six items were chosen from the SVIB-M to form what was called the NSWL Scale. Results indicated that, as a group, the NSWL's were average in their basic interests, showed a tendency toward &quot;people-related&quot; professions, were in their early twenties, could be characterized as extroverted, were from a wide range of academic majors and were above average scholastically. Study recommendations call for a follow-up study using the new Strong-Campbell Interest Inventory and a rigorous  analysis of items in an attempt to create a more formal and valid NSWL Scale.

For this study, a lengthy structured interview was held with the mothers of 10 percent of the 6,400 children who had been tested in Stage I of the Cross-National Study of Coping Styles and Achievement, and with the mothers of 80 of the 800 children tested in Germany in Stage III. In half of these families, in all countries except Germany, the father was also interviewed, separately. The interview was designed to elicit the parent's description of the child's coping style and coping effectiveness, in and out of school; the parent's child-rearing practices; the parent's own coping style; and the  parent's aspirations and expectations for the child, educationally and vocationally. The interview transcripts were coded, then scaled, yielding highly reliable scores for 58 variables. These parent-derived scores were then correlated with relevant Stage I measures of the children, and the mothers' scores were correlated with the fathers' scores. The dominant finding was the notable lack of validity of the parent reports. The major conclusion was that parents, in all countries, were a very unreliable source of information about the hopes, efforts, coping style, or performance of their children. (Author)",

The primary purpose is to prepare individuals in the services to perform their duties efficiently. In the era of the All-Volunteer Force, military education must also represent a source of coherent career development for each individual who chooses to enter a service branch. Moreover, the growth that a person achieves while in uniform must be recognized by civilian employment and education institutions. In this context, the Department of Defense has begun efforts to make education more accessible, continuous, and creditable in relation to civilian career development requirements. This involves new attempts to establish greater integration of the  military and civilian components of the nation's education and guidance communities. The design, operation, and future direction of these new developments are discussed in terms of their implications for educational and occupational guidance. (Author)",

The goals of the model are to increase the ability of teachers and parents to work with students and to permit the services of the counselor to have greater effect with more students.

Research indicates that female students undergo a loss of academic ability and sense of self-esteem as they progress through school. Male students also respond to sexist practices in education. This paper identifies and delineates competencies to be included in programs of teacher education in an effort to eliminate classroom bias. Suggested competencies fall into four categories: (1) awareness, (2) clarification, (3) classroom behaviors, and (4) professional and societal behaviors. Competencies must be designed to confront and eliminate such debilitating practices as sex bias or they will not be  worth the modules into which they are incorporated. (Author/EK)",

The study further sought to determine levels of program adequacy for each of 43 typical characteristics. Characteristics were grouped into the broad activity areas of counseling, staff attitudes and relationships, facilities, program orientation and information, occupational counseling, follow-up, administrative policies and ancillary services. Forty principals and 82 counselors were surveyed in 25 school districts. Principals and counselors were additionally asked their opinions regarding the importance of the characteristics in local guidance and counseling programs. The study revealed few significant  differences within each respondent group when compared by urban and rural locations. The number of significant differences increased when the respondents were compared by professional positions. A high degree of homogeneity exists among the respondents in their reactions to the characteristics. This suggests some level of program improvement is recognized by both principals and counselors. Findings in this study tend to support the literature that principals and counseling staffs perceive the function and role of counseling differently. The study concludes that there is a need for clarification and agreement between principals and counselors concerning role perception and utilization of counselor skills. (Author/NM)",

Approximately 15 trainees participated in each of the three training sessions. Each trainee was a State employee who was required to conduct interviews to determine eligibility for medical assistance, money payments, SSA unemployment insurance, or food stanps. The average age of the participants was 34, and the average level of formal education was less than one year of college. The training sessions were designed to develop interviewing and counseling skills, appreciation of values held by different groups and a greater understanding of human behavior. The participants were first trained to discriminate among different qualities of  helper responses. They then practiced written responses to client statements of distress. Emphasis was placed on assisting the participants in sharpening their skills in making appropriate oral responses to client statements of need. The assessment of the enrollees' growth in discrimination, written communication and oral communication skills was made by administering paper-and-pencil tests and by scoring role-playing interviews prior to and following training. The data show that the interviewing-counseling skills of the participants were considerably improved at the end of training. Tables and appendices of paper-and-pencil tests are included.

Most of the structures comprising the quadrangle are one-half to three quarters of a century old, hence, they had become increasingly unpopular as a choice of campus residences. However, without major renovation, and with only minor expenses, the University Quadrangle has been turned into the most popular student residence on campus, through the efforts and imagination of a dedicated staff. The author attributes the new popularity of the hall to these innovations: (1) house projects--the living units are divided into distinct houses with different emphasis and interests as determined by the residents; (2) faculty in residence; (3) co-educational living; (4) a student  run coffee house; (5) a dark room for a student photography guild; and (6) acquisition of a potter's wheel and woodworking bench with a room set aside for their use. Special programs initiated include a faculty-student lunch program, a bimonthly film series, a Quad theater group, and various programs featuring special talents of the staff. Included in this paper are copies of various posters and advertisements for the above mentioned activities. (Author/HMV)",

Inclass participation of the tutor allowed for closer classroom observation of student behavior and instructor techniques. Contributions by the tutor-fellow to classroom activities were permissable at the teacher's discretion. Positive gains generated through the Undergraduate Fellowship Program were many, such as: (1) improvement in communication and integration of activities between departments; (2) improvement of relationships between the instructor and students; (3) more responsible and independent participation of the students in  classwork; and, (4) more conscientious preparation of students for classes. The Undergraduate Fellowship Program was viewed not only as a supportive aid to the students in need of assistance with their courses but also as a self-fulfilling experience for the students who served as tutor-fellows in the program.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to compare the shop achievement of secondary vocational-technical students who received one year versus two years of Area Vocational/Technical School (AVTS) instruction. One group attended the AVTS for both the 10th and 11th grade, while the other attended only for the 11th grade year. The criterion variable used to make the comparison was the Ohio Trade and Industrial Education Achievement Test. When ability was not taken into consideration, the one year group did at least as well as the two year group in terms of shop achievement. When differences in ability were taken into account the finding suggests that those students who received twice as much instruction did somewhat better on the shop achievement test as a total group. Beginning AVTS  instruction in 10th grade appears to result in greater shop achievement at the end of 11th grade than taking shop only in 11th grade; however, the amount of increase in achievement appears to be small and may not be of practical importance. Differences are variable from one specific trade knowledge area to another, and from one shop program to another. The importance of any differences depends somewhat on what basic knowledge is necessary to a specific trade or trade area. Some shop programs may suffer more than others from the elimination of the 10th grade year. (Author/NM)",

Students indicated the number of times they had taken a drug, how many times they had been offered a drug, and how many boys and girls they knew who took drugs. To determine whether a current adolescent drug abuse profile applied to the younger sample, questions and scales were developed from Wiener's research on English school children. Results indicate that use of drugs is not a  major problem for this particular fifth grade group although drugs were available to them. No indication of a general drug-prone profile developed for the sample. (Author/HMV)",

The Drug Use Scale was developed containing 134 items and dealing with five classes of drugs: marijuana, hallucinogens, stimulants, depressants, and opiates. Study subjects were male and female college students. Results of the assessment showed a positive relationship between attitudes, experience, and knowledge subtests. Drug users obtained higher knowledge scores than did nonusers, and showed more positive attitudes toward drugs. The study concludes that the Drug Use Scale is reliable. (Author/EK)",

The ensuing analysis emphasizes the racial composition of the sample and the relationship between the subculture of the two major racial groups and drinking styles leading to offensive behavior. Results of correlations between drinking behavior and crime are presented throughout the paper. They reveal that a very large majority of inmates tend to be \"regular\" drinkers, that a substantial portion of the inmates had previously experienced personal social complications as a result of drinking, and that these  experiences created the \"ideal\" circumstances conducive to the commitment of the criminal act. The results show strong evidence to support the relationship between drinking behavior and rate of recidivism. Study limitations were twofold: (1) its design sought only to explore commenctions between deviant acts and drinking; and (2) several important variables pertaining to the inmates' first experiences with alcohol were not examined.

Hypotheses that a person's competencies, activities, self-estimates, interests, and vocational choices can be organized by a six-category typology to understand and predict subsequent choice were tested. Samples of 894 men and 989 women took the Self-directed Search (SDS) at entry into two colleges and reported their occupational choices one or three years later. All hypotheses received support, although the predictions varied in efficiency. Other analyses indicated that current vocational choice is the best predictor of later choice, and that scores based on sex-specific norms are less efficient predictors than raw scores. The findings support both the theory and the  validity of the SDS assessment for men and women. Extrapolations from these conclusions are limited by the nature of the criteria and the population tested (College students). (Author/PC)",

On the basis of their response patterns to a set of Guttman scale items, the students were classified into three standards: abstinence, double standard, and the single standard of permissiveness. A racial comparison of the Mississippi sample with Reiss' Virginia student sample revealed striking similarities with one exception--a significantly higher proportion of Mississippi whites endorsed permissiveness without affection. The Mississippi data, however, failed to give strong support to the presumed prevalence of the double standard. Moreover, several social factors examined appeared to influence the standards of whites and females to a greater  extent than those of Negroes and males. Accordingly, the results suggest that residence does not significantly differentiate standards of premarital permissiveness among adolescent youth. (Author/PC)",

The aspirational data were obtained from the Daydreams section of the Self-Directed Search (Holland, 1972). Categorical and correctional analyses show that a person's retrospective vocational aspirations have coherence and yield efficient predictions. In addition, the degree of coherence or similarity among a person's vocational aspirations provides a potentially useful index of a person's decision-making ability. Vocational aspirations were also found to be more  predictive of future vocational status than were interest inventories, suggesting that these aspirations can serve as a validity check on the Self-Directed Search itself.

Twelve major components are outlined. Assessment of the client's potential is suggested as the counselor's major function in components 1 through 6, while planning and delivering services to assist the client becomes the major concern in components 7-12. These two major functions of the counselor, assessment and service delivery, are intertwined throughout the rehabilitation process. The systems model approach provides three useful functions which will enable counselors and counselor educators to promote the goals of rehabilitation. The model clarifies the counseling process, educates counselors in training as to their function as'rehabilitators,' and communicates the rehabilitation process to community members, thus promoting good public relations and encouraging the referral of handicapped persons to rehabilitation agencies where they may be assisted toward independence.

Careful consideration is given to the socialization of sex roles in children and how this relates to marriage expectations.

The socialization and sex role literature indicate the normative expectation for middle class females is for adult life to be based around marriage, so those women who never marry deviate from societal expectations. And, women who never marry usually deviate from the expectations of their associates and themselves, since the never-married role and identity generally are evaluated negatively. This analysis draws from existing studies, singles' advice books, and personal observations in considering the transformations of identity of women who do not follow the expected role sequence moving from eligible singles to married women, but instead become old maids. The processual  nature both of recognition of the possibillty of never marrying, as well as the strategies employed in adjusting to the unmarried role are analyzed. (Author)",

The Pearson product-moment correlations on the 16-PF ranged from .18 to .77; the mean correlation was .36. Statistical significance was reached on 14 to 16 factors. In a &quot;t&quot; difference analysis, significant differences were found on 9 of 16 factors. The Pearson product-moment correlations on the Personal Orientation Inventory ranged from .12 to .82 with a mean of .59. Statistical significance was reached on 11 of the 12 scales indicating that for individual women the relative ordering remained essentially the same except for the way in which they viewed the dichotomies of life. In a &quot;t&quot; difference analysis, significant  differences were found on 4 of the 12 scales. The results indicate that various personality characteristics have shifted in the direction of increased self-awareness, self-sufficiency, and inner resourcefulness. As a group, women religious appear to be more inner-directed, more aware of self-actualizing values, and more spontaneous with a higher regard for themselves. The investigators suggest that these shifts might, at least in part, be due to the growing modernization within religious communities and the resultant increasing flexibility and freedom of choice for women religious.

It is based on data concerning 249 consecutive readmissions of leave of absence patients occurring at Stockton State Hospital during a five and one-half month period. Results indicate that rehospitalization causes a breakdown in communication between the patient and his family, and that overt rejection is often the result.

A total of 98,016 people responded to a wide variety of reading exercises which were administered and scored by trained professionals. The results were then examined according to various group characteristics: sex, color, parental education, region of the country, and size and type of community (STOC). Reading objectives were formulated and reviewed by a cross section of scholars, educators, students, and lay citizens. The first five objectives represented the individual's ability to comprehend, analyze, use, reason logically, and make judgments concerning what he had read. The sixth reading objective was concerned with attitudes toward and  interests in reading. Some of the results indicated that there is a correlation between membership in certain groups and a low or high level of success on reading exercises, that school-age males read consistently below females, that blacks were consistently below the national population, that people from the Southeastern States were consistently below their counterparts in other States, and that students from inner-city areas read less well than those from any other STOC group.

This publication records the highlights of that conference: &quot;About the Institute for Services to Education&quot;; &quot;About the Thirteen-College Curriculum Program&quot;; &quot;The Relationship of reading to TCCP,&quot; which presents talks given by the president, the vice-president, and the senior program  associate, English, of ISE; &quot;Consortia Reading Concerns as Expressed by Reading Specialists,&quot; which presents some of the major concerns of college reading specialists with their college students; and &quot;Presentations by Special Consultants,&quot; which presents a talk on college reading curricula for black students and one on reading and linguistics. In addition, the &quot;Appendices&quot; present two reports on reading in the ISE English program and a list of conference staff members, consultants, and participants. (WR)",

In general, there has been a sufficiency of research, and what is now needed is action to implement the results already obtained. This action is needed in three areas: in helping to make good the severe deficiencies in oracy that exist in so many children before they come to school; in ensuring that teachers, both at the initial level and in service, are given better training in teaching beginners to read and are made aware of the results that research has already supplied; and in ensuring that steps are taken without delay to draw the attention of all  concerned with education to the problems that are caused by using traditional orthography to teach beginners to read and to encourage the use of proven alternatives.

        "description":"Basic research in speech and the lateralization of language is shown to illuminate the problems of reading and some of its disabilities. First, it is pointed out how speech for the ear differs from reading, or language for the eye. Perceiving speech is easy because, as members of the human race, we all have access to a special physiological apparatus that decodes the complex speech signal and recovers the segmentation of the linguistic message. Reading is hard because the phonemic segmentation, which is automatic and intuitive in the case of speech, must be made fully conscious and explicit. The syllabic method supplemented by phonics is suggested for remediation of segmentation problems. Second, it is posited that since the sounds of speech are processed differently from  nonspeech sounds, the two should not be diagnosed and remediated interchangeably. Third, it is shown that the relationships among cerebral lateralization for language, handedness, and poor reading can now be studied more meaningfully because of the recent development of new techniques.

        "description":"This study was designed to determine whether subjects who received one of three treatments of color cues in an instructional program differed significantly on three learning tasks. Subjects were randomly selected from the kindergarten populations of two Michigan public schools and were assigned to one of three treatment groups. Eight letter-like figures were presented to the 102 subjects in one of the three treatments: no color, maximum color, and maximum color added and then vanished. Subjects were pretested on the ability to match the figures to form and to match the figures from memory. Following the completion of a teaching sequence, subjects were posttested on the ability to match the figures to form, to match the figures from memory, and to associate a meaningless trigram  with each figure. The results indicated that the vanished color treatment was significantly better than the no-color treatment. From the results it was concluded that the vanished color treatment enhanced the learning of visual discrimination, visual memory, and paired-associate tasks when compared to the no-color treatment and that this enhancing effect seemed to result from improved attention to the distinctive feature of a stimulus.

The subjects were all the second graders in the same midwestern city whose teachers had chosen a certain grade-level reader for their reading instruction. The MFF test was administered to all of the subjects. The subjects were then asked to read test passages aloud and an examiner audio-tape recorded and noted errors in the children's oral reading. The miscues were coded for:  word order changes, substitutions of meaningful words, insertions, omissions, skipped words, and punctuation. Each miscue was categorized as graphically similar or dissimilar, as corrected or uncorrected, and as to its contextual appropriateness. The results indicated that no significant differences were found between reflective (REF) and impulsive (IMP) subjects in the proportions of graphically similar and contextually appropriate miscues, and IMP children appeared to correct fewer unacceptable miscues than REF subjects.

The free-recall tasks consisted of lists of 30 high frequency words. One list was composed of six conceptual categories; the other list consisted of 30 unrelated words randomly selected from the 1,000 most frequent words in the English language. The Category Width Test was administered two  days after the learning of the free-recall lists. Relationships were found between the average size of the groupings and the number of objects left ungrouped on the equivalence range task and the noncategorized free-recall task, whereas only the number of objects left ungrouped on the equivalence range task was found to be related to categorized free-recall. Band-width was related to observed-expected repetitions and the adjusted ratio of clustering. (WR)",

Since in a typical middle school, student reading ability may span eight grade levels, with four possible variations of problems--organizational, decoding/vocabulary, interest/purpose, and experience background--differentiation of instruction must be process oriented.

The five programs range from the most modest effort, which involves the face-to-face relationship of the college instructor with rural teachers, to the other extreme, computer-assisted instruction through a mobile van. Two types of administrative structure at Bemidji State College for providing direct contact of the college instructor with rural teachers are described. One involves a federation of area schools which follows the Individually Guided Education (IGE) model. The federation requests specific types of inservice workshops which are delivered in various schools with graduate credit granted through college extension. The other approach, which is a  competency-based program, provides undergraduate credits which may be applied toward a college degree for Head Start and day care teachers. The teachers attend workshops throughout the year at locations convenient to them, and they work through learning packages which provide content knowledge. Then at the working site of each student a college instructor checks a mastery of content knowledge as well as application of skills in the classroom. (Author/WR)",

Six experienced classroom teachers, representing all primary levels, were selected from a list of volunteers. The cycle of teacher expectations and self-fulfilling prophecy and its related literature were discussed. All available self-concept inventories were examined, and common items were selected and paraphrased into language aimed at the primary child. Following a first administration of the inventory the items were examined for their suitability and phrasing, and two inventories were created: one for the younger primary child and the other  for the more mature. Along with the two variations of the Teacher's Inventory of a Pupil's Self-concept (TIPS), a score sheet and a set of instructions for administering were developed. The major result was the development of the inventory; however there were also beneficial side effects: individual students' strengths and weaknesses were revealed, and individualization was facilitated.

Three different kinds of passages, chosen principally for their illustrative value rather than for any direct practical transfer to a particular classroom, are presented. Passage one briefly describes New  York City; suggestions for teacher use include discussing general background relative to the passage, use of questioning to facilitate understanding, and identifying the main idea. Passage two is a social studies passage and is presented to demonstrate multiple word skills and demonstrate a shift from literal to critical reading. The third passage presented is the opening lines from \"Dandelion Wine\" and is intended to serve as an example of introducing a story and as an exercise in entry to imaginative language. (WR)",

        "description":"To determine the effect of oral responses on cloze test, particularly at the primary grade level and with students of below average reading ability, was the purpose of this study. A total of 135 students from second, fourth, and sixth grades were included in the study. At each grade level the students were divided into above-average, average, and below-average reading ability groups with 15 students in each group. Two cloze forms were prepared for each grade level using a 10 percent lexical deletion pattern. Each student completed both forms at his grade level. The forms were read silently, and one was completed with written responses and the second with oral responses which were recorded by the examiner. The t-tests for correlated means showed no significant differences between  oral and written response scores at any of the three grade levels or for any of the reading ability groups. Significant positive correlations between the response modes were found at all three grade levels. The results indicated that oral responses did not affect cloze scores. Both response modes generally ranked students the same way. (Author/WR)",

The clinic-field relationship is characterized by a split two-day arrangement during the first two quarters of the program where each intern spends half of each day in the University Clinic and half of each day in his field assignment. Assumption of intern competency is made from observed performance in the field according to criterion-based evaluations which are continuous throughout the total program. Work toward competency in reading  education is initiated during the first quarter of clinic activities. Activities during the reading education portion occur in sequence: acquisition of knowledge, case typing of an individual student's needs, application of knowledge in an instruction situation with the case subject and with a small group, and application of pedagogical skills in the total classroom situation.

Cross-cultural studies have shown the systematic relationship between the culture pattern of a society and the basic personality and mode of cognitive functioning of the children who are reared according to the social institutions in that pattern. This article discusses the differences in the value placed upon reading in several countries, the linguistic differences in learning to read in different languages, the varied sexual restrictions or  customs in literacy education in the fourteen countries, and racial differences in reading instruction and achievement. The position of literacy on the scale of cultural priorities of the countries in the study is presented. And, finally, the cultural variation in the purpose of acquiring literacy is discussed. (TO)",

The project's instructional approach was built around the basal text because of its use in all of the region's school systems. No special equipment, such as reading machines, was used. Only common audiovisual items found in most schools, such as overhead projectors and tape recorders, were employed to any degree. The goal of the project, to diffuse better teaching practices in reading throughout the region, was operationalized through eight specific project objectives. Five of the objectives were closed objectives, stated in performance terms;  the remaining three were open objectives calling for the completion of specific activities. Not only did the project meet its objectives, but in many cases it enabled students to achieve a much higher level of performance than stipulated by the project objectives. The project demonstrated that effective steps can be taken to teach elementary children of the Upper Cumberland Region to read on an adequate level. (WR)",

Coordination of certain sense modalities, when present in the learning of a new written word, increases the probability that this word will be retained over a period of time. This coordination involves specific intersensory transfers (intersensory transfer refers to the ability to translate information from one sensory mode to another). This paper analyzes current word recognition instructional methods in terms of their intersensory transfer components. A perceptual model of word recognition, based on perceptual memory research, is then presented.

One hundred eighty kindergarteners were randomly selected from a racially mixed population and randomly assigned to one of four visual matching of letters tasks. All tasks presented letters of uniform size, shape, density, and presentation except for certain variations relevant to each of the four experimental treatments. All four treatments required subjects to match lower case letters to one lower case stimulus letter printed in the center of the page two inches from the top. Subjects were instructed to draw a cross on each letter on the rest of the  page that was exactly the same as the stimulus letter at the top. The letters presented on the rest of the page were designated response letters. The response letters included those identical to the stimulus letter and three foils. The results indicated that the vertical properties of b, d, p, and q influence the letter reversal behavior of kindergarteners. In addition, reducing the dominance of the vertical aspects of these letters resulted in marked reduction of reversal errors. (WR)",

Significant differences favoring the standard English readings were revealed for three measures of oral reading proficiency so the interference hypothesis was not supported.

The eight easiest and eight hardest texts were selected. Another eight texts were selected for use as practice passages. Two word lists were generated for each of the 24 texts. The type of word match determined whether the reader need only attend to the physical features of the words (Search Condition) or whether the reader had to make semantic interpretations of the words (Memory Condition). The subjects were paid high-school volunteers. Thirty-four served in the Search Condition and 34 in the  Memory Condition. Subjects in the Search Condition saw the list of words they had to match with text words before reading a passage. Subjects in the Memory Condition did not see the list of words before reading a passage. The results indicated that readability would have little effect on rate in the Search Condition when subjects matched words on the basis of physical identity. Matching for synonymity in the Search Condition caused subjects to read the passages more slowly. (WR)",

The attributes associated with one of the subclasses were presented in the first five sentences, and those of the other subclass were presented in the second five sentences. Forty-eight fourth graders were randomly assigned in equal numbers to one of four experimental conditions. Each subject was then presented one of the two passages either in a reading condition or a listening condition. Experiment two used slightly modified  experiment one passages mounted on slide transparencies. Each slide could be presented at a fast rate of three and one-half seconds or a slow rate of seven seconds. Fifth-grade subjects were shown the sentences at either the fast or slow rate, and in the listening condition sentences were read at either a fast or slow rate. The results indicated that when a passage was presented at a normal rate, the effect of imagery instructions on substance recall was relatively greater under listening than under reading conditions.

        "description":"The implications of a life-span developmental prospective for Piagetian theory and research are discussed in this paper. Initially, certain recent criticisms of the Piagetian system are evaluated. These include the interpretations of Piaget's abstract model of logical reasoning; his views concerning the interrelationship of hereditary, maturational, and socioexperiential factors; the similarities and contrasts present in the Genevan viewpoint and neo-Hegelian dialectical approaches; and the possibility of continued developmental change following the adolescent years. A brief overview of the research on Piagetian concept development beyond the years of adolescence is presented. These cross-sectional assessment studies which have included samples of elderly subjects have generally  found marked differences favoring the mature adult subsamples, similarities between the performances of the young children and aged subject subsamples, and/or apparent decrements in the performances of elderly persons on the Piagetian tasks. In a concluding section the philosophical, methodological, and practical implications of a straightforward acceptance of a life-span orientation are discussed. (TO)",

        "author":["Marliave, Richard"],
        "description":"The relationship between selective attention and learning is investigated in this paper. It is proposed that two forms of attention exist: (1) inspectional attention, which is a simple matching pocess where perceived stimuli are compared with an internal model of the stimulus for which the individual is searching, and (2) comprehensional attention, which combines the inspectional process with more complex cognitive operations. The stimuli which are searched for and recognized with comprehensional attention must be simultaneously processed with these cognitive operations. It is shown that this added complexity of comprehensional attention has physiological correlates which are qualitatively different from the corresponding concomitants of inspectional attention. The functions of  selected attention in learning are also examined. Emphasis is placed on the role of attention in developmental changes that usually occur in the 5-7 year age range. Transposition, reversal shift, and conservation learning processes are also considered. The function of attention in these learning processes is related to blocking effects and surprise. Stimulus novelty and complexity are shown to arouse comprehensional attention, thereby facilitating learning. (Author/WR)",

A diagnostic teacher needs a comprehensive acquaintance with the objectives of reading instruction. He or she should be familiar with the specific knowledges and skills expected to be mastered at many levels of the reading program and should have at hand detailed lists of those objectives for ready reference. In addition the teacher needs an acquaintance with a good sampling of materials that may be useful in a diagnostically oriented reading program. These include basal readers and their guides over a wide range of reading levels, related workbooks, independent workbooks  for specific skills, boxed multilevel materials of the kit or laboratory type, audiovisual hardware and software combining records with printed material, and commercially available reading games, as well as teacher-constructed materials. Also, the diagnostic teacher of reading needs school support, the ability to determine pupil needs and abilities, the ability to organize a class for instruction, an efficient record keeping system, and the ability to motivate students.

Cross-sectional and longitudinal data relating the time required to read orally 50 unrelated letters, 50 unrelated words, and 100 words in text among first to sixth graders and adults are presented. Metropolitan Achievement Test (M.A.T.) reading scale test scores were obtained and related to the time data. The results indicate a high level of developmental stability and strong relationships between the ability to read letters or words rapidly at an earlier age and the ability to read text rapidly at a later age. These results are interpreted on the basis that  a common ability must be involved in the time required to read all three types of materials. M.A.T. scores are also highly associated with reading times both concurrently and longitudinally. These results are interpreted as indicating the existence of a developmental reading speed ability which is not primarily dependent on word identification or context-using skills. The nature of this ability and educational and research implications are discussed. (TO)",

As far as book reading is concerned, research has revealed that on the average teachers do read more than the public. However, factors detrimental to teacher readership exist, including the teacher's job, the grading of student papers, housework, television viewing for relaxation, and children. Furthermore, there is evidence that some teachers do have reading difficulties. Thus, readership research involves the major implication that more stringent screening procedures are necessary in admitting students to teacher  training, an issue that the total university should face in assessing its academic influence during a student's formative training years.

Strategies for gaining comprehension during reading are discussed as being similar to those already used by the learner in listening: sampling, predicting, testing, and correcting. Three major cueing systems for achieving comprehension are discussed: graphophonic, which is basically concerned with using cues within words; syntactic, which includes the use of inflectional endings, grammatical relationships, and punctuation markers; and semantic, which involves the information the reader  has to bring to the printed page. An example of a child using the semantic and syntactic systems effectively is also presented. (WR)",

Using these conceptual relations in conjunction with vocabulary appropriate for the learned, formal, and informal language environments, a demonstration is presented of how a person may be able to express a concept using one set of vocabulary items, but not another set. The concepts can be taught without focusing on prestige or standard formal vocabulary. The syntax of thought is universal; the syntax of language is specific to a speech community. (TO)",

Currently there are three types of activities carried out under the general title of outreach: Basic Outreach, Co-sponsored Instruction, and Consultation. Basic Outreach is an information activity that involves talking to faculty members in departmental meetings, to classes, to several graduate students' associations, and to a wide range of other groups. Co-sponsored Instruction has two purposes: as a vehicle for delivering reading or study skills information at the co-sponsor's convenience, and as an effective \"teaser\" to more involvement in RASSL programs. In Consultation, the RASSL  staff works with interested faculty or staff on issues involving students' learning. An extensive example of outreach services is presented to explain and clarify the activities and the close relationship between outreach and regular RASSL classroom instruction. (TO)",

At Maricopa Technical College (Arizona) adult students have access to a special reading program emphasizing the language experience approach, capitalizing on students' life experiences and oral language facility. Otero Junior College (Colorado) teaches medical terminology in a Licensed Practical Nursing (LPN) program as the students meet the words in other course work. Language Masters help the LPN students master medical terminology through imitation and synthesis. The Informal Vocabulary Inventory used in the Reading Center at Ricks College (Idaho) is a quick and inexpensive diagnostic tool. The student lists the alphabet and then lists, alphabetically, as many words as possible  in 10 minutes. Another innovative and inexpensive diagnostic test used at North Idaho College diagnoses knowledge of phonetics, noun and verb usage, and reading comprehension. Multi-track options in a Learning Skills program are offered to any interested student at the University of Utah. The study and reading skills program at the University of Wyoming consists of programed mini-courses for developmental and speed reading, vocabulary building, spelling, listening, and several other topics.

Special emphasis is given to the diagnosis and treatment of children with severe reading problems. The influence of instruments such as the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities on the pattern of clinical and classroom practices in Australian education is traced. An approach which recognizes the interaction of aptitudes and teaching strategy is suggested as perhaps being the most efficient. Also suggested is that legislative or administrative convenience may not best serve children with learning disabilities and that teachers need training to understand both the learning process and the characteristics of exceptional  children.

        "description":"This paper reports on a two-year longitudinal study which determined the relative effectiveness of three methods of coordinating language arts instructional procedures and compared these methods with two methods in which components were not coordinated. The five treatment groups, to which 789 first grade students were randomly assigned, consisted of methods of instruction that either did or did not relate spelling to the basal reader. The instructional methods were: subjects taught to spell words that appeared in the reader; subjects taught from lists directly related to the reader; subjects taught spelling only incidentally as the children needed words for composition related to the reader; and subjects who had no spelling or written composition instruction but who engaged in  oral discussion and art activities which were related to stories in the basal readers. It was concluded that, since not all differences were significant, language achievement was most enhanced by teaching spelling words drawn from the children's basal reading series. Results favored methods relating spelling, reading, and/or oral language over methods in which these were not carefully related. (WR)",

Two hypotheses were tested: pupils in the control group and pupils in the experimental groups will not differ significantly in reading skill mastery, and teachers in the control group and teachers in the experimental groups will not change their perceptions of selected interpersonal variables. A total of 1,703 pupils and 69 staff teachers from 15 schools in Connecticut, Illinois, Minnesota, and Wisconsin participated in the entire study. Conclusions were that the percentage of pupils mastering skills was significantly higher on  the posttest than on the pretest, a comparison between the gains in the percentage of pupils mastering skills between treatment groups was not significantly different except for one skill, and the analysis of the teacher questionnaires revealed that for all of the treatment groups and on all of the measures of teachers' perceptions there were no significant changes.

Each student listened to 30 tape-recorded sentences-15 fully grammatical and 15 anomalous--through one speaker of a stereo system, and pressed a finger key as rapidly as possible on presentation of a tape-recorded click (at 4, 5, 8, 10, or 12 seconds) through the second speaker in the silent period following each sentence. Students then repeated each sentence verbatim 20 seconds after its presentation to insure perception of both sentence and click. Analysis of variance for  reaction times yielded a significant effect for semantic relations. Reaction times for anomalous sentences showed a strong linear downward trend, but those for grammatical sentences did not. Data support the hypothesis that the semantic organization of a sentence affects the ease with which it is processed. The effect of semantic organization seems to occur immediately after, not as, the full sentence is heard. (JM)",

The rationale for the arrangement of the theories on a critical continuum is that it provides a conceptual structure for discussion about disparate theories of symbolism and illustrates how problems introduced by one mode of criticism can be handled by shifting to another critical approach.

        "description":"Problems arising in teaching drama to high school students stem from their lack of usable allusions--previous experiences and learning--which enable them to understand and appreciate any literary genre. In attacking this problem, one approach enables the student to cope by using two methods of association: reliance on emotional relevance and reliance on situational relevance. In attacking the problem of drama presentation, student acting proves ineffective in producing credibility. Student reading is more appealing to the student but fails when the average student must rely on his imagination, while student watching provides the most valuable learning method. Whether this latter method employs live performance, television, or videotape, students should be given background  information before viewing the play, after which directed discussion and supplementary materials will help students to relate the play to life and other literature, thereby building up their banks of usable allusions.

Through various interaction exercises, the student becomes sensitive to nonverbal messages, is enabled to reveal his feelings about himself, and can develop a sense of the relevancy of literature to the world as he sees it. Helping students become acquainted when forming new groups are the \"identity reflection\" and \"preparticipation self-analysis\" exercises; a \"decision making\" exercise based on a particular topic or story helps students relate personally to the subject matter; and the students are given practice in discussion skills through the \"triad problem\" exercise, which involves two-way communication--those group members who present the  problem and those who receive it--plus an observer who provides necessary feedback. Such projects have proved valuable in achieving effective educational aims. (A list of references is included.) (JM)",

As subjects, 72 black, preschool children in lower-class neighborhood day care centers of New York City were randomly assigned to one of six conditions, with each group consisting of six boys and six girls. Models were two dark brown, neuter gender hand puppets representing an adult and a child, while visual stimuli consisted of three pictures--a drum, a clown, and a dog. In the pretest, a visual stimulus was presented to all children who then wrote a story about it. Four modeling conditions varied in either the linguistic  style (Black English or standard English) or the relative lengths of the modeling story, while two control groups provided comparative information. Children's pretest and posttest responses were tape-recorded. The major finding revealed that modeling in a shorter sequence, using Black English, caused greater verbal productivity. (JM)",

        "description":"When teaching composition to speakers of Black English, instructors should be aware of the dominance of oral expression in black culture and base the writing program on developing the students' present language abilities. The social value placed by inner-city blacks on oral expression is evident in the varying verbal contests carried out when interacting with the establishment or authority figures (i.e., \"shucking,\"\"jiving\") and among themselves (\"rapping,\"\"running it down,\"\"signifying,\"\"sounding,\"\"ranking,\"\"styling' out\"). This expressive mode is different from that of middle-class speakers in function, being closely involved with performance (self-projection) and audience, and depending on a large body of shared knowledge. In developing a composition program, emphasis  should be on teaching students how to handle situations not dependent on shared knowledge--frozen, formal communication. A practical way to do this is with a group writing project which permits interaction (familiar to them), first in a group play and later in group theme writing, building on the students' skills.

Inspired by the literary and artistic works of a jail inmate sentenced for life, the program included the showing of a compelling videotaped interview of this man, an exhibit of prison art work, the playing of a record made by a prison singing group, speeches by three representatives of the Fortune Society--two by former prison inmates and the third by the society's director, a panel discussion, a series of dramatized scenes from prison life, and  a reading presented by five members of a reformatory theater group.

Various critics of the Arnoldian concept of culture, including Walt Whitman, G. John Roush, and Louis Kampf, have attempted to explain the separation of the Arnoldian ideal from ordinary reality, in his day and ours. However, Arnold's concept that the provincial spirit--the ordinary self--opposes the ideal of the potential best self--led not by a class spirit but by a general humane spirit--is suprisingly applicable to Americans today.  Arnold shows most clearly how imperfect and inhumane our destiny will be if Americans cannot transcend their trend toward provinciality. (JM)",

        "description":"Previous research has found that spoken rehearsal is superior to silent rehearsal during verbal discrimination learning. The frequency theory posits that verbal discrimination (VD) learning improves as the frequency differential between the correct and incorrect member of each pair increases. Erlebacher, Hill, and Wallace (1967) tested this hypothesis by administering a recognition memory test immediately following a VD task and found that subjects correctly identified more previously correct than incorrect VD items. The present experiments of the frequency theory were replicated in a manner similar to that of Erlebacher. A total of 80 paid college students (40 subjects in each experiment) were used. The stimuli consisted of 100 low frequency words from the Thorndike-Lorge  tables; 50 of these words were randomly selected for a VD list. The results of the experiment clearly support the frequency theory prediction that pronunciation during informative feedback increases the differential between the correct and incorrect member of the VD pair, although it is unclear how this occurs.

Black English, a dialect with linguistic principles whose roots can be traced to West Africa, has not been accepted by most educators although it has been shown to bee a logical mode of expression. The effect of focusing standard English onto students accustomed to using black English has been negligible. Moreover, the proposal that children be taught to read and write in their own dialects and then be allowed to switch to standard English after they have grasped the principle of correspondence between written letters and  spoken language will not preserve our heritage of dialects. Implicit in the right to language is the responsibility for communicability, but until more is written and understood in black English, many questions remain unanswered concerning its communicability.

The view set forth in this paper is that &quot;voluntary behavior&quot; is only that behavior which is verbally controlled and that such behavior is disturbed when the verbal instructions conflict with the child's own movements (stereotypia), or with his immediate perceptions (echopraxia). While Soviet psychological theory posits that voluntary behavior is typically verbally controlled behavior, it is argued here that voluntary behavior is only that behavior which is verbally controlled.

Also effective are student references to both critical works and humorous literature about Shakespeare, informal discussions in  class or on buses en route to or from plays, listening to records, viewing filmstrips or movies, and acting in class or for special assemblies. In addition, the Folger Shakespeare Library's &quot;Newsletter&quot; and &quot;The Shakespeare Newsletter&quot; from Kent State University also help students to become enthusiastically familiar with Shakespeare.

However, two main hurdles to teaching language skills well are the separation of reading as a lone subject and the ignoring of speaking and listening skills in many curricula. Although reading instruction eventually develops into literature study, listening must be taught intentionally, not incidentally, and persuasive speaking is necessary in involving the listener. The teaching of writing skills should also begin in the primary grades, as should the rudiments of logical thinking. Textbook language programs can be sequenced to provide increasingly demanding reading experiences and wider language skills  study. In addition, textbook programs should include valid performance objectives and evaluation.

A significant interaction of retention interval by race was obtained; for example, on the immediate test white subjects obtained higher recognition scores than black subjects while retention test recognition scores were higher for the black subjects on the one-week interval. These results supported an earlier hypothesis by  F. H. Farley of arousal, memory, and the conditions of testing in black-white learning and memory research, suggesting in addition that the race of the experimenter may be crucial to the analysis of the black subjects' task performance.

The argument consists of three points: that the thesis of complementarity is recognized in the combination of the philosophy of science with a stated preeminence for the epistemological subject in hermeneutics; that hermeneutic understanding must be conceived of positivistically in order to subsist in this complementary relationship; and that the maintenance of the specific achievement of hermeneutics means the emancipation of inquiry from  the cognitive monopoly of science. These three points are derived from the standpoint of Critical Theory as reflected in the Frankfurt point of view. Critical Theory's task has been to show the appearance of the increasing authority of science and thus amounts to an argument against a science of human communication. (Author/RB)",

A and B are human agencies from different cultures whose relationship is one of communication interchange. X is the symbol system by which they communicate.

There are three aspects of Epstein's work on this film that merit attention: his deployment of filmic motion and superimpositions for the purposes of both revealing and concealing, his synesthetic &quot;playing&quot; with the faculties of seeing and hearing, and his use of the elements of fantasy. With this film, Epstein questions both the nature of reality and the nature of fantasy. (The author's purpose is to discuss one film as an  aesthetic unity.) (RN)",

To counter these disadvantages, the creation of an awareness group time--half an hour each day--provides all children within the class with a chance to speak freely and listen to others on matters of personal concern and to establish closer relationships among themselves. Also benefiting from these discussions, the teacher must establish a warm, non-critical atmosphere which inspires the children's trust, draws out shy children, and gently but firmly deals with aggressive children. From discussions, drawings,  puppet plays, and role-playing within these awareness groups, the migrant child may become more aware of his feelings and what triggers them, of his potential capabilities, and of the interpersonal consequences of his behavior.

As defined in this study, leadership contention differs from leadership in that it is comprised of behaviors individuals derive from their beliefs about what leaders do and is also specifically concerned with a developmental process through time. Following a review of the literature which proved to be inadequate in providing logically valid hypotheses, the next step in the investigation was the analysis of communicative behaviors of three groups of five people recorded on video tape during 4-hour periods. The bulk of the study is devoted to explaining the logical paradoxes encountered in studying leadership contention and gender differences  and to demonstrating the role of the researcher's socialization in his or her construction of the group under investigation.

        "description":"Although the cultural stereotypes which the mass media disseminate about the roles of men and women are often discussed in general terms, the actual nature of these stereotypes in the present American culture has not been fully or systematically explored. This study examined part of the system of cultural stereotypes relating to men and women on television--specifically, the operation of male-female knowledge stereotypes that are displayed through the giving and receiving of advice and orders on afternoon and evening TV dramas. Clear-cut differences between the sexes in knowledge and approach to knowledge, tending to fall along and reinforce traditional stereotypical lines, were found in their interactions with each other, with men always shown at the nexus of ultimate power. The  nature of the male-female stereotype did not change between soap operas (with overwhelmingly female audiences) and evening dramas (with mixed audiences). Rather, the soap operas emphasize those aspects of the stereotype most favorable to women without diminishing in importance the role of men. In this manner, the fundamental strictures of the culture are not violated while the expectations and desires of the female audience to see itself portrayed in central roles are gratified. (TO)",

A contrast is drawn between the idea that meaning is \"in people\" and the speech act theory that meaning is an interpersonal construct. There are nine conditions of interpersonal communication that must exist for a statement to have meaning to a speaker and a listener: both persons speak the same language; the speaker articulates a promise in the sentence uttered; in expressing that promise the speaker obligates himself to a future act; both the speaker and the listener have a clear preference for the speaker keeping his promise; the promise predicates a future act that normally would not happen without the making of the promise; the  speaker is sincere in his purpose: the speaker intends that the utterance of the sentence will place him under an obligation to do the future act; the speaker intends to produce in the listener the knowledge that the utterance of the sentence places the speaker under an obligation to do the future act; and the semantical rules of the dialect spoken by the speaker and the listener are such that the sentence is correctly and sincerely uttered.

Early forms of protest in black drama revealed the desire to become active members of American society. Following a void in black playwrighting during the reconstruction period of the late nineteenth century, black intellectual rebellion was expressed in the 1930s, experienced a hiatus during the 1940s, and revived seriously in the late 1950s with Lorraine Hansberry's &quot;Raisin in the Sun.&quot; Black drama during the 1960s exploded with plays of social protest aimed at the many characteristics of a sick society, then gave way by the end of the decade to concern with blacks  themselves--self-determinism. Black revolutionary theater has progressed from disruption by white rowdies to the possibility that revolution in black theater may soon be out-dated. (JM)",

It was hypothesized that the amount of information which respondents indicated they received from paid political advertisements, editorials, supporters of the candidates, news reporters, and the candidates themselves and the amount of information available about the candidates' personal lives, campaign issues, the candidates' personal characters, and the candidates' political backgrounds would have a greater than chance relationship to the semantic differential scales for George McGovern and Richard Nixon. Respondents were drawn from three Southern Illinois counties and St.  Louis County in Missouri. While both hypotheses were confirmed, it appears that it is the message type rather than the amount of information received which affects candidate image. Further research relative to the content of the messages within various media is necessary before any definitive explanation of the effect of sources, message, and channel on candidate image can be made.

A group of 309 students enrolled in twenty class sections of Fundamentals of Speech Communication at Purdue University participated in the study. Subjects were administered a revised version of the Personal Report of Confidence as a Speaker. The final instrument contained two 8-item subscales measuring speech anxiety and exhibitionism. On the basis of student response to the 16-item instrument, subjects were divided evenly into low, medium, and high levels of speech anxiety and exhibitionism. A 32-item questionnaire was developed representing eight classifications (content and delivery, positive and negative, personal  and impersonal, atomistic and holistic). For each statement, the subject responded as to whether he would prefer to receive the comment orally in front of the class, in private written form, or whether he had no preference. The results indicated that oral criticism in the classroom should probably be impersonal and atomistic, and that female students prefer the private, written mode more than do male students. (WR)",

Each of five sets of scales was used to measure perceptions of a different cultural group: black, Chicano, native American, Anglo, and Filipino. The data were collected from 89 students enrolled in basic speech communication courses at the University of New Mexico. The students were randomly selected and instructed to indicate their feelings about each cultural group as accurately as they could for each scale. The findings indicated that similar factor structures were found  when measuring the perceptions of co-cultures together or separately. In the second stage, attitudinal changes across activities and cultures were measured. A group of six Anglo and six Chicano subjects engaged in a series of four co-cultural activities, and subjects also responded individually to attitude scales. The findings indicated that there is no difference in the effects of certain co-cultural information activities on attitude changes toward other cultures. (WR)",

A random sample of 20 days was selected, and on each of these 20 days the evening newscasts for all three television networks were recorded on audio tape. The results indicated that Nixon received a greater total amount of news coverage than did McGovern, but that the three networks carried significantly more anti-Republican judgments than anti-Democratic judgments. The verbal data were not particularly clearcut on the question of bias for  one candidate or the other, but the nonverbal data showed an overall pattern which can be interpreted as a pro-McGovern bias. Further analysis indicated that, while ABC showed little significant bias for either candidate, it appears that television news can be relatively unbiased in terms of verbal content and, at the same time, biased in terms of nonverbal content.

To enhance open culture understanding of the terms propaganda and agitation, the research delineates their closed culture functions. A communication design of the concept of feedback in specific closed culture propaganda and agitation is presented to illustrate intercultural concepts and functions. The design also serves to exhibit the intercultural effect of lack of information, definition confusion, and misconceptions of function.

        "description":"In an attempt to discover improved classroom teaching methods, a class was turned into a business organization as a way of bringing life to the previously covered lectures and textual materials. The simulated games were an attempt to get people to work toward a common goal with all of the power plays, secret meetings, brainstorming, anger, and friendship choices. The idea was to structure the members of the class into a hierarchical organization with organizational goals and functioning departments similar to those of a training-consulting firm. The instructor declared himself to be the general manager, not to keep control, but to stay out of the mainstream of the flow of communication. Organizational positions were assigned to each individual based on expressed preferences in  response to a written description of each organizational slot. The advantages of this type of teaching method are the realistic experiences and the official and secret power plays and communication attempts. (RB)",

The following proposition was investigated: there are independent source versus receiver dimensions and independent-formal versus informal-context dimensions of self-reported communication apprehension. The Personal Report of Communication Apprehension and a 45-item instrument focusing on apprehension in the reception of communication were given to 324 undergraduate college students. The results indicated that a separate dimension or type of communication apprehension exists for the receiving function of communication. Both a factor analysis and a correlational analysis indicated that self-reported receiver apprehension varies independently of self-reported  apprehension experienced by sources of communication.

Society still expects the main responsibility of child rearing to be that of the mother, while the speech profession, which has prepared all students to be teachers and scholars, is uncooperative in providing either a sabbatical leave for parenthood or part-time employment when the mother is ready to re-enter the profession. As evidence of such negligence of professionally trained mothers, of the eight women honored at the recent meeting of the Speech Communication Association in New York, six had never been married and neither of the other two was a parent. Obviously, the speech profession consists of successful, mature women devoted  exclusively to their careers and young, single women. The missing middle group should be allowed back in the profession.

It is argued that stimuli are selected differentially because of the perceiver's experiential codification sophistication: a preference for using some codes rather than others exists in relation to previously learned verbal and nonverbal language development. Interpersonal perceptual selection of transmissions occurs in relation to the receiver's coding expertise in symbolic, sign, action, and object languages. The dominant language processing ability for a particular situation is hypothesized to be instrumental in producing individual differences in perceptual selection of interpersonal messages.

A number of criteria which stressed the perceived need for greater flexibility, reality, and comparative studies were suggested for evaluating the potential of the written simulation for decision-making research. The written simulation was then viewed in terms of this context. While written simulations have potential for studies in the field of decision making, there are two serious shortcomings: simulations with realistic content are still artificial, and written simulations are limited by the ability,  sensitivity, and creativity of the writer.

Two different types of summary techniques, a mnemonic and a traditional type, were identified and compared with each other and with a third treatment involving no summaries. One hundred and eleven volunteer subjects were randomly assigned to the three treatments and were given the &quot;Goyer Organization of Ideas Test,&quot; which was used as a covariate. Although previous studies showed no effect of summaries on recognition as measured by multiple-choice tests, it appears that summaries are a significant aid to recall of the main points of a message. Further, some summaries seem to be more effective than others, as shown by the significantly higher recall scores of  subjects who heard the mnemonic summaries versus subjects who heard the traditional summaries.

These histories examine films on a thematic level, offering noncinematic interpretation such as literary meaning, social significance, philosophical connotation, and the historical paraphernalia surrounding films. To partially resolve this problem, serious film research on classic films and specific cinematic styles should be undertaken, and archives of film classics should be established which allow repeated viewings of films and parts of films in the close structural analysis of sequences. In addition, a cinematic methodology including direct  investigation of the formal strategy of certain groups of films should be permitted.

Because significant changes in enrollment patterns have occurred during the past few years in institutions of higher education, this edition shows, for the first time, alternate total and first-time degree credit enrollment projections. The published sources of data are noted in each table. The tables are grouped by subject matter -- together with detailed explanations of inclusions, exclusions, and descriptions of the data and projection methods. Separate chapters provide data on enrollments, graduates, teachers, expenditures, and tuition and other changes. Footnotes to the  tables state the assumptions on which the projections are based, with references to tables and other data in the appendixes giving detailed technical explanation of estimation and projection methods. The appendixes also include selected details of classification changes, a glossary of terms, and a number of auxiliary tables. (Author/MLF)",

The game gives all persons interested in the school an opportunity to \"purchase\" the kind of education they feel is needed. A player is given 20 Play money bills, each in the denomination of $100, and he spends the money according to the amount of educational time and effort he feels should be devoted to a particular area. Choices are made within the nine areas of the 3 R's; social studies; science; work world; the arts; health, P.E., and safety; making choices; relationship with others; and development of self. Participants are also asked to rank their current school program (for a specific grade level) in each of  these nine areas. Responses are then tabulated by computer and when the results are in, the school can move forward in curriculum development in accordance with the priorities of the school community. This publication contains a copy of the game, describes its development, and presents a case study of its implementation in an Atlanta school district. The community public relations and administration and costs of the game are also discussed. (Author/DN)",

The development of the project, its funding, and its components are outlined. The Chicago component is described as focusing its efforts on the problems unique to the urban community; the Santa Clara County component as working on bettering the planning process in communities moving from rural to urban characteristics; and the Dallas component as utilizing existing computer capability to develop simulation models which will  promote better planning, as well as more efficient operation in a variety of school systems. All three components have worked toward the establishment of a National Center for Educational Planning.

This general uplifting can be accomplished only through broadened educational efforts at the grassroots community level. Although there are many common elements in the various community education programs currently in operation, there is undoubtedly as much variety as commonality in the scope, purpose, organization, administration, and operation of the programs. However, all community education programs are based on a common belief that the school exists to improve the community of which it is a part and consequently to strengthen society as a whole.

Although most of the attention given to the law since its passage has focused on its impact on colleges, Title IX will have the greatest impact on the elementary and secondary levels of education. All school districts in the country receiving federal funds will be required to abide by these regulations in order to continue receiving funds. This legislation does not prohibit different entrance requirements for boys and girls to schools for the academically or artistically talented, nor does it prohibit single-sex schools, except for vocational schools. However, all other aspects of public school policy will, in one way or another, be affected by Title IX.  Although the implementing regulations of Title IX have not been finalized, from the proposed regulations released in June 1974, it is possible to determine the type of school policies that will require changes. This report describes some of those policies. (Author/JF)",

The problems have changed from what to do about overcrowding, double sessions, and temporary facilities, to what to do about empty classrooms. The report examines this counter-phenomenon of shrinkage to find its extent, possible duration, and some of the strategies being developed to cope with surplus space. The authors interviewed over 100 school districts in 40 States and invited 25 of the larger cities to respond in writing to questions about their enrollment projections, whether they had excess space, and their plans for using it. The numbers needed to justify a decision to close a school form the basis of an  analysis and recommendation. The report deals directly with how future population numbers are calculated and discusses the strategies and procedures that follow when a population is too thin for existing school facilities.

This report tells the story of rehabilitating sturdy, often handsome structures, ideally combining in one building several uses including public transit as a component of multiple use. Ten examples of the successful reuse of stations have been selected, representing different sized stations, uses, and ways in which reuse has been accomplished. Despite these and other encouraging examples of reuse, many architecturally  resplendent stations remain in jeopardy. Five examples are given of endangered stations sited on highly valuable urban land. An analysis of the economic routes open to those interested in acquiring and reusing railroad stations points out the limited money available and the necessity of the private sector joining with government if the larger stations are to be saved.

        "description":"Succession socialization is the movement of an aspirant from candidate to protege to administrator. The 'rites of passage' are delineated as announcement, training, and advancement. The vehicle is the sponsorship mode which entails identification, adoption, and molding of the protege in the attitudinal image of the sponsor. Completion of succession socialization (that is, acceptance by administrators) is achieved after the protege displays an appropriate administrative perspective. However, informal promotional practice results in the exclusion of ethnic minorities and women. Faulty characteristics are subconsciously and consciously attributed to minorities and women, with the assumption that these qualities would prevent them from functioning in an administrative role. Because  of historical resistance by minorities to acculturation, and because socialization is a form of acculturation, sponsorship is not sought. Thus, since succession socialization is the established informal route to promotion, culturally diverse persons are filtered out, not on the basis of competencies and competion, but on unfounded stereotypic characteristics and favoritism.

        "description":"This report explores some techniques that could assist educational managers in their attempts to arrive at more optimal input and output mixes. Following a review of the literature on input-output analyses in education and a description of the Pennsylvania Educational Quality Assessment Program (the basis of the present study), an empirical analysis utilizing single- and simultaneous-equation systems was conducted. Because the regression coefficients indicate the expected change in any one output, reflective of changes in one or more inputs but not in the overall level of educational output, output indexes based on the canonical correlation technique are presented. The analysis supports the contention that some reallocation of resources could enhance the outputs of the  educational system. A strong argument is made in favor of the development of a simultaneous-equation system. The canonical correlation technique was found to be useful in developing an overall output index. Although the output indexes are not very sensitive to changes in the output set, they are sensitive to changes in the input set. (Author)",

        "description":"This presentation describes the year-round school operation of the Chula Vista City School District in California. Chula Vista adopted the 45-15 year-round plan to help ease a shortage of classroom space while maintaining a quality program for children. Under the plan, each pupil attends school for about nine weeks and then has vacation for three weeks. Throughout the year, one-fourth of the pupils are on vacation at any time. Major advantages of the year-round program are that the long summer vacation is redistributed into shorter seasonal vacations, the school facility is in use 12 months a year, variations in teacher contracts are possible, and most of the benefits of the traditional school program are retained. Disadvantages include the break in the tradition of a long summer  holiday, difficulties in scheduling and communication, more expensive maintenance, and the need to study and consider vacation programs throughout the entire year. The document also considers answers to questions often asked about implementation of a year-round school program. The 1974-75 year-round school calendar for each student group is included.

        "description":"One way in which the analysis of educational finance reform might be broadened to include an analysis of the fiscal effects of such reform is to show fiscal competition between large cities and their suburbs. It is not possible to say that &quot;most central cities&quot; or &quot;most suburban areas&quot; deserve a greater share of State educational aid. Rather, there appears to be significant variation among metropolitan areas in the relative fiscal position of the central city. School finance reform is not the only State policy that has potentially significant fiscal effects. For instance, the issuance of nonproperty taxes -- especially &quot;commuter&quot; taxes -- might play an equally important role. Evidence suggests that State aid to local education is already a pro-suburban program. A reform of school  finance is likely to make the program even more pro-suburban. There is probably no one single optimal school fiance reform plan which can be applied uniformly everywhere. (Author/DN)",

Despite the existence of fairly sophisticated central planning machinery in Ireland and an active desire for reform on the part of the government (with an explicit policy on school location, buildings, curriculum, etc.), the school networks in the County still remain largely outdated and ill-adapted to modern circumstances. This situation results in costly under utilization of resources, a lack of equality of educational opportunity and supply, and inadequate pedagogical provision. The County is highlighted geographically and placed comparatively in the Irish context under the headings of demography, economic and social background, and educational system.  Profiles of the school networks are given, and an analysis and a diagnosis are made of the first and second levels respectively. Internal comparative analysis by catchment area is made separately for the two levels under enrollment, transport, teaching staff, curriculum, physical facilities, costs, and financing. Prognoses and proposals for future school networks are made, and an enrollment forecast to 1976 is made against a background of the economic and social development perspective and the demographic trends for the County. The methodology, parameters, and principles of school mapping are presented. (Photographs may reproduce poorly.) (Author/MLF)",

This review, by emphasizing the importance of the human role in development, has raised questions as to the more efficient use of educated manpower, the under employment of trained people, the 'brain drain', and how education and training, whether undertaken at home or abroad, could make a greater contribution to the total development of a country. The aim of this monograph is to review the study abroad problem, in order that educational planners and administrators -- particularly in developing countries -- might be informed of some of  the recent thinking on the subject. Certain suggestions are made which may help in the more efficient planning and administration of study abroad in the framework of total educational and development planning. (Author/MW)",

Findings indicate in part that there is no consistent relationship between superintendents' salaries and staff size, enrollment, operating expenditures, or average family income; more time is spent by superintendents in fiscal management and budget planning than in any other activity; and the average superintendent has less than one year of work experience outside the field of  education. As a result of the study, it was recommended that women be provided equal access to school superintendencies, a rational basis for superintendents' salaries be established, legislation be initiated to allow competent candidates (other than educators) to compete for superintendencies, and that steps be taken to assure that graduate programs and inservice training programs be pertinent to current job requirements.

Exogenous variables include socioeconomic backgrounds of students and their classmates, school spending, race, and region. The results suggest that: (1) school spending has its main impact on income through the channel of school continuation; (2) the time-discounted income gains associated with increased educational spending are smaller than the requisite spending increase; and (3) cross-sectional test score information can yield misleading results about the long-term effectiveness of schooling improvements. The results are reconciled with basic theoretical propositions in economics. (Author)",

        "description":"This project developed a conceptual framework for viewing educational planning. The original framework was based on a review of literature. A questionnaire was developed and distributed to school districts involved in systematic planning. Four of those districts, each with a distinctive approach to planning, were subjected to case study. The data generated by the Educational Planning Process Questionnaire (EPPQ) and the four case studies were analyzed using the original conceptual framework. The framework was then modified and expanded to account for key variables identified in the present study. The refined framework, which includes 18 variables found to be significant in educational planning, was organized around three basic questions: (1) What are the specific techniques and  methodologies of the planning approach? (2) How does the planning approach gain and retain legitimacy and effectiveness in the school system? and (3) How is the planning approach actually used in the school system? The primary contributions of the project include the development of the conceptual framework and the case studies, theory building, and instruction; the presentation of testable propositions about educational planning; and baseline data on the state of educational planning. A selected bibliography is included. (Author)",

The systems approach provides an analytic strategy for task decomposition into sequentially, temporally ordered activities without necessarily dictating the process by which distinct activities are to be accomplished. The planning techniques discussed in this paper are modified versions of the Program Evaluation and Review Technique and, like PERT, descend from network and graph theory. However, combined use of the time file and the procedural timetable appear to provide a definite, practical approach to significant increases in management performance as well as several  advantages not associated with the use of PERT.

The center represents the first prototypical application of the Multi-Activity Zones for Education (MAZE) system. This study attempts to demonstrate and test the physical and operational performances of the MAZE system and explore its educational implications. The responsiveness of the MAZE system to these concepts has been achieved by redefining the nature of two elements that make up an environment--space and hardware. A nonprogramed, multifunctional informal space and a set of mobile, activity modules that function as environmental control elements, i.e., containers for a wide range of teaching/learning media and stimuli for tactile  interactions, have replaced traditional, monofunctional space and equipment. These modules operate in spatial zones and can continuously generate and transform a wide range and scale of activities. Since these modules can be manipulated by all of the teaching/learning participants, the system responds to individual as well as to group behavioral and educational needs. To secure an evaluation of the multifunctionality of MAZE, the modules were physically manipulated over a 10-week period, providing continual changes in the learning environment. Each modification of a module and/or activity zone was preceded by observations that recorded the effects of physical change on learning, child-child and teacher-child interaction.

The population for the study consisted of 189 elementary schools of the Cleveland Catholic School System from which was drawn a sample of 40 schools. In addition to the general question posed, three more specific questions were asked: (1) Did the frequency of feedback affect the degree or amount of change in principals' behavior? (2) Did the quality (positive or negative) of feedback affect the degree or amount of change in principals' behavior? (3) What was the interaction between the frequency and the quality of feedback? Findings indicate that feedback does affect principals' behavior as perceived by teachers. In all instances, with the exception of \"positive only\"  feedback of task assistance, there were either differences or changes in the principals' behaviors which were in excess of differences or changes in the control group. Negative weekly feedback, in the absence of positive feedback, is the most effective means of producing change in principals' behavior as perceived by teachers. (Author/WM)",

More specifically, it compared the Multiunit School-Elementary (MUS-E) type of school organization with that of the nonMUS-E type. Adaptiveness, or the activities that elementary school staffs carry out to adapt instructional and learning programs to the differences identified among children, was measured with regard to student activities, teacher activities, and individualization. Data were analyzed using multiple stepwise regression techniques with no exclusion or inclusion criteria. While the study did provide  evidence that organizational structures were related to organizational adaptiveness, it also revealed that factors in addition to the structural variables were contributing to the adaptiveness of MUS-E schools. In other words, although MUS-E and nonMUS-E schools showed substantially no difference with regard to their organizational structures, MUS-E schools were significantly more adaptive. (Author/DN)",

        "description":"Because it included only public schools and guaranteed both school survival and staff employment rights, the first year of the Alum Rock demonstration (1972-73), as sponsored by the Office of Economic Opportunity, was not a test of vouchers as defined in theory. The demonstration was known, therefore, as a &quot;transition&quot; voucher model, which would look to the inclusion of private schools in the future. The participating schools created a limited amount of educational diversity by setting up special instructional programs known as mini-schools; but, as of the second year, there are still no private schools in the demonstration. The demonstration has shown that Federal agencies can offer incentives for schools to follow innovative policies, but these agencies cannot control the shape  of future innovations in American public schools. That shape is traditionally determined by local priorities and interests. With Federal support, Alum Rock has shown that it is possible to combine decentralization of authority down to the school level with parental freedom to choose children's school programs. The major discernible effect of the first year of the demonstration has been on the roles of central district staff, principals, and teachers. Each voucher school has gained new autonomy, and teachers are now working in new cooperative arrangements and with new discretionary power over resources. (Author/JF)",

Thirty experimental Ss in the year 1 workshop focused on understanding individual differences with 30 objectives, 217 content items, 343 instructional activities, 273 materials suggestions, and 197 measuring devices. Both workshop and control Ss later were rated by supervising teachers and independent raters (for eliciting student participation with verbal behavior) during practice teaching assignments. Results of testing indicated significant improvement by workshop Ss in cognitive content (ability to identify and write objectives and prescribe strategies) and in self-concept, improvement in  utilization of curriculum and classroom management strategies, and no significant difference resulting from verbal interaction. In the second year replication study, different instruments were used with 30 different experimental and 10 prior control (control/experimental) Ss in the workshop, and a control group consisting of 30 different control, 10 prior experimental (experimental/control), and 10 prior control (control/control) Ss. Ten prior experimental (experimental/experimental) Ss had a 1-week refresher workshop. Results indicated that experimental Ss scored significantly higher than controls on an instruction measurement instrument and lesson planning. Longitudinal results showed that control/experimental and experimental/experimental Ss tended to rank higher than control/control  and control Ss. (Appendixes give instrument sample and procedures.)

The model is reported to encompass the following 13 states or definable conditions: undergraduate training; five states each for undergraduate and masters degree levels consisting of full-time teacher in SE, full-time teacher in SE and part-time school attendance for a higher degree, full-time student, out of SE and part-time student, and out of SE and no school attendance; and two states (in or out of the SE field) at the post-masters degree level. Methodology is given to include categorization of students by the three educational levels according to the specialty areas of sensory disorders, learning  disorders, and other specialties; and categorization of teachers on bases such as representation from 26 states and school districts. Noted is use of career data such as length of time in jobs and nature of current position. Analysis of version 1 (state probabilities) involving matrix computation is explained through results indicating that of 128 female teachers specializing in sensory disorders, 48 teach full-time with an undergraduate degree, 49 teach with a masters degree, one teacher in the field has a doctorate, four teachers are in school full-time, and four teachers have left the field. Explained is analysis by version 2 (incorporating time in state) involving ways to interpret movement of teachers in the field.

        "description":"Reviewed in the speech by John Ottina, the U.S. Commissioner of Education, are trends in the federal government's role in education for the handicapped and current federally funded projects serving the handicapped. Noted is program growth from subsidies for just two facilities 20 years ago to the current annual budget of $300 million to support education of the estimated seven million handicapped children. It is explained that $190 million goes to the states and another $100 million is used for a model program development in areas such as early childhood education, media development, and teaching training. Described are new federally supported efforts in research such as developing four new curricula for the mentally retarded child, in media such as captioning the ABC evening  news, in program development such as establishing 10 centers to serve deaf blind children and, in an emphasis on early childhood programs to identify and remediate disabilities at the preschool level. Future trends in government involvement are seen to include provision of resources to State and local education agencies as they expand services for the severely handicapped, increased support of model preschool projects, model projects specifically designed to serve the severely handicapped, increased emphasis on the gifted and talented, and collection of better data on incidence and educational costs of various handicapping conditions.

It is believed that programs for the gifted can easily be included in a Head Start program. Reported are the results of on-site visits to two programs in Utah which resulted in recommendations such as the importance of inservice training and the need for curriculum based on development of problem solving skills. Briefly described are two other programs which stress skills such as creativity and decision making. Meetings with parents are reported to have shown agreement that the gifted child needs an enriched program but disagreement concerning whether gifted children should be in segregated or integrated settings.  A good preschool program for the gifted and talented is seen to require identification of comprehensive objectives, provision for pupil differences,appropriate instructional materials and physical facilities, a flexible schedule, qualified staff, and a curriculum focus on the development of thinking skills. Emphasized in the section on the characteristics of preschool children are the multiplicity of potentials in children at the preschool age and the need for a program which provides a multiplicity of opportunities for free expression.

The most dramatic development is seen to be the extension by the courts of appropriate education in the least restrictive environment to all handicapped children. Described and rejected are three models of macrosystem teaching training: the Sovietized approach which would involve a highly centralized analysis of needs and allocations, the Institutes of Higher Education Dissemination model which would give colleges and universities the primary training role, and the local needs assessment model which would stress the local education agency as the determiner of needs and distributor of resources. The author  prefers the voluntary collaboration model which would involve cooperation among local education agencies, universities, and teacher associations in the planning of training programs. An example of standards in such a program are that existing training centers should take the leadership in defining and distributing training programs so that every child receives services regardless of his location. It is suggested that participation in such a consortium be increased by incentive systems of states and professional organizations. Among criteria given as suitable for evaluating a consortium are increased communication among all units involved. Additional guidelines offered for consortium development includes the avoidance of narrowly based, fixed consortiums that establish territorial rights.  (DB)",

Identified are four historical stages in special education: (1) the organization of residential schools in the 19th century, (2) the development of a few community prototypes in the early 20th century, (3) the quantitative explosion of services 1945-1970, and (4) the current period which is seen to be one of negotiation for more integration for exceptional children in both the public schools and the community. Mainstreaming is stressed as the dominant historical trend. Described are  four local programs to provide support services to regular teachers whose classes include exceptional children. Five criteria for placement are considered which include the instructional decision being made on evidence of advantage for the individual and not on the institutional difficulties associated with placing the child in the mainstream or another particular setting. Finally, the author expresses his preferences for special education which include decategorizing both children and teachers so that the highly competent \"special educator\" would receive funding and children would receive individualized instruction based on educational needs rather than handicapping condition.

The experimental design contained the following six independent variables: IQ groups (retardates vs. normal Ss), retention intervals (seconds vs. hours), kinds of test problems (new vs. old), sources of interference (proactive vs. retroactive), types of interfering discrimination (new vs. old), and Ss. The dependent variable in all conditions was the S's response (on a discrimination test trial) expressed in terms of either percentage of  correct responses or retention loss score in each level of the factorial experiment. Acquisition data showed that retarded Ss were slightly but significantly slower learners than normal Ss and required more trials to reach criterion on interference free discrimination problems. Retention data showed that retarded Ss had only a slight overall retention deficit compared to normal Ss, and that both groups displayed greatest retention loss on new test problems, long retention intervals, and interference conditions (retroactive conditions for the retarded Ss and proactive conditions for the normal Ss). The results indicated a dual memory process of retarded and normal children and therefore supported N. Ellis's 1970 Primary and Secondary Memory Theory and the data of D. Zeaman's 1973  Attention-Retention Theory. (Author/MC)",

Aim of the curriculum is the successful placement of students in the community. Provided for grades 1-6 are the following components: a rating scale and behavioral objectives for primary and intermediate levels in areas such as the family, language arts, reading, health, career education, body image, directionality, the neighborhood, transportation, and geographical/governmental concepts. Materials are suggested for use in language arts and arithmetic. Offered for grades 7-9 are a vocational readiness checklist and behavioral objectives for effective living, prevocational abilities, general work duties, general work  information, communications, and mathematics. Grades 10-12 items include an orientation form and behavioral objectives for communications, personal and social adjustment, self preservation, social and environmental sciences, wages and hours, and functional skills. The following are examples of behavioral objectives: location of Florida on a map for understanding of geography (elementary level), knowledge that lateness is a form of dishonesty for attainment of prevocational skills (junior high level), and knowledge that hallucinogens distort physical senses for awareness of troublesome drugs (life sciences unit of the personal and social adjustment category in high school). Included are lists of materials, state approved texts, and survey results of alternate graduation plans for EMR  programs. (MC)",

        "description":"Provided is a competency based career ladder model (developed for Colorado) to enable universities and colleges to improve preservice programs for teachers of the moderately and severely retarded, and to aid state and local agencies in planning meaningful inservice programs. Administration requires cooperation of state groups such as the state department of education and the local agency and coordination by a central office. The following dimensions of the model are described: the rationale dimension, which deals with the &quot;product&quot; (student skills to be developed); the job analysis dimension, which comprises prescribed and discretionary activities; the middle management dimension, which is crucial to staff development and motivation; and the growth opportunity dimension, for  upward mobility through compensatory planning and training components. Discussed are recommendations for a career ladder model for the state of Colorado. Details of the model are given in the appendix. Listed are responsibilities, duties, prerequisites, and minimum competencies for aide (level 1), training assistant (level 2), teacher or specialist (level 3), and specialist-supervisor/teacher-supervisor (level 4). Performance objectives are specified at each level for the phases of student assessment, program design, program implementation, and program testing. An example of an objective at level 3 (teacher-specialist) for attaining knowledge of developmental disabilities with emphasis on mental retardation (student assessment phase) is: &quot;teacher can write facts about epidemiological  variables.&quot; (MC)",

It stresses that lipreading training aims to develop the understanding of words, phrases, and sentences rather than the study of exact lip movements. The lipreading ability of the child is said to be usually far beyond his oral and written expression. Part 1 contains fundamental principles and teaching techniques such as individualizing instruction, using commands to develop exact lipreading, taking dictation and lipreading from television. The activities in Part 1 may be used for readiness purposes prior to formal lessons and as enrichment in conjunction with the formal lessons in Part 2. Lesson format provides information  on the following areas: movement, visibility symbol, sample words, elicited words, secondary spellings, movement description, sound formation, eye drills, clue words, sentences with clue words, homophenes, devices and games, and practice words at six levels of difficulty with the target lip movement in the initial, medial, or final position.

Included for study aspects are discussions on the literature; stimulus for the study, such as helping the TMR student experience a feeling of self-expression; and methodology, which involved administration of the Templin-Darley Test of Articulation and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) to two experimental and two control classes in school A and to one experimental and one control class in school B. Procedures are explained in terms of beginning with a familiar song, engaging in ear-training and  tone-matching games, practicing of rhythm patterns, learning a new song, and closing with a familiar song. Detailed are speech articulation activities such as repetitively singing \"Good morning, Miss Moss\" for practice in diction; and vocabulary development activities such as describing the animals while listening to a recording of the \"Carnival of the Animals\" by Saint-Saens. Given are results which indicate improvement (but not at the significant level) by the three classes, and significant improvement by the one class (school B) on the PPVT as a result of reinforcement and review by the teacher. Conclusions and recommendations are given to include need for a longer experimental period and for more rote experiences by TMR/disadvantaged students in learning situations. (MC)",

Stressed in the chapter on sensory processes is research on neonate and infant testing and the substitution of one sense by another. The chapter on visual perception provides information on results of impaired vision and perceptual difficulties and asks to what extent perceptual deficits depend on memory deficits.  Diagnostic tools for memory deficits are focused on in the fourth chapter which also includes an evaluation of newer methods of memory research and the author's theory of memory. Described and critiqued in the fifth chapter are four main theoretical approaches to cognition: behavioral, developmental, information-processing, and linguistic approaches. Considered in the chapter on language development are the nature of language learning as a dynamic activity and the biological and social factors which determine language development. Discussed in the next chapter are the contributions of several areas of experimental psychology to help children sustain attention and control impulses. The final chapter centers on the personality and social development of the handicapped child. (DB)",

        "description":"A new dimension may be added to the study and teaching of a second language by the development of contrastive sociolinguistics. Sociolinguistics is defined here as the study of how a person relates to another person in terms of language, and is concerned with relational utterances rather than factual statements. Relational utterances are those that assume the existence of a listener, to whom the speaker is relating himself. Such utterances vary in tone and style, depending on the variables of sex, age, status, and familiarity. These variables make it socially, not linguistically, obligatory for certain relational utterances to be selected over others. The necessity of teaching the differences in relational utterances is illustrated in the case of the Japanese, who cannot  confortably use English imperatives or invectives because of the social restraint on such usage in Japanese. In addition to the contrastive difficulties between languages, factual statements and relational utterances vary grammatically within one language. Learning one type of utterance does not guarantee knowledge of the other; both must be taught if the student is to be able to generate both. (LG)",

The community involved was the township of Benque Viejo at the Guatemalan frontier, and the four informants, aged 10-13, spoke varying mixtures of Spanish, English, and Creole. The questions asked were: (1) What is the linguistic character of the community? (2) What is the nature of the children's competence, and in what sense is it a &quot;knowledge&quot; of the language of the community? Individuals were seen to create their own competence norms, competence being their knowledge of the available code. In the analysis of the children's renditions of &quot;The Three Little Pigs,&quot; their  individual codes were marked by particular expressions of hispanization, such as the dropping of the final -z, creole-ness, such as nasalizations, and r-colorations, which illustrated the extent of their &quot;book-learning.&quot; For these children, there is no single internalized linguistic system; rather, they weigh their chances of being accepted in one role or another and create for themselves the linguistic stereotypes of those roles.

Saville-Troike illustrates several types of conflict which may occur in elementary classrooms when teachers do not understand the nature of the linguistic and cultural diversity of their students. G. M. Blanco and C. F. Gregory explain the rationale behind their curriculum bulletin \"Espanol para alumnos hispanohablantes.\" Several dialogue situations are discussed by A. S. Hayes and D. H. Anisman as examples of how failures in communication between teacher and student can occur. C. W. Kreidler suggests ways to improve the teaching of reading when English is a second language. Practical ways to use visual aids in  teaching meaning and culture are suggested by C. J. Kreidler, and the teaching of composition is discussed in articles by M. Finocchiaro and E. Elmer. R. P. Klebaner speaks of adapting the entire school curriculum to different levels of English competence. Various methods used to stimulate student interest are described by C. Eisman, B. Matthies and J. Horan. C. Begay illustrates how cultural content can be included in a bilingual education program. The volume concludes with a selection of French games developed by the bilingual program in Lafayette, Louisiana. (PM)",

        "description":"Sociolinguistic data regarding code selection and nonverbal modes of learning are examined in the gesture communication system of the (Oglala and Brule) Sioux. Sign language is viewed as an extra-linguistic mode of communication currently in use in Indian classrooms. It is one alternative to literacy as a means of communication; however, this is not to suggest that sign language be adopted in place of literacy for formal education. Analysis of contextual uses of sign language suggests that some nonverbal learning may enhance classroom participation and, in some situations, have more cultural salience than literacy. Sign language represents an example of a code which may be selected from the communicative repertoire of the community. Since sign language usage depends on an  internalization of the verbal categories, the internal structure and syntax is maintained despite the transferral to nonverbal grammar. Furthermore, its use is nonrandom; it is definitely patterned and subject to social constraints and sociolinguistic pressures. (Author/LG)",

        "description":"Early childhood learning of language has led some to postulate innate knowledge of an abstract symbolic linguistic system. However, if the child's abstract understanding initially requires concrete support in the form of agreement of the message with his nonlinguistic experience, the indication would be that the development of syntactic comprehension does not derive from genetic prewiring. Rather it indicates that syntactic comprehension develops through concrete experiences from which abstractions are only gradually derived by the child. In order to test abstract knowledge, which requires the removal of concrete sources of support for comprehension, probable and improbable active and passive sentences were presented to 120 three- and four-year-olds. The results showed that age,  syntactic voice, semantic probability, and the interaction of voice and probability had significant effects. Passive voice still required support from semantic features. Syntactic concepts apparently mature from concrete understanding to abstract knowledge, in the same manner as other aspects of cognitive development. (Author/LG)",

However, few master the language well enough to handle it at the university level, where it is the medium of instruction in all subject areas. At the secondary level, students are highly motivated in sciences and mathematics, since their examination scores in these subjects will largely determine their academic future, but they can see no immediate reason for a diligent study of English or of any other foreign language. An entirely different approach to the study and use of English should be taken. English should not be required but should be optional, resulting in a smaller program of higher quality with motivated students. Motivation could be improved by training teachers  in such concepts as Service English, English for Special purposes, and English as a Library Language. Arabic should then replace English as the language of instruction in the universities, but students who choose to do so should be able to study English for a specific purpose. These changes would increase motivation for the study of English and would eliminate the problem of many students who have found their advanced work to be dependent on their English proficiency.

Through variability studies, answers can be found to questions about how to delimit styles, how to effect acceptability in school writing and talking, how to appreciate the dynamics of variation in the language of others, how to sequence language materials, how people set themselves off from each other through language, or how subtle variation between spoken and written language forms can cause problems in composition and reading. Information about language variation may be used to help rethink the education of teachers, the development of instructional materials and techniques, and the building of educational  programs of various sorts. Linguists must try to gain influence within the field of education if they want to participate in effective educational planning. Three plans are suggested by which linguists can work for change from within the existing education system: (1) infiltration, (2) the jealousy motif, and (3) management control. The study of variation will also help to broaden the training programs of linguistics students, thereby providing them with more versatility as they approach the job market. (Author/PM)",

A government designates an official language to restrict access to economic and political power. This view of language is substantiated by an analysis of the United States' experience with official language designation in three areas: the school systems, in which English has been required; the political institutions, which require voting and naturalization processes in English; and economic life, in which many occupations have been open only to citizens. The patterns have been similar, in that they were affected by three historical trends: the initial period of relative tolerance toward the use of other  languages (1780-1880), active development and support of English language qualifications in order to exclude (1880 through World War II), and then active questioning and reversal of these official actions. In general, language control has been evidenced in the language restrictions imposed legislatively when an ethnic group was viewed as irreconcilably alien to a prevailing concept of American culture.

        "author":["Wolfram, Walt"],
        "description":"One of the most significant problems that linguists face in their attempts to describe Vernacular Black English (VBE) is the matter of fluctuating forms. It is consistently observed that speakers appear to fluctuate between a socially stigmatized variant and its presumed nonstigmatized counterpart. Fluctuations in VBE have often been viewed as a type of code-switching. From this perspective, the fluctuating variants are assigned to different systems or subsystems within a speaker's linguistic repertoire, and he simply shifts from one to another in response to some stylistic, situational, or other functional shift. Variation has been observed, however, when the extralinguistic context remains constant, and such variation cannot be classified as code-switching. Much fluctuation in  VBE, then, is best described as inherently variable rather than code-switching. This means that both of the fluctuating forms are an inherent part of a unitary system. In terms of descriptions of VBE, the code-switching concept leads to a distorted view of what the dialect is actually like, because VBE is seen to be more different from Standard English than it actually is. What is needed is a grammar which can account for variability beyond traditional rule optionality. (Author/PM)",

To assess the effect of mode of language instruction on the student's concept of self as well as student achievement in reading, the following research was conducted. Suspecting that non-English-speaking parents are also affected by the school, a third measure was made of parent-school relationships. The research involved four village schools in the Kuskokuim district of Alaska having the Eskimo dialect of Yuk as their vernacular. Two served as subjects. Treatment was the Yuk Instructional Program, wherein Yuk was used as the primary language of instruction. The results were  as follows: (1) control schools were significantly more advanced in reading as measured by the SRA Achievement Series; (2) treatment schools evidenced significantly greater concept of self on 6 of the 14 sections of the Yuk Modified Tennessee Self Concept Test; and (3) total rapport of treatment school parents with the school was significantly more positive as measured by a Parent Opinionnaire.

The conference had two very broad areas of concern: (1) to consider ways in which HEGIS data may be made available to the higher education community in a more timely fashion than is now the case, and (2) to consider ways in which the community may provide advice to NCES in a regular, ongoing, and informed manner. The recommendations of the conference suggest: (1) That NCES devote substantial resources and efforts to the continuation and expansion of projects to define and describe the postsecondary education universe and include all  relevant sectors of that universe in its ongoing data collection activities. (2) That NCES establish a procedure whereby institutions wishing to restrict data dissemination must make a specific, written request. (3) That the planning commission for the HEGIS VIII Conference take positive and substantive steps to encourage the removal of data restrictions by those institutions that currently impose them. Following the recommendations, emphasis is placed on a background for HEGIS in general and a presentation of specific problems and questions considered by the participants. (MJM)",

The agenda seeks to move the 11 state colleges toward expanded community service and encourages them to cooperate in establishing special learning centers. Other major proposals of the agenda include: (1) A system of faculty evaluation that includes student participation. (2) Credit for students' practical experience gained in off-campus projects. (3) Reducing teaching duties for faculty members who initiate projects of scholarly merit, research, independent study, or of service to the campus or the community. (4) Integrating the specialized career programs with the liberal arts  curriculum. (5) A Reevaluation of the role of teacher education in an era when employment opportunities are declining. Appendices include the policy on graduate education; the Massachusetts Transfer Compact; guidelines for new degree programs; and procedures for reduction in faculty teaching load. (Author/PG)",

This staff report describes this framework, placing special emphasis on two of its major components--a data base and an analytical model. The data base includes data on postsecondary education, institutions, students, and sources of financing. Details are provided that indicate the ways in which the analytical model, a set of nonlinear, simultaneous equations, was used to project the impacts of various financing patterns on the achievement of those postsecondary educational objectives that can be measured quantitatively. The model, which operates through a time-sharing  terminal, helps the analyst examine the impacts of key policy parameters on an interactive basis and obtain results immediately. Finally, this staff report explicates how the model may be used to evaluate several financing proposals as well as to assist in the construction of additional financing plans for postsecondary education. As background for the analysis, several key parameters of the complex decisions related to public policy are identified in this report, the applicable literature is reviewed, and new directions for research are indicated.

Results indicated that: (1) No applicant who completed an AAS degree program was denied admission to a public 4-year institution and that applicants who had not completed their degree programs were generally admitted if their academic records reflected some minimum quality of academic achievement. (2) Out of 17 cases of students who transferred from nondegree programs in Technical Education Centers, 11 students received some credit for diploma work completed in Technical Education Centers. (3) One hundred and eleven students transferred from AAS degree programs at Technical Education  Centers to 4-year public institutions in the fall term of 1972. Of these 111, 59 had received their associate degrees, 51 had not completed their associate degree programs, and one student's status was unknown. The conclusion suggests the need for a reexamination, based on the above facts, of present transfer policies in terms of sound educational criteria, thus leading to greater statewide consistency in this area.

        "description":"Changing patterns of demand for higher education services have generated considerable interest in research into the factors governing the choices students make when they apply to colleges and universities. During 1973, the staff of the State Budget Division of New York State undertook the task of creating a general model of the demand for college services. The model was derived from the theory of consumer demand, which postulates that the demand for any commodity is a function of consumers' tastes, incomes, and the relative prices they face. The 4 basic factors selected as the variables determining demand were: academic quality, social aspects of the undergraduate experience, where the school is located, and costliness. Conclusions are: (1) Academic policy does influence the  decision to apply to a particular college, but the quality of the student body seems to be the most important factor in the determination of a student to apply. (2) Relative pricing policies of particular colleges are very important in determining the student's choice of where to apply. (Author/PG)",

        "description":"As a working definition, innovation in the context of higher education involves substantive changes and reforms in instructional methods, the use of student and faculty time, and the process of learning. These observations are based primarily on the results in some 75 projects underway in the California State University and College System. The findings, which should have special meaning for planners, include student, faculty, and administrator reactions to innovations. Students seem to like the experimental programs in which they participate, even when assigned to them at random. Faculty participating in innovative programs generally express satisfaction with the experience and a willingness to repeat it--even though most report working far harder than they had anticipated. A  variety of time-shortened degree programs and self-paced courses seem to be demonstrating that a substantial minority of students are interested in and capable of moving more quickly through their college education. As innovations take hold, changes in the higher education enterprise will follow. If existing procedures cannot accommodate innovative programs, they must be adjusted accordingly. To permit past routines to stifle the new is contrary to the fundamental spirit of American higher education. (Author/PG)",

The preservation of this type of structure is essential to the efficient and effective pursuit of the university's basic mission: to facilitate discovery and personal growth. The actions of virtually all universities reflect a strong conviction that planning should be dominated by similarly trained individuals in department-like groups and that the administration should facilitate this planning by: motivating faculty to plan for themselves; liberating faculty from habitual/traditional modes of thought; being a resource/consultant person; and providing structures and formats that  allow an institution to revise and redirect its plans with minimum effort. As such, the author presents ideas to help the academic planning person become the motivator, liberator, resource person, and coordinator necessary for true faculty participation. (Author/PG)",

It is essential that some members of the Board should be present or recent members of the professional academic community--teachers, research workers, librarians, or administrators. A judiciously constituted Board should be involved in such pivotal matters of admissions, curriculum, graduation requirements, selection, retention, promotion, tenure, and sabbaticals of faculty, leave policy, and compensation scales. In all, the role of the trustees should be policymaking, not administration, although in practice each one feeds the other. The most immediate way in which a trustee can verify the  quality of faculty is being attentive to conditions of employment. Trustees must be accountable to faculty, in that they must accept the work and the often unpleasant decisions it entails. (Author/PG)",

With costs of new construction steadily rising, with space on which to build dwindling and with the growing affection for old, familiar buildings on campus, modernization often serves as the ideal answer. The range of choices is a wide one, beginning with limited clearning up, painting, recarpeting and exchange of furniture, all the way to the kind of remodeling that leaves nothing standing but the old outside walls. In between there are solutions like the one at the University of Tennessee, where some walls were taken out, big new flexible spaces created, and almost immediate moving in is possible. Despite drawbacks,  modernization in its various forms is able to help hard-pressed managers of campus space to come to grips with these problems. (Author/PG)",

This report concerns the field of graduate study in education in Canada. Recommendations include: (1) The universities should encourage the development of Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) programs and other types of post-baccalaureate programs in education. (2) Deans of Education should establish broadly-based coordinating groups for all forms of professional study for teachers including both graduate and undergraduate work. (3) Scholarship granting bodies and educational authorities should examine the types of financial support appropriate to students of education and provide appropriate levels of support. For planning purposes figures are presented for  enrollment for 1976-77 doctoral and masters programs in education. Appendices include: report of consultants; comments by universities; procedures of the planning study; and terms of reference. (Author/PG)",

        "description":"In order to identify long-obscured patterns of concentration in grants made by large private foundations to various types of colleges and universities in this country, a computer program capable of annual trend analyses was developed and utilized with data from the currently most comprehensive and accessible source, the grants index of \"Foundation News.\" All grants reported in 1963, 1966, 1969, and 1970 and 276 foundations having most of the national assets and making most of the grants for all purposes, including higher education, were analyzed. Of these 276, each of which had assets of at least $8 million, a range of from 112 (1963) to 184 (1970) made grants of at least $10,000 each to a range of from 293 (1963) specifically identifiable U. S. colleges and universities. The  major findings about the concentration among grantors was that each year at least 46 percent of the grants and 75 percent of the actual funds involved came from no more than 25 of the foundations, including the Ford Foundation. Although there was a slight trend toward more widespread foundation participation in academic grantmaking, the ratio of college or university recipients per foundation stayed about 2.75 per year.

Major conclusions are: (1) The states have the preeminent responsibility for postsecondary education. (2) Each state should insure and promote a variety of postsecondary educational opportunities. (3) Particular attention must be paid to the changing population characteristics and social expectations that face postsecondary education in the period ahead, including a leveling-off or decrease in the traditional college-age population. (4) An effective coordinating agency or governing agency should have broadened responsibility for the range of postsecondary education, concern for educational innovations and new forms of educational &quot;delivery,&quot; and concern  for articulation. (5) In states with multiple statewide postsecondary agencies dealing with state plans and/or dispersal of state and federal funds, these activities should be coordinated by one central coordinating agency. (6) Each state should determine levels of authority and responsibility of coordination and governance and should develop state plans suggesting levels of decisionmaking consistent with that authority. (7) Planning and its effective implementqtion are the key to effective coordination and governance. (8) The legislative and executive branches of government should support planning and coordination through an appropriate state educational agency. (Author/MJM)",

One-third of the faculty reported experience with both interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research, 17 percent had experience with multidisciplinary research only, and 14 percent reported only interdisciplinary research experience. The balance of 36 percent were divided into 17 percent with no experience in either type of research and 19 percent nonrespondents to this item. Analyses were made of the attitude and opinion items relative to the types of experience the faculty reported. Overall the faculty indicated a mildly  favorable attitude toward both types of research. They gave higher ratings to the type of research with which they had experience. Those who had experience with both multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research viewed them with equal favor. The organizational structure and reward systems of the university were seen as neutral to both types of research, although the USC administration was perceived as favorable and the faculty expect to see more of both in the near future.

The financial barrier that inhibits the education of many citizens and the efforts of state governments, federal government, and the postsecondary institutions to eliminate the barrier are described. Highlights indicate: (1) The financial aid needs of the full-time undergraduate students in the colleges, universities, and public vocational-technical schools in the SREB (Southern Regional Education Board) states exceed $1.08 billion. (2) Over $828 million in financial aid from all sources is available to undergraduates. However, because not all aid is distributed among institutions in proportion to student financial needs, the unmet financial need or additional aid required exceeds $339 million. (3) The need for additional financial aid is greatest at the 4-year nonpublic colleges. (4) The students from families with incomes of less than $6,000 per year have the largest unmet need, 34 percent of the total. (5) Federal student aid programs are the largest single source of aid to students in the SREB states, contributing over 27 percent of all available aid. (6) Almost 34 percent of the total available aid is in the form of loans. (7) If all student financial aid were made available on the basis of need and distributed to students in proportion to their need, unmet financial need would be reduced by 23 percent. (Author/MJM)",

The primary objective of the inventory is to improve and simplify communication through increased standardization of terminology and usage. Secondary objectives are to provide assistance to those concerned with developing and designing data bases and information systems, and to suggest ways that statewide planning and decisionmaking might be improved through the identification of problems and issues to which the measures in the inventory are  relevant. It should be emphasized that the inventory is not by itself a useful planning and management tool. It does provide a start toward the standardization of terminology for postsecondary education planning and management, and it suggests ways of linking this terminology to a variety of general statewide concerns. However, with respect to the tasks of analyzing specific statewide problems and issues and developing operational information systems, the inventory is at best a point of departure or frame of reference.

(5) While recognizing the general importance of part-time study for master's degrees, there be no programs specifically designed for part-time study for specialized professional master's degrees or doctoral degrees. (6) A specialized masters program in the theory of coaching should be planned for future implementation. (7) Planning for the future at the doctoral level could include an additional program in exercise physiology and one in social science of sport.

There are 34 units in the course, designed for self-paced instruction. The course went through three trails, the first two with curriculum specialists and graduate students in education and the final trail--hands-off field test--with 46 undergraduates at Emerson College. The evaluation of the course consisted  principally in criterion questions administered as a pretest and as a posttest. The percent gain was in all instances high, but with the undergraduates the final scores were not completely satisfactory, a fact attributed to the lack of monitoring. The material should produce competence in critical judgement and production of curriculum materials for graduate students. (WH)",

The third study used seventh and eighth graders to study the effect of prior memorization of either examples or non-examples on concept formation.

After the novelty and problems of the start, the system has progressed to the point where over half of the general education course work is now offered by the systems approach--creating a savings of 28.5 faculty. As part of the employment contract faculty members are urged to use a systems approach and are given released time to produce materials. The university, through its instructional materials center and other offices, helps with programs, materials, and copywriting. Ownership of material resides with the faculty member, but it is agreed that the university may use the material indefinitely without charge. If  institutional support were lower, these arrangements could be patently unfair to the faculty. (WH)",

Some 50 educational music publishers together with 50 band directors and 50 choral directors were surveyed by questionnaire. Based on the data collected, the analyses made, and the findings reported, the following conclusions were drawn: (1) the law is quite clear, there is no reason for any music educator to make any unauthorized copies of any parts of any music; (2) the results confirm that music educators do make unauthorized copies, and that music publishers are aware of this practice, but to date have taken no legal recourse toward remedying this situation; (3) variations in the standard instrumentations used  by music publishers are sufficient to dilute the value of ordering standard instrumentation; and (4) music publishers and educators are in basic disagreement in their opinions concerning the seriousness of making copies of parts. The study recommends that: (1) music educators cease making unauthorized copies of music; and (2) publishers should provide a clear definition of what parts are included with a publisher's arrangements when they are advertised. Further recommendations are included. (WCM)",

Several types of typical problems encountered by researchers who adopted the new technologies, together with the solutions adopted by the researchers, are described. It is shown how the local computing facility expanded to the centralized facility as a result of these problems; new types of needs and uses for computers continue to favor evolution and change. One result was the growth of large-scale computer networks. An alternative to established forms of networks--hierarchical computing systems--is suggested as providing better  answers to more kinds of needs. The Minicomputer Interfacing Support System (MISS), developed at the University of Chicago, is briefly described as a prototype system allowing minicomputers to be used in a hierarchical system which would provide more powerful capabilities when they are needed. Finally, it is suggested that traditional attitudes of researchers toward computation facilities should be reevaluated, as new possibilities are being developed and made available. (WDR)",

Students are treated as responsible adults and are expected to work closely, as colleagues, with their teachers. Curriculum planning reflects the belief that graduates would change their career pattern and life styles at least three times during their adult years. Instruction is grouped under natural sciences, social sciences, and the arts and humanities, instead of by departments. Courses are multidisciplinary and must be relevant not only to today's society but to the problems of future generations. Grades are based on narrative achievement reports instead of letter grades. The academic program is divided between coordinated and contractual studies.&quot;Access&quot; is the key work for the generic multimedia workshop library. Audio tapes and books share adjoining shelves, with thousands of visuals stored on microfiche. Television monitors and computer time-shared terminals are available for student use. Equipment checkout ranges from slide projectors to video cameras and VTR's. The library media production facility includes graphic artists and technicians; two complete television production studios; &quot;hands-on&quot; filmmaking equipment; and, in addition to musical instruments, a complete audio studio.

A careful random selection was made of phone numbers from each school district, and 4,306 respondents were interviewed between the months of May and October 1973. Respondents were asked about their current and past use of the public library, activities performed there (e.g. browsing, research, use of media), location and time convenience, and specific activities, equipment, and/or services they would like to have in their library. Use of the library (both general usage and for a specific activity) were separately correlated to respondent's occupation, educational attainment, and the distance from their  home to the library. This report presents a narrative description of survey results, tables of data, with statewide totals, and separate results for the city of Wilmington and for New Castle, Kent, and Sussex counties, and a copy of the questionnaire used.

There has been a history of planned social change in medical library organization. Stress was being felt in that library agencies could not meet user expectations. With the Medical Library Assistance Act, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) was authorized to act as a change agent to forge new organizational relationships for medical document delivery. Regional medical libraries (RML) were to be founded and rationalized into a hierarchical system of resources under NLM's guidance. The Kentucky-Ohio-Michigan Regional Medical Library was the first decentralized RML, its purpose being the establishment of new linkages between existing biomedical libraries for the sharing of  resources. Types of linkages vary throughout the three-state region, but the data suggests that new communication channels have been established, and that the RML is supportive of change. (Author/SL)",

The development encompassed, among other tasks, selection of services, training for services, developing the initial organizational and operational policies and capabilities, publicity about available services, and the operations monitoring procedures. A fundamental philosophy was to integrate these services within the library environment where they complement traditional services. Initial experiences during a three month operational period showed that (1) a demand exists for  computer-based reference search service; (2) users are willing to pay, even out-of-pocket, for such services; (3) searches are often interdisciplinary and require several sources; (4) various publicity mechanisms are helpful but none so important satisfied users telling their colleagues; and (5) users like and respond positively to the in-depth, customized service and personal attention to their bibliographic needs.

By far most respondents, from both institutions and industry, report favorable experiences and attitudes toward their ITV involvement. Financial visibility is made more likely when auditors--with or without grades and tests--and nonengineering courses are included in the program. The Stanford ITV system demonstrates the success possible. Finally, four hypothetical  cases illustrate the need for cost studies and comprehensive planning before choosing any specific delivery approach. (WH)",

The computer network spans the United States and in its three years has involved 5,000 deaf students. The curriculum in elementary mathematics is divided into strands, series of related problems, and the language arts program tries to teach grammatical rules by the inductive approach. Groups of students were systematically selected for evaluation of the two curricula and received pre- and post-tests. The results showed that CAI could be used successfully by deaf students and  that gains in mathematical computation two to three times greater than classroom instruction could be achieved by CAI. Furthermore, these gains could be precisely predicted from the number of CAI sessions. (WH)",

A questionnaire study of community college learning centers was developed around a model based on the premise that there are four major functions of such a center. Of the more than 300 schools responding, almost half contained all four parts of the model. In those centers where all four  components exist, 63.9% are contained in one building. Most provide library and audiovisual services with almost 63% also having some non-traditional types of learning spaces. However, instructional development is the weak area of service in most centers.

In addition to the two decision processes, five major processes are viewed as being central to the man-machine system of CMI: test scoring, achievement profiling, diagnosing, prescribing, and instructing. Thus computer-assisted instruction can be just one facet of a computer managed instruction program. Most CMI systems are built around units of instruction that are specified in terms of educational objectives desired student behavior, levels of competence, and/or concepts to be learned. Generally, the similarities of CMI programs are greater than their differences. The WIS-SIM model for CMI, developed by the Wisconsin R&amp; D Center, embodies most of these features. Individually guided education is the ultimate in flexible, non-linear education programs and is well suited to CMI. An added benefit of CMI is the use of the data field to generate information for decisions on whole programs not just units. (WH)",

The major disadvantages of minicomputers are the difficulty of securing maintenance and the reliance often on the single language, BASIC. Software systems are crucial and languages such as BASIC or APL are ill-suited for course-authoring for computer-assisted instruction (CAI). Cost, of course, is the principle advantage. The system at WWSC relies on a multilingual interpreter to execute programs in a constant pattern for all languages, once translated into an internal code of single byte operands and operators. PILOT has great structural simplicity but yet great  versatility, and perhaps its best feature is its ability to call an already compiled BASIC subroutine. A program was written which can translate COURSEWRITER III to PILOT. The experience of WWSC indicates that a CAI system can be satisfactorily run on a minicomputer if there is access to good software. (WH)",

In addition, the concept of regional learning centers and the integration of the State Library is also embodied in this bill. Furthermore, cable television is central in two important ways. First, a multiple channel system with two-way capability could be employed to tie the proposed regional learning centers into a coherent statewide system. Second, the regional system can be expected to tie community cable systems operating on a commercial basis and thereby touch the homes of adults, for use as needed. (WCM)",

Thus, for much the same reason as they created their own university presses and broadcast and graphic services, universities will integrate these capabilities with instructional faculties and staff and create, distribute and consume their own instructional non-print programing. Moreover, since production costs are high, institutional sharing is in order, and is happening. The first act of the university as videopublisher is to get its instructional house in order, to integrate its instructional resources, and use them effectively for its own purposes. The  second act is to find partners for an enterprise which inevitably will be long-term and expensive. The third is to identify useful collaborators in the non-university world such as industry and the military. Finally, if higher education can produce video programing of merit for this evolutionary period, universities will gain additional markets; cable television will gain a new product, and the burden of being publisher of last resort may prove to have been a blessing for all concerned.

The network is expanding to begin cooperative videopublishing among universities which will also include important changes in the governing structure of TAGER. In short, videopublishing involves a richer mix than simply a canned television course. It involves faculty improvement; it involves selling to administrators, to fund providers, and, most of all, to faculties. It involves the combination of taped sequences, film, live lectures,  talkback, and almost all of the arts of television production.

Nevertheless, research universities can contribute to the development of cable television. The crucial question of measuring the effectiveness of the end result will require universities to train higher-level experts in both the uses of the medium and the evaluation of the results. Beyond that, the universities  should provide well-planned and executed research in the problems of cable, including those of its organization, relations with other media, preferred funding alternatives, civil liberties, implications, political, sociological, and psychological impact, and so on \"ad infinitum.\" Most immediately, however, universities should be developing software which combines television with other kinds of teaching.

        "description":"Despite the voluminous array of comparison studies, educators have little for purposes of administrative decision making or for the establishment of scientific generalizations about how students learn from television. Of interest to cable adherents is the off-campus home viewer of instructional television (ITV) offerings. Research evidence indicates that at-home TV students tend to perform better than their on-campus counterparts and they frequently have a more favorable attitude toward learning via the TV. Cable offers at least two technical capabilities which are unique to cablecasting: (a) multiple channels for simultaneous communication with multiple small audiences; and (b) two-way interaction between the teacher and the learner. However, these opportunities can also be seen  as problems. First, multiple-channel opportunity evokes educational TV's historical inability to produce sufficient software to fill the existing, limited channels. Second, the opportunity for two-way interaction is clouded by the rather obvious failure to date to identify and perfect teaching methods which captialize on this capability. In essence, educators must decide what it is we want cable to do for our institutions. (WCM)",

Performance objectives are used to describe course content and the learning requirements for individual courses within a program, as well as to report student credit. The objectives force the professor to identify the content and requirements of a course, thus providing an explicit guideline for developing instructional materials. The instructional communication center is committed to use modern communications technology in the delivery of instruction. Economy-of-scale is achieved through mass dissemination. When cable becomes available, the cost of launching a university  could plummet down through the creation of a central instructional communications center with outposts, instructional systems, learning packages and low-cost meeting places. Cable decentralizes instruction. This study concludes with recommendations for cooperation among universities and within regions to develop a more efficient system of higher education. (WCM)",

The basic questions asked in this study are threefold: (1) What strategies can be effectively used by a rural community college in extending its services to its service area? (2) What kind of services can be established? (3) What steps need to be taken to define and implement these services? The research utilized two approaches in community organizing: (1) information-rural development, and (2) problem solving. The informational approach established a number of community groups which serve as sources of information for the purpose of establishing a data bank at the community  college. Data have been collected, and the means have been sought for a full-time economic specialist for rural development who will assist in utilizing the collected information. The problem-solving approach centered on organizing a study group on the health needs of senior citizens in one of the major cities. Some restructuring of local services took place along with plans to conduct a county-wide survey. (Author)",

Fifty-one percent of the total student sample preferred the 4-day week, and 30 percent preferred the 5-day week. Forty-five percent of the students reported that they preferred a class period of one hour, and in a related item rating classroom activities, 44 percent reported no difference in classroom activities when the short and longer periods were compared. A total of 58 percent reported that they worked or were on a work/study program. These working students also reported that they were able to work more with a 4-day class schedule.  The administrative staff (deans, department heads, program directors, and student services personnel) completed a narrative evaluation. Lists of advantages, disadvantages, and suggestions were prepared from these evaluations. The Learning Resources Center experienced a decline in services ranging from 15 percent to 44 percent. An analysis of class schedules for variation in services, enrollment data, and grades revealed no change that could be attributed to the 4-day week. An analysis of energy consumption over the years 1970-1974 indicated that energy was saved, but the amount contributed to the total energy-saving program by the 4-day week could not be determined with reliability.

Questions related to the structure of the varying provincial educational media organizations and their use of film and video tape. Relationships, if any, that exist between educational media authorities, community colleges, and provincial library systems were also explored. In order to meet the legitimate requests of educational and cultural groups within the province, it is proposed that the Saskatchewan Educational Communications Corporation (SASKMEDIA), in concert with the community  colleges, develop a three-level approach toward educational radio broadcasting in the province. Level 1 would be the development of a network of medium-power FM transmitters with studios licensed and operated by SASKMEDIA; level 2 would be the development of &quot;Saskatchewan Radio Forums&quot; operated by community colleges over regional AM radio stations; and level 3 would be the development of satellite low-power FM transmitters and studios around the mother medium-power units.

Questionnaires were sent to 155 presidents for chief executive officers in charge of community junior colleges in Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North  Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming. A small nationwide sample of community junior college administrators that have responsibility for community services was also used in determining attributes needed by community development specialists. Questionnaires were also sent to 409 community/junior college trustees and 273 private citizens. Replies were received from 56 percent of the presidents or chief executive officers, 43 percent of the trustees, 57 percent of the private citizens, and 65 percent in the nationwide sample. Survey results are provided, as related to the four objectives above, in both narrative and tabular formats. The result support the concepts of community development services as a legitimate and significant function of the community/junior college. (DB)",

In order to accomplish the necessary goal of developing subsystems which together constitute a performance-based system, it is necessary that college faculties and administrators develop measurable objectives for every program, level, and service. Miami-Dade Community College, South Campus, undertook such an effort in five phases. Phase 1 involved the development of measurable objectives and support service on campus. Phase 2 involved developing course objectives and service objective statements and distributing them to advisors, faculty, and students. In Phase 3, procedures were  developed for evaluating the degree to which students or other groups achieved objectives. Phase 4 involved the statement of measurable objectives for every level of management. In Phase 5, a system of mutual determination of objectives for faculty and administration was developed. These objectives form a 1-year plan of action and constitute the basis for written performance evaluation. (KM)",

The model was tested in York County because of the low income level, the lack of amy public postsecondary institution, and the availability of the facilities and services of two private colleges. To date, seven educational institutions are involved in the project. York County Community College Services began classes on Sept. 5,  1973, with 38 courses and 315 students. In its second semester, enrollment is nearly double, at a cost to the state significantly lower than that of existing publicly supported campuses. Student surveys indicate that 90 percent of the students are attending college for the first time and that they would not be attending except for the college's proximity and low cost. A second phase now being developed in an open-entry, open-exit instructional system. (KM)",

Ervin Harlacher spoke of a \"community renewal college\" where community development depends on individual rejuvenation, self-realization, and self-fulfillment. Max Raines proposed a transactional model for considering leadership strategies for community services. In responding to Alan Pifer's challenge that community colleges become community service agencies exercising a key leadership role in the regeneration of American society,  Edmund Gleazer set forth a national agenda that is community-based and performance-oriented. Examples of special programs to meet the needs of special groups were presented by project directors. The community services programs at four community colleges were also highlighted. Special strategies and techniques in faculty involvement, community needs assessment, and program evaluation were presented as well. (Author/KM)",

Among the recommendations are the following: (1) by 1980 the city colleges should aim to serve 120,000 students; (2) teams of instructional and supportive personnel must be developed; (3) efforts to develop a management information and budgeting system that focuses on cost effectiveness should be accelerated; and (4) faculty should be reorganized into program-based units. A history of the CCC from 1911-1973 is presented in three chapters. In the final chapter, the future of the CCC in the following areas is considered: the  community orientation, the students, the educational programs, new instructional strategies, facilities, and financial support. Program costs and data on students and faculty are tabulated in an appendix.

It consists of a cluster of five community colleges scattered around the perimeter of a central business district of a large city. Each college concentrates on one of the following specializations: business, creative and performing arts, engineering and industry, health, and public and human service. The model is predicated on several assumptions about urban conditions, the student body, and academic matters. The career education concept is fundamental to the model, which will require a general education unit to serve the career programs. Potential problems exist in, for example, the fact that it will not be as easy to shift specializations, which will necessitate an early career decision by the student. The model's  strengths include the following: (1) the separation between academic and occupational programs would be minimized; (2) remedial or developmental programs will relate directly to career programs; (3) the clearly defined basis for each unit's existence makes autonomous operation possible and encourages economical operation; (4) the specialized units promote development of curriculum cores; and (5) the location of the college promotes integration. Reactions of educators to the model are attached. (KM)",

Ability, interest, and family background measures were used as independent variables. Results indicated (1) that vocational choice changers were very similar to nonchangers in terms of the 23 independent variables examined; (2) that vocational choice change patterns varied widely among groups of changers; and (3) that there were very substantial differences in the choice changes made by males and females.

Significant differences were found between students enrolled in regularly scheduled classes and those using a multimedia, self-paced, individualized instructional system. Students using the individualized system made significantly more progress than the students attending regular classes in speaking, reading, writing, and composite language skill. There was no significant difference between the two groups in listening comprehension. Levels of language competence were measured by the \"MLA--Cooperative Foreign Language Tests\", and additional data was obtained by administering the \"Otis Quick Scoring Tests of Mental  Ability.\" An additional conclusion of the study was that students scoring in the upper and lower extremes of measured mental ability benefited more from the individualized program than did the students in the middle one-third of the sample.

Focus is on one specific orienting reaction, the early direction and maintenance of one's eyes and head toward certain stimuli instead of others. The physical properties of stimuli that control the response are discussed. Patterned stimuli are preferred over unpatterned ones, and the contour density of stimulus surfaces appears to be a crucial variable in controlling this preference. The second issue discussed concerns systematic changes in reactions to these stimuli as the child develops. Third, the question of how these specific physical properties might stimulate the developing nervous system is addressed.  Electrophysiological studies are reviewed, indicating that contour density and other factors that interact with contour density do control the amplitudes in some components of visually evoked potentials (VEPs). Finally, the document proposes a possible description of how this stimulation might be brought under the self-control of the infant's own actions. The speculation focuses on (1) inhibitory loops in the brain, and (2) the developing receptive field between 4 and 5 months. (DP)",

Data were taken from laboratory studies and field observations. Study subjects were 18 months old. Sharing was defined in terms of the following three responses: showing objects, giving objects, and playing with them while in contact with another individual. The studies  included analysis of several variables: (1) effects of novel versus familiar toys, and toy versus nontoy objects, (2) effects of differential social reinforcement, (3) recipients other than the mother (fathers, relatively unfamiliar persons), and (4) effects of environmental changes (decorations) on the showing component of sharing. Discussion focuses on the learning processes that may be involved in the origins of sharing, which is viewed as an adaptive response.

The higher the occurrence of complex verbalizations the more desirable the care. To distinguish between the quality of care given in family day care centers and group day care centers, two hypotheses are presented and tested which state that more complex verbalizations (N-V-A) will be produced in the family day care center and that the group day care center will produce more simple verbalizations (N-V) than complex. Ten randomly-chosen children between the ages of 28 and  54 months were used as subjects, and a total of 400 minutes of observation for all the children were taken by trained preschool teachers. Results confirmed the hypotheses, but significance levels were low due to some inherent problems in the procedures. These are discussed. (SDH)",

The re-analysis was considered necessary because of unclear methodological issues in evaluation research and the existence of much data that was not used in the WLC analysis. A basic question raised is whether the WLC data can be used to produce unbiased estimates of the effects of Head Start. Several formal models of Head Start Evaluation are presented in order to determine the conditions that would lead to biased and unbiased estimates. The WLC report did not describe its procedures for selecting children for Head Start and control  groups. For the re-analysis, the following modifications of the WLC study were made: (1) use of ungrouped instead of grouped data, (2) expanded list of socioeconomic and demographic indendent variables, and (3) inclusion of the Head Start variable in a manner to allow for different effects for children from various ethnic groups and family structures. Findings generally support the original study, but indicate that Head Start was more effective than the WLC report indicated. (DP/Author)",

        "description":"This paper presents two studies which explored the manner in which the father interacts with his newborn infant and compared paternal and maternal interaction patterns. In contrast to earlier studies, a direct observational approach was employed that permitted a detailed specification of father behaviors in the presence of the newborn. In the first study, a time sampling observational procedure was used with 19 Caucasian, middle-class couples 6-48 hours after delivery. Two sets of observations were made: (1) mother-father-infant, and (2) mother-infant alone. Data revealed that the father was just as likely to interact with the baby as the mother. The second study consisted of a sample of 51 white and 31 black, lower-class couples from a large metropolitan general hospital. This  time, observations were made on father-infant interaction, as well as mother-infant interaction, and mother-father-infant interaction. Results indicate that parents tend to react similarly to their infant when alone. Both studies indicate that the sex and ordinal position of the infant are important modifying variables in early parent-infant interaction. Implications of both studies suggest that the father plays a more active role in early social interaction than previous research indicated. (CS)",

        "description":"The Oxnard (California) Community Mental Health Center reports on evaluation of efforts to train parents in child management skills using behavior modification techniques. Rigorous training procedures, curriculum, and evaluation techniques have been developed over the past two years. Twenty groups of 3-15 parents have received training in behavior modification during 10 sessions led by mental health technicians. The paper emphasizes the importance of evaluating program outcome in terms of multilevel sources of data if the workshop format is to continue as a viable approach to child therapy. Accordingly, evaluation of program progress encompasses the traditionally defined process variables such as attendance, participation by parents in workshops sessions, and characteristics of  leadership behaviors of the trainers. In addition, the evaluation of parent training as outlined in this paper is in terms of what parents do, rather than what they talk about doing. Therefore, the effects of the training program are evaluated in workshop role-playing sessions, and later by home and phone contacts. Finally, the paper suggests that the impact of parent workshops should be assessed in terms of the reduction of delinquency rates, admissions to residential treatment facilities for children, and dropout rates.

        "description":"Aspects of Piaget's theory were applied in the studies reported which examine two aspects of children's information processing of television commercials--selection of information and cognitive processing of information. Children's selection of information was indexed in terms of patterns of attention to television commercials in the natural environment of the home. Children's cognitive processing of information was indexed in terms of responses to a variety of questions concerning TV commercials and programs. Two sets of studies are reported here. The early studies included upper middle class children, 5-12 years old, and the later study included children aged 4-8. In the early studies, data was collected in the home. Attention behavior data was collected by mothers, and  interview data related to children's processing of information was collected by pairs of interviewers. In the later study, attention behavior and interview data were collected in the school by observer-interviewers. Responses to the various questions in both studies are highly consistent with Piaget's theoretical discussion regarding differences in the cognitive structures of preoperational and concrete operational children. Results are reported on the basis of three cognitive levels which were identified: low cognitive level, medium cognitive level, and high cognitive level. Results indicate that what is learned by children increases with age and that part of this increase is due to changes in cognitive development. (CS)",

        "description":"In this monograph, the language and pedagogical concepts embodied in the Tucson Early Education Model are used to develop a systematized method of natural language learning. It is hypothesized that young children in school continually resystematize their language, and that conscious and systematic modeling by the teacher should accelerate this natural language learning. Characteristics of this natural language learning method are: (1) conscious modeling, (2) corrective feedback by the adult, (3) elaboration in modeling, (4) expansion in modeling, (5) extension of knowledge, (6) provision for the child to practice talking, (7) consistent response by an adult in a program of discriminating reinforcement, (8) structuring of the environment so that there is a structural demand for  specific modes of thought and particular language forms related to such thought, and (9) verbal expression by an adult of a variety and a range of thought processes. Such an approach demands that the teacher, in order to be a conscious modeler, must think about thinking, think about talking, talk about thinking, and talk about talking. The eventual goal of language modeling is the mutual stimulation of the child's own thinking and talking. The monograph includes charts focusing on the language-intellectual relationship in classroom interaction, a tentative hierarchy of mental activity for hueristic purposes, and a chapter dealing with more sophisticated aspects of the nature of language in the context of natural language learning.

Preliminary work was based on observation of sessions in which one child would draw a picture in the presence of an adult. Major findings were that: (1) the children did not have preconceived notions of what they would draw; (2) they did not try to capture a moment in time, but rather drew \"diagrams\" of changes over time; (3) much scribbling was the result of manipulative rather than representative movements; and (4) when describing their work, the children used the adult as a passive listener rather than an active instructor. Preschooler's work in drawing and clay was compared to assess whether the three dimensional medium would reduce distortion. Also, subjects' representations of objects were  collected and analyzed, indicating that the children may have been representing experiences with objects rather than the object itself. The final group of studies investigated the performance of many children on one activity (drawing a square). It appears that 4-year-olds were significantly more advanced at this task than 3-year-olds. Subjects between 42 and 49 months received various levels of training in square drawing, but these procedures were generally ineffective. Results are discussed in terms of developmental processes that could be involved. (DP)",

        "description":"This report presents the findings from an evaluation of the classroom processes of the twelve Planned Variation sponsors. Three basic issues were addressed: (1) To what degree are the programs really different and providing distinct treatments? (2) To what extent are the educational goals of each program actually implemented? and (3) Is there a relationship between implementation and child outcome as measured by cognitive and achievement tests? After a brief overview of Project Head Start and descriptions of each sponsor model, the method of the evaluation study is discussed. Data collection was based on a battery of tests administered in the early fall and late spring of the 1970-'71 academic year, and observation of classroom processes twice during that same year. The  observation instruments and lists of tests used are appended to the document. The procedures of analysis for the study (computer and statistical) are also discussed. It is concluded that (1) although several loose clusters of sponsors were identified, there were more similarities than differences, (2) consistency between sponsor objectives and sponsor frequencies on the variables selected to reflect these objectives was quite high for all sponsors, but consistency on these same process variables across sites was quite low, and (3) the relationship between implementation and test results remains unclear.

        "description":"This final report of an ESEA Title III program compared the impact of a 3-year interracial preschool program on cognitive and social development on two treatment groups and a control group. Group 1 had parents and children participating in a preschool classroom, and the parents also participated in parent education programs. Group 2 had a separate parent education program, but no classroom participation for either parent or child. Group 3 was a control group with no participation other than testing. The groups were drawn randomly, stratified to insure that at least one-third of the number of children in each group were disadvantaged, one-third black, that there was representation from all 11 elementary schools in the district, and approximately even sex distribution. The three  major needs focused on by IPSIP were: (1) Improvement of \"school readiness\" of disadvantaged preschool children, (2) development of healthy self/racial concepts of all children, (3) cultivation of positive parental attitudes toward school and community. Program results showed a 20-point average rise in I.Q. as measured by the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) for the disadvantaged group, and a 13-point average rise for the advantaged and disadvantaged groups at the end of the second and third years as measured by the Boehm Test of Basic Concepts. Sociometric studies show no racial bias in choice of playmates. (Author/CS)",

        "description":"This report describes an observational study of one family-grouped classroom, a system in which elementary school children remain with the same teacher for two or more years. The class was composed of junior kindergarten, senior kindergarten, and grade 1 pupils. Each child was observed over a period of one year. A detailed observation schedule, included in the report, was designed to record the types of activities each child engaged in, the level at which he worked, who initiated the activity, the role of the child, and the length of the activity. Group composition and the presence of the teacher or other adult were also recorded when applicable. A measure of reading achievement and a teacher rating of behavioral growth were also taken. The results of the study question some of  the arguments for family grouping. It was found that little cross-grade grouping occurred spontaneously, and there were very few instances of older children teaching younger children. However, attention span was found to be high, no doubt due to the skill of the teacher in guiding and directing the work of the group. There were no differences in the reading achievement of graduates of this group and a control group, and the greatest behavioral growth was in the area of expressive language and social development.

The second section describes a number of curriculum guidelines specifically developed for children at the junior kindergarten level, and discusses evaluations that have been carried out to assess the effectiveness of some of these programs.  Section 3 contains reports from some educational committees set up to study the need for and feasibility of extending public education to younger pupils. The last section describes a number of specific preschool programs recently developed that illustrate various approaches to early education and the teaching of young children.

Children were shown a long and short word written on a card (e.g., mow and motorcycle), and asked which word corresponded to a spoken word (e.g., mow). The word choices were always grossly different in length, so that a nonreader could perform perfectly if the relationship between written and spoken length was understood. Children were also asked about their basis for responding. Most inner-city kindergarteners in a reasonably representative sample did not perform well on this test. A majority of suburban kindergarteners and inner city first and second  graders performed well, but many did not. Controls suggested that failure on this test cannot be attributed to the specific form of presentation of the materials or to misunderstanding of the question being asked. (Author)",

The first chapter gives an overall picture of the Head Start Planned Variation study, while the second chapter summarizes data concerning background characteristics and distribution of test scores. Chapter 3 provides a general discussion of methodological issues and some of the major difficulties resulting from the study design. Chapters 4-7 attempt to present a picture of the pattern  of overall effects of various programs through ranking analysis, residual analysis, analysis of covariance, and resistant analysis. The final chapters explore the question of whether the relative effectiveness of various programs is related to certain child background characteristics, such as sex, ethnicity, age, prior school experience, and mother's education. One major conclusion drawn as a result of the intermodel comparisons was that Head Start programs are quite homogeneous in their ability to promote general cognitive development. (CS)",

Data collection has included measures of children's behavior and development, parent-child interactions, and parent variables such as locus of control and self concept. The research has been directed toward the analysis of questions concerned with: (1) effectiveness of educational home visits for parents (home visits vs. educational home visits), (2) use of the professionally designed, Piaget-based, language-oriented curriculum vs. curricula developed by experienced paraprofessionals with little theoretical background, (3) effects of providing a comprehensive program (home  visits and group experiences for children) at age two vs. continuous parent training from birth, and (4) comparisons of intervention which takes place directly with children vs. parent education. Results are presented in tables throughout the report. The program has developed into a Project Follow Through program sponsor. It is discussed in terms of analyzing child factors and materials and family factors based on underlying assumptions and postulates. It is concluded that the basic model of intervention works, although many refinements in the delivery system, training courses, and measurement procedures are needed. (DP)",

Focus was on the investigation of the behavior objects of 3-year-olds from urban and rural low income and urban middle income homes. Behavior objects are the things and people in the environment which the child uses as essential supports for his molar behavior. Behavior objects were identified from narrative reports based on direct observation of each subject in the home. Specific criteria were used for identifying the behavior objects in the  narrative reports, and the objects were described according to 8 descriptive categories. The investigation yielded two general kinds of results: (1) frequencies and rates of occurrence of behavior objects, and indicators of the rate of flow of behavior objects through the environment, and (2) classification of behavior objects, reflecting qualitative differences. Results were suggestive rather than conclusive, but significant differences between families were indicated. (DP)",

It is an attempt to clarify unresolved issues arising from the Westinghouse Learning Corporation Report on the impact of Project Head Start. Generally, this review focuses on the following question: What is known about the impact of any type of preschool intervention program? The report includes chapters on (1) Head Start graduates in school (studies from New Haven, Connecticut), (2) impact of early education on disadvantaged children (based on a Philadelphia study), (3) a five-year enrichment curriculum ranging from preschool to third grade levels (New York City, IDS Program), (4) the Early Training Project, (5) effects of economic  deprivation on nursery school performance (study at Howard University), (6) The Karnes' Preschool Program (University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign), (7) The Learning to Learn Program, and (8) The Ypsilanti Perry Preschool Project. It is concluded that early intervention does have an immediate impact (within one year) on the child's performance when measured by the Stanford-Binet, or personal-social adjustment ratings. On a long term basis, positive impact of intervention programs on school performance has been reported. Variables such as age, sex, and socio-economic status may affect the quality of intervention impact. (DP)",

The study is based on interviews with scholars and government officials, an analysis of statistical data and research reports, and visits to day care centers, playgrounds, and other settings in the United States, Sweden, Israel, and China. While much of the information necessary to assess the system of child care in this country has not been systematically collected and analyzed, there are a number of empirical indicators of child neglect and abuse. The current &quot;crisis&quot; seems to be the result of a combination of social trends of which the following appear to be major ones: (1) changes in the structure of households, (2)  changes in sex roles which downgrade parenthood and child rearing, (3) loss of child care options outside the family, (4) a serious imbalance in the supply and demand for child care, and (5) the costliness of children. The role of the child and role system involved in child care which operates in different societies is also discussed. (Author/CS)",

It is based on direct, in-class observation, but standardized tests and interviews were also utilized. The teacher is described in terms of her role in the preschool, and her behavior in interaction with children and parents. Description of the curriculum focuses on the gradual evaluation from unstructured free play to instruction and skill development. Curriculum is discussed according to three major objectives and their related activities: (1) introduction to traditional nursery school experiences, (2) fostering of self-awareness and self acceptance, and (3) promotion of language development. A detailed report of one aspect of the curriculum (use of  books) is included for illustration. The discussion of the children focuses on their classroom behavior as they adjust to the preschool environment. Group divisions along sex lines were noted, as well as differences in activities and styles of boys and girls. The importance of individual differences is emphasized. The Harlem children were compared with a sample of economically advantaged children from Maine. Family makeup and home environments are described in four case studies. Finally, parent-teacher and parent-school relationships are discussed, with emphasis on the inadequacy and ineffectiveness of these aspects of the program. (DP)",

The curriculum was designed for use with disadvantaged preschool children and was field tested in two schools in central Harlem, New York City. The objectives and methods of the curriculum, as well as background and characteristics of the four teachers involved in implementing the project are described. Two comparison groups were used in the evaluation, including afternoon classes of several experimental group teachers and a prekindergarten class in a nearby school. Data was collected for various aspects of the 1967-1968 program. It is emphasized that the curriculum attempted to achieve intellectual stimulation which would be reflected by  playfulness with ideas, language, and learning strategies. These qualities are most difficult to assess with standardized measurement instruments. Evaluation incorporated the following data sources: (1) Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (pre- and posttests), (2) Goodenough Draw-A-Man Test, (posttest only), (3) Levine Elzey Preschool Social Competency Scale, (4) teacher rankings on verbal competence and IQ. A separate analysis of speech and language needs is appended to the document. Results are inconclusive, and discussion focuses on limitations of the data due to difficulties in controlling many variables. (DP)",

The 30 advantaged infants had working mothers, and the 9 disadvantaged infants had nonworking mothers. In the original study, they were enrolled in private day care and involved in a program of total environmental care and parent guidance. Special methods of cognitive rule stimulation through play and warm and flexible personalized care were designed for each of four types of activities: developmental care routines, free play, guided learning, and excursions. Original results indicated a mean 20-point gain in IQ. A followup study carried out one and two years after the original investigation showed that all tested groups tended to rise considerably in IQ over the  total period, despite temporary dips by three groups. The major evidence on socioemotional development also shows a generally continuing high and slightly increasing mean level of functioning on nearly all ratings. Exact measurement results are presented in four graphs. Concluding discussion focused on the lack of regression to or toward preprogram levels of functioning, although regression had been found to be characteristic for disadvantaged children in other studies. Possible reasons for greater developmental gains for advantaged infants are presented. (SDH)",

Being an integral part of rural communities and society, these schools are affected by the forces at work within and on their society. Rural society, communities, and schools have been changed by massive forces of industrialization, urbanization, and bureaucratization. Migration accelerated as inequities between rural and urban areas became more visible. The school is a major force in improving opportunity and the quality of life. Therefore, schools are a mechanism for development and can be strategic forces in development efforts to improve rural communities, then creating conditions under which they can perform more effectively as educational institutions. This paper provides: (1) an overview of the growing  interest and concern in development at various levels, (2) a review of the functions of schools in past development, (3) impediments schools confront as a development mechanism, (4) functions schools might perform in rural development, and (5) some specific actions schools might take to accelerate development in rural communities and to improve educational quality.

The study population consisted of all 6th grade students in a single school located within 25 miles of Phoenix (Arizona) and within 10 miles of an Air Force complex. The literature review, using only studies written after 1959, showed that there was no significant relationship between mobility and achievement. A total of 132 students who were present when the California Achievement Test (CAT) was administered in October 1973 were included in the testing. If a student was present for the testing, but subsequently moved, his scores were still included. A causal-comparison design was used, with  continuous length of time as the independent variable and mean grade equivalent achievement test scores as the dependent. Analysis of variance was used to determine if differences existed at the .05 level of significance for 4 CAT subtests: Reading Vocabulary, Reading Comprehension, Mathematics Computation, and Mathematics Concepts and Problems. The study concluded that, since the f-ratios were not sufficient to establish significance at the .05 level, length of continuous attendance did not significantly affect achievement test scores.

Today, due to geographic isolation and an absence of economic alternatives, many Navajos are still dependent upon trading posts. This report of a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigation details the system on the Navajo Reservation, including the abusive and unfair practices used by many of the traders. FTC interest in trader conduct traces to a 1971 meeting between attorneys from the FTC Los Angeles Regional Office and staff attorneys from Dinebeiina Nahiilna Be Agaditahe (DNA), an Office of Economic Opportunity legal aid facility on the Reservation. The DNA attorneys cited 3 questionable practices: withholding government checks; alleged price fixing; and Truth in Lending Act  violations, particularly in pawn transactions. In April 1972 the Commissioner of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) requested that the FTC, because of their expertise, conduct immediate investigations to promulgate revised Navajo trader regulations. FTC staff surveyed 95% of the trading posts on or near the Reservation. These interviews were directed at pawn practices, open end credit, and mail delivery. The staff also interviewed more than 100 Navajo consumers on the reservation. Public hearings were then held by the BIA and FTC in August 1972. The hearings concluded that one of the most onerous trader practices was &quot;credit saturation&quot; (extending credit up to the customer's known periodic income). (KM)",

The attitudes studied were reasons for going to college; concept of an educated person -- whether they should have a technical orientation or a broader interest in life; student versus professional orientation of professors; and student-professor distance. Asian students appeared to be more collectively oriented than U.S. students, and also thought the educated person should have a broader orientation in life. Both Asian and U.S. students favored professors' attitudes being more student than professionally oriented. Asian  students did perceive more distance between themselves and their professors. No significant differences were found between Mexican American and Anglo students' attitudes toward education. Socioeconomic status, as measured by occupation, education, and income, did not appear to influence the reasons students have for going to college and was not related to other attitudes.

The study population included 46 Chicano students who enrolled in the fall 1973 semester at Mt.  San Antonio College (Walnut, California) and continued their enrollment through the 15th week of the semester. The results concluded that the SPC attitude change package can help Chicanos and others to compete more effectively.

Results also confirmed the researchers' impression that low self-image is a key factor inhibiting successful academic performance. (KM)",

The goal of the project, which began in July 1972, is to implement and coordinate a comprehensive environmental education program for the county's students and citizens. The pilot group for the first year included the 5th grade students and teachers in the county's 7 school districts. Ten activities were designed to integrate environmental education into existing instructional programs, including program planning in conjunction with the Department of Education, Northern Illinois University; developing a series of in-service training sessions for classroom teachers; identification and  development of area resources for student field trips; and developing a local outdoor education site. Evaluation tests, developed by the staff, indicated that pupils had statistically increased their environmental awareness. The proposal is divided into Information and Project Description; Effectiveness/Success, Cost Information (deleted), and Exportability. The Appendix includes a project description, the program as planned and carried out, activities, and the national validation report. Much of the information is given in tabular or proposal form.

As educational programs related to individual community needs are developed, the need for services beyond the reach of most local school districts is discovered. Community schools face the problem of how to get these educational services at a reasonable cost, while at the same time preserving local autonomy.

The Yearbook emphasized the human rather than technical factors in small school administration, mentioning financing or budgetary practices only when they could contribute to a better understanding of the functions of the administrator, administrative relationships, or major trouble spots in small schools. To determine the unique  problems which surround these administrative positions, more than 150 administrators in 20 States identified their major concerns. The most serious problem of every small community school is its inability to provide broad educational programs. Limited financial support, obsolete and poorly equipped school buildings, an inadequate provision of instructional tools and materials, and extreme difficulty in attracting and retaining competent teachers made the educational program not only limited in scope but poor in quality.

        "description":"During the past decade, it has been made clear that educational structures and curricula must become responsive to student needs and aspirations. Many minority groups are calling for development of an educational system which includes the study of ethnic heritages and aspirations. The response has been the inauguration of black, Chicano, and American Indian studies. The growing acceptability of ethnic courses offers hope for future educational innovations in which the study of history will play an integral role. The content of U.S. history should include the many ethnic cultures which have become part of the democratic experience. In this paper, the Mexican American culture, which has contributed to the nation's historical development, is singled out. Emphasizing a content  structure using three history modules, the paper also demonstrates how these can be incorporated in teaching U.S. history. The presentation methodology and material development are left to the teacher. The three modules are: (1) America and Europe Meet; (2) Independence Movements; and (3) Immigration. These areas demonstrate where the multicultural approach can be used in history study. (NQ)",

These may be derived from applicable Federal, State, and/or local laws, including school regulations. On June 22, 1973, an ad hoc committee (50 percent American Indian) was convened in Albuquerque, New Mexico to review a special report form prepared for evaluating Indian student rights and responsibilities. The committee was concerned with the organization of these codes and their compliance with local, State, and Federal legal and technical requirements. The form was distributed to 33 Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) secondary schools and dormitories, 20 of which responded. This paper discusses the philosophical extent of student rights and the past and present status of rights and  responsibilities in BIA and non-BIA schools. Some findings are: almost all schools have some type of written handbook or guide; 3/4 have some type of grievance procedure; and all but three apply the Interim Procedure for student expulsions. The appendixes, which comprise the bulk of the document, give: references to BIA school management policies and disciplinary procedures; the constitution for BIA high schools operated within the Navajo area; the report form sent to the schools; a roster of the schools; information relative to the Phoenix Meeting on Student Rights and Responsibilities; and a bibliography of reports related to Indian student rights prepared within the past three years.

Course objectives are to: (1) present current historical and cultural facts on Appalachia; (2) encourage students to explore and examine their cultural background; (3) understand the causative and sequential relationships between the past and present; (4) try to develop concern for the dignity, welfare, rights, and freedom of all individuals; (5) instill in each individual his worth to the community, state, and nation; and (6) put Appalachian culture on an equal footing with other American cultures. The document also explains attitudes to be acquired by the students; skills to be learned; content guide; problems to be solved; resource persons; individual  projects, excursions or field trips; audiovisual aids; procedures for bringing in outside resources and taking students through the community; and evaluation procedures. The chronologically designed American history course outline is loosely constructed to allow insertion of materials developed through continuing research on Appalachia. A bibliography includes publications on the history of the area, literature, cultural background, folklore, and journal articles. (KM)",

The plan assists small rural schools with inadequate guidance funds to establish a career information program at a minimum cost using the community, a heretofore untapped resource. The objectives of this 1970 Title I Elementary and Secondary Education Act program are to: convince the school and community that they should provide, in their planning and budgets, for guidance services; foster better school-community relationships; emphasize the importance of career information for education and life planning; provide significant guidance services to the noncollege student; train teacher-counselors for the guidance role; and  train the school's personnel toward independent operation of this community-school support program after Federal funding is terminated. The report/guideline summary assists persons who might be interested in establishing such a program giving: a project description, procedures (including the teacher-student interview program, career representatives, career information sources and classification, a career card file system, career type interviews, films, and the committee structure); and personal and financial requirements.

        "description":"Between May 1969 and October 1973, the University of California, Davis, was involved in a series of research and service projects designed to better the condition of single-male farmworkers in Stockton and Sacramento. These communities, known locally as skid row, were destroyed as a result of urban renewal. The projects were separated into 2 phases: 1) the development of service and research methods in the Sacramento Skid Row community, and 2) the application of these methods to the Stockton Skid Row community. In Phase I, university efforts focused on employment and training opportunities, community development, service projects, and in-culture research. Project developments during Phase II were: in-culture research, community development, services needed for survival, and  casual labor market assessment. The in-culture research method operates on the philosophy that the persons who participate in a culture or subculture are a valuable information source on their needs and lifestyles. A research team from within the group collected data by a questionnaire composed of questions from the group and interviews. This monograph emphasizes the process in which the single-men projects were developed, briefly describing the projects and discussing research results and implications of the process for future researchers. Findings indicate that members of the single-male subculture can be organized into self-help groups and that the in-culture research approach works. (NQ)",

        "description":"The study examined the hypothesis that occupation and residence patterns present after high school graduation are generally predictable. The data come from a homogeneous, all white central Minnesota farming community with a 1961 population of 3,300. The study population is the 1961 high school graduating class, who were surveyed by questionnaire 10 years later. The 101 returns investigated 1971 occupations, place of residence, marital and family status, and spouse's occupation. Since the data represent the author's own graduating class, both an &quot;outsider's&quot; and &quot;insider's&quot; interpretation are used. The analysis differentiated between men and women because societal pressures, restrictions, and expectations channel the sexes in different directions. Also, high school activities  tended to enforce sex related roles, such as in athletics, which is an exclusive male endeavor, while the female supports and encourages such functions. The study concluded that, as a group, this class had more females than males, and over half grew up on a farm. Over 50 percent of the women were housewives; the rest were in professions commonly associated with their sex. Likewise, the majority of the men were blue collar workers, conforming to established patterns. For residence a definite preference for the familiar area was displayed--3/4 of the graduates remained in Minnesota, although only 21 resided in their hometown. In general, persons sampled were behaving in a proper, acceptable manner as defined by middle class America, thus supporting the roles learned in their formative  years. (KM)",

The reflection and endorsement of nine selected Appalachian cultural values (familism, love of home place, neighborliness, individualism, personalism, modesty, sense of humor, religion, and traditionalism) in educational programming of extension agents in West Virginia (an Appalachian State); North Dakota (a rural State); and New Jersey (an urban  State) were discussed. Data were obtained from the total field agent population in the three States. Comparison of means, frequencies, and percentages of response to the instrument were utilized for analysis of differences between States and groups within States. The study concluded that: (1) West Virginia agents were sensitive to and endorsed Appalachian cultural values, especially the individualism cluster; (2) differences in the endorsement of cultural values among the three States' agents indicated the continued existence of an Appalachian subculture; and (3) a substantial relationship was found among age, tenure, and effectiveness of West Virginia agents--the older and more experienced agents were more sensitive.

The hypotheses predicted that there would be less parental acceptance of and support for the open classroom according to: the greater the classroom openness; the less the parents' cosmopoliteness, the smaller the town population, the older the parents, the lower the informational level about the innovation, the less parental involvement with and experience in open classrooms, the less the degree children are perceived as being happy with school; the less parents perceive their children as progressing in school, and the greater the perceived home discipline problems. Data were based on interviews with 276 parents with children in open classrooms during the 1971-72 school year in 16 communities. Interviews obtained  data on the parents' (1) factual knowledge about the classroom, (2) reactions to the classrooms attitudinally; (3) perceptions of how the classroom may have affected their child's home behavior, (4) information about and perceptions of open education and the children, and (5) personal information. Both closed, multiple choice items and short-answer, open-ended questions were used. Results of a stepwise multiple regression analysis were presented, with preference for more detailed, nonparametric statistical analyses. Findings indicated that the child's perceived progress, town size, child's comparative enthusiasm for school, parent observed classroom, parent classroom participation, and changes in home discipline problems were first on the stepwise process.

        "description":"In most of the United States, rural areas are experiencing economic and social changes that raise new policy questions for both government and private organizations. Often, these changes have industrial or urban roots and require knowledge and skills not part of the background of most rural people, with the likely outcome that farmers and other rural citizens will not be as effective as they might be in guiding future developments. To be most effective, rural leaders need a basic understanding of the methods whereby public problems can be solved through group action. Recognizing this, the College of Agriculture, Pennsylvania State University, designed and implemented a special adult education program focusing on public affairs leadership development. The 5-year program began in  fall 1970. Designed for training potential leaders 20-40 years of age, the program offers an integrated sequence of workshops, travel seminars, and home study, which include: public policy from a broad perspective; economic, political and social changes that affect public planning; leadership in group action; alternative solutions to rural problems; and national and international issues. Emphasis was placed on sharpening the ability to analyze public problems and communicate with others, rather than on laying down arbitrary guidelines. Suggestions for program evaluation and future research needs are also given. (KM)",

Since then, the visions of the early colonists have fallen victim to rapid population expansion and a highly specialized technology, and the close ties between the school and the community have been seriously weakened. Recent reports, however, have called for new links to be built between the schools and the communities they serve. Though these reports were aimed at large urban centers, they are equally important for rural schools and communities. The basic premise of this paper is that and educational change that requires citizens' understanding and support; parent cooperation; or new roles or relationships for students, teachers, administrators, school boards, or parents must  begin with and use a process that involves all such users in selecting, implementing, and evaluating that change. Examining barriers to citizen involvement, the paper concludes that many rural citizens feel left out of their local school decision making processes and that a new promising approach of involving citizens exists. Finally, the paper suggests that a new support mechanism be made that will make available a planned change model for interested school districts, regional service agencies, and State Departments of Education.

Social inequalities resulting from discriminatory patterns based upon sex, social class, and place of residence were explored. The U.S. case focused on high school seniors and their plans for college; the German phase dealt with &quot;Volksschule&quot; (elementary) students and their plans for further schooling, and secondary school students and their plans to attain the &quot;Abitur&quot; (university preparation). The Norwegian phase dealt with &quot;ungdomsskole&quot; (comprehensive intermediate)  pupils and their plans to enter the gymnas (secondary), and gymnas students and their plans to go on to the university. Scholastic performance level, the independent variable, was measured by cumulative grade average. U.S. schools consistently and to a marked degree ranked girls over boys. In the Norwegian and German schools, although this sex discrimination pattern also existed, it was of far lesser magnitude. Social class origin manifested a strong effect in the U.S. and Norwegian cases, but was insignificant in Germany. It was concluded that sex biasing is more evident in the U.S. case, with girls being favored within the secondary school, and boys gaining a considerable advantage at the point of transition to higher education.

        "description":"The literature suggested that marriage provides alternative occupational achievement for women who opt by choice or by circumstance to attain socioeconomic position through their husbands' occupations, and that an advantageous social contact setting is crucial for access to promising mates so that a woman's personal attributes can be beneficial for marriage mobility. This study examined the experience of 34 women from a typically rural area (characterized by overall depression and a strong outmigration by the youth of the areas) to understand why, faced with limited opportunities, some achieved advancement through marriage while others remained nonmobile. The present study concerns a cohort of 134 females, first studied in 1957, who married during the post high school decade. It  was found that women who met their husbands after moving to an urban social context were more likely to be mobile than women who met their husbands in a rural setting. When personal attributes were considered, it was found that most women who met their spouses in an urban setting achieved status advancement through marriage irrespective of personal characteristics. In contrast, positive personal attributes were strongly related to an advantageous marriage among the women who met their husbands in a rural context. The only personal attribute that appeared to relate strongly to marriage mobility was intelligence. (KM)",

        "description":"The sex-role attitudes of 910 once-married females, aged 40-44, were examined to ascertain their support for traditional as opposed to modern sex-role orientations. In addition, 5 variables (education, employment status, residence, age at marriage, and number of children) hypothesized to influence these attitudes were tested by analysis of variance for the statistical significance of the observed relationships. The subjects had participated in a 25 year longitudinal study of a cohort of people from nonmetropolitan areas in Pennsylvania. Data for the present study were obtained in 1971 by personal interviews and self-administered questionnaires. The 2 categories of items were: 1) attitudes toward work and employment; and 2) aspects of sex-role stereotyping. Findings show little  support for either traditional sex-role attitudes or for the modern, equalitarian model. Instead, there was considerable ambivalence and ambiguity in these women's sex-role attitudes. Education was clearly the most important correlate of modern sex-role attitudes. Similarly, employed women and urban women had more modern attitudes than unemployed and rural women, although the effects of these variables were somewhat less than that of education. The 2 indicators of role-traditional living, age at marriage, and number of children, were largely unrelated to attitudinal dimensions. Findings are in tabular form. (Author/NQ)",

The research design obtained a representative sample of these youths through a proportionate, stratified, random cluster sampling technique. The 1968 procedures were: (1) the State was stratified into 4 geographical areas which represented its different economic and social groups; (2) within each area, between 4 and 6 schools were randomly selected from nonmetropolitan parishes to obtain black and white student representative of the nonmetropolitan State enrollment; and (3) senior students were the respondents. In 1972, due to integration practices, only schools whose racial groupings could correspond to the 1968 schools were sampled. The initial sample consisted  of 217 black and 325 white respondents; the 1972 sample included 141 black and 312 white respondents. The approximately 20 tables give percentage rates for changes, both by sex and race, and by residency and race, for such things as occupational aspirations, aspiration levels, intensity of aspirations, occupational expectations, and a working table gives frequency distributions of occupational orientations.

        "description":"Presented are some findings concerning self-identification as a tool for temporary system evaluation based on the reactions of participants in a resource personnel leadership training workshop. Goodson's model for classification of individuals by influence style (tough battler, friendly helper, and logical thinker) was used to self-categorize the participants into three subgroups. Each group was then asked to conduct a brainstorming session to develop program content for a seminar to be presented the following week. There was a high correlation between the content of the lists compiled by a subgroup and the characteristics of influence style as identified by Goodson. There was also an extreme lack of overlap of topics generated by the three subgroups. The investigator concluded  that the limited observational evidence collected tended to be supportive of the statement that either the adult educators were able to \"play the game\" by a set of rules to which they were briefly introduced or self-select into a group with a theoretical influence style and behave consistently with the theoretical construct. However, the methodology employed in the experiment was extremely loose, and the results have not been, and probably cannot be, assessed. (PEB)",

For the purposes of his presentation, the author uses \"mentally handicapped\" to designate those children who fit into any of the categories of those who are mentally retarded, have learning disabilities, or are handicapped by factors other than intellectual subnormality and thus fail to keep pace with their peers in academic achievement. Motor activity refers to things that children do actively in a pleasurable situation in order to learn. The author suggests that science experiences, particularly those of the physical sciences, can be presented through physical education activities and provides eight concepts to  illustrate this point.

This was necessitated by an interruption of the school year by a teachers' strike. Three objectives guided the project: (1) to insure that children would obtain the basic science skills contained in the Elementary Science Primary Unit of the Philadelphia Public Schools, (2) to enrich the scientific course of study, and (3) to test the worth of open classroom techniques in a traditional setting. The major objective for the teachers was to extend the knowledge of newly developed scientific concepts wherein it might enable them to  better prepare their pupils to meet the scientific age. Descriptive information is provided for the Primary Science Unit and the Primary Ecology Unit, including concepts involved, steps of organization, correlation of subject matter, and culminating activities for each of the two units.

Cressman's approach deals with the so-called Early Man record, using artifacts as a means to an end and not an end in themselves. He presents a consideration of the origins of the New World population considering first the question of indigenous origin. This he rules out and then presents in detail the facts that support that the population was derived from another continent, namely,  northeastern Asia. Evidence is presented from geological data, and the archaeological evidence is presented in detail. A list of publications of the Museum of Natural History at the University of Oregon is included.

Therefore the Environmental Studies Division, Washington Environmental Research Center, Office of Research and Development invited a number of experts to present their views on alternative futures, the environment, and the quality of life. Each speaker was asked to prepare comments in one of three research themes: The Nature of the  Environmental Crisis, Zero Population Growth and the Environment, and Implications of Alternative Growth Policies on Environmental Quality. This book, which resulted from the papers and discussions at the forum, is divided into two parts. Part 1, Challenges of Alternative Futures, reviews the environmental and population issues, presents a recent systems method of analyzing the problems of growth and summarizes the international implications of growth policy. Part 2, Coping with Alternative Futures, presents human behavioral factors and their influence on growth policy. Classical and modern concepts of economics and implications for growth policy conclude the work. (Editors/PEB)",

        "description":"This material is one publication of a series of documents available from the Institute for Environmental Education (Cleveland) and consists of a curriculum activities guide to birds, bugs, dogs, and weather and environmental studies. The first edition of this material was prepared by the Documentation Task Force of Project KARE, Philadelphia, and was revised by personnel at the institute. The guide is intended for use by teachers and students until they feel sufficiently confident to prepare their own materials and is organized into three sections: Chapter 1 is on awareness activities, 2 on transitional activities, and 3 on operational activities. Awareness activities, developed with process skills in mind, are designed to orient students toward a concern for environmental  problems and a realization that the problems are appropriate subjects for study. Transitional activities are directed toward real community concerns. Operational activities are integrated with community efforts to solve environmental problems. The guide's format is that of a questioning sequence, using questions to (1) lead to the activity, (2) initiate the activity, (3) continue the activity, (4) expand the activity, and (5) evaluate the activity. Teachers using the guide are invited to use only those activities that are most appropriate to their situation. (PEB)",

Approximately 180 dental educators, including 69 official delegates from every dental school in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico attended. The program aimed primarily at presenting some selected views on basic science subjects with the hope that such presentations would serve the immediate future as a common matrix for reference and evaluation by all concerned. The current status of basic science courses in the dental curriculum was described, new and pertinent areas of information relative to contemporary biology and dentistry were delineated, and problem areas were identified. The symposium was  made up of four sessions: Major Advances in Fundamental Biology During Post-War Period, Current Status of Basic Science Courses in Dental Curriculum I, Current Status of Basic Science Courses in Dental Curriculum II, and Future Needs and Directions.

Conference participants explored the elements of the Christian tradition--as well as of the Eastern religious and the Native American outlooks--which could be applicable to contemporary environmental problems. In addition they sought to grapple with such questions as: Does the environment have rights? Should the church concern itself with environmental issues? What does a land ethic consist of? How can abstract ethical positions be applied to specific land use questions? The discussion of these questions is  contained in the section, Reports of Value Task Groups. In addition, the five papers presented at this conference are included in the document. The titles of these papers are: The Role of Values and Ethics in Environmental Concerns; Reflections on the Alleged Ecological Bankruptcy of Western Theology; Eastern-Mystical Perspectives on Environment; Ethics for Environment: Native American Insights; and A Paradigm Case in Land Use Ethics: Door County, Wisconsin.

For purposes of evaluation, the project has been organized into three major components; Instructional; Development; and Management. Each component has product and process objectives. Within the present project, evaluation efforts have centered on individual project objectives, which concern (1) identification of children with deficient reading readiness, language development, and perceptual motor skills, (2) development of a course of instruction for these children, (3) development of training programs for aides and instructors in this program, and (4) development of a monitoring and evaluation scheme to ensure  adherence to the first three objectives. The report discusses the rationale for the project, and describes the target population, as well as project operations and outcomes. It is concluded that the program accomplished most training and management objectives and developed a significant group of instructional materials. However, the majority of instructional objectives were not attained. It is suggested that this may be due to inappropriate goals, which should be reevaluated. (DP)",

A major objective of this pilot study was to be able to answer questions about what it is like to be an advisor, what problems arise in the course of using this approach, and how an advisory system should be designed. The second paper, \"Developmental Stages of Preschool Teachers\" suggests four dimensions of training for preschool teachers: (1) developmental stages of the teacher; (2) training needs of each stage; (3) location of the training; and (4) timing of training. In the third  paper, \"The Enabling Model for Early Childhood Programs\" the broad dimensions of the Enabler Model have been outlined. Rather than offering a community a predesigned experimental curriculum, the Enabler Model provides regular on-site support and guidance to assist local communities in the formulation and implementation of their own preschool programs. The last paper, \"Condition with Caution\", provides a paradigm in terms of phenotype and genotype for the consideration of contrasting explanations of behavior. (CS)",

Eighty subjects per grade at grades 3, 5, and 7 were tested. A stimulus array consisted of five cards, each of which contained pictures that could be designated as central or incidental. The stimulus cards were presented for 20 trials. Recognition for central stimuli improved when color cues differentiated them from incidental stimuli, but there was no differential effect with age. Permitting rehearsal resulted in improved recall and recognition performance. At the older age levels, in the rehearsal condition, recognition of central stimuli was hindered less by the incidental stimuli than in the condition which interfered with  rehearsal. (Author/DP)",

The demonstration program explores the feasibility and outcome of having parents involved in a program with their children. This evaluative study of impact on parents centers around the program's primary objectives: to have (1) impact on parenting skills and attitudes, (2) impact on the parents' sense of self esteem and feelings of control over their environment and  personal destiny, (3) impact on the parents' knowledge and use of community resources, and (4) impact on the parents' use of health facilities and on their nutrition practices.

The population of the North is polarized between 2 social groups: the minority of white incomers, who have the jobs, money, and power; and the native Indians, Eskimos, and Metis, who are economically deprived, culturally alienated, and politically powerless. Although broadcasting is the obvious means of mass communication for these isolated people who do not have a written culture, media in the North is predominantly middle class in its outlook and appeal, aimed at the white minority. If broadcasting is to change and help the native peoples it must serve them as both a source of information and entertainment and as a means of self expression. This paper explains  experimental and community broadcasting programs that could meet the needs of native people. It also details programs currently being developed by the Northern Service of the CBC, one of 2 main broadcasters in the North, and by other agencies such as the Native Communications Society of Alberta and the Society for the Coastal Area Network in British Columbia.

        "description":"The report detailed an experiment with 3 methods of instructing American Indian children in Taholah Elementary School (Quinault Reservation, Washington State). To assess the relative value of instructional methods in the school, 2 conditions had to prevail. The content of the lessons was to be unknown to pupils at all grade levels, and the content should be of general interest to the students. To satisfy these conditions, the study of the nature of cities was selected for its interest appeal. The 3 instruction methods were: (a) a method that relied totally on textual materials that the students have to read; (b) a method that required the text to be presented orally by the teacher with supplemental pictures; and (c) a visual presentation with large overheads followed by an oral  teacher presentation. The experiment used a 3x3x3 design. The 3 dimensions--grade, concepts, and methods--were each divided into 3 parts. The 6 grades were divided into 3 groups: 3-4, 5-6, and 7-8. A total of 104 pupils were used in the experiment. Analysis of student achievement by the individual concepts across methods yielded an F-ratio which was not sufficiently large to be significant. The F-ratio on the central place concept was .15, on the special function concept .24, and on the break-of-bulk concept it was 1.1. (FF)",

        "description":"The report investigated the educational policy of Federal and state governments toward American Indians in California from 1850 to 1934. In California the fate of official efforts and non-efforts at educating Indians can be divided into 3 distinct periods. The period between 1849 and 1870 was a time when virtually nothing was attempted. Between 1870 and 1920 the principal focus was on education in Federal day and boarding schools. Finally, by the third decade of the present century the public schools assumed primary responsibility for Indian education. The dominant theme of this report was the sheer physical destruction and exploitation of Indians by white settlers, often with at least the passive support of the state government. Educated estimates place the Indian population as  high as 260,000 in 1769; 100,000 in 1848 at the dawn of the American period; and less than 20,000 by 1880. For all its inadequacies and misadventures which became legend over the next century, the Federal government did assume responsibility for some measure of Indian welfare. The state, on the other hand, focused most of its efforts on exclusion. The election of Franklin Roosevelt in 1932 and the arrival on the national scene of Commissioner of Indian Affairs John Collier produced a substantial shift in national attitudes toward Indians.

Of the various methods considered for geographical redistribution of medical manpower to rural areas, the one that may hold the greatest promise is the recruitment of physicians to organized groups. Also, in some rural areas, solutions completely different from the traditional \"physician in residence\" must be sought. Emphasis may be needed on expanded transportation and communication capabilities, part-time use of physicians and allied health workers, new physician support occupations, and better understanding of  individual health practices. To help close these gaps in rural communities, several suggestions are offered, such as: (1) physicians in communities can lead recruitment efforts; (2) if communities do not have adequate financial and population resources for recruitment, they can combine their resources with nearby communities; (3) citizens in every community can make efforts to reduce the burdens they place on rural physicians; and (4) the need for medical personnel can be advertised through physician placement services, medical schools, and teaching hospitals. It is also noted that, to improve rural health, the totality of deficiencies in rural living today must be addressed. (KM)",

        "description":"Summarizing recent research on evaluative reactions toward Mexican American speech varieties, the paper obtained contrasting evaluative reactions for standard English versus standard Spanish, for standard English versus highly accented English, and for varying degrees of accented English. Anglo and Mexican American adolescents from a Chicago high school rated the personalities of 16 speakers representing 4 \"context x language\" categories: English-Home, Spanish-Home, English-School, and Spanish-School. For both groups, there was a definite preference for English in school, and slight preference for Spanish in the home. The important effect of the contextual domain on evaluative reactions toward English and Spanish speakers suggested that the subject takes into account the  appropriateness of the speaker's behavior as well as his ethnicity. In eliciting reactions toward standard and accented English, standard speakers received more favorable reactions in every case. The relationship between the amount of accentedness heard and the attributed characteristics of the speaker was also investigated. High correlations between accentedness rating and each of the other ratings indicated that small increments in accentedness are associated with gradually less favorable impressions of the speaker. Overall, the investigations established the effects of context and degree of accent, indicating that group membership is only one factor underlying the reactions. It was also noted that, since the studies were conducted solely in the Chicago area, they revealed only one  dimension of the Mexican American adolescent experience. (KM)",

The sample was limited to youths from 3 rural Texas counties and only those with parental SES scores, using the Duncan socioeconomic index (1961), of equal to or less than 45 were included. In addition to testing for differences in occupational projections, analysis of 2 previously tested propositions was also reported. These dealt with the goal blockage an individual envisioned might prevent his obtaining the occupation he most desired. The 2 blockage items analyzed were race and schools attended. Information used in  this analysis was obtained by combining data collected from a panel of high school sophomores and seniors in 1966 and 1968, with a follow-up in 1972. The differences in occupational projections of blacks from segregated and desegregated schools were minimal. It was noted that it was the desegregated, not the segregated, blacks who saw schools attended as comparatively more detrimental; this was the opposite of what had been posited. The overall finding of the study concluded that school desegregation in and of itself will have little, if any, effect on the mobility chances of black youths. (FF)",

        "description":"The study is a continuation of previous research into the nature and magnitude of the delinquency problem among Wind River Indian Reservation youths in Wyoming. The study is based on responses to a self-report questionnaire concerning delinquent acts, alcohol use and drug use which was administered to 9-12 grade students in high schools in the Wind River Indian Reservation area (May 1972). Findings were based on a sample that included 355 Anglo males, 315 Anglo females, 68 Indian males and 62 Indian females. There was little overall difference in the self-reported delinquent activities of Indian and Anglo males, with the exception that Indians were more involved in offenses centering around the school. Data did indicate, however, that compared to the Anglo female, the Indian  female was considerably more involved in running away from home and in school centered offenses. Also, although there was an indication of a slightly greater drug use by Indians, the study did not indicate that illegal drinking is more of a problem among Indians than Anglos. The Indian youths in this study were disproportionately concentrated in the lower class and were somewhat underrepresented in the middle class. Thus, it is possible that some or all of the differences that have been found between Indian and Anglo delinquency may be due to differential social class distribution. This hypothesis was analyzed by sex, race, and social class. (FF)",

        "description":"Small schools, at one time the basis of education in the U.S., achieved an uncomfortable status with the development of urban centers and increasingly larger schools. Urged to consolidate to provide better services and to reduce costs, small schools were reluctant to abandon many of their advantages, such as close teacher-student relationships. Therefore, they adapted to the change, continuing to capitalize on a major strength--the emphasis on the human element of learning. This paper presents 6 major adaptations that have not only improved rural education, but that have also maintained the small school. These are: (1) the development of shared service programs; (2) the addition of extra courses to supplement curricula (i.e., correspondence courses, honors seminars via telephone,  and multiple classes); (3) flexible scheduling, where teachers can identify problems during the morning, discuss and develop the idea during the afternoon, and run a trial test the next day; (4) the development of close community-school relations, and the joint resolution of local problems, such as the combining of the town and school libraries; (5) a development of empathy for the learner, where teachers and community members with special expertise assist other teachers and groups when needed; and (6) the maximum utilization of resources, especially the development of natural resources by students and teachers. Many small school administrators feel that these practices could be well adapted to the larger, urban schools. (KM)",

The survey form contained 84 questions in 4 categories: (1) personal, (2) education, (3) employment, and (4) culture. Procedures to implement the survey included the hiring and training of Indian surveyors. Over 1,260 family units had been surveyed when data gathering was concluded on July 31, 1972. Indians came to Dallas because of a greater chance for employment and were planning to stay for the same reason, yet their children, born and raised in the city, expressed a strong  desire to return to their parents' rural home. Almost 1/2 did not complete high school education. Only 44% attended a college or technical school. Only 3.1% completed 4 years of college and received a bachelor's degree. A great deal of interest was expressed in training for management and eventual self-employment. Roughly 3/4 of the respondents understood their native language and 50% said they spoke it. Eight recommendations were included; i.e., Indian organizations in Dallas should implement a program to aid Indians in their adjustment to city life. (FF)",

Under the leadership provided by the chiefs and the 3 elected committees--education, housing, and library culture center--a number of programs have been initiated which have served to improve the quality of life on the reservation and open new opportunities for Mohawks. Beginning with the library project the Mohawks have attempted to bridge the barrier to tribal unity created by the international border (United States and Canada) that divides tribal lands. Planned programs in education, health, and economic development are aimed at further reducing this  artificial division of the Mohawk community. There exists a growing sense of pride in the community by virtue of the accomplishments achieved over the past 6 years (1968-74). The presence of the cultural center and the initiation of mohawk language and cultural-history courses in the schools has contributed substantially to increasing Mohawk tribal identity and self-awareness. The sense of unity and community strength which developed out of the school boycott has enabled the Mohawks to begin the long road to regaining control of their community. Membership on the school board and voting rights in school elections have made the school districts more responsive to Mohawk needs. (FF)",

The survey gathered data on when students were taken out of the classroom for educational experiences, resource areas used, related curriculum areas, reasons for out-of-door activities, materials used, factors that discouraged outdoor education, and teacher opinions as to the need for a specialist or workshops in outdoor education. Because of the small number of teachers in the survey (44 out of 66 responded) there was not a significant  difference between the number of teachers that had participated in outdoor education and those that had not. There were 18 findings which determined, for instance, that outdoor education experiences were most frequent in grades K-4 and that the curricular areas most frequently stressed were science, social studies, health, and safety. The 6 recommendations generally covered resource areas, curriculum, materials, teacher aids, workshops, and the need for an outdoor education specialist. (KM)",

        "author":["Barnhardt, Ray"],
        "description":"The program known as the Alaska Rural Teacher Training Corps (ARTTC) was established in 1970 as a 4-year experimental program to train Native elementary school teachers for rural Alaskan native communities or for any school in the country where an Alaskan teaching certificate is acceptable. The beginning group included an even distribution of males and females ranging in age from 18 to 48 who are a mixture of 4 distinct native groups. As the program proceeded, it became apparent that it was not going to be simply a matter of applying the latest teacher training techniques. This paper explains the 3 basic questions explored in the program: (1) Why train natives to become teachers? (2) What is a native teacher? and (3) How do you train native teachers? Another area that was  investigated is the curriculum: what students were doing, and what they were supposed to learn during their stay in the program. Finally, the paper discusses what participants in this experimental program learned. This evaluation and discussion of the above areas concludes that it is difficult to be a native and a teacher too. The program may not really be training &quot;teachers&quot; since the feed-back from the participants was that they felt more like general practitioners than specialists. Also, literature in education, as well as anthropology, is often of limited use in the program. (FF)",

Chapter I traced the development of the American school system from its inception in colonial America to contemporary times. Characteristics of America's rural population were identified and briefly explained, focusing on educational opportunities in rural areas. The development of the intermediate educational unit was followed from its origin as a county unit to its relatively recent emergence as a regional one. Chapter II contained a detailed comparison of these units, explaining that intermediate units organized on a regional basis are much more efficient and economical than those limited by county lines. Chapter III discussed several  specific programs provided through regional intermediate units which appeared to meet the needs of both small and large schools. Recommendations for bettering rural education covered: (1) regulatory versus service roles, emphasizing that, when regional programs are more effective than similar ones offered by individual schools, these schools should be required to participate in the regional program; (2) boards of control, which should represent the clientele organizations of the regional units; (3) financing, including guaranteed basic funding for core program operations; (4) staffing, especially the intermediate unit's chief executive and his administrative team, and (5) improving services to rural schools through these regional intermediate units.

It explains that, if migrant children are to have successful experiences in the succession of schools they attend, it will be because of the staff. The most important service a school or community can provide the migrant child is a staff trained to meet his special needs. Despite this, however, there has been no national strategy or funding for staff development, which has seriously impeded achieving the intent of the Title I Elementary and Secondary Education Act migrant amendment. Therefore, the preparation of staff to work with these children must become a national priority in migrant education. Staff development  programs hould include training in: (1) helping the migrant child adapt to each new environment; (2) learning to adapt to and work with culturally and ethnically different groups; (3) learning what effect migratory farmwork has on the lives of these children; (4) helping the child better his self concept; and (5) using \"process approach\" skills to help children meet new problems and situations.

By exploring their background and family life styles, it is hoped that some sort of understanding of their aspiration problems could aid the school counselors. The paper is divided into 4 main discussions: (1) characteristics of rural life, (2) problems of rural students, (3) counseling rural students, and (4) special problems of counseling in rural schools. The paper points out that rural youths do have special needs and problems--e.g., graduates from small schools experience less success in college than do graduates from larger schools. A review of the literature in this area reveals 3 special interest areas: (1) special tools and skills that will help these students, (2) numerous helpful  agencies, and (3) the ability to approach each individual as one human being to another. A list of 24 special problems are also presented, such as (1) parents do not realize the importance of post high school education or training; (2) rural areas are less likely to have manpower programs of vocational training available; and (3) there is less opportunity to participate in job-placement programs. Not all is grim in rural school counseling, though. There is greater flexibility and closeness to students and the community environment. (FF)",

The Program of Special Directed Studies for Transition to College (PSDS) was administered by the Claremont University Center. PSDS was a 5-year experimental project primarily funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. It recruited, selected, and provided a program for students whose high school achievement was inadequate to secure regular admission to the colleges. The program was primarily developed for Mexican American students, although Black, Asian American, American Indian, and Anglo students were included. These students all reflected characteristics of &quot;disadvantage&quot; and &quot;risk&quot;. PSDS provided selected students with some  $3,800 per year in financial assistance, a special education program, and up to 2 years to qualify for regular college admission. In all, 158 students (61.4% Spanish surnamed) entered the Claremont Colleges through PSDS. Of these, 95 matriculated. The findings tentatively suggested that carefully defined special admission procedures will minimize failure, although the issue of compensatory education effectiveness remains basically unexplored. The findings also suggested that the traditional cognitive measures used to predict academic success for all students are valid only for the student with traditional credentials. Lacking evidence to the contrary, the success of the program at this time may be attributed to selection alone. (KM)",

These patients are given a chest X-ray, a complete physical, and a developmental history, followed up with electrocardiograms. A surgical clinic is also held once a month by a pediatric surgeon. A weekly foot clinic is held by a podiatrist. A new additional health service is the optometric consultant for patients requiring glasses. In  social services, an additional nun, who specializes in child guidance, was added. Inclusion of other physicians within the county who treat patients in their own offices has relieved some of the transportation burden. The exciting accomplishment was the addition of hospitalization. Other services provided are an obstetrical clinic, ambulance services, and the registration and issuing of cards to attract migrants to the clinic. (FF)",

        "description":"The question addressed in this paper is to what extent does the use of measurement indicators based on differing, even contradictory, epistemic assumptions affect the acceptability of the empirical conclusions. The approach used monotonic transformations of empirically obtained measures of occupational and educational status to investigate the effect of patterns of intervalization which were isomorphic with epistemic relationship between the indices and the theoretical construct of social status. Data for this report were obtained from a 3 wave, 6 year panel of nonmetropolitan southern youths in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina. The first sample of high school sophomores was originally collected in 1966 and 1967, and subsequently 2 and 6 years  later. From the resulting panel of 1,228, 627 males were analyzed. The analysis of the matrix of occupational transformations tended to suggest that, at least, for occupational status measures of the Duncan SEI type that the relaxation of assumption of interval measurement required for parametric procedures may not result in excessive error. The configuration of the correlation coefficients for the educational status tended to follow a similar pattern. The reader is cautioned, however, about accepting the conclusions drawn from this analysis because there do not exist, at this time, any satisfactory procedures for analyzing differences in the type of coefficients produced or for directly evaluating epistemic error.

The analysis of the stability of marital plans and educational expectations in this report focused only on these attitudes during the sophomore and senior years. The analysis for females indicated that the correlation between marital plans and educational expectations observed in cross-sectional  data results from marital plans, in part determining subsequent development of educational expectations, whereas the reverse influence is of negligible effect. At a higher level of abstraction, it would support the contention that marriage and possibly motherhood were major goals for women relative to educational considerations. The same analysis for males, however, resulted in the lack of any relationship between the 2 variables. (KM)",

        "author":["Palmer, James M."],
        "description":"Since 1952, the South has experienced a remarkable growth in private schools. These new schools, because of their relationship to the desegregation of public schools, have often been dubbed &quot;Segregation Academies&quot;. This phenomenon is quite extensive, and the evidence seems to indicate that it may well be continuing. There are 6 basic types of private (non-parochial) schools: schools for special groups; schools for the handicapped; college preparatory schools; Christian schools (non-denominational); community schools; and Segregation Academies. The Segregation Academies, predominant in the South, arose out of the desegregation movement in the early 1950's. They first played a dual role -- acting as a safety valve to prevent possible racial violence while prolonging, if not  heightening, racial tensions. Since that time, these schools have flourished and appeared to have become a permanent part of southern life. Discussing this issue, the paper concludes: (1) private education in the South is a factor that must be reckoned with; (2) since these schools are not bound by tradition or bureaucracy, they may develop innovative educational models that can be used in public schools; (3) where private schools are strong in a local community, the public school may need to place a stronger emphasis on vocational curricula; (4) some type of open communication needs to be established between the public and private systems; and (5) some form of state accreditation and/or setting of educational standards should be afforded these schools.

        "description":"In recent times the ultimate role of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) in Alaskan education has been questioned, focusing on how much longer the BIA will operate schools and what form, if any, BIA education will have within and following the next 5 years. Therefore, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs (former Area Director for the Juneau Area Office) asked that the Alaska Native Needs Assessment in Education (Project ANNA) be undertaken. The project was conducted from January-October, 1973. The document content includes (1) a project description of the needs assessment in education; (2) student survey; (3) student characteristics; (4) Alaskan Native student enrollment; (5) resident education evaluation; (6) educational preferences of Alaskan Native School Boards; (7) Alaskan  Native high school dropouts; and (8) a future educational outlook. For easy reading and understanding, a project summary is presented first. The reader is advised to pay close attention to the Appendices, when the vital details of this report are contained. Though this project was not as broad as was planned, it encompasses a comprehensive approach to basic issues in Native education and should serve an important role in the decision-making process. Although data from the project will be used in a number of different problem areas, it centers on certain specified areas, such as the identification of the educational preference of Alaskan Native peoples and the development of a benchmark of education information which reflects current BIA programs.

        "description":"Well-financed and appropriately organized school districts are essential if rural education is to be improved. Since all 3 levels of government (local, state, and Federal) participate in providing revenues for rural education, coordination among them is necessary. In many states, the local property tax still provides a major portion of educational funding. In such states, property tax administration is of prime importance, since a poorly administered system limits the availability of revenues. In much of rural America, therefore, property tax reform is a matter of some urgency. If rural students are to be provided with an education appropriate for life in modern society, the quality of their schooling should not be based on local tax-paying ability. Considering the states'  responsibility for the support of education, movement toward full state funding is recommended. Statewide planning is also needed to ensure that revenues provided by the state are used effectively. State leadership in the planning activities of local and regional authorities is an important element in the development of improved rural educational systems. Federal categorical support of programs designed to improve rural education should be continued. Within this complex financial and organizational system, the rural educator plays the key role. Therefore, administrators and school board members in rural communities should be provided with financial and technical assistance to permit them to meet the needs of their students. (KM)",

        "description":"Four rural counties in Texas--Jones, Haskell, Stonewall, and Fisher--were selected for the study because they represent every type of problem which needed to be examined to develop a comprehensive career education model. Since 1950, the population in each of these counties has declined, and the population characteristics have changed. Even with a revitalization of agriculture, future economic decline was predicted unless fundamental changes take place, such as industrial development. The ability of these communities to survive rests more with the high school youths than with their parents. In discussing the role of the public school, the report pointed out that lack of intelligent school consolidation is badly hurting the image of the area and dooming the future of those smaller  towns with inadequate school systems. In order to save these communities, the schools must become community leaders, especially in providing career education. This will provide a strong attraction for industry to enter the area. A series of strategies for career education were discussed, with only a modest step forward suggested at this time, since the more basic and fundamental problems faced by the area must be resolved before any full-scope career education program can be considered. The document also noted that, although the study only covered 4 counties in Texas, its findings and conclusions were germane to similar counties in rural America. (KM)",

        "description":"The study attempted to determine whether any significant differences of educational achievement, as measured by a standard test of academic performance, existed between groups and subgroups within 2 high school levels of varied ethnicity and socioeconomic status. The study was conducted at Hot Springs High School, Truth or Consequences (New Mexico). All 9th and 11th grade students enrolled for 1970-71 were involved. Students with Spanish surnames were classified as Mexican Americans; all others as Anglos. Three hypotheses concerning the effects of ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and interaction between ethnicity and socioeconomic status were formulated and tested by analysis of variance. The only significant difference found was that for ethnicity at the 11th grade level. Lack  of significant difference for socioeconomic status was attributed to the cohesiveness of the sample grades, smallness of the county population, and absence of racial or social barriers in the community setting. Recommendations included replication with expansion to cover one or more school districts, including both urban and rural areas; assessment of educational goals and procedures and immediate revision of curricula to motivate and retain the low socioeconomic student, especially the Mexican American; and efforts to identify and modify, if practicable, such socioeconomic factors as self-concept.

A simultaneous survey was made of the attitudes and opinions of elementary teachers concerning the college general biology course. The survey results from both groups were compared. The study revealed the course topics, methodology and philosophy which the college general biology faculty and the elementary teachers believed should be included in a general biology course as part of the general education program. Differences in opinions between the two  groups resulted in little agreement concerning the amount of emphasis given to specific biological principles. The two groups were in close agreement concerning the methodology and philosophy to be used in a beginning biology course. Conclusions were reached on how the college general biology course could be developed as an integrated part of the preservice training of elementary teachers. (Author/JR)",

The purpose was to assess the levels of self-initiation, direction, and evaluation for differently treated pupils. Samples were comprised of the pupils and teachers from eight IPI and eight control schools. Fourth- through sixth-grade students were referred to as middle level pupils and third-grade students, as early pupils. The instruments used included: the teachers' checklist, the middle level pupil opinion form, and the early pupil form. Parents of fourth- and fifth-grade students also completed an opinionnaire. Results obtained showed that teachers' perception of teaching roles and teacher-pupil interaction was almost identical between the IPI and control groups. The IPI  teachers had a significantly different positive attitude toward teacher aides. The IPI pupils were found to be more motivated, self-directed, and independent than control pupils on the parents' opinionnaire. Middle level IPI pupils had significantly higher scores on measures of creative tendency, self-concept, and attitude toward school than control pupils. For early pupils, the control group had a higher attitude toward school while the IPI group had a higher self-concept. Effects of IPI were not apparent at the lower level grade. (CC)",

The meaningful development-of-structure approach emphasized closure, commutativity, associativity, and the identity element of addition; the inverse relationship between addition and subtraction; and place value. The control groups essentially used drill-type activities. The subjects were students from a middle class elementary school in Tampa, Florida who had the poorest performances on pretests.

Analyses are made in connection with placement status at each degree level, major curricula of different job climate, expected graduate shortage, student trends in schools accredited by the Engineers' Council for  Professional Development (ECPD schools) and non-accredited schools, starting salaries, and chronological comparison. Job prospects for next year's graduates are reported as good. Graduates of ECPD schools are more likely to continue further study in comparison with non-ECPD school graduates. The strength of the observed demand decreases gradually from bachelor's in engineering to older alumni through bachelor's of engineering technology, associates in technology, master's in engineering, and bachelor's of industrial technology. The lowest group is PhD's. Women graduates average slightly higher salary offers than men at the BS degree level. Blacks and other minority graduates are characterized as in very strong demand. Also included are statistical tables of varying-degree graduates versus  institutions and curricula. (CC)",

Several small groups of students, acting as Economic Advisory Councils, make fiscal and monetary policy decisions for their country based on their knowledge of business cycles, monetary policy, and fiscal policy. In each of the four rounds the Advisory Councils study a chart of Economic Indicators to determine the state of the nation's economy, fill out a Decision and Analysis Chart according to their perceptions of the economy, and survey the effects of their decisions to decide the new, over-all state of the economy. In class discussion, each Council presents its point of view; an economist's \"correct\" answers are provided by the teacher and discussion continues. There is no student reward besides  the satisfaction of guiding the country successfully. The game materials are included in the teacher's guide and consist of a set of directions for students, and, for each round, transparencies, Decision and Analysis Charts, and Economic Indicators Charts. The guide provides the teacher with introductory information and a discussion of economic options and causal relationships possible in each round. (JH)",

Much of the first year of NIE's existence was spent in reviewing and evaluating programs that were transferred into the agency, recruiting a staff, and digesting the planning papers that had been prepared. For example, the planning paper  on sociology, prepared by a committee chaired by Burton Clark of Yale, points out the need to study schools as social organizations and to increase knowledge of how educational institutions interact with other sectors of the society. Sociologists have a great deal to contribute in these areas and are solicited to participate in research through any or all of the following NIE programs: 1) Office of Research Grants; 2) Office of Research and Exploratory Studies; 3) Office of Programmatic Research and Development; and 4) Office of Research and Development Resources.

The analysis focuses on the following three factors as a vehicle for generating programs that may have some potential for improving educational quality: 1) isolation --the extent to which students are isolated from the broader society by their schools; 2) sameness--the absence of diversity within American education; and 3) piecemeal  reform--the fragmented attempts at improving the quality of education which have not been sufficiently comprehensive and which do not address the systemic or structural variables that are necessary to fundamental reform.

To facilitate successful experimentation the following are necessary: an outside agency to conduct evaluation; criteria of success acceptable to innovators and critics; and, in control and comparison groups, assessment and accounting of the initial versus final status of students, equation of the student-teacher ratio and education cost per student, and a similar high level teacher competency. These criteria will help to produce standards for decision-making by potential users of the innovation. (The opportunity to evaluate the integrated classroom as a radical innovation is available in Berkeley.) The following hypotheses about traditional programs should also be tested for comparative  purposes: the most effective programs are those which assess the child's status and then devise applicable instruction; programs emphasizing intellectual abilities improve convergent, analytical thinking better than unguided discovery; effective remediation efforts require ability groupings or customized tutoring. A healthy educational environment depends upon educators who communicate meaningfully and know their subject matter, can behave rationally, value self-assertion and independence in children, and practice authoritative rather than authoritarian control or permissiveness.

An outline proposes a system of analysis of educational problems to provide a context for ideas and public scrutiny. The main body of the paper deals with educational problems and educational  system problems. Problems are stated, their symptoms and evidence discussed (incompletely), and note is made of questions raised by each problem. Educational problems which are considered are reading, mathematics, commitment to learning, motivation, curriculum, assessment, violence, and coping skills. System problems discussed are the quality of teaching, the rights of children, and research and development models.

The Planning Unit studies include this paper which traces the nature and evolution of Federal program development in education beginning with the Great Society programs. The general impact and evaluation of these programs are analyzed. Two possible conclusions based upon these experiences--that local implementation fails because of inadequate resources or deficient techniques for transfer--are applied to a proposal for a new style of development. A three phase model of program development, occurring over a longer time period, is outlined which would be based in  research, focusing on engineering aspects such as training techniques, technical assistance and materials for use by local personnel; that would experiment with mechanisms for training and with dissemination of program models using highly skilled staff; and that would approach as closely as possible a typical operation program with minimum use of the program design. Capabilities required by this proposed concept of program development are intended to meet the need to carry on lengthy program efforts and to provide long range planning. (Author/KSM)",

To fulfill its obligation, the NHF conducts a program in which humanists--university professors, creative artists, and others--work with selected schools who have applied for help. The NHF currently operates two kinds of programs for the schools, Individual Projects and Thematic Projects. These are reported on for the period 1972-73, as are the NHF Why Series, and Working Papers. A projection of the population upon whom the impact of NHF work has been directly felt is presented, as is a report of the means and forms of evaluation which have taken place.

        "description":"An attempt is made to understand the structural and transformational inter-relationships between processes of classification, segmentation, ranking, and segregation in a suburban high school from a cultural point of view. The first of three sections of the paper reviews the acceptance among social scientists in the last decades of the belief that America is not a totally equalitarian society but is stratified into a certain number of classes and of the belief that all men are equal, both contradicted by actual ranking, segregating and stratification processes. Specific examples of segregative and stratifying behaviors were studied in a New York high school. The school appears to have socio-economic and demographic homogeneity, but ways used by teachers to characterize students  are noted. Two general sets of acts, those which the school as an institution is entitled to react to and these which lie outside of its jurisdiction, are grouped and diagrammed. To the first set belong matters of scholastic performance and discipline; to the second, matters of socio-biological descent and individual personality. It is argued that what appears to be social class must be considered to be the product of processes which are not organized on class principles and that it is the very democratic ideal which, in certain situations, produces states of being which contradict some aspects of that same ideal.

        "description":"Rather than simply transferring the patterns and materials used in graduate school demography studies to the undergraduate curriculum in population education, it is argued that certain objectives should be established for the education of students in accordance with their special needs. Four kinds of demography--folk, citizen's, scholar's and humanist's--are identified and described. Folk demography allows the student to view himself as a population actor, to see himself as part of larger trends and to recognize his contribution to them. Citizen's demography requires an understanding of population literacy and of the interpretation of evidence and the development of judgements about facts and figures. The perspective of a scholar's demography is based on research processes.  Humanist's demography views population as a key to understanding of the history of society and of ideas. Concluding remarks reiterate that courses should be organized around what the student should know and indicate two problems for further consideration, the specific concepts and findings to be communicated to undergraduates and the place for population concerns within the curriculum.

        "description":"A survey conducted in Arkansas gathered information pertinent to the status of civics. The purpose was to develop a model teacher training program for civics teachers in the Arkansas public secondary schools and to propose revisions in the certification requirements. The survey obtained general information about civics including curriculum data, adequacy of teacher preparation, and the attitudes of social science teachers toward civics. A five-question survey was administered to teachers of civics in 198 secondary schools, selected at random, with each school size represented proportionally. Data gathered on the size of schools where civics is taught, a summary of academic majors and minors of participants, and the average number of hours taken in political science are tabulated  and analyzed. In a summary analysis of the survey, the following observations are made: civics is taught in 95% of the Arkansas public secondary schools and is required in two-thirds of them; teacher preparation is inadequate; most teachers consider themselves qualified but believe more hours in political science should be required for future teacher certification; additional hours in political science with more practical orientation are needed; the selection of textbooks is out-dated and limited. Recommendations based on the data conclude the study. (Author/KSM)",

The aims of the course are to show important ties between science and those disciplines in which nonscience students' primary interests lie; to develop in nonscience students the recognition that an intelligent perspective on science will be an essential part of their thinking; and to introduce them to works about science which can serve as prototypes for a continuing nonprofessional interest in science. The structure of the course is in two parts, each running for one ten-week term. Details of class meetings, scheduling, prerequisites, and participant characteristics are presented. The content, about 40% science and 60% about  science, is based on course materials listed in an attached bibliography. Criteria for book selection and a sequence of presentation of course content is outlined. The first major topic is the Copernican Revolution, the second the Darwinian-Mendelian Revolution, and the third behaviorism. Procedures for examinations and grading are presented, and the promotion of a worldview by the teacher is discussed. Ratings from students evaluation forms indicate uniform commendation.

        "description":"A review of educational research reveals that free and inexpensive materials are used today to a much greater extent than they had been in the past. Two studies, sponsored by the American Iron and Steel Institute, are evidence of the producer's interest in determining the strengths and weaknesses of the materials being sent into classrooms and utilized in instructional programs. An analysis of the data of these studies of teacher opinions in relation to free filmstrips and printed materials, ED 072 992 and SO 006 300 respectively, is presented in the major portion of this paper. Tables illustrate the similarity of the samples used in both studies, the effectiveness of the materials, and the opinions expressed concerning evaluation of free materials compared to commercially  produced materials. The second major, but brief, portion of the paper discusses data interpretation and recommendations. It is suggested that producers concentrate on narrowing the content focus, and that teachers be more selective in choice of materials before using them in the classroom. The final recommendation is for further study by producers of the ways in which teachers utilize free materials. A bibliography concludes the paper. (KSM)",

The development of citizenship assessment described in this paper typifies the processes undergone for each subject--art, career and occupational development, citizenship, literature, mathematics, music, reading, science, social studies, and writing. Of the following developmental components, emphasis has been placed on the first five, although the last two are now receiving greater attention: 1) development of objectives with the participation of educators and laymen; 2) development of exercises based on the objectives and representing various techniques and levels of difficulty; 3) determination of a probability population sample representing region, size of  community, and socioeconomic status; 4) administration of the exercises to the sample of 9-, 13-, and 17-year olds and an adult group aged 26-35; 5) scoring and analysis of the exercises by machine and trained evaluators; 6) reporting and dissemination; and 7) utilization. Components 6 and 7 describe the census-like reporting of data without interpretation.

        "description":"The National Assessment, a census-like study to collect information concerning the educational attainment of Americans, is being adapted in many states with the results of the adaptations being used for decision making by state agencies or by teachers and administrators. The characteristics of the adaptations follow patterns related to this distinction of intended user. From among those states which have adapted the National Assessment as a model for assessment programs, this paper discusses the state-level programs in Maine, Connecticut, Texas, and Colorado and the district-level programs in Nebraska and Maryland. Although certain characteristics denote a good assessment program, the many possible variations open the model to misuse. Appropriate use of the national model can  promote curriculum improvement and yield valuable information for decision making; for example, the necessity of determining behavioral objectives can lead to sharpened perceptions of educational aims, but the exercise can also narrow perspectives. Assessment data too can be misinterpreted and misapplied. An optimum use of the model is for accountability when applied to a total organization, such as a school.

A review of the concept of simulation is followed by a discussion of the circumstances which maximize interaction in classrooms. Teacher role, student participation, and small group dynamics are summarized into seven steps for maximum classroom interaction. Applications for both elementary and high school grades are discussed. Simulations appropriate for the needs of elementary education are observed to be those with activities emphasizing free communication, social responsibility and democratic decision-making. In the high school, it  is thought that the focused conversation technique creates student interest and develops self-confidence and leadership abilities. Several examples of games used successfully in high school situations are described and the role and nature of evaluation in simulation use are reviewed. References are followed by a general bibliography and a list of publishers of games. A related document is ED 083 057. (KSM)",

Such an approach requires a descriptive national profile; an analysis in terms of dynamics, output, goals, and constraints; a strategy to achieve the goals; and a plan to actualize them. Various perspectives in a sector assessment of education are possible depending upon the role played by education within national priorities: social demand, national development, manpower needs, economic returns, and employment generation. Implementing a sector assessement requires consideration of key elements such as sponsorship, identification of goals and perspectives, and needs for and limitations of quantitative analysis.  Recognition, definition, and consideration of opportunities within employment institutions, formal education, and nonformal education and training are also critical. Three methodological approaches widely recognized and implemented relative to national perspective -- manpower surveys, returns to investment in education, and tracer studies -- give an idea of the possibilities and liabilities available in sector analysis.

The study contains four main sections: origins of community schools; the community school in the black ghetto; the need for a new philosophy of education; and conclusions and recommendations. The historic background of community schools is reviewed and their continued development traced. Parent involvement in the community school of the black ghetto, teaching practices and problems, and the problem of  long-run stability are discussed. The prevailing American philosophy of education and the problems of social class and educational equality are related to a basic philosophy of education for Blacks today. The two features of this proposed philosophy are pride of origin and passion for equality. Twelve conclusions and recommendations for others involved in community schools conclude the study.

        "description":"The geography unit is designed for use in upper elementary grades. The unit objective is to help the student learn facts about the landscapes of the United States, the Netherlands, Australia, Russia, and Central Africa, and acquire generic ideas which he can apply to the analysis and comparison of other landscapes. The unit is an attempt to apply David P. Ausubel's concept of advance organizers to an elementary social studies unit. During the first three days of the unit, a conceptual rural landscape model is taught as the advance organizer. The following inclusive organizing model concepts are identified and developed: population, density, culture, earth complex (land, climate, vegetation), and technology. Specific informational data within this general framework is then  presented in each case study. Through questioning techniques the teacher leads the student through an analysis of the data. Among the 18 units outlined are the following: 1) the family farm in the United States; 2) the Netherlands; high population density and extensive sheep stations; 4) the earth complex of the U.S.S.R.; huge and cold; and 5) Ituri Pygmies: subsistence hunters and gatherers in Central Africa. An overview, a list of terms used, an outline of unit ideas, and course content including diagrams, pie charts, graphs, tables, maps, and questions are provided for each unit. (RM)",

        "description":"Within a setting of dynamic rather than static knowledge, the academic structuring of disciplines begins to lose meaning. Interdisciplinary courses are one result of this perception of knowledge. A polydisciplinary approach, however, would be a more accurate construct of reality. Given the following four aspects of a polydisciplinary approach to the study of man--environment, actions, knowledges, and pulsating growth--a three dimensional matrix described by the first three aspects, of which the fourth is an integral part, is possible. Each aspect breaks down into small parts: action consists of doing, deciding, dreaming, and discovering; knowledge consists of sciences, technics, humanities, and praxis; and environmental areas consist of socio, psychic, abiotic, and biotic. The  interrelatedness of the parts becomes multifaceted in a three dimensional matrix. This approach is action-oriented in that it relates to existing situations that face man and involves an experiential study of the interactions of man and his activities. (Author/JH)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which selected experimental curriculum units emphasizing avenues of political involvement, creative conflict, and change might influence the acquisition of political knowledge and development of feelings of political efficacy and cynicism among Anglo, Black and Mexican-American twelfth-graders. The subjects of the test were 252 Texas high school students. Four government classes were selected at each school, two experimental and two contrast groups. The experimental treatment relied on four curriculum units in government developed for this study. A political attitude and knowledge questionnaire was administered to all subjects before and after experimental treatment. Items constituting the criterion measures of political  cynicism, political efficacy, and political knowledge were imbedded in the questionnaire. Results support critics of the traditional approach to political education who advocate emphasis upon political behavior, processes and conflict, rather than the usual emphasis upon government structure and institutions. The experimental units appear to be salient means of increasing feelings of political efficacy among Anglo, Black, and Mexican-American students. Discussion of the findings is followed by data tables and references. (Author/KSM)",

        "description":"The success of educational expansion can be seen in the decline in illiteracy rates, improved achievement scores, more years of teacher training, innovative curricula development, and in the greater independence and openness of young people. Despite such positive trends, a crisis in confidence in our system, stemming from the great expenditure in education with less easily perceived results, is a reality. Perhaps efficiency by itself is not an appropriate criteria for measuring a service agency and should be associated with other, social goals in establishing any real criteria for success. Inequality of opportunity, lack of adaptibility and accountability are still the imminent social concerns of our educational system. Suggestions for overcoming these problems, however, usually  concentrate on production. Priorities for the 70's should include a maintenance of the production goals of the 60's but also the provision for alternatives in schooling, among which parents and students may make intelligent choices, and a renewal and expansion of the apprenticeship tradition in education. The aim of the National Institute of Education for the 70's is to serve the practical needs of the local &quot;consumers&quot; of educational improvements, with emphasis on the establishment of renewal centers to serve as gathering and disseminating points for those concerned with education.

        "description":"Three issues raised in this speech on the prospects of converting education from a labor intensive to a technology intensive enterprise are the following: how technology might affect the quality of education; the relationship of technology to equality in education; and the transitory nature of technological innovations. It is observed that quality of life objectives are increasingly preferred by youth today and that these less tangible objectives should be considered in educational development. The question of equity is viewed as one of the most critical issues and the least amenable to a technological solution. Major problems in programs involving technological reform are reviewed as including preoccupation with implementation, coping with long-term implications, and community  involvement. Features of these proposals focus on provisions for consumer choice, expansion of an apprenticeship tradition, and promotion of human interaction. While it is observed as unlikely to expect increased productivity at the elementary or secondary levels by means of technology, the university level appears as a possible target. A final summary advises cautious thinking in relation to the use of technology and its consequences, and notes the role of the Federal Government as working within policies compatible with pluralistic values and goals for education.

The program originated from the following needs: to revamp the traditional education program; to develop an experiential base reflecting the realities of public schools; to examine various models of teacher education; and to specify more precisely the outcomes sought. The results of the program thus far are described as constituting a first step toward a final CBTE program. The bases for the program were a Concerns Model, a setting appropriate for teacher education, the allowing of education students into schools as soon as possible, and the specifying of performances sought in measurable terms. It is admitted that performance  objectives, but not genuine competencies, have been specified. An external monitoring or evaluative scheme was not implemented at the inception of the program, although data collected does reveal patterns in the areas of student performances, attrition rate, and placement success. Critical problems which remain are identifying and specifying competencies and assessment procedures, counseling and screening functions, developing a positive self-concept to deal with values in the social studies, and placement in public schools for student teaching.

The introduction notes the unsolved problem of providing care outside the home for children below the school age of seven, day care and preschool education being the alternatives considered. The first article &quot;Pre-school Education in Finland&quot; recounts circumstances which led to the appointment in 1970 of the Committee for Pre-primary Education to define and plan preschool education and describes the results of that committee's efforts. The second article, &quot;The Pre-school Experiment,&quot; describes a few early attempts at preschool education, made at the descretion of municipal school systems during the sixties, and preschool experimentation evolving from the mandate of the Committee for  Pre-primary Education and utilizing the results of that earlier experimentation to define a year plan for curriculum to be developed under practical experiment conditions. The third article contains short summaries of research studies, combined with the experimentation programs to ascertain the effects of group size, duration of instruction, and supervision and control on the children's development.

The old system consisted of eight years of compulsory schooling, beginning at the age of seven, divided into six years of Primary School and two to three years of Civic School, which specialized according to local needs and on the basis of general, vocational, and pre-orientational education. Secondary schools consisted of a five  grade lower section, the Middle School, and a three grade upper section, the Gymnasium. The new system will include preschool education and a Comprehensive School covering the elementary years, replacing Primary, Civic, and Middle Schools. Teacher training also will be reformed, taking place at the University within education departments rather than in training schools. (JH)",

The conference was part of the Coalition for Population Year functions attended by members of such organizations as Planned Parenthood, Zero Population Growth, and Environmental Action Foundation. The philosophy of the seminar recognized the need for an interrelated program of comprehensive medical care, economic self-help, and participation in policy making processes to arrive at the goal of a stationary world population. Proposed internal policies were formulated around production and consumption patterns, population growth and distribution, and sex roles. External policies focused on trade, multinational  corporations, development assistance, international relations, migration, and research. The critique of these policies comments that the policies lack an orientation toward action; that public participation is not essential to the policies; and that the policies proffer insufficient recognition of responsibilities toward the Third World. Youth actions are directed toward the legislative processes. Addenda include a list of participants, specific action suggestions, a response to the Report of the Advisory Committee, and a minority opinion to the Report. (Author/KSM)",

The introduction provides a general framework for understanding culture generally as well as providing specific guidelines for discovering plausible alternatives, information gathering methods, and cultural and social dynamics. The first objective is to attack ethnocentrism by finding alternative, and equally plausible, solutions to problems. The exercises progress to the creation of experiences which serve as a basis for discussion of these alternatives,  finally putting the trainee in an actual cultural experience without structure in order to allow the previous controlled experiences to aid his recognizing new cultural relevance and/or differences. The latter step is enhanced by a series of exercises in community involvement and country-specific activities, dealing with housing, job and personal experiences, as well as methods of obtaining information through newspapers, films and role-playing situations.

For each text a summary account is provided of what the text has to say about labor in terms of a set of pre-established criteria. At the end of the review a distillation of all references to labor topics which appear in the text's index is included. This gives an approximate idea of the quantitative coverage of labor in the text; of the tone, emphasis and selections of topics dealt within the text's narrative; and of whether the labor topic is merely cited or listed, or whether it is analyzed and described. An introduction to the survey and review summarizes the labor  events and terms regarded as basic to an adequate treatment of organized labor. The summary evaluation placed at the end of each text's review is based upon the extent to which the text included the items listed in a meaningful way for the student. The two major headings for the criteria are 1) labor history and 2) collective bargaining and labor disputes. The texts surveyed date from 1966 through 1973. (Author/KSM)",

The program ostensibly provided summer jobs and activities for students. The contract designer reports on program design, activities, and implications for government and education. The designer's interest was an analysis of functional relationships between the rate of technological and social change and the rate of decreasing historical authority, along with identification of societal trends in an era when educational methods are less and less capable of preparing students for discontinuity created by rapid change. Two projects in the OFY program displaying an exploratory behavior not generally reinforced by industrial society were a study of gull  behavior in Newfoundland, and the creation of a child's environment called the Land of Mu. The composition of the gull project team scrambled conventional academic hierarchies and traditional professor-student relationships into a joint-learning experience with rotating scientific leadership. The Land of Mu's design environment was achieved through a breakdown of traditional relationships between students, professionals, professors, labor unions, and exhibition organisers. These projects are considered by the program designer as an aid to educators for recognizing the idea and nature of technological education. (Author/KSM)",

The program departs from traditional practice by changing the roles of the classroom teacher and the university field supervisor. The supervisor's role becomes that of coordinator while the teacher assumes the supervisory role. Cooperating teachers and their assigned teacher candidates participate in a pre-student teaching workshop which is based on an analysis of the unique, and sometimes stress-filled, relationship between the two team members. The workshop has as its aim to enhance communication and interpersonal perceptions in addition to providing opportunities to communicate about forthcoming classroom procedures and  objectives. Monthly seminars allow for discussion of progress and problems during the student-teaching experience. This program has been found to provide a) superior supervision because the student-teacher ratio is one-to-one, b) more direct involvement of the public school in the teacher preparation effort, and c) financial savings for the university.

        "description":"This analysis compares the efforts devoted to research and development (R&amp;D) in education with those devoted to R&amp;D in health and agriculture. Specifically, it characterizes the size and institutional arrangement of the educational R&amp;D community and compares it on a common basis with the agricultural and medical R&amp;D communities. The analysis is structured around performance in man-years of effort by institutional setting and sponsorship in dollars by institutional setting. The results indicate that, as compared with agriculture and health, research and development in education has the following characteristics: a) it has a much smaller proportion of the total value of production; b) it is sponsored almost entirely by the federal government; c) it is performed in much greater  proportion at universities; and d) it is not performed by federal agencies. The report does not argue for more educational R&amp;D but for a determination of the structural similarities and differences which exist in the agriculture, education, and health R&amp;D systems as a preliminary to the ultimate objective of knowing how to improve systems for conducting R&amp;D.

Projects were categorized according to the kind of output: theoretical, analytical, and experimental studies; surveys; evaluations;developmental projects; training programs in educational research; conferences, workshops, and symposiums; and research and development centers and regional laboratories. Categories were divided into subgroups according to project cost and were subsequently analyzed for common cost-differentiating characteristics. Flow charts using  sequential questions were developed for sorting the projects into their appropriate cost groups. Eight percent of the projects studied did not fit the classification scheme; that is, they were sorted into one group on the basis of their cost and into a different group on the basis of their descriptive characteristics. The classification scheme is limited by the accuracy of the data reported in the project resumes with regard to a) adequacy of funding level, b) quality of investigator or project outcome, and c) amount of supplementary funding from sources other than the Office of Education.

The author identifies four major periods: a) the emergence of education as a field of study (1855-1895); b) the period of empiricism (1895-1938); c) the assumption of a pragmatic orientation; and d) the emergence of a major role for the federal government. During the first period, curriculum reformers relied upon European ideas, and the federal government collected and disseminated data. Changes based on scientific investigation and controlled experiment marked the second period, which was highlighted by the founding of John Dewey's laboratory school at the University of Chicago and the rise of education as a field of graduate  study. The period from 1938 to 1954 saw the decline of research in education caused mainly by economic depression and the gradual separation of education from other areas in the arts and sciences. The Cooperative Research Act, passed by Congress in 1954, marked the beginning of a major federal role in education. In 1965, amendments to the Cooperative Research Act made possible the organization of a network of research and development (R&amp;D) centers. Rapid growth and proliferation of responsibility for the sponsorship of R&amp;D programs have characterized educational history since 1965. (HMD)",

A tripartite definition of efficiency is proposed and explained: economic, technological, and social. The report is organized around discussions of some impediments to the realization of these three efficiencies. For each impediment or obstacle to the achievement of a particular kind of efficiency, there is a discussion of why the obstacle is a problem and what kinds of research have been or are currently being done with respect to the problem. New kinds of research or experimentation are proposed which might provide policy makers with guidelines for reducing the obstacles to these efficiencies. The final section  coordinates the proposals and indicates research items that are of the highest priority: research and experimentation in decentralized decision making, assessment of institutional and classroom efficiency, development of a federal research school, experimentation and evaluation of complimentary services.

The problems of transition to the new policy and organization are discussed with regard to program objectives and management and problems associated with implementing fiscal year 1973 (FY 73) funding requirements. The issues considered in relation to program objectives are a) the need for specialized R&amp;D centers; b) the maintenance of a special relationship between NIE and R&amp;D centers; c) NIE support of improvement in R&amp;D management and technology; and d) achievement of a balance in policy conflicts regarding flexibility vs. continuity, mission focus vs. conglomeration, and research vs. development.  Program management issues discussed are a) coordination of policy implementation; b) completion of design of the assessment system for the new policy; c) budgeting, organization, and management of product dissemination; and d) the requirement that universities cost share in the support of R&amp;D centers. Problems of implementing the FY 73 funding requirements are identified as being concerned with: a) consistency between funding recommendations and program policy, b) the negotiation process, c) contract/grant terms and conditions, and d) the increased cost of the new policy. The author concludes that FY 73 should be considered a year of transition during which NIE carefully and deliberately moves to establish a lasting program. (HMD)",

The document is organized around four ideas discussed at the meeting. The first is the political constituency for NIE; that is, the program of NIE must be made relevant and visible to educational practitioners. The second is the idea of the teacher craftsman: as teachers know more about teaching than anyone else, there should be an organized effort to identify &quot;the great craftsman teacher&quot; and devise mechanisms to get at and replicate this craftsmanship. It is added that teacher involvement would be more readily achieved if it were made a part of U.S. Office of Education guidelines. The third idea presented, teacher participation in NIE, is  based on the belief that teachers represent a great pool of expertise. It is proposed that teachers recognized by their peers be considered for membership on a &quot;council of instruction.&quot; Finally, possible NIE-NEA cooperation is discussed. Two activities are particularly considered: a) creating a new position of &quot;instructional ombudsman&quot;--a teacher given administrative preparation by both NEA and NIE to move back into a school district, preferably the one from which he or she came--and b) providing teachers with information on what kinds of resources are available to accomplish a particular type of learning.

One factor is the leadership positions of state certification personnel that enable them to become instrumental in making certification policies by giving them opportunities to promote far-reaching reforms in education. Two different philosophies of education reform are then discussed--democratic localism and insipient democracy, the latter having been followed by most state education agencies. However, the competency movement should change this since it is an attempt to alter the locus of authority within the education system. A new type of teaching exam, designed to provide  information relevant to interests of the clients such as teacher education, retention, and promotion, is another factor. The exam would be weighted so that each client could establish the profile desired; it would consist of over 40 modules in four broad categories. Film episodes to test the candidates' ability to see and understand what is going on in the classroom are also suggested. Finally, the paper recommends that a diversified and localized value system should be established to relate to the public's expectations for schools. States should support a certification system that expects diversity and challenges all to meet the highest level of accomplishment. State standards should never be rigid and procedures should be revised yearly based on constant feedback. (PD)",

        "description":"This study was undertaken to demonstrate the effectiveness of utilization of discovery learning episodes with four different treatment groups: one seventh-grade history class; two preservice education classes (elementary and secondary); and an in-service teacher workshop. The discovery episodes consisted of readings, large- and small-group discussions, individual and group projects, and role playing of the project outcomes. Pre- and post-instruction interest level measurements were administered. Significant differences were found between each group's initial and postinstructional interest level. Subjects favored the use of a wide variety of activities and resources and agreed that the group discussion and role playing aspects of the discovery episodes were most effective. The  results of the study support the hypotheses that a) discovery learning produces increased interest and involvement in the content to be learned; b) utilization of a wide variety of resources and activities can be an effective tool for maintaining a high level of student interest; and c) teachers may be able to improve the overall effectiveness of student learning through discovery learning techniques. From the results of this study, it appears that properly employed discovery episodes may improve the psychological, affective, and social dimensions of the classroom.

The center program attempts to provide a wide array of experiences which promote the academic, professional, and community awareness growth of the student through: a) an exposure to the community and the total school district operation; b) observation, participation, and miniteaching at all elementary grade levels; c) completion of an 11-week period of student teaching; d) the integration of academic course  work with actual daily involvement with schools; e) an extensive exploration of what constitutes teaching; and f) the development of a broad repertoire of teaching skills. The success of the program is apparent from the results of a study which show that a higher percentage of graduates of this program secure employment than do graduates of regular teacher training programs offered at Illinois State University.

These variables are grouped according to program, personnel, and administrative variables. Personnel variables listed are a) the ethnic composition of interns, b)  the socioethnic composition of interns, c) the age composition of interns, d) the value and cultural differences between teacher and intern, and the attitude of cooperating teachers. Program variables are a) the undergraduate nature of the program, b) the need for teachers with bilingual skills, and c) community and school district involvement in Teacher Corps programs.

The author finds the promise of the scientific approach to be illusory. He defines it as education that promotes behavior change in some desirable direction. However, this definition, which the author finds equally serviceable for toothpaste salesmen and terrorists, makes the clients of educators not the children but the system of schooling itself and its elite to whom educators owe whatever loyalty they possess. Working on the premise that, for the present, teacher education must be changed in relation to existing schools, the author advocates examining current educational myths, such as the myth of Cultural Deprivation, which makes the victims  responsible and makes the responsible into victims. Working on a scientific approach with a humanistic basis, the author promotes a human science of people whose purpose in professional education should be to deepen our awareness of what it means to be human, to use language, and to grow up in the diverse arrangements that out planet affords. This definition of education transforms \"schools\" from institutions of technological management into complex arrangements for authentic work and interesting conversation. (JA)",

First, the personal orientation of the learner is a central consideration in teaching activity. The task of aiding the learner in his development is transactional and requires privacy for both the teacher and the learner. Second, the position of teacher is neither technical nor professional but must take into account both political and technical considerations. Third, schools must be organized to provide accountability with regard to environmental quality. Fourth, the teacher must be seen as a unique supervisor in the school's authority structure. These propositions are presently in the realm of theory, but research designs are  being developed which will test their reasonability. (Author/HMD)",

The centers are directed by resident supervisors who are responsible for the supervision of student teachers, demonstration teaching of a limited number of classes in their respective fields, and, in some cases, the development of new curricula and evaluative instruments for improving teaching and supervision in their budget areas. Student teachers in the program complete one year of education-related academic study at Harvard and a one-year teaching internship. An evaluation of the centers was made by surveying the student teachers by questionnaire and by interviewing the supervisors. A comparison of the responses of students in STCs and students  in ordinary student teaching situations points up striking quantitative differences in the number of contacts with their supervisors and significant qualitative differences in the ratings of supervisors. Resident supervisors agreed that the STC concept greatly facilitated induction of teachers into the classroom and into the school as institution with particular regulations and mores. Even though the results are not the product of stringent and sophisticated procedures, the evaluation suggests continuation and expansion of student teaching centers. (HMD)",

        "description":"A study designed to modify inappropriate pupil behavior in a recently integrated public elementary school in New Orleans made extensive use of a parent paraprofessional. It was conducted in a classroom judged by the faculty to be experiencing numerous behavior problems. The parent paraprofessional was given written definitions of the behaviors she was to observe and then observed the class daily during baseline, experimental and follow-up periods. In the experimental period the teacher reinforced pupils exhibiting satisfactory behavior and ignored, as much as possible, those behaving inappropriately. The paraprofessional copied letters drafted by the teacher to be sent to the parents of pupils, informing them that their children were behaving well in class. It was expected that  the parents would further reinforce their children when they received such favorable letters from their child's teacher. Agressive and disruptive behaviors were both reduced during the experimental period. During the follow-up period, the number of agressive behaviors and disruptions were found to have increased slightly over the experimental period, but they remained well below their previous levels. The paraprofessional was found to be of increased value in the over-all school program after learning the mechanics of taking part in a relevant research study. (DDO)",

Emphasis is placed on the teacher role of manager of learning experiences. Ninety performance objectives are arranged in 18 capsulized skill areas each of which consists of: a) a list of objectives to be met; b) a test battery to determine whether the student has met capsule objectives; and c) a performance component which requires the student to present written and videotaped evidence that he has met capsule objectives. This model requires attitudinal change by both the teacher candidate and the teacher educator. The candidate must be willing to engage in self-initiated instruction, frequent self-assessment, and  evaluation of and by his peers. The teacher educator must be prepared to enter into cooperative interactive learning experiences with each candidate, and to become involved with public school practitioners, community, and lay people. Implementation of this model at the University of Kentucky required four years to develop and revise the following program materials; criteria, test batteries, post program measures, screening devices, instructional capsules, simulation experiences, knowledge measures, orientation programs, and stimulation techniques.

The paper is based on the assumption that the purposes of teacher evaluation are as follows: a) to provide information with which to make a decision about granting tenure, b) to help teachers improve performance, and c) to improve the educational program of a school. Some general assumptions related to teacher evaluation, such as \"teacher characteristics do not correlate with success,\" are listed and terminology defined. Seven critical aspects or needs of teacher evaluation are then listed and defined: a) competencies required of teachers; b) means for assessing competencies of individual teachers; c) establishment of goals by teachers reflecting both school and personal needs; d) identification of job  responsibilities required of teachers; e) specification of authority, support, and situational variables affecting a teacher's responsibilities; f) procedures for periodic assessment of teacher competency and discharge of responsibility; and g) an established procedure for \"coaching\" the teacher, providing for self-improvement and evaluation that relates the assessed level of performance with criteria of competence and responsibility determined acceptable to the school. The remainder of the document discusses these points, using them as a basis for outlining conditions for implementing changes in teacher evaluation along with some new skills that may be needed by individuals who are providing leadership in developing such systems.

Answers to each question in the questionnaire sent to state certification officers are described. There follows a discussion of these results and an outline of the minimal essential considerations of those states that have developed policies. Among these considerations are a) the right of a hearing; b) an appeal process; c) specificity of the descriptors of disqualification; d) clear and consistently defined use of terms; and e) the rights of the individual to pursue his  profession balanced against the rights of society to insure that unfit persons are not allowed to teach or counsel in the public schools. It is concluded that educators, individually and collectively, have made little effort to develop a coherent, rational, and fully implemented policy and procedure relevant to felony convictions and certification, and that much more research is needed.

He examines two prevalent methodological approaches: evaluating the process and evaluating the product. The first approach involves the description of a study which concluded that teachers rated high by supervisors and well-liked by pupils were not the teachers whose pupils showed the greatest gains and who judged themselves most effective. The second approach reviews the problems of the reliability and validity of tests and advocates giving up the idea of measuring teacher effectiveness in terms of pupil gains on tests. The recent work of Flanders, Bellack, Smith, Hughes and others is commented on, with the conclusion that the more dimensions of  teacher behavior that can be measured and correlated with pupil gains, the more likely is the discovery of one or more correlating with teacher effectiveness. Reviewing common practices that measure teacher effectiveness, the author points out that educational research does not support Dewey's \"we learn by doing,\" or Skinner's reinforcement theories. Instead, less obvious things, such as the cognitive level of questions asked, probing questions, clarity and structure, should be looked for in measuring teacher effectiveness. (JA)",

Trained observers classify teacher statements according to; a) acceptance of student feelings; b) use of praise and encouragement; c) acceptance of student ideas; d) use of questions; and e) use of lecture, direction, or criticism. Two additional categories relate to the verbal behavior of students and one category covers the contingency of silence or confusion in the classroom. Inferences drawn from a tabulation of the teacher's statements are discussed in a feedback session. In modifying teacher behavior through the use of interaction analysis, steps must be taken regarding: a)  training of observers and participating teachers in the use of the technique; b) clarification of the participating teacher's self-development goals; c) construction of comparison situations involving a planned change of behavior and scheduling two or more observations to assess evidence of change; d) the collection of other evidence of behavior change. To reduce distortion of teacher behavior while being observed, it is suggested that: a) an observer be in the classroom only when invited; b) the status and power difference between a teacher and observer be at a minimum; and c) the feedback session follow a logical plan of inquiry.

From a tabulation of matrix entries it is possible to make inferences concerning the teacher's attitudes and behavior with regard to the following: a) acceptance of students' feelings; b) praise and encouragement; c) acceptance of student ideas; d) question asking; e) lecturing; f) directing; and g) criticizing. It is also possible to tell from the matrix the amount of time the teacher talks, the students talk, and the amount of time the class spends in silence. As part of a 10-week in-service training program involving 53 teachers in Minnesota, interaction  analysis serves two functions: a) as a pre- and post-measurement of success in helping teachers modify their overt behavior in order to make it more consistent with their self-development goals; and b) as a working tool to feed back information during training.

The use of such data for improvement of instruction can provide valid and feasible assessment procedures. Directed skill training, competency contracts, and inquiry projects are all appropriate means of assessment and improvement at this stage in the development of techniques for the evaluation of teacher effectiveness. Inquiry projects can involve comparisons of behavior with a model, comparisons of behavior with stated behavioral objectives, and comparisons of behavior over time. Peer cooperation in collection of interactive data is apt to contribute to development of skills in  coding behavior and therefore to lead to greater behavior change. (Author)",

These four modes of classroom interaction permit 12 transitional possibilities from one mode to the other. In order to facilitate these transitions, the teacher must have the ability to a) inventory pupil ideas; b) reiterate, paraphrase, or expand on pupil ideas; c) relate pupil ideas to his own; d) react constructively to unexpected student statements; e) give criticism in a constructive manner; f) introduce  his own ideas in ways which do not inhibit student participation; g) ask questions which generate student thinking; h) express and explain his own ideas clearly; and i) guide conversations according to models of inductive and deductive reasoning.

The subjects were 110 secondary school student teachers. The research instrument was the individualized Instruction Inventory, designed to provide a total individualization score and reveal attitudes toward individualizing instruction in four specific areas: a) intra-class grouping; b) variety of materials; c) student autonomy; d) differentiating assignments. The study included the following findings: student teachers were more positive in their attitude toward individualized instruction before student teaching than they were after student teaching; both pre- and post-student teaching females were more positive in their attitudes towards individualized  instruction than were pre- and post-student teaching males. The authors suggest that part of the difficulty may be attributed to the cooperating teacher, who may have minimized the importance of individualizing instruction through both his attitude and classroom activity. A more careful selection of cooperating teachers is recommended and special efforts should be made in teacher preparation programs to educate males in the theory, philosophy, methods, and techniques of individualizing instruction.

This analysis involved a comparison of the data collected from middle and junior high school teachers. Results obtained from the junior high school teachers were also utilized in a second comparison with the findings from a similar study of Indiana's junior high school teachers in 1959. Data were collected from 199 middle and 289 junior high school teachers in 44 selected intermediate schools throughout the State of Indiana. Interviews were conducted with five middle and five junior high school principals. Findings indicate that there are no major identifiable differences between the professional preparation of today's junior high school teachers and that of 10  years ago. The professional preparation of middle and junior high school teachers in Indiana is quite similar, usually with an emphasis on the senior high school. This preparation generally lacks two important elements: course work in counseling and guidance and student teaching in either a middle or junior high school. In-service college classes specifically related to the junior high school are no more frequently a part of the junior high school teacher's in-service activities than they were 10 years ago, and middle school teachers are no more involved in in-service activities than are their junior high school counterparts. The paper concludes with various recommendations for the preparation of intermediate school teachers. (DDO)",

Listed in this section are various forms of practicum education regarding childhood development. Two aspects of the evaluation of training are considered: the effects of training on graduate  students and the effect the consultant has on adults he encounters.

The trainees were employees of federally supported child care centers, and the program was specifically designed to modify some behaviors of the trainees toward the children with whom they worked. The training staff consisted of graduate students in developmental psychology. The training methods, which can be described as behavioral engineering, consisted of situations in which trainees observed demonstrations of various goal behaviors and subsequently practiced these behaviors themselves. Lectures, discussions, written materials, and assignments followed each observation and practice session. The pre- and post-training survey covered three main areas of  child development and management: a) the use of reward and punishment, b) the reasons children behave as they do, and c) the use of written records in day care centers. The results of the post-survey show that a) with regard to use of reward and punishment, many subjects registered a positive change in attitude; b) with regard to explanations of children's behavior, there was no significant change in the attitude of the subjects; and c) subjects developed a clearer awareness of the necessity of record keeping although the competence with which they kept records showed little improvement.

Urban education is defined as educating people for living and in coping with an urban environment, including politics, crime and drug prevention, and delivery of services to cities. Some problems in urban education are identified as weak community-college relations, poor assistance from municipal governments, lack of an indigenous power base, misinterpretation of urban issues, and crippling attitudes of educators towards the limited educational background of urban inhabitants. The broad goals of the program at William Paterson include the following: a) to develop a vehicle for the efficient delivery of consultant and resource services to the urban community, b) to improve  community-college relations through sound programming and expert coordination of activities, c) to initiate humanistic and professional staff training, d) to provide overall curriculum improvement for public and private schools and universities, and e) to implement an interdisciplinary approach to education.

        "description":"Western Kentucky University is engaged in testing an evaluation system designed to obtain objective, quantifiable data on graduates of its teacher education program. Each year 20 elementary and 20 secondary participants are randomly selected at the beginning of their student teaching experience. Participants are observed during their preservice student teaching and at the end of their first, third, and fifth years as practicing teachers. Instruments used for data collection are five general types: questionnaires, personality scales, rating scales, direct classroom observation systems, and transcripts of grades. At the end of each data collection period, all information is placed on computer disc and a continuing data base is maintained. Appropriate statistics are computed and  made available for study by faculty. To date, 2 years of data collection have been completed and planning for a third is now in progress. Seventy-eight student teachers and 22 practicing teachers have been studied in 70 different schools in Kentucky. Descriptive statistics are available for approximately 230 measured variables.

The study was designed to lead towards the identification of tasks required in the successful performance of the professional role of the secondary school industrial education teacher. It was also designed to be of specific use in the re-evaluation of the M.S. degree program at the University of Wisconsin-Stout. This paper is devoted to a review of related literature. The use of analysis as a basis for identifying objectives for education is traced back to Plato (c. 400 B.C.) and, in the field of industrial education, to Pestalozzi's analysis (c. 1800). The literature review describes the work of Taylor, Allen, Charters, and Smith, among others, and ends with the current emphasis on  performanced-based teacher education. (JA)",

In addition to utilizing a token reinforcement program, the design emphasized teacher training, involved the manipulation of surrounding conditions and curriculum variables, and employed video tapes both in training and in subsequent measurement and analysis. The token reinforcement  system, which enabled students to use points earned for desirable behavior to purchase various items, was introduced to Room B--half of a classroom of 18 students. Students in Room A earned desirable behavior points in order to gain entrance to Room B. During the course, desirable pupil behavior increased approximately 30%. The reinforcement rates of both teachers increased. Desirable pupil behavior was found to be a function of teacher reinforcement. The results of the study support the hypotheses tested, but further research is needed to reach a greater level of sophistication in the definition of teaching techniques that work. (HMD)",

The course consisted of a 6-hour self-observation training program, a 10-hour group process training curriculum, and a 12-hour communication skills workshop. Questionnaires soliciting feedback from the subjects on satisfaction with participation, clarity of instructions, clarity of text, usefulness of training in teaching, and instructiveness of training were administered at the  end of each session. The subjects recorded their personal reactions to the training and descriptions of their attempts to apply the training in their teaching. Pretests and posttests were used to evaluate the effectiveness of parts of the self-observation training program and the communication skills workshop. The subjects' overall reaction to the training course was moderately favorable. No serious problems were encountered in the administration of the training products. Results indicate that the experimental course format is a useful and convenient method for obtaining trainee feedback on teacher training products. (Author)",

It is organized around four primary functions of the School of Education and discusses how each of these functions contributes to the overall mission of the school to deal with problems of educational change. For each function, specific operational examples are cited. The four functions are a) to prepare professional personnel who are able to stimulate, plan, manage, and evaluate educational change; b) to produce basic knowledge about education necessary and sufficient to support educational change; c) to develop products, practices, and procedures aimed at promoting and facilitating change in education; and d) to establish and  maintain synergistic relationships between the School of Education and its clients that enable all parties to respond positively to the need for educational change. Appended is an outline of target objectives and priorities. (DDO)",

Ninety-five students from low-income families were asked to identify their \"good\" teachers. Sixty-five of the 69 specified teachers were then queried about their grade point average in college, both overall and in their majors. The median overall average was 2.8; in their majors, 3.2. Of the nine teachers who were identified most often by students, only two exceeded the mean for the overall grade average, and only two exceeded the mean grade point average in their major. The author concludes that a) there is little evidence in the available research to support the contention that requiring higher grade point  averages for admission into teacher education programs will improve teaching in the public schools; b) arbitrary grade point requirements used in determining the admission of prospective teachers may be eliminating many effective teachers of low-income students; and c) further research is needed to determine the extent that arbitrary grade point averages may be eliminating good teachers for any income group.

It was found that the Arithmetic and Reading sections of the 1963 Revised Wide Range Achievement Test have reasonably good construct validity as judged by their relation to the Stanford and the Metropolitan Achievement Tests. The WRAT was found to be suitable for use with children of widely differing socioeconomic backgrounds and different ability levels. The Arithmetic section was found to be valid at both high and low ability levels. The Reading section, however, was not suitable for high school students at the low end of the ability continuum. The validity of the WRAT as an estimate of grade level placement showed considerable  variation. In spite of the fact that the validity coefficients vary considerably, depending on the grade level and geographical region involved, there is sufficient evidence of substantial correlation with criterion measures at every age level investigated to consider the WRAT a satisfactory brief estimate of school achievement.

Forty-two Mexican-American freshmen students who entered the University of California, Riverside, in the Fall 1971 participated in the study. Analyses of variance concerning ethnic groups on GPA (grade point average) and SAT verbal (SATV) and math scores (SATM) were performed indicating higher Anglo-American scores on all measures. The hypothesis that both groups can be described by the same regression plane can be rejected. When the Anglo-American regression equation was used to predict the grades of Mexican-American students, substantial overprediction resulted. If separate equations are calculated for each subgroup, the SAT is almost as predictively valid for Mexican-American  students as it is for Anglo-American students. It would appear that the pattern of standardized regression rates for GPA and SATM (since Mexican-American students score higher on math probably due to bilingualism, in which vocabulary might be more affected than mathematical reasoning) does not maximize grade success for the ability profiles of Mexican-American students as a group.

The four areas of data collection for residential treatment program evaluation include: (1) a community baseline relating to the family system; (2) a residential baseline; (3) the child's behavior at the time of discharge; and (4) the conditions present at the time of the child's re-entry.

The three kindergarten classes were used in the study. In one class the parents of the children spoke little or no English at home. The second class consisted of children whose parents spoke English at home. The children in the third class used no DISTAR materials and consisted of children whose parents also spoke English at home. The children represented different racial and cultural backgrounds, but approximately one-half of the sample were Chinese Canadians. During  early March, each kindergarten teacher administered a pictorial test to measure the pupils' grasp of the major concepts in the DISTAR Language I Program. From the results, four comparisons were made. In only one of the four comparisons was the difference between the group scores statistically significant; namely, between English speaking parents' children who were in the DISTAR Program and those not using the DISTAR materials.

Considering the age and degree of programming experience of those  involved, the performance of the computer science students on the CPAB was impressive. They scored well above the average of both more experienced groups. However, the results may be distorted since one of the high school groups was given 25% more time than that specified in the test manual.

The results of these studies reaffirmed the generally positive view of University Hill that emerged from Year One of the evaluation. The use of community resources was found to be extensive and varied. Through the mini-course program, students were exposed to a much wider range of volunteers and community facilities than were students at the comparison schools. Grade Eight students from the three feeder schools  were adapting well to University Hill. They were honouring their &quot;contracted time&quot; obligations by attending class, and were devoting a reasonable portion of their unscheduled time to their studies. The results of the testing indicate that the autonomy afforded students at University Hill through the availability of individualized independent programs did not adversely affect student achievement.

The pupils were divided into three groups: the members of the &quot;Computer Group&quot; each received five minutes of CAI in arithmetic per day in addition to regular arithmetic classes, the &quot;Help Group&quot; received five minutes of group instruction per day in addition to regular arithmetic classes, and the &quot;Zero Group&quot; received no additional instruction. Pre- and post-tests in arithmetic were administered. A questionnaire, designed to determine the attitudes of the pupils towards the computer experiment, their evaluation of its effectiveness and their opinions on possible modifications to the system, was administered. The teacher involved was  asked to give his impression of the project. The results indicated that: computer-assisted instruction improves arithmetic skills, and CAI in addition to regular classroom instruction is superior to an equivalent amount of classroom instruction in improving arithmetic skills. None of the results, however, was statistically significant. The students and the teacher considered the project to be beneficial. It was thought, however, that pupils at a lower grade level would benefit more from this particular application of CAI. (Author/RC)",

The teacher of the Punjabi-English class kept an extensive anecdotal record of the growth and development of her students. An observation of the class was made by an educational psychologist to provide an external objective audit of the pupils' accomplishments. Various tests were administered to the experimental class and a control group of matched East Indian children. The findings showed that the special class appeared to be promoting the personality development of its pupils, particularly in social skills and oral expression. The program  achieved its objective of developing in pupils sufficient facility in English so that more than one-half of them merited placement in regular primary classes.

Then schools participated in an examination of the computer-science courses. This aspect of the study consisted of five parts: a questionnaire to teachers, a questionnaire to students, a set of problems for students to measure their problem-solving ability, observation of three computer science classes in progress, and administration of the Computer Programmer Aptitude Battery to one computer class. This study summarized the findings of the teacher and student questionnaires regarding computer based instruction. Observation of three  computer science classes generally supported the results of these questionnaires. The performance of the students on the programming problems indicated that they were capable of at least fundamental programming. Examination of one class' performance on the Computer Programmer Aptitude Battery illustrated that the computer science course had helped to improve the students' reasoning ability. Included in the appendices are the student and teacher questionnaires, problem sets, computer games and examples of computer programs written by students.

The purpose of the involvement of the officer was to bring about more positive attitudes toward authority and the police and to contribute to the improvement of relationships between youth and the police. In the present study, comparisons were made between &quot;experimental&quot; and &quot;control&quot; groups in terms of pre-treatment scores (November 1972) post-treatment scores (June 1973) and changes in scores on a thirty-eight item scale of student attitudes toward police officers. An analysis was made of the performance of students on selected critical items and of the reactions of teachers  and principals to the project. A summary was made of student suggestions of ways by which better relationships could be established between students and the police. The officer's involvement in the schools has enabled pupils to view the policeman as a trusted friend. At the end of the 1972-73 school year students in these schools had a more positive attitude toward the police than did the control group. Recommendations were made for the continuation and extension of the program and for an evaluation of the long-range effects. See TM003478 for a related document. (Author/MLP)",

Many of these recommendations and criticisms involve typographical and grammatical errors, incorrect language usage, difficulty of item sequence and others. Further usage of the test should reveal to what extent these corrections will bring about a more valid assessment of the Puerto Rican child's general intellectual functioning. The discrepancy between the Puerto Rican and American WISC IQ's and standard deviation presents serious problems when interpreting Puerto Rican children's WISC IQ's and their subsequent classification. Included in the report is a table listing Puerto Rican  IQ's (WISC) with their approximate converted American equivalents. These figures were extracted from normal curve tables, using the expected cumulative frequency distribution of the 128 cases included in the Puerto Rican sample. (RC)",

Following this task, all statements are categorized and the categories themselves placed in rank order.

The teaching staff at Port Edwards, Wisconsin, where this study was conducted, was asked to rate questions for relevancy to the IGE curriculum and to predict what percent of the class would answer each question correctly. The following scale was used: A, for a valid question; B, for a reasonably valid question; C, for an invalid question. The evaluation was done by grade level teams in grades two through six and by subject matter area in the junior high, due to departmentalized organization. The data was tabulated and the results appeared to be acceptable but a suggestion was  made for the study to be carried further. After a review of the data some valid conclusions were made. Considering only valid and reasonably valid questions, (A or B rating), the tabulations indicated that the students exceeded national percentages at all grade levels.

It concerns the subject areas of mathematics, reading comprehension, and science. The main thrust of this analysis was to look for a possible relationship between age of entry into pre-formal school education programs and achievement as measured by these IEA tests at ages 10 and 13. The principal findings suggest that there may be a specificity of effect between early entrance into school and greater achievement in mathematics; this is not true in reading comprehension or science. It is suggested by the authors that gain in achievement based on early education may in fact be due to the sensory motor experiences which are so commonly part of early  childhood education programs. It is further suggested that the carefully planned and sequenced curriculum approach to teaching mathematics may have an effect here. The research also examined the commonly held phenomenon of the home background of the child being a very important contributor to his academic success in school. (Author)",

The purpose of this research was to investigate the reliability and internal validity of the CAQ and the temporal stability of its original factor structure. CAO responses were obtained from 5,297 Penn State students in 272 classes during a 1973 term. These data were item-analyzed and submitted to principal-components and common-factor analyses with orthogonal and oblique transformations. Coefficient alpha reliabilities were computed for the factor-derived scales. The large normative data base was also inspected. The factor structure was not replicated by a &quot;fit' of the derived  factors to the CAQ-keyed subscales. Most factors were highly correlated and their reliabilities appeared to be a function of redundant item content. A &quot;general&quot; dimension pervaded the instrument, accounting for much of the total and common-factor variance. A trend toward inflation and skewness in scores was noted for the 10-year period. The CAQ) subscales should be interpreted with caution and systematically reviewed for currant validity.

First, by assessing the characteristics of cognitive style, classificatory skills, and logical reasoning ability, the student's readiness to attain concepts under various circumstances can be determined. Secondly, the model points to optimal methods for teaching concepts. The basic strategy in determining such methods is to note the cognitive operations entailed in reaching the desired level of concept attainment, then to speculate on conditions which would either hinder or facilitate these operations. Instructional methods which are effective in concept instruction may be related to the operations postulated by the model. In turn, new instructional methods might be formulated on  the basis of their potential for facilitating one or more of these operations.

Its goal is thus to develop the relationship between problem structure and problem-solving behavior. Five specific hypotheses respecting the paths generated by problem solvers (in this case, college students and college educated adults) in the state-space of the 4-ring Tower-of-Hanoi problem were formulated. These hypotheses were motivated by the formal properties of the Tower-of-Hanoi state-space and represented anticipated effects of the problem structure in shaping problem-solving behavior. The  experimental results of this study seem to confirm an important role played by features of the problem structure in determining patterns in the problem-solving behaviors of the subjects.

Other implications for improving the quality of instruction are discussed relative to  meeting individual student needs. A daily record sheet and the rating scale are in the document. (Author/BB)",

One hundred and fifty-four subjects viewed video lesson segments in two college course areas, Accounting and Psychology. A variety of TV formats were used, including story-lines, short vignettes, animation, sharers of information, and illustrated lectures. The intent was to produce instructional television rather than televised instruction. Subjects responded to content and attitude questionnaires and were interviewed in depth. The results suggested guidelines for acceptable formats for instructional television designed for adult learners. (Author)",

Given to eleventh grade students the course is directed at helping students understand the emotional and social dimensions of their sexuality. Because the emphasis in the course was on feeling, not fact, this evaluation of the Family Life Education program examined attitude changes as an index of the course's success. Three instruments were used on a pre-test and post-test basis: a Premarital Attitude Scale, a Semantic Differential and a questionnaire. The results of the testing did not offer any conclusive evidence of the course's success. There were few significant changes in students' attitudes, as evidenced by scores on the Attitude Scale and the  Semantic Differential. Pronounced differences which emerged in the pre-testing between the attitudes of male and female students persisted in the post-test. Several factors should be remembered in considering the implications of this evaluation for other programs of Family Life Education. First, the instruments used were crude: measurement of attitudes is open to question. Second, there was a drastic decrease from pre-test to post-test in the number of students responding. Finally, if its purpose is to assist students in dealing with the problems of their coming of age, then an evaluation such as this can only be a partial measure of its success. (Author/MLP)",

Samples of schoolchildren in Regina (Canada), Adelaide (Australia) and Sydney (Canada), divided into subgroups according to family size and socioeconomic status, were tested in the first two samples on the Otis Mental Ability Tests, and in the latter on the Henmon-Nelson Intelligence Test, while socioeconomic status allocation was obtained from the occupation of the father of each child in the three samples. In each sample, the results demonstrated the existence of a definite relationship between intelligence (IQ) and socioeconomic status  (SES), in favour of the high SES children. However, the usually reported significant negative correlation between family size and IQ disappeared in the 170 predominantly middle-to-upper SES children in Regina, in the 427 school-children from various SES groups in Adelaide, and in the upper SES group only of the 144 school-children in Sydney (even though the overall correlation for the latter sample was negative and significant). In each sample, a clear indiciation emerged--family size, among middle and upper SES families in Western industrialized affluent societies, generally has no detrimental influence on the mean IQ of its members. Evidence from the Canadian and Australian samples point to the same conclusion--at the least, upper SES children perform equally as well on an intelligence  test regardless of the family to which they belong.

Cook Elementary School, located near the Capitol Homes Housing Project, the Martin Luther King Village, and a six to eight block deteriorating inner-city neighborhood, served 666 pupils in grades kindergarten through seven in the main building and an additional 80 infants, toddlers, and kindergarten-age children in the Title IV-A Child Development Center located in adjacent buildings. The instructional program was supplemented by three supportive programs. The English-Reading Program under Title I of the 1965 Elementary Secondary Education Act provided compensatory education for the most educationally deprived pupils in the school. The primary objective of this activity was to improve the reading competencies of the most deprived pupils through tutorial and/or  individualized instruction. By improving academic competencies, the program also aimed at improving the self-concept and attitude toward school of participants. The Cook Child Development Center, funded under Title IV-A of the 1967 Amendments to the Social Security Act, serves 80 preschool-age children in day care and 50 school-age children in extended day care with a staff of one lead teacher, four group leaders, and 12 aides. As a result of funding difficulties, the kindergarten program was drastically altered and the Outreach component was cut out entirely until July, 1973, after the Title IV-A funding of a separate outreach component proposal. The Comprehensive Instructional Program, funded by the school system, was designed to aid teachers with individualizing classroom instruction  in reading for grades one through three and in math for grades four through six.

Subjects were 214 fourth-grade and 213 sixth grade children from two elementary schools in a middle to working class suburb outside Rochester, New York. The child's own assessment of his own adjustment was measured by the California Test of Personality, 1953 revision. Teachers' evaluation of children's adjustment was gauged on a six item scale based on five of Jahoda's six criteria of adjustment. The self report of  children's self esteem was obtained by using a modification of the Coopersmith Self Esteem Inventory. Teachers rated self esteem in children on Coopersmith's Behavior Rating Form, consisting of 13 five-point scaled items. Three visits to the classroom were required to complete the testing. The results suggest that, at least on the measures selected, teachers and children perceive that children's self esteem is moderately to highly and positively related to personal and social adjustment. Self esteem and adjustment scores correlated highly, as did teacher's estimates of children's self esteem and adjustment but teachers' child agreement on self esteem and adjustment dimensions were lower.

The question that this paper addresses itself to is the relationship of the formal schooling of disadvantaged children to their sub-cultural education. What is unique about the cultural model as it is discussed here is that we are suggesting that the United States, hithertofore defined as the melting pot par excelence, is a prime candidate for a schooling system that recognizes the retention of distinct cultural groups within its shores, and recognizes the value of these diverse cultural ways. In addition, we suggest that among the diverse subcultures that should be considered as pertinent to such a school system is the Negro American. In fact, his  case is used as the prime example of this paper since he is a member of one of the larger minority groups in this country, and since if one does not make a case for his culture being distinct, he may well be excluded from a cultural model. The search for new directions in research in education is essentially motivated by the fact that our existing theoretical positions have not proven fruitful in terms of helping children from minority groups achieve in the public schools. In order to construct new theoretical bases for research possibilities it is first necessary to consider what the prevailing theoretical notions are, where they are sound, where they are inadequate, and where they must be amended and new positions put forth.

A total of 404 male and female classroom and special education (i.e., art, music, physical education) teachers in grades one to six, from a large school system in a metropolitan area, received a Student Progress Report with an attached color photograph of a boy or girl who had been previously rated as low, moderate, or high in physical attractiveness. The personal growth and attitudes section of the Student Progress Report were manipulated so that the conduct of the student was acceptable or unacceptable. A teacher evaluation form which asked the teacher to rate the student on  several ability related dimensions accompanied the Student Progress Report. A total of 350 teachers (295 females and 55 males) or about 87 percent completed the evaluation form. The results show that children who are achievement oriented, accepted, cooperative, dependable, and self-controlled are perceived by teachers to be more academically capable and likely to achieve greater vocational success. It would appear that children with good conduct are the \"chosen ones\" in the elementary school, regardless of their level of physical attractiveness or sex. The prediction by teachers that poor conduct girls would be more intelligent than girls with acceptable conduct suggests that the rather passive, quiet girl is not viewed as possessing the intellectual capacity of one who is perhaps more  assertive and less self-controlling. Further, girls who have high achievement motivation take on some characteristics of the male role. (Author/JM)",

Of the 3,397,413 children enrolled in public schools, 16.3 percent were Title I participants while 17.5 percent of 872,717 nonpublic school enrollment received Title I services. The New York State Title I grant for local school aid was 113,600,524 dollars of which 66 percent was allocated to New York City, nine percent to Albany, Buffalo,  Rochester, Syracuse, and Yonkers, and the remaining 25 percent to the other 702 participating districts. The major emphasis of Title I programs was on the improvement of reading skills (1249 programs) and, secondarily, on the provision of pupil services (554 programs). Other programs emphasized were art, English as a second language, mathematics, preschool education, and speech therapy. The major changes in administrative structure in 1968-69 were the creation of State task forces to reexamine the State's educational goals; and the efforts of the Division of Evaluation to coordinate local, State, and Federal reporting by assisting in the development and implementation of an improved Federal program reporting system. As a result of statistical studies, several interesting facts came to  light, e.g., it became obvious that Title I's greatest effect was on the younger child. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"If any one fact has emerged consistently in the International Project for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) studies of educational achievements, it is that achievement is related to a variety of factors in the home background of children. This is true so far as differences in the achievements of single students within a country are concerned. It is also true so far as mean score for different countries is concerned. Several questions can be posed with respect to these relationships. Firstly, how substantial are the relationships, both within and between countries? Are they merely \"statistically significant,\" or are they of a size that has \"practical significance?\" Secondly, how stable are the relationships from subject matter to subject matter and from country to  country? Are the factors that receive most weight as predictors of reading the same as the ones that receive most weight for prediction of science or of literature? Are the factors that are most predictive in the U.S.A. also most predictive in England or Iran or Chile? If not, what reasonable explanation can be offered for the differences? Thirdly, are the facts that are most predictive of individual differences also the ones that are most predictive of national differences? If not, why not? In spite of the modest correlations that we obtained for background variables, these seemed to be much more effective predictors than any of the items that described the school as an educational unit.

        "description":"This paper investigates the effects of school on learning as exhibited in this research. In all three studies, there were regressional analyses carried out in which the total variation to be accounted for was that between school averages, and regression analyses in which the total variation to be accounted for was the full variation between individual students. In examining overall effects of school variables, the between-student analysis should be used even though it includes a lot of variance due to individual differences within schools. It appears better to recognize that school variables can account only for that fraction of the total variance that lies between schools, and to use the between-student analysis for the study of effects of school variables. In the use of the  between-student analysis, six countries are focused on which engaged in testing in literature, reading, and science: Chile, England, Finland, Italy, Sweden, and the United States. In addition, the analysis is confined to the 10 and 14 year-olds. Several general results are useful to state. For all three subjects, the total effect of home background is considerably greater than the total direct effect of school variables. Comparisons between ages 10 and 14 show a slightly higher total direct effect of schools at age 14 than at age 10 but a smaller proportion of it independent of home background. The data show fairly conclusively that reading achievement is more fully an outgrowth of home influences than are either of the two subjects, less a function of what takes place at school.

        "description":"The aim of this study was to examine the health and nutritional status of low-income women in Upstate New York and to identify problems that interfere with their employment. Questionnaires on health and work, complete medical and employment histories, physical examination, laboratory tests, dental examination and diet recalls were obtained for 469 low-income women, mothers of at least one teen-age child. Among the major findings are the following: The greater the total number of current medical complaints that the women reported, the less likely they were to be employed. Among these complaints neurasthenic symptoms including tiredness, insomnia, headaches and nervousness together were significantly more common among the non-working groups. Physical and mental disabilities,  documented by examination, were also associated with unemployment. Obesity was the most common nutritional problem encountered. Unemployment was related to obesity, and the incidence of unemployment rose directly with the degree of fatness. The association between unemployment and obesity could be explained as being due to the coexistence of diseases known to be complications of obesity, such as hypertensive heart disease and diabetes. Variables correlated with current welfare status (welfare dependency) included absence of an employed husband, disabilities arising in early life and the presence of chronic disease. The total number of years a woman had been employed since leaving school was related directly to education and job skills and inversely to the number of children and number of  pregnancies.

What has been the response of the suburban school system to the black student? What changes in the educational policy, curriculum, administration and structure are taking place? With what effect? What financial changes are needed for adequate educational support? What has been the changing relationships among the schools and various governmental agencies; county, state and Federal? Can those suburbs with black populations show surrounding suburbs--and the central city--that quality education can continue under the stress of a changing population? Can these suburbs demonstrate new ways of coping with problems  on which the city schools have foundered? Can they develop new methods and ideas for educating the young that can be shared widely among educational institutions in the country? The initial aim was to look at several suburban school districts experiencing increases in black population in the New York Metropolitan Area. During the first year, we looked at two communities, the school districts of Roosevelt and Westbury. Both are located in suburban Nassau County, part of the expanding New York metropolis. Open-ended interviews were conducted with people from the community and people from the school system (blacks as well as whites), people who had lived there for a long time, and blacks who had only recently moved in. Special care was taken to include low-income blacks. The interviews  ranged from 30 minutes to two hours. (Author/JM)",

CBI explores teacher perception of the child's behavior in the area of extraversion-introversion, task orientation-distractability, and hostility-considerateness. The total group of 87 white and 54 black 4th, 5th, and 6th grade pupils, including 12 balck Educable Mentally Retarded (EMR) subjects, were significantly different on all three dimensions. Black subjects were seen by their teachers as more introversive, more distractable, and more hostile than were white pupils. Random samples of white and black non-retarded children were matched for number of boys and girls and by grade, with the group of black EMR children.  There were no white EMR children in the classes. Significant differences were found among the 12 nob-retarded white, the 12 non-retarded black, and 12 EMR pupils on two of the three dimensions, namely, task orientation-distractability and hostility-considerateness. The differences between black and white, and EMR and white subjects were significant, while those between EMR and black students were not. Teachers described their black non-retarded and their black EMR as similar while seeing their white students as different on the dimensions measured. Race was more potent than intellectual ability in determining teacher attitudes toward their students. (Author/RJ)",

Members of the committee point out the gap existing between the need for basic research and the limited financial and personnel resources allocated to the approved program. The special needs of developing countries to work out adult education policies and programs often involve the training of both specialists and recipients. The mass media in adult education, which in developing countries is the  radio, plays an important part. The decisive part that women can play in the development of adult education is, likewise, indicated.

Logic validation of the rationales and paradigms used can be carried out prior to the full development and implementation of the programs and is necessary for the wise use of limited funds and resources. Topics discussed in detail in the area of basic issues in career development education are: stability vs. change, technology as master or servant, who is an educated person, locus of motivation, and fidelity  vs. anomy. General guidelines for career development curricula consider assumptions about the five issues discussed in the first portion of the document, from which seven essential qualities for career development curricula can be inferred. Finally, seven design principles are developed and the whole framework is used to examine the logical validity of the Career Development for Children Project (CDCP) for a K-12 curriculum in career education.

Differing points of view are also expressed in answer to the question, \"Is career education all of education or is it only part of education?\" Some people regard career education as a new title for vocational-technical education; others stress the importance of career education for all people at all educational levels from early childhood through adulthood. If these basic differences in the value systems of the various conceptualizers are not resolved, career education's potential for vitalizing and refocusing education could be lost. A  both/and attitude rather than an either/or attitude is suggested.

The experimental group, receiving twelve hours of coordinated instruction, improved their scores, as shown by pre- and post-testing for achievement motivation. Ability of media to change attitudes was measured with four college vocational planning classes being questioned as to interest in occupational information; two of the classes, which were shown a film on goals, showed increased interest level.  Analysis of costs directed to the cost/effectiveness of coordinated instruction in reaching large groups of students indicated savings through the use of para-professionals with instructor coordination versus regular instructor only. Research and film production costs become economical only when fifty or more sets of films can be sold. Since media can communicate more concisely, it does permit more class time to be spent in activity and discussion. (EA)",

As a result of the review, certain specific matters were identified on which it was evident some further guidance in the implementation of Recommendation 1 would be welcomed by electricity boards. These arose from experience of the application of Recommendation 1, and the changes proposed can be carried out within its general framework. These are: (1) the provision of a common first-year program for distribution trades, (2) the further development of related-trades training, (3) the need for the  flexibility in the implementation of on-job training programs, (4) the effect of changes in the pattern of recruitment, (5) the effect of developments in the field of further education, and (6) the implications of experience gained from use of first and third year test. These six changes are discussed in detail. A common first year training program for distribution craft apprentices takes up the second half of the document. The intended training period is approximately 36 weeks. (Author/DS)",

While many of the suggested activities are designed to foster a personal maturity, the emphasis is placed upon maturity in vocational and career decision making. Within the four sections (pre-kindergarten/kindergarten, primary, intermediate, and junior high school) the material is presented under the headings of concept, behavior, activities, and reference. Each section is provided with its own list of books, films, and other resource material. World of Work concepts are introduced in a concrete fashion at the early primary level and recycled and expanded in a more sophisticated manner at the  intermediate and secondary levels. This consolidated approach to career and child development is essential. The guide approaches career development in its broadest sense with emphasis on increasing awareness and understanding of the World of Work and its adaptability to one's individual life styles.

The project had five goals: (1) expand the present career awareness program in the elementary grades, (2) expand the exploratory programs in the junior high grades, (3) establish a vocational &quot;cluster&quot; program in the senior high grades, (4) improve guidance and counseling service at all grade levels, and (5) establish a placement service to place all students in either a job, a post-secondary occupational training program, or a baccalaureate program. The five general goals were subdivided into nineteen specific objectives. activities undertaken and completed in sixteen of the nineteen objectives included visits to other  program sites, development of classroom materials, teacher workshops, literature searches, development of assessment procedures, and other related activities. A third party evaluator concluded that the activities were generally well organized and developed involvement and interest in career education. The guidance and counseling component at the elementary and high school levels was the least rewarding project effort. The evaluator considered an important outcome to be the placing of the person employed by the project under regular contract with instructions to continue the program. (AG)",

For each program, the guide presents its concepts, topic, focus, location, background information, and discussion considerations.

Even students whose occupational goals cannot be served by any business in the community benefit from learning how to work and developing positive work attitudes. To facilitate the development of such programs this coordinators' guide briefly discusses program criteria, determination of student needs, program planning, program implementation, and program objectives.

Concurrent research relevant to the practice itself has provided promising implications for the construction of a curriculum of training for professional careers in correction, rehabilitation, and education, and has demonstrated that this kind of activity provides a valuable learning experience for students preparing for careers in these and related areas. The basic principles used are those of  differential reinforcement to bring about behavior modification, with the aim of making delinquent-prone high school students more competent to deal with their environment by correcting behavioral deficits. Results obtained by this program suggest that stating students' problems in behavioral terms and defining events in terms of their function could result in benefits both to the educational system as a whole and to individual students by allowing those involved to become more attuned to the realities of the situation.

To achieve these goals, a graduate counseling fellow was assigned to the one elementary school in the project, three fellows were assigned to the three middle schools, and a graduate counseling fellow, a placement officer, and a secretary were assigned to the secondary school. In addition a graduate research fellow served the overall project  and five students enrolled in a Cooperative Office Education course were assigned to assist the graduate students. Among the results of the program were the development of a volume of activities for instructional procedures, slides and audio tapes, a model for career guidance at each of the three levels, a core of trained personnel, and placement information and services. The project has been successful in view of the objectives established. (Questionnaires, tables, and aids for curriculum development constitute a large portion of the volume.) (AG)",

The emphasis of the 1971-72 study was the objective of student goal-setting and planning for career and educational development. Guidance Curriculum processes and materials were utilized to meet this objective. The ninth grade unit focused on the acquisition of decision making skills. In grade ten the unit attempted to assist each student with educational planning. The eleventh grade unit was designed to enable each student to explore career opportunities and make tentative occupational choices. In grade twelve the unit was intended to help each student with post-high school decision making. The media components used at respective grade levels were the booklet entitled &quot;Deciding,&quot; the Educational Guidance  Information Service, the Self Appraisal and Assessment Structure, and the Comparative Guidance and Placement Program. Evaluation of the Guidance Curriculum activities was in the form of a randomized experimental group pretest-posttest design. Student questionnaires (SQ-1 and SQ-2) were prepared as evaluation instruments for each of the four components. Comparative summary tables of change within components are presented with item analysis. Conclusions were made; evidence suggested that such a program of group guidance can be both feasible and effective. Copies of SQ-1 and SQ-2 are appended. (SC)",

Strategies identified to realize these objectives fall in these categories: (1) planning, including administrative and policy level planning, curricular and operational level planning, and articulation level planning; (2) differential staffing, including the staff role of the teacher, the administrator, the guidance  coordinator, the counselor, the counselor assistant, the support staff, and volunteer aides; (3) guidance services, consisting of the guidance curriculum (group guidance), group counseling, individual counseling, and home-school-community interaction; and (4) evaluation.

Also included in the institute program were films, an orientation meeting, a two-day workshop, and discussion groups on the techniques and strategies for career planning. Pre- and post-tests were given to the institute participants to determine their familiarity with the required education, training, yearly income, and occupational mobility for 30 job titles. Participants were also asked to record their perception of their own knowledge of career guidance. Scores were uniformly higher on the post-test, the margin of  difference between scores for the same item showing some variation. The participants generally agreed the institute accomplished its objectives and plans for implementation of career guidance programs were stated.

Special focus of the VOICE program was toward underachieving students with language difficulties (bilingual) and socioeconomic disadvantages who would be non-college bound and possible school dropouts. At the elementary and junior high school levels, project efforts were directed toward career awareness for students and teachers, while at the  senior high school level, efforts were to provide saleable skills for graduating students, a vocational guidance counselor at each high school, and placement services for graduates. One of the outstanding characteristics of the VOICE program was the involvement of people from outside the school system, families of students, and the local business community. Third party evaluators felt VOICE was an effective model, as its concepts were incorporated into district schools, and that it created change in the thinking of the Mexican-American community. About half of the document is devoted to appendixes. (EA)",

        "description":"Since it is a lifelong system increasing the relevancy of basic academic subjects, stressing decision-making, and assuring everyone a marketable skill, the Office of Education believes that career education has potential for effecting a complete renewal of education. The Office has: (1) launched six pilot community projects; (2) asked each State to plan a model (school-, home-, or employer-based, or rural residential) with Federal funds; (3) appointed an investigative panel of scholars; and (4) contracted for a project with the University of Missouri to help States organize and conduct implementation workshops in career development guidance and counseling. A career education thrust requires top priority for redirecting and expanding guidance, counseling, and placement; a  Bureau-produced catalog of areas of \"national concern\" suggesting the scope of attention and responsibilities involved in a systematic redirection is reinforced by Eli Ginzberg's critique of career guidance (\"Few spend...significant time in activities designed to lead to improved decision-making\"). A comprehensive and developmental program must be designed for outcomes that ensure freedom of choice for American citizens. (AJ)",

Areas of commercial and administrative activity needing employers are distributive trades and salesmanship, government, technical industry, and international trade. Caution must be exerted to ensure that general vocational education remains general. The structure of commercial education may be considered by function of employment, by the type of school, whether schooling is to be part or full-time, apprenticeship schemes, and correspondence education. Among the aims, skills, and aptitudes of commercial education are  listening comprehension and verbal skills, communication skills, computer skills, knowledge and references sources, possession of initiative and adaptability, and capacity for working as part of a group. Common reference points are needed as a base for curriculum design. A wide range of teaching methods must be employed in business and administrative education. Traditional methods of evaluation must be reexamined and professional continuous learning opportunities should be provided. Education is necessarily viewed as a life-long process. (AG)",

The author describes an evolving discipline divided on the meaning of \"instructional technology\" (gadgetry or systems approach?), and reviews the findings of research on instructional television as they apply to adult education. A program in American Samoa and the Open University of the BBC are cited as examples of large instructional design; discussing movements toward instructional designs in the U.S., the author describes and evaluates the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the Commission on Instructional Technology, and the National Institute of Education. Programs  of the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications receive close attention: satellite, cable, microwave, and wireline networks have been developed in support of health-care delivery, education, and research. The author concludes that \"there is no point in trying to do what most instructional television programming for adults has tried to do,\" and he offers his own guidelines for adopting televised instruction.

Analysis of the data obtained indicated that flight excusal followed by refresher training would provide operational units with better qualified aviators at less cost than the traditional flying program. A proficiency maintenance program based on very low-cost synthetic training devices seems to be the only alternative that might be less costly than excusal plus refresher training, but feasibility of these devices in the Army context is unknown at this time.

        "description":"To determine the effect of a legislated increase in the minimum wage in Ontario, 219 establishments in five industries were surveyed. The industries were shoe factories; luggage, handbag, and small leather goods manufacturers; hosiery mills, children's clothing industry; and the foundation garment industry. Data were gathered at three different times: just before the increase, shortly after the increase, and one year after the increase. The increase saw an immediate reduction in the number of employees earning less than the new minimum, but over the course of a year, it was not possible to isolate the effect of the minimum wage on employment. More than half the establishments raised product prices in the year following the wage increase. Following a period of compression of the  labor structure by increasing wages at the lower end, the differentials established prior to the revision were re-established. It is generally concluded that the immediate gains to the low-paid employees are eroded in the long run. The level of hourly earnings increased, but changes in employment, hours of work, systems of payment, and production techniques could not be attributed to the wage increase. (AG)",

The training phase objective was to recruit, train, obtain certification for, and place eight occupational education administrators while gathering information for the development of similar programs. Eight employed teachers were provided with a one-fourth time internship under the daily supervision of the local administrator, with the University providing overall supervision, seminars, and classes, all for graduate credit. The content of the academic year internship consisted of the accomplishment of 159 competencies; summer school was devoted to a full course load. At the end of the training period all participants had received the proper  certification and all became employed in leadership positions. Evaluative data suggest that a combination internship and accompanying classroom experience provided competency development that was superior to either method offered alone, although the project approach is more costly than the traditional approach to school administrator education. It was recommended that some techniques and methods used should be refined and/or modified during a second year of program operation, and an attempt should be made to package the instruction to be usable by other educational institutions.

        "description":"The review and synthesis of the sociological literature on mobility in the United States relies essentially on studies described in professional sociology journals and books written by sociologists. There are three types of sociological stratification: caste, estate, and class. In a class stratified society, the influential factors are education, occupation, and income. Studies generally investigate inter-generational mobility or intra-generational mobility to resolve the conflict of the relationship between occupational mobility and vertical mobility. The factors motivating occupational mobility are based on the values of society. In America, a Protestant work ethic and a pragmatic work ethic were closely interrelated. Many other values are influential in a more limited way.  There is also controversy over the amount of mobility, but it is generally agreed socio-cultural considerations are involved as well as labor-union and government programs. The consequences of occupational mobility can be either positive or negative and are not restricted by the direction of the movement. The same factors influencing occupational mobility influence vocational education but not necessary in the same manner or to the same degree. (A nineteen-page bibliography is included.) (AG)",

The Research for Better Schools (RBS) model, an employer-based model, is composed of a management structure, an instructional program, guidance and counseling, and an evaluation plan. The Far West Laboratory Model is also an employer-based model, different from  RBS in several aspects. A home/community model was designed consisting of a comprehensive career-oriented program centered in individualized learning programs.

Product objectives outlined the types of student outcomes which are career education objectives. Process objectives detailed the educational strategies and techniques to be used in achieving desired student outcomes. Project objectives provided a system of events leading to the accomplishment of both the product and process objectives. The program was to be implemented through the existing curriculum by all teachers, kindergarten through high school. It was felt the  project made a major contribution to the statewide increase in career education awareness and interest. A 50-page external evaluation utilizing computer monitoring of the PERT schedule concluded that the process and project objectives had been met. A second, 30-page, external evaluation of product objectives, based on pre- and post-tests, was inconclusive. (AG)",

The focus suggested is the responsiveness of career education to the problems experienced by individuals as they interact with the labor market. A framework for R&D is established by tracing the connections between three major labor market problems--unemployment, low-income employment, and alienation in employment--and career education interventions that might ameliorate these problems for various population groups. Using this framework, some ongoing career education projects (school-based, employer-based, home-based and residential) are examined to  determine what changes and additional efforts are needed. A program plan is derived with four basic components: analytical activities, modification of continuing projects, new efforts, and evaluation. Approximate budget proportions and staffing requirements for carrying out the program are suggested, together with alternative organizational and management strategies.

The project's goals were directed toward recognition of the importance of: career preparation, relevancy of education in career preparation, effective teaching methods, and continuing career assistance for former students. Specific objectives were: career awareness in grades K-6, occupational information in grades 7-9, improving guidance and counseling services at all levels, and development of a placement service for all school leavers. A university extension course in career education and in-service training were available for interested teachers. Program outcomes were the development of a training and general education program for disadvantaged students, the  preparation of 84 curriculum units, and a senior high school level cooperative work experience program. A 60-page evaluation report by a third party concluded that the data supported the observation that the project met and frequently exceeded its responsibilities.

Intended to bridge the gap between school and earning a living for students in an urban poverty area, the program begins in elementary school and continues through high school. Eight goals and related performance objectives were delineated. The program included occupational information and orientation and career exploration. Among the program's accomplishments were the development of sound slides and a curricula guide and the use of both the cluster concept and discipline concept in the program presentation. Appendixes include an annotated bibliography and a list of instruments used. The second major component is the 76-page report of the final evaluation committee.  It concludes that the program results in significantly greater occupational knowledge for its students but was not successful in imparting more positive attitudes towards work related concepts or expanding expressed job preferences. The third major component describes the one-year participation by Catholic schools at the intermediate school level. In 117 pages, the program rationale and objectives are defined, and lesson plans used by grades 4-6 are outlined. (AG)",

The American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education has developed five characteristics of CBTE, five implied characteristics of CBTE, and seven related and desirable characteristics of CBTE. The improvement of teacher education, using CBTE, is related to the issues of competencies, certification, tenure, professional organizations and assessment of programs. The Occupational Teacher Education Program at the University of Michigan is a competency-oriented approach to teacher education, with emphasis placed on common professional teaching competencies. Teaching experiences are  utilized to develop applications to specific service areas. (SA)",

Men who had participated in Manpower Development and Training (MDT) were compared with State trade school trainees, men from the Experimental Manpower Laboratory for Corrections (EMLC) token economy study, men with both MDT training and token economy treatment, and men who received no institutional treatment. A criterion for criminal behavior was developed, the Law Encounter Severity Scale (LESS) which served as the yardstick for validating the capacity of the following instruments to predict law  encounters and recidivism. While vocational training and adult education appear essential to rehabilitation of the criminal offender, data indicate that supplemental training in interpersonal skills and money management is also critical.

Data was collected on client characteristics according to sex as to demography, educational level, employment, experience, income, and welfare statistics. Eighty-four percent of the project clients were placed in three major job types--service, clerical, and professional/technical/managerial (to a lesser extent, structural jobs) with educational and hospital/health type employers; service jobs were the largest single type of occupational category. Those  clients who received welfare generally were shorter term clients receiving modest welfare payments. Data analysis indicated a relatively high transition rate for client and good job retention and welfare reduction for transitioners versus non-transitioners. Conclusions from this study were that public service employment appears useful as a means of obtaining steady primary employment and was most effective with clients having better work histories and less welfare time.

The study indicated high correlation between income and empolyment and level of education; the earnings of blacks and of women were substantially lower than of white males (after controlling for level of educational attainment, occupation, and industry of employment). Participation in conventional and poverty-type training programs had not raised trainees' income above those of  nonparticipants and had no significant effect upon employment duration. However, it cannot be concluded that participants received no benefit, since comparisons were not made for pre- and post-training earnings and employment duration. Two major areas in need of emphasis were identified as the increasing of skill levels and eliminating racial barriers to upward mobility. Thus far, training programs have not proven an adequate substitute for formal education, and further research is needed on the restructuring of school programs to increase the proportion of students completing high school.

The main thrust of the program was the construction of a positive learning environment--a restructuring of the classroom that replaces the failure environment with a success environment that, in turn, promotes future successful experiences. Out of this approach a classroom management system, success technique, evolved which consisted of three components: positive contingency management system (behavior modification) designed to deliver high reinforcement of appropriate social and academic behavior, classroom arrangement designed to foster small group and individualized teaching, and some revision of the  standard curriculum. Various reinforcers were used. First year evaluation results indicated a usable behavior management system had been provided but not an effective program for accelerating academic performance. Thus, reinforcement for academic behavior was emphasized more and begun earlier; project pupils achieved at least one month's gain in reading and arithmetic for each month of project participation. The project has been recognized as one of the top three exemplary programs in the nation during 1973. (EA)",

The benefits of exposing students to a variety of life styles include: (1) fostering of a greater understanding of diverse human situations and lifestyles; (2) challenging student perceptions and values; (3) heightening the awareness of young women and stimulating them to aspire to greater self-realization and (4) providing a contemporaneity and relevance for youth; (5) encouraging students to assume a life-long, family-cycle, developmental perspective for themselves, and (6) helping to bridge \"generation gaps\" between instructors and students. Issues relating to teacher effectiveness involve: (1) the teacher's philosophy of  education (teaching traditional values vs. exposure to new values); and (2) the teacher's philosophy of family (traditional vs. divergent family styles). The roles of text materials, assignments, lectures, and class experiences in this curriculum are also discussed. (RWP)",

Training schools have been described as poor houses for neglected children, tending to increase the alienation and crystalize the criminal self-concept of the offender. The Massachusetts Department of Youth Services departed from traditional approaches in two ways: (1) it was the first state to close its correctional youth institutions; and (2) it has developed many innovative and promising community-based alternatives for its troubled youth, without a major increase in budget or personnel. This pamphlet examines, very briefly, several of these alternative  approaches. (HV)",

The workshops are designed to help school-community representatives to work on problems of mutual concern. The study considers two questions: (1) Assuming the workshop is capable of bringing about positive change in the relationships among individual participants, to what degree can the responsibility for these changes be traced directly to the curriculum materials? (2) Do participants show any evidence of measurable change that appears to go beyond the changes in their relationships to one another? To determine effectiveness of curriculum, short questionnaires were used along with evaluative observation. The primary tool used  in measuring changes in perceptions was a pre-program and post-program questionnaire which included a semantic differential section in which participants were asked to rate 10 concepts on 10 scales. Results indicate that there is little evidence of change in participants' perceptions of concepts fundamental to the program or among various groups involved with education. (Author/HMV)",

Specifically, the investigation seeks to determine if the measures of selected personality traits display a parabolic curve similar to that displayed by the initial closure data on the Higgins-Wertman Test of Visual Closure (H-W) over the ages seven, eight, nine and ten years. Initial closure was assessed by the H-W and selected personality traits were assessed by the Children's Personality Questionnaire. Subjects were 20 male and 20 female children at each age level. The initial closure  data, over age, was reported by Higgins and Wertman (1968) to form a concave parabolic curve for males and females combined. Results of this study replicate those findings.

The sum of these products was divided by the number of respondents for the goal to yield a mean value. Results are compiled in rank order for each of the ten separate groups and for the total of all groups. All 34 goal statements were accepted by the vast majority of respondents.

The same principles apply to the acquisition, maintenance and weakening of complex verbal skills as mathematics as to rats pressing bars or pigeons pecking windows. Two aspects of child research are assessment and training. Assessment involves cross-sectional sampling of the child's activities, while training involves more longitudinal repeated presentation of a task and its accounterments. The focus of this paper is training. There are many systematic positions that attempt to account for the products of learning operations. The author's position leans entirely toward associative conditioning of external (rather than internal, movement-produced) stimuli with behavior. Drive reduction  is not sufficient although it seems to be a sub-set solution to the overall problem of reinforcement--feeding the deprived rat works, but probably for reasons other than drive reduction. The terminal response is a given situation is that recurs when a large enough proportion of the original cue is represented. (Author/HMV)",

This study establishes two conditions under which activities are defined as either typified for both male and female actors or typified for male actors only; 269 male and female S's respond to a TAT-type verbal cue depicting a successful female actor under one of the two conditions. Results show that fewer subjects report \"female motive to avoid success\" when the activity is defined as typified for both sexes than when it is defined as  non-typified for women. When the activity is defined as typified for both sexes, sex of subject does not affect response and reports of the \"motive\" are few. When the activity is defined as non-typified for women, more male S's report \"female motive to avoid success.\" Few females S's in either condition report the \"motive.\" (Author)",

Path analysis of the data from the first four waves of a five-wave, seven-year longitudinal panel study of 2790 youth from the southern tier of New York supports the tenability of that proposition, albeit more for males than for females. Early expectation is the variable which: (1) mediates a sizeable percentage of the influence of family status, measured intelligence, parental achievement socialization, and parental educational stress to specified \"in-school\" behaviors, to later or senior-year educational expectations, and to actual post-high school educational  attainment; (2) is itself a net determinant of those specified in-school behaviors, of later expectations, and of actual educational attainment.

The objective was to examine what significant value changes, if any, took place during the program. Results are assessed according to racial groups rather than individuals. Results of the first survey show that the black interns were more concerned with cleanliness, independence, politeness, and self-control than were white interns. White interns were more concerned with honesty and salvation than blacks. Results of the second survey show that the groups differed significantly only in their rankings on the value, &quot;Clean.&quot; Survey data at the end of the program indicate  that blacks and whites demonstrated fewer significant differences in their values.

Both freshmen and transfers tend to use drugs more to get high and feel good, but freshmen are more apt to use them to be more friendly and sociable. The most frequent reasons for non-use of drugs were similar for freshmen and transfers: no desire to experience its effects, and reports (or experience) of harmful psychological effects. Transfer students take a more favorable stand on the legalization  of all drugs, but a harder stand against the use and selling of drugs other than marijuana than do freshmen. Transfers are also less apt to go the University Counseling Center for help with a drug-related problem. Type of school formerly attended by transfers did not correlate with their use of drugs. Users of some drugs were more highly intra-correlated than uses of others. (Author)",

Both polls were designed to investigate the incidence and frequency of drug use among incoming students, as well as students' reasons for using and not using drugs, their attitudes toward drug legalization, the illegal sale and use of drugs, and the University's role in providing drug related services. Results indicated a fairly stable, although slightly increasing, trend in the incidence and frequency of drug use. Although marijuana was the only drug to evidence a significant increase of use, all drugs except hashish, mescaline, and DMT, tended to be used more  frequently. Only LSD and DMT were shown to have been used by a smaller percentage of people. A substantial portion of the incoming students have tried alcohol in at least one form (90%). The correlation between use of marijuana and hashish and use of heroin was found to be low. With the exception of cigarettes, more men than women use drugs. Students' reasons for using and not using drugs were not found to change substantially. Students from the later poll showed significantly greater agreement on the legalization of marijuana, on NOT attending a campus drug education program, and on going to the University Counseling Center if they felt a need for drug counseling.

For example, smiling is an evolved mechanism with an obviously adapted function and is, therefore, a standard unit of behavior. Yet when smiling is interwoven with an individual pattern of behavior the end result is a unique, individually evolved personality structure. The author maintains that research should strive to understand  individual personality in terms of man's evolutionary nature. (RWP)",

Many of the functions presently performed by professional counselors are within the capacity of trained, mental health paraprofessionals. However, research indicates that professional counselors often react defensively when \"professional\" functions are assigned to paraprofessionals. The purpose of this study is to explore some of the reported realities of the relationship between professionals and paraprofessionals in the field of counseling. The author suggests four functional principles to facilitate the introduction of paraprofessionals into a counseling setting: (1) functional identification which specifically defines the  activities counselors may engage in within the institution; (2) functional differentiation which describes the association of the activities with either professionals or paraprofessionals; (3) team identification which allows the thorough integration of paraprofessionals yet maintains clearcut functional identities for both professionals and paraprofessionals; (4) institutional identification which suggests the establishment of expectations and goals on the part of the institution. The paper discusses the implementation of these four principles. (Author/HMV)",

Differences emerge between respondents from approved and non-approved programs, especially between third-year graduate students in these programs, with respect to perceptions of the quality and importance of research training in the programs, estimated productivity of graduates and problems in research training.

The special characteristics of the dormitory--racially mixed and discordant--seemed to indicate a need for a special kind of resident advisor training program, one that attempted to better acquaint resident advisors with their own feelings and those of other resident advisors and the incoming students. It sought to unite the resident advisors into a single group, working together and setting the mood for the entire dormitory. Virtually all schools have such training programs, although not much literature has been published on the topic, nor has much research been done in the area. It was felt that the most effective program  would, like most others, feature an inservice week on campus including a three-day retreat, and use of a handbook, reading list, self-evaluation forms, and weekly meetings. Unlike other programs, the inservice week at CSU included extensive sessions in sensitivity training. It was anticipated that the inservice portion of the program and the required readings would assist students as well as advise in coping with aspects of racial prejudice. (Author)",

        "description":"This paper examines the assets and problems that occur when a school system relies on part-time, external mental health services. In this case, the \"part-time, services\" are provided by local university (Yale) graduate students in the role of counsultants The greatest problem encountered is the attitude of the regular teaching staff who find the consultant's role very ambiguous as it often depends upon the degree to which each particular consultant develops it. Consultants are often regarded as either intruders or saviors; neither attitude is productive. Another problem is caused by the time lag during which the consultant can do little more than acquaint himself with the school system. Advantages include an expansion of services along with a general intellectual \"recharging\" for  much of the teaching staff. In addition, new approaches to education reach the school system more quickly through the students' influences. Finally, the staff benefits from outside, objective appraisal. The author suggests that some problems would be alleviated through the use of an explicit, mutal contract so both the consultant and the school system know what is expected, and so that all regular personnel are informed of consultant's specific roles.

Of particular concern is evaluation of the implications of this reconceptualization for empirical investigation of the effects of central concepts of Goffman's theoretical view. The study consists of two major parts: (1) translation of the parameters involved in self-presentation into a multiple-cue judgment task compatible with the lens model paradigm; and (2) utilization of this task as stimulus material for investigation of interpersonal learning. Specifically, 20 faculty members participated in filmed and taped interviews which were presented to 45 undergraduates under one of three experimental conditions: (1)  film and audio; (2) film only; or (3) audio-tape only. They were to indicate the likelihood of good relations with that person and a prediction of the estimate each stimulus person would make of his relationship to students. Results indicate that subjects show internally reliable judgmental systems as measured by the multiple correlation among cue values and responses for each subject. (Author/HMV)",

        "description":"Evaluation of effective classroom teaching has long plagued school supervisors and administrators. Rating is generally done with criteria which varies according to the educational objectives of the rater as well as with his subjective impressions of the staff member being rated. Counselor Educators are faced with a similar problem when attempting to evaluate the practicum student's performance in the counseling situation. In 1965 Flanders published in an U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare monograph a system of quantifying selected verbal interaction between teacher and students whereby meaningful interaction between them in the classroom could be explored. This technique of interactional analysis lends itself to adaption for the evaluating the interaction of the  counseling situation. By categorizing the possible responses in the counseling interview, recording them at timed intervals, and entering these data into a matrix, a comparison and analysis of the client and counselor responses are available. This paper is an explanation of an attempt to accomplish such a task. (Author)",

Goals of student development are defined as follows: (1) to provide opportunities which have potential for impact on all students; (2) to create a campus climate  conducive to learning; (3) to foster personal growth; (4) to enhance students ability to maintain satisfying human relationships; (5) to assist students in the development of their decision making processes; and (6) to broaden the perspectives of students through a multiplicity of activities.

The ASVAB is a group of nine paper and pencil tests that are combined into groups of two or more tests called Aptitude Areas. A single score is computed for each area. Justification for using ASVAB is based on the common knowledge that different occupations require different aptitudes, therefore, tests that measure specific aptitudes may predict success or failure with more accuracy than general intelligence or overall ability tests. The Career Workshop provides  the student with updated and relevant information from a variety of people in the field. The Career Information Resources Center consists of reading materials, records, tapes, slides, and assorted free materials. The three elements of the Career Guidance Service provide a variety of experiences to help the student develop his ability to make tentative career choices based on realistic information about himself and the world of work.

Each student was asked to name all of the lower case letters, which were presented in non-alphabetical order. Each response was accurately recorded to determine which letters were taken for others. All responses were then tallied, and an error frequency chart was constructed. The incorrect responses were statistically studied to differentiate between random and systematic errors. The systematic errors were then analyzed to determine what factors made it difficult for these letters to be learned. The results indicated that the most difficult letters to identify were those which resembled other letters in the visual and auditory modes. Error frequency of use were unrelated,  and no consistent direction of reversal was found in groups or individual students. Inability to note subtle differences between letters that resemble each other apparently accounted for almost all of the systematic error. (WR)",

The first thing the teacher must do is determine the specific reading and study skills required by students for content learning. This establishing of goals takes place before instruction begins. The next step is to determine the extent to which students possess these skills. When students' reading status has been assessed and their particular skills deficiencies determined, the teacher should gather reading materials which represent the range of reading abilities found in the classroom and provide practice in particular areas of weakness. The teacher must then  decide upon patterns of classroom organization to maximize teaching effectiveness. The most obvious organizational pattern is to group students by their determined reading levels and to teach content using material written at the appropriate level of difficulty. Finally, the teacher should use a functional approach to evaluate students' growth in reading and study skills. (WR)",

The subjects then took either a verbatim or paraphrase quiz, either immediately after reading the passage or after a 20-minute filled delay. In experiment two, 422 freshmen from a suburban high school read the army ant passage and then completed a verbatim quiz, a paraphrase quiz, a verbatim quiz twice, a paraphrase quiz twice, a verbatim quiz followed by a paraphrase quiz, or a paraphase quiz followed by a verbatim quiz. The results indicated that taking a quiz significantly enhances performance  on a delayed test. Performance was consistently higher on the verbatim than on the paraphrase forms of the quizzes and tests. Fitting the data well was a theory which assumes that a verbatim question is best at evoking retrieval of phonologically coded information in short term memory, and that a paraphrase question is best at instigating transfer of the information into long term, semantic memory.

The project was funded by the Florida Education Department, and the researchers built on earlier catalogs developed in reading and writing. A search of the literature pertinent to the fields of reading, written composition, and performance objectives was performed, and all existing communications performance objective catalogs were surveyed. After developing a domain chart treating the expressive skills of speaking and writing as almost mirror images of the receptive skills of listening and reading, the group employed graduate assistants and practicing  teachers to list competencies for each area and to develop pre-objectives, performance objectives, and two assessment items for each skill. A major portion of the paper presents the values and limitations of the performance-objective approach and the anticipated use of the finished project within a humanistic curriculum. (Author/WR)",

The i.t.a. program was compared to two different written composition programs, both of which used the traditional orthography or alphabet. One traditional orthography program (t.o.+), emphasized correctness of form. In the other program (t.o.-), samples were acceptable as they were turned in regardless of errors in mechanics or flaws in content and style. In the i.t.a. program, correction only occurred when it was indicated that a child was using  a character incorrectly through a misunderstanding of its sound value. As in the t.o.- program, only positive peer reaction was solicited. The data showed that high reading readiness achievement correlated significantly with achievement in creative writing and that the i.t.a. instructional program was more effective than the other two. This result may indicate the existence of an additional factor (writing) in the readiness complex and should be investigated further. (LL)",

One of the most commonly accepted strategies at the secondary level is that of improving self-concept through the study of literature. Since an important aspect of the modern youth culture is their music, another affective strategies would be the use of music in the classroom. One of the most popular uses of music in the classroom is the examination of lyrics of modern songs, many of which are intriguing enough to stimulate serious thought and discussion of what the song writer is trying to communicate. Language experience is a viable method of improving the reading skills of  secondary students. Drama and skits are effective strategies for improving students' self-concept. Some teachers may want to have their students write a play, cast it, and build the sets to produce it for other classes. Several projective techniques can also be used to help students begin to examine themselves and their relationships with others. (WR)",

The children were interviewed individually and were asked initially to draw a picture showing what they would like most to read about or have read to them. In the nation-wide study it was found that first graders were more interested in fiction while second graders were more interested in factual topics. In the study of a first grade open classroom in Culver City, California, the choices of topics reflected a greater interest in scientific material, particularly animal subjects. And in  the study of a traditional-turned-open classroom in Glen Cove, New York, it was found that the four topics receiving the greatest degree of preference included three which were categorized as realistic fiction and one categorized as imaginative fiction. It was decided that no clear-cut conclusions as to the influence of open classrooms on the reading interests of first grade children could be drawn from the three studies described. (HOD)",

Fifteen subjects were arranged in a large circle and were told that they were going to study a sequence of sentences and that a recall test would be administered after each presentation of the sentences. One by one, alternate subjects turned over a sentence card and read the sentence aloud to the group. A free recall task followed each presentation of the sequence. The results indicated that the subjects showed a very high recall performance for sentences read by themselves but tended not to recall sentences within the  range of two positions before and one position after their own reading.

Such a concept of student teaching cannot be developed in the traditional setting of the public school student-teaching program. Only by combining theory with practice throughout the entire educational program can meaning be given to the student teaching experience. Apprenticeship has been strongly recommended as the key to successful teacher education. The training of teachers has been affected by the vast array of technological innovations which enable the teacher educator to simulate classroom and professional situations preparatory for the  student's clinical or field experience. Attitude modification has been found to be effective in preparing future teachers to work with culturally disadvantaged groups. An innovation gaining momentum is the student teaching program which is based on competencies to be developed by individuals rather than fitting all individuals to pre-set expectations. In line with this, a number of states have moved toward the direction of certification based upon approved competency-based professional programs. (LL)",

The models are categorized according to the different approaches to comprehension: \"Behavior Models\" are concerned with determining behavioral outcomes for teaching comprehension; \"Cognitive-Based Models\" are concerned with explaining cognitive operations underlying comprehension; \"Relational Models\" explain comprehension by relating specific skills to postulated underlying cognitive operations; \"Information-Processing Models\" explain comprehension in terms of the dynamic interaction between incoming information and the cognitive processing of this information; and \"Psycholinguistic Models\" discuss  comprehension in terms of psychological and linguistic theory. It was concluded that the traditional approach of teaching comprehension as a series of skills separately defined, sequentially developed, and generally applicable in all reading situations is in error. The models suggest that comprehension is a multidimensional process, that the performance of skills is an outer manifestation of a complex inner process; and that comprehension varies with the task and should be taught as a cognitive process.

In modality testing the severely disabled learner's poor self-concept and short attention span adversely influence test results, and the child's preferred learning style is not determined. Prognosis testing is based on the premise that the decoding of words can only be mastered by sight words or phonics learning. Within these two approaches, there are alternative methods of learning that can be matched to the child's preferred learning style. The Spelling Pattern Prognosis Test, the Language Experience Prognosis Test, and the Phonics Prognosis Tests are short tests developed by the author for determining a preference in learning words by sight. These tests  are based on language experience, spelling patterns, and basal reader methods of teaching whole words. The prognosis test for phonics learning helps determine a child's facility in discriminating sounds, associating sounds to symbols, and blending sounds to form words by two alternative methods. The results of prognosis testing prescribe the best approach for teaching disabled readers, and this procedure is more productive than modality-type testing. (Author/WR)",

        "description":"The development of reading programs by publishers traditionally began with the selection of a qualified team of authors and consultants who then worked with editors in the research, development, and writing of a program. Another approach now emerging begins instead with the identification of learning needs, the specification of outcomes, and the overall design of a program to meet the following needs: instruction, content, and pedagogy. Learning strategies take precedence over teaching strategies. Authors are often not determined until the overall structure of the program is identified and the authors' roles are defined. Field tryouts of representative units or modules are conducted prior to full development of a complete multiyear program. The present model for program  development in reading also stresses data on pupil performance and pupil attitudes accumulated in field tests, rather than the recorded impressions of teachers. An increasing number of new programs stress field testing of teacher-training systems to assure that the programs will work as intended. Developmental research and development models in publishing have moved from a concern with the improvement of content to a concern for pupils' performance. (RB)",

The chief aim of the two year preschool program was to provide participants with enjoyable language arts experiences from which they might or might not learn to read. The only requirement of this group was that they be four years old by December of the school year. Findings showed that when differences in intelligence test scores were accounted for, children in the experimental program obtained higher mean scores on reading tests during  grades one through four. At the end of grades one and two, differences were large enough to merit statistical significance, but at the end of grades three and four, this was not the case. (HOD)",

Minicourse 18 was designed by the Far West Laboratory for Educational Research and Development to improve teacher effectiveness in aiding children in their acquisition of reading decoding skills. Fourteen inservice teachers and nineteen preservice teachers served as subjects. Seven inservice teachers and nine preservice teachers were trained with Minicourse 18, and the remaining seventeen subjects served as a control group. All of the subjects taught a  twenty- to thirty-minute lesson on reading decoding skills to three pupils one week before and two weeks after the training of treatment panel teachers. Some of the findings indicated that training with Minicourse 18 contributed significantly to the development and refinement of behaviors related to teaching reading decoding skills. Also, training with Minicourse 18 appeared to have provided teachers with a more systematic approach to teaching reading decoding skills. (WR)",

This concept, known as competitive partnership, is an instructional program in which major publishing companies compete with each other, but in partnership with a school system, in tackling a specific educational problem. The rationale for instituting competitive partnership was based on the following educational and administrative principles: (1) highly structured reading and mathematics programs are essential to successful performance and progress with slow learners and/or educationally disadvantaged students who represent the Title I target population; (2)  performance contracting has demonstrated that it has not produced satisfactory results; (3) under competitive partnership, no more money, and in some cases less money, is being spent for services that relate to a specific task; (4) many teachers need additional support programs and inservice training to successfully perform in urban schools; and (5) each company and teacher is competing with other companies and teachers to produce the desired results.

A successful reading program for children with behavior problems provides for daily success. Initial and continued teacher reinforcement creates increasingly effective self-reinforcement within the pupil. After thorough diagnosis, the teacher furnishes the pupil with reading materials which offer challenge without frustration. Reading activities include individual oral and silent reading, choral and team reading, and writing. There are few requirements for independent study on word attack or study skills. When the teacher plans a reading program which allows for success  with a minimum exposure to failure, reinforces each small achievement, and gives unwavering support for all progress, the pupil has an opportunity to overcome the reading dificiency and to make a more satisfactory social adjustment within the classroom.

Thus far, the Right to Read Effort has employed some 47 experts in reading as technical assistants, established 106 demonstration projects and additional  special projects, and appointed 31 Right to Read Directors. Schools throughout the country have exemplified the efforts of Right to Read.

From the evidence and the research studies reviewed the author concludes that generalizations about vowels can be grouped into two categories: generalizations which hold true most of the time but which include too few words to be worth teaching, and those which apply to many words but which are so unreliable that they are not worth teaching. Finally, the author suggests an alternative to the direct teaching of generalizations about vowels, which emphasizes the  exploration of language and learning to read through reading. (Author/WR)",

Ten third graders and 22 fourth graders from an inner-city Catholic school served as subjects. A paraphrase recall pretest was administered which involved reading a three-paragraph, 176-word passage and then retelling it, not necessarily verbatim, from memory. The two groups then received twelve training sessions over a period of 27 days. Two days after the final training session, subjects were given a paraphrase recall test without any imagery prompting, a paraphrase recall test with imagery prompting, and Form G of the Metropolitan Achievement Test (MAT) Elementary Reading battery. The results indicated  that there were no differences between groups except on the paraphrase recall test with imagery instruction, where the experimental scores were forty greater than the control scores.

Translators of research may present the results of studies in programs for the classroom teacher. Perhaps the greatest need today is for the translator to produce viable programs of instruction for the classroom teacher on such problems as the link between the structure of language and the structures of listening, speaking, reading, and writing a total language program. This is needed today if teachers are to implement the findings of significant research studies to effect change in instructional strategies. These reports and programs must be made  available to the classroom teacher in a simple uncluttered manner, without an overemphasis on statistics. Only then will the classroom teacher be in a position to add or delete practices of instruction for maximum pupil growth in reading and all other areas of language. (Author)",

The conclusions of the study indicate that television seems to be dealing mainly with the surface structure of written language. Several questions are posed; (1) Can television go beyond to the higher level communication processes that take place when a reader interacts with a text? (2) Can it help to increase  the productivity and quality of reading instruction? and (3) Can it eventually provide a viable alternative route to literacy for developing countries. It is suggested that the answers to these questions lie in future research and development policies. (LL)",

The children are trained to work independently in an environment laid out to permit choices from among 680 components and activities, as well as an environment that responds immediately to a child's unique decision. Audio card readers are one example of the auditory equipment available in the program. The conventional reliance on the single book has been replaced by a wider use of multi-modal presentations to accommodate the many different learning styles of  children.

Though established guidelines are helpful in making decisions about what books should be read by students, there is no system-wide prescriptive graded reading list for teachers to make \"safe\" selections from. Therefore, the teacher should read widely, in order to make his own booklist, and should guide the student's out-of-class reading experiences according to the student's abilities in reading areas where he will be motivated to read further. A teacher might plan a unit using adolescent literature by giving the students a voice in the planning. For example, the  class might come up with a list of adolescent problems. The teacher can then seek titles that provide insights into these problems, seek materials with a variety of reading levels, and seek materials of varying degrees of maturity. Another way to use paperbacks is through minicourse programs. If the student can become \"hooked on books\" in elementary school, he may have a more successful academic career ahead of him. (HOD)",

Furthermore, it can teach the pupil to look through the literary order and discover the logical order, and it is from the teacher that the student learns the rules of logical order before he can write. What happens, however, is that this method, being prescriptive--first the rules, the forms and then the \"stuffing\"--intimidates the students so that they write very reluctantly and awkwardly. Collaborative learning, on the other hand, provides an opportunity for the students to help each other to write before a teacher lays down the rules. First the students are encouraged to write freely,  uncriticized. Next, the students are encouraged to share their writings with each other for feedback, and then they proceed with editing. Teachers in this situation become tutors who help students with their problems in editing. At this point the teacher may, for purposes of elucidating sentence analysis, use Kellogg and Reed, but not as the point of departure. (HOD)",

The use of science fiction can help in making education more general, more flexible, and more relevant to possible future needs. Even at its most general level of information, in the most inept styles, science fiction can still give a personal immediacy to issues which statistics and discursive prose usually lack. To make adequate use of science fiction in the schools may require applications of the \"open classroom\" concept--that is, a classroom which would be \"open\" to the world, to the future, and to the individual student. However, interdisciplinary concerns can be introduced into many courses within  the traditional curriculum, since bringing in the future can help liberate almost any subject matter. Thus, it may be possible to turn high school and college courses at all levels in the direction of relevance by making this form of literature serve extra-literary ends. (HOD)",

From the data, materials and audio tapes were developed that could be used in helping preservice and inservice teachers identify morphological and syntactic features of black dialect. The concepts used in developing the materials were that (1) enough people speak black dialect to give credence to the thesis that they comprise a separate and distinct speech community; (2) there is systematic variety in the kind of English which these persons speak; and (3) black dialect speakers frequently alternate between general academic English practices and those of the variant dialect. Thirteen speech features were studied, including the omission of \"s\" to indicate  the third person singular, the formation of the past and perfect tense of verbs, zero copula, auxiliary \"be,\" negative \"be,\" formation of the plurals of nouns, formation of the possessive case of nouns, the pronominal appositive, variant forms of pronouns, the existential \"it,\" multiple negation, overinflection, and inverted word order in indirect questions.

The first part of the paper lists threads of historical significance often found in African literature: the division of Africa into colonies in the nineteenth century; the resultant imposition of diverse cultures; English as the common language and medium of instruction; and English and French as the two literary languages. Ideas on social and cultural change in Africa are also presented based on \"Africa in Social Change,\" by P. C. Lloyd. The dilemma of the African writer is discussed by drawing references from \"Perspectives on African Culture,\" edited by Christopher Heywood. Finally, the  annotated bibliography cites works that articulate the stratification of African society into \"haves\" and \"have-nots\" and the incipient class conflict that resulted from a European inspired elitism. Most of the citations are actual literary works, although some represent historical or critical reviews. (HOD)",

Arnold van Gennup, in his book &quot;The Rites of Passage,&quot; reduces all initiation rituals into three definable phases: separation, transition, and incorporation. The general pattern of the initiation ritual in &quot;Othello&quot; is as follows: Othello and Desdemona are separated from home (Venice); they go to a land of adventure (Cyprus); and they are initiated by a shaman (Iago) on the truths which they are to believe. In the case of &quot;Othello&quot; the second stage of the normal initiation ritual, &quot;transition,&quot; breaks down because the shaman, Iago, does not teach the truth. An initiation ritual also involves the rebirth of the candidate. In a profound psychological way all the characters in the play separate  themselves from their former identities in order to become new people: Othello becomes husband, rather than general; Desdemona becomes wife; Iago becomes deceitful; Cassio becomes lieutenant; and Emilia becomes a lady's attendant. The attempts by all the characters to become new and different people generate the dramatic tensions which result in the inevitable catastrophy of the play. (LL)",

With rare exceptions, this linguistic research has been directed to the lower working-class members of the black community. The language of blacks who are not lower class, on the other hand, has been summarily ignored, resulting in the middle-class black protest against the popularization and romanticization of ghetto varieties of English. The neglect of black varieties of English spoken by middle-class blacks has served to promote a negative stereotypical notion of black speech no different from linguistic stereotypes of former days. There is testimony that standard speech is no new arrival to the black community. What most linguists have failed to realize is the new dynamic within the black revolution which  encourages an appreciation of divergent forms of black behavior for no other reason than the fact that it is black. The concept of a black standard or, more correctly, black standards for English is a new concept which requires elaboration and refinement. (HOD)",

The absence of a critical position on Cable is due to the decline in his reputation as an artist when he became a writer of popular literature. Before 1925 Cable and his works were well known to the American reader. Cable follows a tradition in Southern writing whereby the locale functions as a spatial metaphor. The most unique feature of Cable's work is its social consciousness, which is most readily seen in his themes. In form, Cable's writing is the mixture of romance and realism that characterizes the era of post-war popular fiction. Cable's work at the turn of the century has none of the social  criticisms that characterized his earlier writings. The disappearance of his social consciousness contributed to the decline in his reputation. (LL)",

If the youth is to be educated, so must the adult be. This implies an openness on the part of the teacher if we are to conquer the gap in communication by a never ending search for the experience of  humanity conveyed in the art form. Through the medium of literature, the teacher penetrates and breaks rigidity and darkness within the student, nourishing instead enlightenment, inspiration, and hope.

Or, the pupils draw back when usage or mechanics are mentioned because they have previously experienced long sessions of dull practice. Recognition of these factors spurred the development of a Daily Oral Usage program which basically involves writing two incorrect sentences on the board each day. First the incorrect sentences are read by the children so that they can listen for errors. Next they search for errors in punctuation, letter format, verb usage, capitalization, and so on. Pupils then volunteer the needed  corrections, identifying the type of error in each case and explaining the need for correction. Finally, the class rereads the corrected sentence to hear the right version. The whole procedure takes a maximum of ten minutes each day. Within this context, the teacher can realize the need for some arbitrary placement of skills. (HOD)",

In an evaluation of the elective programs offered in the Fort Wayne Community Schools, it was found that (1) seventy percent of the students enjoyed being allowed to pick their own English courses; (2) eighty-eight percent of the students found phase-elective programs to be more to their liking than their previous programs; (3) sixty-three percent of the students felt phase-elective programs had positively affected their attitudes toward English; (4) students in the phase-elective schools were somewhat more positive in their response to language arts classes than were students in the traditional programs; and (5) students in the elective programs felt they were more involved in  their curriculum planning. Scores on the Iowa Test of Educational Development over a four-year period indicated a rise of ten points on the English scores above the score for the year prior to the institution of a phase-elective program. Though scheduling continues to be a problem, proponents of the elective programs continue to seek new solutions, for it seems students in these programs have captured a spirit of course election that is positive.

The first section, on the small group process, suggests procedures for putting the child in the position of having to share tasks, purposes, ideas, feelings, strengths, and weaknesses, and of being able to receive the personal support of other persons in the group. The second section, on acting out language, describes procedures for guiding the child from dramatic activities to written activities--the drama sequence being pantomime, guessing games,  charades, and small group improvisations. The third section, on writing out language, has as its main objective to have the child become involved in telling a story and provides suggestions for engaging the child in this activity. The fourth section, on writing down language, offers suggestions to encourage the child to write down, record, or transcribe some type of ongoing event that might involve the perception of some external or internal situation.

On this count, too many smalltime local papers are good only for \"negative teaching\" of socially accepted language. The influence of any newspaper on the language depends upon how much of it is read by how many subscribers. The paper's linguistic effect depends on what has to be studied intensively in order to be realized: its \"stylistics\" range from punctuation use through syntax, choice of words, spelling, and the resulting from all these and from its semantics. Punctuation rules are granted by those \"new grammarians\" who insist on the vocal-descriptive determination of usage, since it reflects the stress, juncture, even pitch  of speech. Newspapers may very well be useful as elementary readers, in that they discuss the world which surrounds the student in the vocabulary that he is encountering. However, it is necessary to understand the aims of newspapers as well as their preparation before using them as teaching tools. (LL)",

The internalization of these myths has been found to have far-reaching implications for intellectual achievement and individual functioning in a democracy. Numerous studies have indicated that these sexual myths are destructive to females' self-image. Eleanor Maccoby, in her study on \"Sex Differences in Intellectual Functioning,\" found that there is a tendency for the more passive-dependent children to perform poorly on a variety of intellectual tasks and for independent children to excel. The study further suggests that for girls and women the evidence consistently points to masculinity as a correlate of intellectuality. Several studies of children's books reveal that girls are characterized as dependent upon  others; they consistently take an inactive role. The role of women in literature is only one aspect of sexism in our society. However, aware parents and educators can demand that publishers provide more than token elimination of sexism in children's books. (LL)",

He had no temptations to fight against--no appetites, no passions, no taste for elegant trifles.... He never had a vice in his life.&quot; (2) modern scholars approach Thoreau as a Transcendentalist, and although Thoreau was profoundly influenced by the philosophy, to think of him in only those terms is to conceive of him as one who abjured the physical world and dwelt in the world of ideas. (3) Thoreau was undoubtedly  influenced by some of the Puritan ideas. (4) Thoreau lived in the heart of the Victorian age, and we are prone to see him as a Victorian. However, Thoreau, unlike Emerson, was sensuous, as evidenced by virtually all of his writings. He is constantly making use of all of the senses, not only in descriptive passages but also in his most theoretical passages. Since our age is more sensually oriented, Thoreau's writings are more appealing than Emerson's philosophical abstractions. (LL)",

Three kinds of accuracy and the conditions under which they occured were looked at. Each experiment was designed to require students to engage successively in two or three journalistic tasks (e.g., writing a news story, judging news values, and planning illustrations). The three different kinds of accuracy measured were: a &quot;source oriented concept,&quot; in which an outside observer judges the accuracy of a message extracted from a receiver; an &quot;observer's concept of message accuracy,&quot; in which an outside source evaluates content accuracy of a message; and an &quot;observer's concept of 'meaning' accuracy,&quot; in which understanding is evaluated separately from message content.

Both classes with disadvantaged and classes with non-disadvantaged students at these three grade levels were included in the project. Conclusions were that teachers who had some training with the materials tended to be more comfortable and imaginative in their teaching; an examination of student work-texts showed that the content could be understood by most classes; the materials were difficult to comprehend for students with severe language  problems; and the most frequent comments by participating teachers were that their students were more aware of structure in composing sentences and were more willing to experiment with new patterns at the end of the project. An examination of writing samples of the students further indicated growth at all three levels with the most dramatic growth occurring at grade four. It was recommended that a longitudinal study be undertaken to determine if the improvement of the students was directly a result of the &quot;sector analysis&quot; materials. (RB)",

It can be administered by a parent or parent surrogate in the home or in a home setting, or by a specially trained language counselor. The LARC program as it now exists has been piloted for a one-year period in an inner city housing project of a medium-sized eastern city. CUE proposes to generate and test in a field setting all materials of instruction in both the home curriculum and the  training course used in the program, along with various measures of language acquisition skills that can be achieved by children at different stages of development. Results achieved so far indicate that the LARC program is valuable as a solution to pressing educational problems now being addressed by schools and communities. (Author/RB)",

For this reason a basic composition course was designed with an emphasis on vocations and was intended to teach writing and to bring literature to bear on the issue of vocational choice. Two works of literature were chosen with this in mind--Shakespeare's &quot;Henry IV, Part I&quot; and Kurt Vonnegut's early novel &quot;Player Piano.&quot; Writing assignments and discussions relating to the problems of work were based on these two books and provided the common core of the course. The professional help of the placement office and counseling service was solicited, and a number  of the staff of the placement office spoke to the students about the services of that office. The counseling center tested nearly all of the students for vocational preference and followed the tests with vocational counseling. (LL)",

The five studies involve nine experiments dealing with one or another of the aspects of this problem. Two questions guided these studies from the outset: (1) What is the order of acquisition of category labels? and (2) How does the meaning of these labels change as the child grows older? Two different definitions of conceptual complexity were considered to see whether either is predictive of the order of acquisition of category labels in development. In a number of studies it was found that neither of these definitions of conceptual complexity is a good predictor of  the order of acquisition of category labels. A good predictor was given by various frequency of occurrence measures in general and in particular frequency of occurrence of the words in child speech, according to Rinsland (1945). The vocabulary of young children is consistent with the way in which mothers name objects for them. (Author/LL)",

A child named Augusta was studied intensively from her eighteenth month through her thirty-first month, and her spontaneous utterances were analyzed for syntax, sentence-type, and propositional construct-type. Findings were that the child initially used specific words and/or constructions in specific positions to express particular &quot;meanings&quot;; each of these form-meaning  composites initially had one or two functions but later generalized to a number of different functions; and each propositional construct-type had different syntactic realizations. The conclusion was reached that the development of predicational structures can be more precisely described by the analysis used here than by syntactic analysis alone. (Author/RB)",

While recognizing the need for specifying an underlying set of caselike relations, it is proposed that this need can best be met by hypothesizing base structure entities called role indicators. According to this theory, the input for linguistic encoding is identified at the perceptual level. The structured entity can be referred to as an event, which is primarily composed of a process or attribute and one or more things in perceived relations to one another. Events are encoded at the basal linguistic level as structured entities which may be referred to as  constructs. The output at the overt level, after appropriate syntactic and phonological elements are added, is the structured entity called the sentence. The underlying structure is viewed as being divided into three components: basal, operative, and expressive. This form of grammar can provide insights into criteria for language differences and deficiencies and can suggest that child language may have less syntactic complexity than researchers have attributed to it.

Subjects included a total of 676 nine-year-old children of heterogeneous socioeconomic status, intelligence, and achievement levels. Verbal fluency was defined as being a measure of associative verbal encoding (a/v/e), wherein children give single word associations to a stimulus word. Two hypotheses were examined: (1) a/v/e would improve with training, and (2) associated with a/v/e would be concomitant improvement in reading achievement. Training in a/v/e involved encouraging subjects to give as many responses as possible to the stimulus words. Two training periods were held daily and conducted by the regular classroom teacher. Only two verbal stimulus words were presented  at any one time. In the control classes an equivalent time block was devoted to general language arts instruction. Subjects were unaware that an experiment was in progress. Results showed the experimental group improved in a/v/e, vocabulary, comprehension, and total reading performance. It was also determined that a/v/e could be reliably quantified and measured. (HOD)",

        "description":"Oral interpretation utilizes the self-referencing qualities of language and literature which involves the interpreter as both actor and reader. By &quot;self-referencing&quot; is meant the capacity language has to express not only literal meaning but also, at the same time, the process of realization and of attitudinizing toward this meaning. Self-reference enable language to express more than one meaning and even contradictory meanings using the same word symbols. Literature, self-referentially, draws life from the dual tension between being ourselves and becoming someone else. The interpreter may use language self-referentially by altering denotative meaning by tonal connotation. He uses literature self-referentially through his unique self's identifying with the persona he portrays  dramatically. The oral interpretation performance also provides a third self-reference, existence in an art experience and as a part of the audience at the same time. Two implications which may be drawn from this concept of self-reference for interpretation performance are (1) that the actor/reader dichotomy is dependent on the unique self-reference of the interpreter and (2) that the added dimension of empathy (intellectual detachment) is made possible by self-reference.

Four experimental groups, each with about 22 students, were selected from sophomore American literature classes at Upper Arlington High School in Columbus, Ohio. The subjects viewed either a conventional production or a multi-media production of \"The Member of the Wedding.\" The multi-media production utilized slides meant to be interpretations of one of the character's thoughts. After the subjects saw the performance, they were tested to determine their understanding of the character. A set of bi-polar adjectival scales was designed to measure semantic agreement specifically for this  production. The statistical data seemed to indicate that both conventional Readers Theatre and multi-media Readers Theatre were equally effective in communicating literature to an audience. (WR)",

Two hypotheses were developed: (1) free schools maintain a definite normative and value system that influences group process among small groups of its members; and (2) the influence of the immediate free school environment on group behavior should result in member deviation from conventional sex role interaction styles. The researcher observed and participated in a free school located on farm land which housed 11 of the 21 children attending the school. Four types of groups were identified: commuter, resident, resident/commuter, and teacher. Results indicated that the behavior of the  first three groups was not influenced by the norms and values of the school; that sex role interaction styles and behavioral preferences of commuters remained unchanged; and that teachers' commitment to counter-culture resulted in interaction styles that deviated from those associated with traditional sex roles. This indicated that patterns of interaction associated with conventional sex roles could be modified if individuals were psychological members of a subculture committed to male/female liberation.

Further, debate judges tend not to use the time allowed them to question some of the debaters' points or critique the debates. Improvements in debate programs could include the assignment of topics on several subjects for a debate year, the adoption of special wordings of topics for special tournaments,  changes in the time format for debating, and some changes in the fee structures of tournaments to eliminate the awarding of excessive numbers of trophies.

The public speaking course was designed so that subjects presented speeches to classes with which they were unfamiliar. On days when students were not scheduled to speak, they remained in their regular class to serve as an audience. Each speaker received a written critique and grade from all the student audience members as well as from a visiting instructor. A five point rating scale was used by all raters to  record the judgments of the speeches. Some of the results indicated that student audiences pay more attention to general effect and adaptation than do instructors in assigning grades.

Other ideas show signs of having been influenced by Buckminster Fuller and Walter Ong in the area of the extension of human sensory systems through the use of machines and electronic media. Most especially, however, McLuhan's postulations are rooted in other social scientists such as Cooley, Mead, and Simmel. Along with McLuhan, these scholars have regarded communication as the integral aspect in man's adaptation to social change. This theoretical communicational base, along with his  variations and refinements of earlier work, are what make McLuhan's work so important to those who seek to understand social, symbol-making man.

Subjects fill in the blanks with what they feel are the words the author used, and their responses are compared with those agreed upon by a standard criterion. In one experiment the subjects were Filipinos with both low-level and high-level education and both low and high degrees of familiarity with the subject of the message. The content variables were difficulty level and idiosyncrasy level. Results indicated that the  level of education accounted for more variance in comprehension than did the idiosyncrasy level.

Further, the interviewer seeks information from the interviewee, who functions as an information source in order to accomplish a specific, preselected, limited end. The structure of an interview is dyadic and &quot;information seeking&quot; and is composed of dialogue and action modes. Also, in an interview, feedback occurs in real time and is essential for use by the interviewer in controlling the interview. (A brief definition of the following types of interviews is included: journalistic, research, examination, interrogation, counseling, information giving,  appraisal, psychoanalytic, persuasion, Socratic dialogue, advocacy, action/results, selection, recruitment, screening, placement, and termination.)

Unfortunately, such policies or procedures often do not exist or are unwritten and therefore open to question. This study investigated school board policies and/or administrative procedures for dealing with field trips in a random sample of smaller school districts of the United States. The superintendent of the school system in these districts was contacted, using a questionnaire designed to elicit responses dealing with board policies relating to field trips. The study found that (1) 79 percent of the school districts surveyed had policies dealing  with field trips, two fifths of which were written; (2) over 90 percent of the respondents indicated that their policy permitted the use of field trips; and (3) the building principal was most often designated as being the person responsible for determining the acceptability of field trip sites.

Senate Bill 501 affords school systems the capability to be accredited as a total district on the basis of a five year cycle of program development and evaluation. The attendant planning and managerial procedures in combination provide an accountability model for local school districts. It is at once both freeing in that it allows school districts the flexibility to develop programs and allocate resources in light of locally determined goals, and responsible in that it requires program and fiscal accounting in terms of progress toward those goals. These  characteristics ensure, in fact enhance, local control of education. (Author/WM)",

The result is that every student in the State has access to an educational program of equal quality (in terms of per pupil expenditure), and the program available to him is not a function of the wealth of the school district in which he resides.

This includes teachers, administrators, and pupil services personnel such as counselors and librarians. The following elements should be included in any such policy: active community involvement in at least the development of staff evaluation policy; involvement of the certificated staff in the development of the policy; active participation of the staff member being evaluated in his evaluation; and a clear delineation of who is to evaluate whom, how, when, and to what end. This paper suggests a staff evaluation policy development procedure and  describes current Kansas procedures as reflected in a 1971 Kansas Association of School Administrators survey.

The accountability factor suggests that current and future educational planning could perhaps differ from past planning. These differences could possibly manifest themselves in a wider inclusion of lay persons and groups in the development, implementation, and evaluation of educational plans and programs; more attention to planning in light of specified anticipated outputs or goals; plans for specified time periods grounded in a more comprehensive information base; and a professional assumption of responsibility for the effectiveness of such plans and programs. The objectives of this handbook are to promote comprehensive planning in local school districts, point out  the benefits of planning, orient the reader to the planning process, and describe specific procedures that might be used in the various phases of the planning process.

An adequate consideration of requisite variety includes a delineation of the information field appropriate for the decisionmaking system. An interaction of the information domain with each state of development, state-set, and whole would enhance decidability. The evaluation of an educational system qua organization requires the delineation, procurement, and provision of information for the reduction of uncertainty in decisionmaking. The theoretical basis for the evaluation model derives from a self-organizing meta-structure of ontogenetic pragmatics. The self-organizing meta-structure includes a supra-ordinate stabilization of syntax and semantics. Two subordinate  stabilizations of completability-consistency and controllability-observability are embedded in the self-organizing stabilization. The ontogenetic pragmatics include a stabilization of syntal elements and synergistic relationships in the pragmatic functions of the organization. The pragmatic functions may include policymaking, needs assessment, planning, program development, program implementation, program evaluation, management information system resource management, and environmental relations. The purpose of the evaluation is to facilitate the improvement of general systems decisions in educational development. (Author)",

A planning overview explains what comprehensive planning consists of, the sequence of steps in the process, a generic planning model, and why a comprehensive planning process should be instituted in a school district. The overview is followed by a rationale for doing a needs assessment, the steps to begin, and the results that can be anticipated on completion of, a needs assessment. To aid in the selection of a model, the criteria used to  choose the models for this handbook are presented, as well as a summary of each model and a matrix of model characteristics. A final section focuses on who is involved, what activities take place, and what happens after the needs assessment is completed in each model. Appendixes contain a list of definitions from each model, a list of questions to help districts evaluate a needs assessment, and one general and four selected short bibliographies. (Author/WM)",

The paper is designed to answer many questions currently arising not only from within the ranks of school district officials, but also from parents of children attending or planning to attend nonpublic schools. The first section of the bulletin identifies and describes the responsibility of parents and of those public school officials where the parents reside in complying with the provisions of the compulsory school laws of Michigan. The bulletin then  identifies and describes briefly the privileges of individuals and groups to establish and operate nonpublic schools for children between the ages of 6 and 16 years.

The development of a definition of \"management rights\" agreeable to school administrators is not possible without (1) a clear understanding of the fundamental nature of the public school system; (2) an advocate's posture in presenting the case for public school \"management rights\"; and (3) a sophisticated plan for convincing the State legislature, the courts, the arbitrators, and sometimes even school boards of the inherent soundness of the position on \"management rights.\" This paper discusses each of the above elements, looks at political and organizational factors affecting the formulation of \"management rights,\" and discusses two court cases  dealing with court interpretation of State statutes. Specifically, the courts in these cases are ruling on which items are negotiable and which items are \"items of inherent managerial policy\" and therefore not subject to collective bargaining.

Part two presents the framework for the research. Because of the preliminary nature of this study, its scope is limited to one site (Albuquerque, New Mexico) and to the secondary level of education.

Findings based on survey and field methods are related to parental socialization, mechanisms for participation, participatory roles, the impact of decentralization, and educational alternatives. Results suggest that administrative failure to ensure representative participation fosters school-community conflict, reinforces existing intergroup hostility, and isolates the school system from community factions.

Each district is involved in developing its administrator renewal program by focusing on school improvement through improved leadership behavior of school administrators. The essential questions discussed here are those concerning a definition of individualized continuing education, the basic ingredients of such a school district program, processes to be utilized by a school district in organizing and sustaining such a program, and the  means by which an individual school administrator might organize his self renewal program. The guidebook is for superintendents, principals, key teachers, professors, coordinators, area superintendents, assistant principals, assistant superintendents, and others interested in self and school improvement processes. It is also designed for school administrators responsible for developing inservice education programs for school district leadership personnel.

Square and rectangular containers, in nine modular sizes, are the basic building blocks of the subsystem. These can be arranged and attached in limitless configurations, and with the addition of subsystem accessories such as shelves, doors,  and dividers, can adapt to specific functions demanded in schools. Because of this modularity, containers are moulded of rigid self-skinning polyurethane foam, as are library card catalogue drawers and container doors.

        "description":"In 1972, the author was asked to join a small team of experts to help implement one of the activities underway in the Programme on Educational Building (PEB). The activity was entitled, &quot;Industrialised Building Methods for Educational Purposes,&quot; and its major objective was to identify for policymakers the considerations involved in using to the best advantage industrialized building methods for the construction of schools. In the course of the activity, the team, which consisted of an architect, an engineer, an economist, and the author, visited a number of countries looking at many different types of school building systems. The visits and discussions of school building problems with educationists, architects, and others of many nationalities prompted the author to write down  his own personal reflections on three related issues which appear to preoccupy a great many of those charged with the responsibility of school building provision: industrialized building systems, educational objectives, and the problem of change. In the first part of this paper, the author analyzes these three general concepts in terms of their application to the practical problems in the educational design of schools and explores their relationship to each other, inquiring in particular whether they can be reconciled. Ultimately, the author attempts to define more precisely the problems inherent in an acceptance of these concepts. The second part contains, in a separate paper, the outline on the objectives, content, and method of the activity referred to, which is used by the author as  the starting point for his argument.

The role model utilized was a modification of several interventionist/change models from the literature on change. Inasmuch as a change agent's role is to facilitate organizational change through assistance with problemsolving, decisionmaking, and decision implementation, the Field Consultant performed a linkage role between research and development and product users, providing training and technical assistance in product implementation and diffusion. The training of the Field Consultant was designed to develop competencies in establishing and maintaining working relationships with clients, training teachers and  administrators, effectively diagnosing and prescribing for difficulties of implementation, and studying change related phenomena. The impact of the consultant role was measured by feedback from clients and by studies conducted on problems related to impelementation of innovations. A short list of references is included.

In the first paper, Miriam Clasby draws attention to the intended and latent consequences of a period of heavy \"Federal initiative\" in education. Among the latent consequences of this initiative is the emergence of strong, well staffed interstate organizations and national lay associations with local school district constituencies that could organize opinion and support policies in ways that would permit direct and effective Congressional lobbying. In the second paper, Dr. Maureen Webster draws attention  to the growth of legislation mandating Statewide assessment of schools and school systems. She gives reason to argue plausibly that such legislation may, in fact, unnecessarily shape the goals of schooling itself and determine the shape that the policy-planning process will have to take. In the third paper, Naomi White sets down one approach to the problem of determining the minimal skills to which the system of schooling should attend. In her discussion, Mrs. White raises the issue of the influence of accountability in defining the goals of education, as opposed to simply evaluating success or failure in attaining those goals.

Yet, the people who make up schools -- professionals, parents, service personnel, and students -- often form into ineffective and poorly coordinated groups, much in the way that employees in the bureaucracies of industry and government become separated from one another. Rarely do the people in schools make a deliberate effort to examine their communication patterns or their organizational procedures. Organizational development (OD) offers a conceptualization and strategy for examining these activities. It enables the school to monitor and respond to the changing environment; and to find, maintain, and use the resources and ideas needed to respond. Through OD, a school can improve  its self-renewing capabilities in improved communication and problemsolving processes, decisionmaking and meeting procedures, and the potential for collaboration. The school becomes self-renewing by experiencing learning-by-doing in the task group, skill training, new procedures, survey feedback, and group and intergroup exercises. In addition to describing organizational development, the publication outlines a sample organization development training sequence; and it lists individuals, programs, and references dealing with organization development in schools.

The bibliography emphasizes, but is not limited to, contributions by anthropologists. A thoughtful perusal of this bibliography and a study of some of the resources identified here may do much to dispel the fieldwork \"mystique.\" However, the process of transforming field notes and journals (the preferred anthropological terms) or data (the customary term among sociologists and educators) into a completed monograph remains elusive, at least to the extent that those who have completed successful field studies have been able to produce (or reveal) guidelines to assist others.

Rather than viewing the role of organizational specialist as still another expectation, the authors see it as a natural fit between the preventive approach to mental health and a system orientation to human behavior. They contend that counselors should modify their targets to improvements in organizational and interpersonal processes and should act more as consultants either as a group process expert within a single building, or as a member of a districtwide cadre of organization development consultants.

The Indirect Cost Workshop was established to develop communication concerning the problems between the United States Office of Education (USOE), SEAs, and several SEAs that have USOE-approved plans for indirect costs. The information gained through the workshop was to assist the SEAs in completing preparations for their Indirect Cost System before the deadline of June 30, 1973. The document begins by reproducing Federal Circular No. A-87 which sets forth principles for determining the allowable costs of programs administered by State and local governments under grants from and contracts with  the Federal Government. The Michigan Indirect Cost Plan and the forms used in that plan are considered next. The document concludes by examining the federal view of program Indirect Costs and by considering Indirect Cost problems as viewed by centralized State administrative services and the local education agency.

Based on a particular view of human beings, communication, and the process of inquiry, DAP involves the members of a group in generating and using three kinds of information: designative (D) about the \"what is\" state of some one or some thing; appraisive (A) about \"what is preferred\"; and prescriptive (P) that suggests what to do when discrepancies can be identified between \"what is\" and \"what is preferred\". As group members generate and use these three kinds of information, they move systematically through three different phases of the problemsolving process. They begin by identifying  their individual and common problems clearly and specifically. They then develop plans or prescriptions for dealing with the most critical of these common problems; and they complete the cycle of problemsolving by implementing their plans, monitoring effects, and evaluating their success as joint problemsolving systems. The major interest of DAP is in finding ways to eliminate or reduce unnecessary and pointless conflict, misunderstanding, and frustration. (Author)",

The procedure was designed to involve community members and the school staff in the appraisal of funding opportunities, the development of topics and objectives, the establishment of timetable and work deadlines, and checkpoints in the approval process. School needs were ranked, and the four process components were identified to be: the subject, the writer, the elements of the proposal, and the strategies for execution. Planning sessions were designed to focus on strategies for pooling effort, securing teacher and parent input, and gaining proposal support. Work meetings were structured to collect data,  determine objectives, and evaluate the developing proposal. The process was successful in developing a proposal approved by the Board of Education as representative of its interest in educational improvements and appropriate for forwarding to the Office of the Superintendent of Job Instruction. The author evaluates the procedure as effective on the basis of approval of the proposal, involvement of parents and staff, response to identified school needs, and academic growth consistent with the effort expended. The author also recommends two followup strategies to be used in the event proposals are not funded. (Page 19 of Appendix &quot;B&quot; may reproduce poorly.) (Author)",

The staff included paraprofessionals and teachers of reading, mathematics, social studies, language arts, and science. Negative factors at the start of the project included tendencies of the teachers to use the lecture approach, neglect of audiovisual and library resources, pervasive job dissatisfaction, and inadequate supervision. Planning workshops with the entire staff, and to which parents were invited, resulted in a program that used trainer consultants, intervisitations, and peer evaluation of classroom  demonstrations along with increased utilization of school-community resources. The outcome of the program was increased participatory learning among teachers, more effective use of materials and resources, more effective provisions for dealing with diverse learning styles, and better use of preparation periods. The author concludes that the impact of the project was evident throughout the entire school program and that the program warrants implementation in other schools. (Author)",

Teachers can reconsider their attitudes and approaches to teaching, obtain a better knowledge of community resources, be reminded of the need to relate subject matter to the real world, and guide learning activities rather than be the  center of the learning situation. Beneficial byproducts of a program outside the school could also be the improvement of the school's image with the community and the opportunity for teachers, parents, and community members to relate to and see each other in a different light.

Each system has achieved implementation in varying degrees and by contrasting methodologies. The objectives of this paper are to (1) examine the theoretical framework, the social contexts, the staffing constraints, the inservicing, the implementation phases, and the feedback mechanisms of these two programs; (2) analyze these components as to their similarity and dissimilarity, noting particularly their degree of functionality; and (3) synthesize generalizations potentially applicable to the implementation of any competency-based instructional system.

Three considerations became criteria in classifying existing competency statements to fit project requirements: (1) the degree to which a given functional area of responsibility was reflected in the content of a particular statement, (2) the major administrative operation indicated by the statement, and (3) the degree to which the statement met performance specifications. Statements were rewritten according to a system flowchart in order to arrive at a standardized form. The resulting model and classification system is a three  dimensional grid: seven functional areas of responsibility were established as one dimension; the form of existing competency statements yielded six administrative operations as a second grid component; and the third dimension is the conceptualization of the principal's performance of various competencies or competency &quot;clusters&quot; in relationship to groups of persons most logically affected by performance.

The language arts component is said to be a multisensory structured linguistic language program which integrates reading,  writing, speaking and listening. Motor perception training is seen to help children achieve spatial, temporal, and body awareness; dynamic balance; and muscular strength for effective body control and increased self confidence. Noted is curriculum modification in all subject areas so that classroom teachers learn to develop alternative strategies appropriate to the child's learning style. Cited is daily process evaluation achieved by using hierarchy of skill charts in both the language and motor components. Project success is said to provide for parent and teacher interaction in bi-monthly workshops, and for participation of professionals, lay citizens, and parents in a community council. Source and price of curriculum guides for the three components are included. (MC)",

Noted is the study's investigation into seven areas of concern: a review of theories on criminality and MR, the legal status of the MR offender, incidence and characteristics of the MR in adult and juvenile correctional institutions, the delinquent in a state residential facility for the MR, juvenile court handling of the MR offender at the community level, and a national survey of the diagnosis and treatment of MR offenders in correctional  institutions. Identified are assumptions of the study such as the lack of a causal relationship between MR and commission of criminal acts. Discussed are 31 recommendations in the areas of education and training, research and development, administrative and procedural changes, and cooperative agreements. An example of a recommendation is amendment of the Texas criminal code to allow all incompetent defendants to be eligible for release from confinement whenever they do not require confinement for protection of themselves or others.

The review indicates that prior to the 19th century there was little effort to discriminate between the MR individual and the criminal offender, that early studies suggesting that MR predisposes a person to criminal acts have been replaced by evidence that the high percentage of MR individuals in the criminal justice system is due to administrative and legal factors, that advances in testing techniques and  causal theories have led to correctional programs concerned with multivariate causes, that current correctional treatment sees the offender as a unique individual, that prejudicial attitudes toward the MR still exist within the criminal justice system, but that a growing philosophy concerning the right to treatment should facilitate the handling of the MR offender. The discussion examines MR from ancient times to the present and then reviews the relationship between MR and crime in terms of legalities, theories of MR and crime (such as religious, genetic, or environmental), and treatment of the defective offender.

It is concluded that the proper handling of the MR offender requires the amendment or elimination of laws dealing with the defendant's competency to stand trial and the use of insanity as a defense in a criminal prosecution. Noted is effective commitment without right to bail during the mental examination period, the indeterminate or lifetime commitment without a finding  of guilt for MR offenders, and a disparity between commitment and release procedures which serves no legal or therapeutic purposes. Issues are discussed in terms of incompetency laws, treatment of MR persons found incompetent, procedural problems such as the psychiatric examination and the incompetency hearing, and MR and criminal responsibility.

The study was part of Project CAMIO (Correctional Administration and the Mentally Incompetent Offender), a Texas study to determine the incidence of criminal incarceration of the mentally retarded (MR) and to identify laws, procedures, and practices which affect the prosecution and incarceration of the MR offender. Evaluation of the inmates was undertaken to determine the incidence of MR individuals committed to the Department of Corrections and to determine the relationship between intelligence and aspects of the social and criminal histories of MR offenders. Administered were five intelligence tests and two tests of educational achievement. The MR incidence among Ss was found  to be approximately 10% (more than three times the rate within the general population). Evaluation of background characteristics indicated that MR inmates tended to be older, to have no military service, and to be members of minority groups. The non-retarded inmate was more likely to have been granted probation as a juvenile offender or as a previous adult offender, MR and non-MR offenders tended to have similar criminal records, though MR offenders were more likely to have been convicted of crimes of rape and burglary. Findings indicated the most significant difference between MR and non-MR inmates to be in the more frequent granting of probation to the non-MR. (DB)",

Intelligence tests administered to all (48) juveniles adjudicated during a 4-month period revealed that the incidence of MR was about five times higher than in the general population. The MR juveniles tended to come from poorer homes, to have been first arrested at an earlier age, but arrested fewer times than the non-MR juveniles. After one year on probation 2/3 of the MR juveniles compared to 1/2  of the non-MR juveniles, were committed to state training schools. Juvenile probation officers queried appeared to view the prognosis for the MR delinquent as poor, to be unfamiliar with mental retardation, and to view state residential facilities for the retarded as of little assistance to the court. The officers indicated the most significant problems were the lack of community resources and the uncooperative attitudes of parents. Interviews with directors of community based programs showed that directors of agencies for the MR were reluctant to extend services to the delinquent and that directors of agencies dealing with delinquents were reluctant to extend services to the retarded.

        "description":"The prevalence of color vision deficiencies among youths 12 to 17 years of age in the United States was evaluated during a 1966-1970 survey of 6,768 youths selected as representative of noninstitutionalized adolescents with respect to age, sex, race, geographic region, income, population size of place of residence, and rate of population change in the place of residence from 1950 to 1960. Findings indicated that approximately 4% of adolescents have color vision deficiencies with boys about 12 times more likely to have this defect than girls. No significant differences were found in the prevalence rates for white and Negro boys except in the South. Red-green color vision deficiencies were substantially more prevalent than blue-yellow defects, which were found only in conjunction  with the red-green defect. Age was not related to the prevalence of color vision deficiencies. No statistically significant regional differences in the prevalence of red-green deficiencies were found, although a significant racial difference was observed in the South (three times as many white as Negro boys had red-green deficiencies). Differences in the prevalence rates across income levels were negligible. (Approximately half the document consists of detailed tables of the survey's findings.) (Author/DB)",

Noted is program initiation after parents and teachers became upset over poor academic progress and behaviors of an increasing number of children. Development of such a program is said to involve analysis, staff dedication, high cost, a low student-staff ratio, lengthy inservice teacher training, and parental cooperation. The curriculum is discussed in relation to individualization in reading (using aids such as programed reading, phonics, and games) and mathematics (using aids such as Continental Press materials and drills). Behavioral modification is seen  to comprise observation, selection of trategies, use of positive and negative reinforcement, and intervention procedures ranging from a shortened assignment through change of media (such as writing with a crayon), to removal of the child from school. Focused on is the summer program designed to maintain the structured environment and provide activities such as math games, reading games and field trips without academic pressure. Given as an example of approaches used to interest summer students is an animal unit which included activities in the following areas: poetry, music, books, art, math, reading, and science. Noted is a science activity which requires a student to observe worms and act like a worm. Among approaches to parent education cited are a weekly phone conference, group parent  sessions, and five parent teacher conferences per year.

The program is said to have been designed to meet the following goals: to create behavioral objectives for the EMR curriculum, to train teachers of EMR students to write and field test the behavioral objectives, and to develop a system to evaluate the effect of various program models on the behavior of EMR students. It is reported that behavioral objectives have been developed in 14 curriculum areas such as learning to earn a living and learning to manage money, that eight models (self contained, modified self contained, selected academic, selected educational, half time placement, learning center,  and mainstream) have been field tested, and that a test with items representing all curriculum areas has been given to students in the model classrooms. Evaluation is said to indicate a need to continue to refine the objectives into a major curriculum for EMR students, to develop the teacher training component utilizing regional and university staffs, and to continue to initiate more model classes and evaluate student progress.

The project's major goal is explained to be the development of a performance-based training model which will be generalizable to other educational institutions. A review of the related literature deals with rationale, the consultant's role as a leader and change agent, relevant training models, and administrative perspectives. Competencies are said to have been generated through educator interviews and a search of the literature, and to have been organized into a model with the following three dimensions: situations, processes, and areas of responsibility. Reported is  distribution of the questionnaire to the following professionals: superintendents, psychologists, principals, curriculums consultants, speech and/or hearing clinicians, special education consultants, directors of special education, special education teachers, and regular elementary teachers. A major portion of the document provides evaluative data on each competency item. Results given suggest that competencies rated as appropriate for on-campus study were primarily in the lower importance group, competencies rated as predominantly in the job training category were primarily in the higher importance group, and that all competencies in the self-growth category were in the higher importance group.

Piaget scored higher than other Ss on a test of Cognitive Development Measures; in child to child communication the most common made was sign language; in child to teacher communication the most common mode was oral-aural followed by sign; and parents of children in oral-only programs now have neutral rather than  negative attitudes toward manual communication.

Program goals are given to be achieved by students in reading ability, number facility, language development and use of abstract and academic symbols. Results given for first year evaluation (1970-1971) include a mean gain of 16,06 IQ points on the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Test (SBIT), and an average rate of accomplishment on an individualized basis of 177 of 269 objectives in nine categories of concept formation. Discussed for the second program year (1971-1972) are emphasis on cognitive  objectives, individual instruction, and independently developed curriculum use of professional and nonprofessional staff (parents) and inclusion of 5-year-old children. Given for year 2 are results such as a mean gain of 8.36 IQ points (on the SBIT). The following are discussed among program aspects: speech therapy, parental participation such as substituting for teachers, (only 2 parents did not participate), medical examinations that identified 118 defects, training of parents who planned and operated a summer program in 1972, cooperation of 25 agencies, and training of teachers for additional preschool classes in Baltimore. Stated among projected needs are continuation of present program components, inclusion of more children and more staff such as a music teacher, and renovation of  school facilities. Included are a statistical report, tables showing test results, and letters. (MC)",

Papers presented at the forum fall under the categories of costs and the financial crisis; curriculum and program evaluation; models, modeling and systems; reaching consensus and establishing priorities; and faculty workload and manpower studies. Invited papers at the conference concerned institutional research as a vital force in higher education, centralization of power in higher education, and open access to higher education as a clue to reformation and reallocation.

The contributors on topics dealing with management, data systems, resources, faculty and students, say there is at least the need for improvement if not reform. They have analyzed the problem from their perspectives and suggest the direction change must take.

This speech suggests areas of foreseeable change in higher education in the future. First, it appears that the rate of enrollment growth in the 1970s will be much less than before. While enrollment growth has slowed, the expenditures of higher education continue to rise. The basic problem today is that income growth is slowing, and unless colleges and universities reduce expenditures growth to correspond with income growth, they will incur deficits. Colleges and universities need management assistance. The 3 major areas of management concern for the 1970s are: statewide planning, the process of governance and management, and production technology. These are not the only issues  confronting higher education; issues involving manpower planning, educational access, and student aid are going to be critical in the next few years. The rising costs in higher education will have to be brought under some kind of effective management control including improvements in productivity. This is the real challenge of management for higher education in the future. (Author/PG)",

General education should provide opportunities for students to become familiar with the objectives, problems and methods of the social sciences as well as the natural and physical sciences and humanities. Among the more significant general education objectives in the social sciences would be the application of its knowledge and methodologies to insure a more profound insight  into the pressing issues of our time (the urban crisis, racial problems, population pressures, food supplies, and the role of women).

The purpose of this paper is to report on an experiment in which the PSI technique is employed on a microeconomics course in which a one semester introductory course was a prerequisite and was conducted in a small liberal arts college. A total of 92 students were allocated to three sections of microeconomics. Two of the sections were taught in a conventional lecture format and the final section was taught in the PSI format. All three sections met for two one and one half hour periods a week. Each student was exposed to the same body of material. The course was based on a conventional text that all sections used. The PSI section had  the text supplemented by written handouts that consisted of the kind of elaboration and clarification that would ordinarily occur in a lecture. The output of the testing was based upon two instruments, the final examination and the course evaluation. Among the conclusions is that the PSI method does provide an alternative educational option that, while not dominating the other methods, does seem to offer students a choice which they value. Used prudently the PSI method can make a valuable addition to the teaching techniques of economics. Tables related to the text are included. (Author/PG)",

They enroll over 3 million students each year, producing gross annual revenues of at least 2.5 billion dollars on which substantial corporate, property, and personal income taxes are paid. Cosmetology schools represent a third of the total number; trade and technical schools another third. Although correspondence schools represent less than a tenth of the proprietaries, they enroll two-thirds of the students and produce over half of the industry's income. Despite their unavoidable presence, proprietaries weren't discovered by educational policymakers until a few years ago. One plausible explanation is that in the early days proprietary schools were conducted as businesses, but academic  and business interests have merged in the past decade. This merging of interests may change into outright competition as all schools scramble for their share of the student market and federal dollars. This report will identify some major findings about residential proprietary students (excluding correspondence schools) against which findings from a fresh study underway at the University of California's Center for Research and Development in Higher Education have been juxtaposed.

        "description":"As the world changes, so do the helping professions in community and youth work, and so does the nature of their training. This paper is written on the assumption that the function of the helping professions is either to remedy incoherence or to help people live with it. Those who work with people are therefore remedying, or helping people live with, the lack of connections between events, ideas, and people, or the lack of experiences, connections between events, ideas, and people. It is the lack of such connections that makes people feel that life is meaningless, and that purposive action is pointless or impossible. Training for the helping professions can no longer rely simply on transmitting received knowledge. The report describes how to manage and administer community and  youth services, how to improve simple human relations, how to work with people in community and youth groups creating new connections among people, and how to introduce stimuli and new ideas into the helping professions.

        "description":"The University Opinion Poll conducted a survey of student opinion on issues related to University-sponsored day care, the role of the Minnesota Public Interest Research Group (MPIRG) and the University's policy on buying lettuce for its food services. Four hundred fifty-two respondents, 76% of a random sample of University of Minnesota students, were contacted for their opinions. Major findings were: A majority of respondents favored a University-sponsored day care service, but were unwilling to support a student fee increase to help fund it. Most respondents rated MPIRG's performance on student issues as adequate or good, but felt that MPIRG should spend more effort on student issues in the future. Responses to questions about the University's lettuce policy are not included in  this report. (Author)",

        "description":"Ninety-seven new residents entering five randomly selected residence halls at the University of Maryland, College Park, completed a questionnaire on their first impressions (2 to 4 weeks) of their dorm and changes they would like to see. Fifty-six had never lived in a residence hall before and 44% had, and 59% did not know anyone on their floor before moving in. When asked what they liked most about dorms so far, 20% said people's friendliness, 17% said the people they met and 16% said the convenient location. When asked what they least liked, 19% reported insufficient or malfunctioning physical facilities and 14% said undesirable physical aspects of their rooms. Nineteen percent gave unsolicited comments that they wish they had gotten more help from their Resident Assistant and  only 5% indicated they would seek out their Resident Assistant for help as a first step. In addition, 8% said they had negative impressions of the residence halls due to impersonal treatment before moving in. Intercorrelations among attitude items indicate that those who exhibit public conformity and private disagreement with residence hall norms tend to feel less positive and have adjusted less well to their new situation. Results were discussed in terms of the theory that satisfiers stem from variables intrinsic to dorm life (e.g., other people, hall programs) and dissatisfiers stem from extrinsic variables (e.g., physical facilities). It was suggested that a good residence hall program treats these sources independently. Overall it was recommended that greater emphasis be given to  initiating residence hall programs before students move in. (Author)",

        "description":"There is now an enormous communications belt between the academic world and government. The whole thrust of the new direction in federal funding of urban programs is to give people with bad housing and state and local governments with immoveable problems the cash they need to back up their particular priorities in the marketplace. This means experimenting with direct cash assistance as an alternative to inefficient and inequitable federal construction subsides to help those in need of safe and sanitary housing. The Urban Observatory program is administered by the National League of Cities and it represents the indispensable cornerstone in building a network of local government-university partnerships. The program operates at present in 10 cities and it has begun to build in these  cities an effective communication belt for bringing local research capabilities to search for solutions to local community problems. Clearly, then, if government is to meet the most pressing domestic needs of the 70s, there must be a flexible and responsive research partnership among all levels of government and education.
